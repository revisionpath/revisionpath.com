Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>By now, you&#8217;ve gotten acquainted with design educator and design strategist Andrew Bass Jr. In the second part of our interview, we explore Andrew&#8217;s calling as a design mentor, as well as his early advocacy work for diversity in the design industry. (If you missed the first part, <a href="/andrew-bass-jr-part-1-of-2/" data-wpel-link="internal">check it out here</a>.)</p>
<p>We start off talking about Black design leadership back in the day, and Andrew tells the story of how he learned about the Organization of Black Designers and how that led to his work leading AIGA&#8217;s first Diversity and Inclusion Task Force. From there, we discuss the current state of DEI with AIGA and the design industry, and he shares what gets him excited about design now at this stage of his career. It&#8217;s really an honor and a privilege to talk with Andrew about his longevity in design and about leaving a legacy for generations to come!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You mentioned when you were at Prats that you saw you had Black design professors and stuff like that. Once you got out there as a working designer, did you see a lot of Black folks in design leadership back then?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
No. That was the unicorn. I was in the libraries. That was one of the things all through my years as a student to my beginning years as a practicing professional, I would hit all the design annuals, books to see who&#8217;s leading in the industry to kind of know names. And I kept coming across the same thing. It was always white men. It was always white men. Eventually it started opening up a little bit where you see the spattering of white women, but it was all predominantly white men. And I barely, barely ever saw anyone Black, Latino. Occasionally there may be a spot, a spot of an Asian. And again, usually it would be a guy, but it was very much pure white and that&#8217;s all I ever saw. And I was actively searching to find, okay, there&#8217;s got to be more folks out there.</p>
<p>And then eventually I did find some folks out there, not through any of the exposure through manuals. At that time there were not a lot of big design conferences. I had not heard of AIGA at that point yet. Definitely there was no HOW. There was no HOW design. And there was Communication Arts because there was a lot of design magazines out back then. Print, design, communication, arts. What was the other one?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Step.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Step was there. Yep. Step. This is a Canadian one, Applied Arts, I think it&#8217;s called. Some other stuff. And so it was not until somewhere in around &#8217;93 in print when I saw Cheryl Miller&#8217;s article on, no, about Cheryl Miller, I should say. It wasn&#8217;t her article. Or was it her article? But it was in print about where are the Black designers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
And I read that article I don&#8217;t know how many times. Right now, these names. I&#8217;m like, who&#8217;s this person? Who&#8217;s that person? Oh wow. Because I had not seen that in any the quote general mainstream stuff. And that&#8217;s when I started learning that there were folks out there, and I started digging a little bit more into history. And that&#8217;s when I learned that there were a lot more that actually existed. And back in the day, just never given any exposure due to societal, the US view on race. So growing up I never saw any of the studios that I admired ever have any person of color in their leadership. And generally ones that I did find in leadership, they usually owned their own businesses. They had their own practices. I really am hard pressed to think of any leaders at any of these Fortune 500 companies throughout the nineties to even I&#8217;d say early 2000s. Nothing pops off in the top of my head. There&#8217;s always people doing their own thing.</p>
<p>And so a few years later, I think that was around &#8217;95, &#8217;96, that&#8217;s when I discovered HOW, HOW Magazine, which I sorely still miss today. That was a fantastic design magazine. Of all the other design magazines I had saw, they actually seemed to have tried to make an effort of showcasing designers of color and somewhat kind of touching the subject of diversity in the industry, because diversity didn&#8217;t exist back then in the nineties, that wasn&#8217;t a word. Some market chair came up with diversity. &#8220;Hey, I think this is going to be a good trend.&#8221; I was basically looking at it as like, fair is fair. It&#8217;s just not white folks out here. So I didn&#8217;t really started to see leadership until around then, around &#8217;95, &#8217;96 when I started seeing that and I started seeking them out. And then I learned Cheryl Miller was here in New York City, did actually meet her face to face. I think I did a freelance project with her.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Woo. She was tough too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I believe it. I believe it. A hundred percent. A hundred percent I believe that. Without a doubt.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
She knew her stuff and I understand why she was very sort of stern, because the industry, it was a very different mentality. She had to fend for herself and stuff and she was doing some major work. I also met Cynthia Mackenzie, I believe. She has a studio in New York too. CM something, something. Oh man, I met her and I was like, oh wow, okay. And then I started meeting some others, especially like I said, my professor Dwight Johnson, he&#8217;s the one who really started giving me some opportunities where he was connected to NBC. He got me to meet some people at NBC. No, I didn&#8217;t meet any Black people at NBC, but he started putting me onto folks that are out there. And then I started learning about Archie Boston, started learning about Tony Gable, rest in peace, started learning about Richard Baker. I started learning about, oh, oh, Eli [inaudible 00:10:29].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Maurice Woods. And that was a little later in the nineties. Oh, how could I forget about the south? It was where I&#8217;ve met her, Cynthia Worley.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, here in Atlanta.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah. And then also Turner. Turner. Illustrators where I first saw them in HOW, oh, I think the name is Turner, last name is Turner. I cannot remember their first name. They&#8217;re based in Atlanta. I think they&#8217;re still around. And I started learning about more folksm and I was like, whoa, how come they don&#8217;t get shined in these magazines? I just went into overdrive to try and find as much history as I could. That&#8217;s how I started finding it about Georg Olden. I&#8217;m still stuck on his story and the total disrespect I feel that the design industry has given him completely. And still, I wonder if I hadn&#8217;t brought up Georg Olden to Ric Gref√© back then before there was Design Journeys and all that. Because I had mentioned an idea on that, and they named the Design Journeys that they honored Georg Olden, what, two years after when I was on the task force, it just dissolved and then, oh, now you decide to award Georg Olden the Medal?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m like, you&#8230; Okay. But at least he got it. I just feel like there needed to be more of an acknowledgement to it. Honestly, I&#8217;m sorry, an apology. Because I read that he also had won an art director&#8217;s medal, art director&#8217;s club medal. But I could not find any records of that. I did not see any of that leadership until I kind of found it on my own. And I like the fact that they were leaders on their own. They didn&#8217;t wait for other people because they couldn&#8217;t get certain opportunities they made their own. John Morning, that&#8217;s the other name, John Morning. And they did it for themselves. It wasn&#8217;t until honestly 21st century, early 2000s that I started seeing Black leadership. I still say it wasn&#8217;t like top tier Black leadership, I still think some of it was just, okay, not semantics, but perceptions, start putting some folks here. So I think they&#8217;re more middle leadership, not top leadership. So even today at 2022, I mean, yeah, you have a few that truly you can say top leadership, but it&#8217;s nearly not enough. So it was very, very barren in those early years that you had to find it and dig to see it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember, and I want to talk about AIGA because that&#8217;s an important part of your story, but I remember when I first started doing Revision Path, I did a lot of research leading up to wanting to start this. And I came across those older magazines you mentioned like Step and Communication Arts is still around, but HOW, and I wonder actually for HOW, because HOW was based out of Cleveland I believe, or somewhere in Ohio, the Midwest.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Somewhere over there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I wonder if that informed the perspective they had because so many of these other design publications were out of New York. And so maybe for them it was through a more New York lens. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the case, but I remember doing a lot of that research and I would see where people would write a letter to an editor at Step or something and be like, &#8220;Well where are more Black designers?&#8221; And the magazine would be like, &#8220;Oh well we don&#8217;t know where they are and we can&#8217;t find them,&#8221; and all this sort of stuff. And I&#8217;m like-</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I was one of those that wrote a letter.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was like, they&#8217;re out there. But then granted, this is also a time before the&#8230; Well, I don&#8217;t want to say necessarily before the internet, but really more before the worldwide web when where people could create these destinations for people to go to. I discovered the internet, or the worldwide web I should say in high school in the mid nineties. I was in a lot of places I probably shouldn&#8217;t have been just in terms of the fact that the Web was just such a big place. So there were things like AOL Black Voices and Africana.net and NetNoir and all those places. So there were obviously places where people were trying to create these destinations for Black people. But I don&#8217;t think those social connections really became prevalent until of course the 2000s with the advent of social media and stuff.</p>
<p>So I was doing my research to try to start Revision Path and I would see that a lot of people were asking these questions, and the editorial boards would just shrug their shoulders. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where they&#8217;re at. I don&#8217;t know where they are.&#8221; And I remember through that research also discovering, or finding out, I should say, about the organization of Black designers and how they kind of started out in the Midwest. I think it was either in Chicago or somewhere in Ohio, but starting out there and then building things out. Did you know about them back then?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Oh that&#8217;s a whole nother story.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, I did. I found out about them early nineties. Actually because I found out about them and that&#8217;s how I found out about Fo Wilson and Michele Washington. Yeah, see now these names are coming back. Michele, she&#8217;s a teacher at City Tech right now. Yeah, I know about OBD and I actually went to one of their conferences. I can talk about that after AIGA because that&#8217;s a whole nother thing. So I lose track of where we going with AIGA.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, let&#8217;s talk about that. So you mentioned Ric Gref√© who was I think a longtime executive director.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, he was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
For AIGA, and you kind of worked with them back in the mid 2000s to-</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
2016, 2017. [inaudible 00:16:38]. Yeah, actually, yeah, you&#8217;re right. Earlier.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve been a lot earlier. Yeah, because Ric, I think Ric retired or left or something.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Sorry, it was 2006, 2007, 2008.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, okay. Yeah, right around that time. Because I think Ric left I want to say in 2013, 2014, something like that. But you had worked with AIGA to not only create the diversity and inclusion task force but also serve as chair. Tell me what that was like, because if diversity was not even in the conversation with regards to the design community, how much of a uphill battle was that?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Shoot, I don&#8217;t even think we even got the first step. Honestly looking back, it was all for show. It was all for show. How that all came about was Step in Design had an article based on women in design, very good article, very interesting. I was kind of starstruck that, not starstruck, I was kind of awestruck that out of all these listing of women designers, how come there weren&#8217;t any people of color in them? I think there was one, and I think it was Lucille, and I never really know how to pronounce her name, but Tenazas, Lucille Tenazas, she&#8217;s a name in the industry, [inaudible 00:18:01]. So I believe she might be either Filipino or-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
She&#8217;s Filipino. I know who you&#8217;re talking about, Lucille Tenazas or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yes, yes. And I was like, you got one person on here. There&#8217;s a whole lot of other people out here. So I wrote a letter to Step in Design at that time just saying, &#8220;Hey, great article, cool and that, but hey, you&#8217;re kind of lacking X, Y, and Z.&#8221; And I rolled off some names that I knew of, such as Cheryl Miller, Of Wilson, Michele Washington. And just questioning, if you&#8217;re going to do a compilation like that, you really need to be a more thoughtful and full approach in doing these kind of compilations. And at the time the editor in chief there, Emily Potts, actually replied back to me via my email. I was like, ooh, I didn&#8217;t know I was going to get an actual response. And she actually struck up this conversation, I should say we struck up this conversation and she had told me she was having conversations with Bill Grant at the time who was AIGA president, right? Yeah, yeah. Board of director president.</p>
<p>And that was one of his issues. He wanted to expand AIGA&#8217;s reach, and so that it becomes more inclusive to people and stuff like that. And she told me, would I be interested in talking with him and that she&#8217;ll put me together with him. And I said, &#8220;Sure, I don&#8217;t mind talking. Talking&#8217;s free, not going to hurt nobody.&#8221; So within the span of I guess a day she got me in touch with him and he called me at home, because I think it was some sort of holiday because I know I was there with the kids because they were upstairs. I had to go in the basement because they were so loud. And we were just talking and he was telling me about his idea that he wanted to start up this task force about diversity for AIGA and would I be interested in helping out with it if I had any thoughts on it. And so I kind of told them some of my thoughts and what it is and stuff like that. That&#8217;s when the conversation started shifting to hard left that I did not anticipate, was that, &#8220;How about you serve as chair?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wait, this ain&#8217;t even a real task force yet. You want me to be chair?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, because you have your ideas and what you&#8217;re thinking with something like that. How about you lead the task force?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; Because I was kind of hesitant because I was not an official member of AIGA at this point. I&#8217;d always worked with AIGA, like some sort of ghost warrior on the end on the outside. But I never actually paid for a membership. But somehow I kept finding myself at AIGA events. And so I was like, all right, let&#8217;s talk. And he said there was a few people who are of like minds with this. And so we met, we talked, and I sincerely felt he actually wanted to do this. That he had a desire to see this happen and that to affect some sort of philosophical change within AIGA in the industry. And I was like, okay, that&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s when I first met Ric. I went to a couple of their leadership meetings out in San Francisco to talk about the task force. I mean, I should have kind of seen it then when I gave that speech, I forgot who, it was with somebody else that we were talking. I can&#8217;t remember who it was. It was a last minute addition to the leadership summit. I kind of took that some kind of way. This was like, okay, it was last minute, but you&#8217;re president. Because he was in his last year. Now, I don&#8217;t know how much pushback he might have gotten, and having the experience I&#8217;ve had now I kind of understand maybe why he was trying to push it through his last year. Because I think he really did meet a lot of resistance. And so I think he just found a way to pigeonhole it in there and stuff.</p>
<p>Our presentation was sort of last. I really can&#8217;t remember who the other person was. But the response from the leaders there, these were chapter leaders about, well, in terms of this diversity task force and chapters looking at it, what if we don&#8217;t have any people of color here? Basically let&#8217;s put it straight. What if we don&#8217;t have any Black people? And I was like, &#8220;Okay, diversity does not mean just Black people.&#8221; I explained to them diversity means a group collection of different voices. And I said, &#8220;Just because there may not be any Black folks there, Latino folks, Asian folks there, you as white folks can still talk about diversity. There is different white folks too. There&#8217;s also the gay community, this disabled community. You can talk about diversity and how you can address practitioners of design who have been left out.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can be a participant and not some sort of like, well if you need help I&#8217;ll be over here but I&#8217;m not going to do anything until you ask me. The kind of snide blow back getting from that at that time kind of told me what we were headed for. But I was like, all right, fine. This is about education. Let&#8217;s school folks. Yes, I knew some chapters, they don&#8217;t have any Black people around. They probably not even been in the same room with a Black person, let alone anybody else. So back in New York, formulating these plans with the&#8230; Well actually, no, we were doing that in San Francisco. We started burgeoning a task force. It was, oh man, I&#8217;m so bad with names. I think Jose Nito out from Boston, Tracy Woods from St. Louis. There&#8217;s a brother down south, can&#8217;t think of his name. I see his site in my head. A white lady from DC, I can&#8217;t remember her name, and somebody else.</p>
<p>We were sort of like the initial pool. And so we started trying to put up strategies, what we&#8217;re going to do, what&#8217;s going to be the tenant of the task force, what are some of the things we&#8217;re going to try and achieve? How do we talk to chapters about this? And I was assured that the New York chapter, not New York chapter, because it&#8217;s always tricky because New York chapter is the headquarters. So it&#8217;s like, we were assured that headquarters would be a hundred percent behind this. Ric said, &#8220;Yeah, we&#8217;re going to do this.&#8221; I think Emily Woods is a name. I don&#8217;t know if she was on the board or if she was from DC, but there was some board members there or staff members from headquarters that were going to help coordinate this, set up some workshops, help supplement our plans. In meetings that I had with Ric, I talked about some of my ideas and some of the research that I had, which I still have a copy of that letter, where essentially I outlined the plan of what needs to be done with diversity task force in the infancy stage.</p>
<p>Because I knew, okay, I&#8217;m not going to hit you up with everything, because we got to convince you guys just to do a little bit first, and let&#8217;s test the waters to see how serious you are about this before wasting all of our time doing this. And I basically was telling him first and foremost, you can acknowledge now the invisible designers out here, the invisible pioneers both past and present. And that&#8217;s when I mentioned the idea that became Design Journeys. My plan was for that to be a roving exhibition going from chapter to chapter to chapter like they do with other stuff. Gave them a whole list of current, at that time current because this was a 2006, current and past design professionals that they could focus on and recognize for not only just AIGA and [inaudible 00:26:05] but just to make up for the, what&#8217;s the word I&#8217;m looking for? The blind eye that they existed and then set paths for people.</p>
<p>And again I was assured, yeah, we&#8217;re going to do this, we&#8217;re going to help put this through. And so as I tried to set up, oh that was Cooper, from Cooper Design in Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, I forgot her name, her first name. As we were beginning to do and set up these programs with the assurances that Ric, the headquarters was going to be behind us, started having as we tried to put these planning meetings together more and more of this initial task force, the participation wasn&#8217;t existing. Folks, some of them checked out. There was only about three of us who were actively meeting, confirming, talking and trying to set stuff up. As they sort of slid off to the back burner, like oh we&#8217;re engaging in the conversations or attending the meetings, as we try to put plans to Ric and the headquarters team as, okay, can we set this up? They&#8217;re like, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to pass it to the board and talk about stuff and see if we can get allocations and resources.&#8221; Nothing ever happened. It was always a talk, &#8220;We&#8217;ll get back to it.&#8221; Let&#8217;s talk about this. What can we do?</p>
<p>And that went on for about a year of just, okay, we&#8217;ll get back and talk about it. And I was really getting very frustrated and pissed off about it because I&#8217;m like, okay, it&#8217;s like this has been set up to fail from get go. Headquarters is not doing anything. And then I got half this task force team that is MIA. The three of us can&#8217;t do all this stuff. And I&#8217;m not going to say the three people that were there. I&#8217;ll keep that out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh man. No, I&#8217;m kidding.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
But they were very active. And the funny thing is they were active because we all shared the same thing. We were all people of color. Those who were active members on this. With the exception of the lady from DC, the white lady from DC, I have to say she was actually very active too. So it was from a biased perspective so to speak. We had a vested interest in this happening. Did not get that same vested interest from headquarters and from some of the task force members. And so as those task force members started whittling away, tried to shift the focus on, all right, let&#8217;s just stick with the task force members that are here and try and get at least something jumped off from headquarters.</p>
<p>They tied the diversity task force into their mentoring program because it was high school art and design. Well, predominantly most of the students are Black, Latino and Asian. But I was like, but that&#8217;s already in place. I mean yeah we can kind of put that, but if you&#8217;re trying to set this as a standalone, we got to do something that puts us out first. How about we first move with, at the time I had The Invisible Designer, but it became Design Journeys. I said, &#8220;How about this exhibition? Now let&#8217;s start introducing folks to these names.&#8221; Then there was this whole thing about money, how would it be, would it be a roving thing? Who can we put together? And that&#8217;s what I learned about the bureaucracy. AIGA is ridiculous. Which I think is on purpose because they definitely can move stuff when they want to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m holding my tongue so much. But yeah, go.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I mean the biggest, I&#8217;d say two of the biggest programs that they definitely move fast was women in leadership, women in design, I forgot that. And then the voting. Oh, they&#8217;re moving heaven and earth to do that. And granted, yes, the women in leadership, great. You still didn&#8217;t focus on anybody of color in there. Still a whole lot of white people. But you can move heaven and earth for that. You can&#8217;t do it for there, where there could be potential sponsorship opportunities here, where you can get Adobe into this. You can get vendors that this is a necessary need because this broadens the industry. And quite honestly, if you just want to go business wise, increases your sponsor&#8217;s customer base. Because we all use the products that they do. We have to, this is our industry. So through all that, my time spent there was, like I said, we barely got a foot because it was all meetings and back and forth and conversations, like okay, we&#8217;re going to set this up.</p>
<p>All these emails that would have back and forth, I&#8217;m like, can we do something? And because of that inaction, basically most of the members left because they were like, &#8220;Okay, nothing&#8217;s going to happen.&#8221; And then eventually I was told, you know what, this chairpersonship should be every year, which I agree it should be every year. But I&#8217;m like, look, we haven&#8217;t even done anything yet. Because the next chairperson after that was Jose Nito, who was part of the original task force. And they still didn&#8217;t do anything. They still didn&#8217;t do anything. But then it was, what was it, in 20&#8230; When was the first design studios thing? When they got their promos and everything, they held it at AIGA headquarters. That was in 20 something? Twenty&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know when that might have been.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
2015, 2016. Maybe it was earlier than that. Maybe it was 20-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it might have been earlier than that.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Because the only thing I saw came out of it was that in 2008, a year after I just basically left and the new chairperson came on board for the D&#038;I task force, they awarded Georg Olden the medal. And I was like, all right, so you took something out of the list. And then the subsequent years I noticed they started pulling more of the names off that list, giving them AIGA medals. So I&#8217;m like, all right, cool. Now in the beginning a lot of it was the older ones, some passed, some were old. I don&#8217;t have the polite word to say, but I&#8217;m like all right. So at least you&#8217;re recognizing them, you&#8217;re still not giving a context to it. So it&#8217;s like a half assed kind of thing. It&#8217;s like, oh, let&#8217;s just do this. Because it definitely was done just to say, &#8220;Yeah, this is what we&#8217;re doing. We are recognizing diversity, we are recognizing our past invisible pioneers in the industry, and that&#8217;s all you need to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>They gave no context to it, anything like that. And then a few years later they started recognizing some living folks, which I&#8217;m like, all right, you can do a mix of living and past. It doesn&#8217;t have to be one year&#8217;s all dead, now you start going to living. But I noticed that they used quite a few of the names that was on the list that I provided. And I was like, all right, fine. At least something happened. I was like, I still think it&#8217;s for show. And then I got the bomb dropped in my mail when I got the promo card for the exhibition of Design Journeys. To say I almost felt like going down the AIGA headquarters and lightening it up. I was pissed because they created, I really thought it was just a empty shell of what it could have been. It definitely felt like a lip service. Definitely. I mean, I wasn&#8217;t doing it for any acknowledgement or anything like that, but the way they did it where it just was born out of them pissed me off to no end.</p>
<p>Still pisses me off to no end. Because every conversation I have with them is like, oh, we didn&#8217;t know you brought this to them. And I&#8217;m like, you mofos, it&#8217;s right there in black and white. Emails, letters. It&#8217;s like, yeah, yeah, okay, whatever. When I went to the thing, because they gave me it like, &#8220;Oh come down, Design Journeys, blah blah blah, this little promo.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, you didn&#8217;t even spend the money for the kind of promos you do for everything else. It&#8217;s this matte cardboard thing that looks like it came out my own printer. I was just ashamed to see that.</p>
<p>And I went down there, it was just basically a wall of some names, and I&#8217;m like, this is really not a true testament to folks&#8217; legacies and their work. I mean, you&#8217;re not even showing the full showcasing of their space, not their space, but of their actual work and what they went into. I was not a fan of it. I thought the exhibition design, I didn&#8217;t particularly like. And then they turned it into this exercise of, &#8220;What is diversity to you?&#8221; And it turned out was AIGAs membership at that time, it was still predominantly white folks coming in. I&#8217;m reading some of this stuff and I just got offended by some of the stuff that I was reading there. &#8220;Diversity is having some Black people, some white people. It&#8217;s about listening to a different perspective you don&#8217;t necessarily have.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, okay, you&#8217;re not really getting to the root of what it&#8217;s supposed to be.</p>
<p>Whiteboard exercise they had. I&#8217;m like, that means absolutely nothing. Because people are going to go in there, they&#8217;re drinking their little wine. &#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s do this because I&#8217;m down for the cause,&#8221; and then next day what cause, what are you talking about? So that incensed me. And I was just kind of done with AIGA at that point because all the conversations I had with Ric, in the beginning it started pleasant and nice but towards the end he definitely could tell my frustration. And I did start getting a bit raw, which I don&#8217;t think anyone&#8217;s ever talked to him raw before, he&#8217;s high in academia and stuff. But I was like, at that time &#8220;I&#8217;m done with this bullshit. This is crap.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;You&#8217;re not doing anything.&#8221; And then he retires, and they give him a big send off and I&#8217;m like, all right. Yeah, you did great for AIGA, but you left a huge part of your membership underwhelmed.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s how that came to be, this leadership. I never really felt like I got a chance to do anything with the task force because it was such a step. The thing is, while going through all this, I came to City Tech because I was now teaching there and I would talk to Dorothy Hayes and that&#8217;s when I bumped into her and I was like, &#8220;Hey, by the way, let me tell you about we&#8217;re doing this diversity task force for AIGA.&#8221; She was like, &#8220;Oh God.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;What do you mean oh God?&#8221; &#8220;You do know that&#8217;s not the first time they&#8217;d done that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Was like, &#8220;We tried to do that in the seventies. Me,&#8221; meaning her, Dorothy Hayes and a few others, &#8220;And we got nowhere.&#8221; She told me, &#8220;Don&#8217;t trust AIGA. They&#8217;re going to give you the runaround. They&#8217;re going to make you think they&#8217;re doing all this stuff. You&#8217;re going to do all this work and it&#8217;s going to leave you empty.&#8221; They will find an excuse why they can&#8217;t do stuff. Because she said they&#8217;re not interested, they&#8217;re really not interested. They don&#8217;t see the value in it.</p>
<p>And that I have to say came to fruition. To this day I still don&#8217;t think AIGA values what really D, E and I really means about, because at this point I&#8217;m even saying that diversity, get rid of that word. That&#8217;s becoming a trend word. It is very much about inclusion. It is more about being included in the conversation.</p>
<p>Diversity means, okay, I got a representative here, there, there, we&#8217;re good. Those representatives don&#8217;t mean nothing. It&#8217;s like you come here, you can&#8217;t say nothing, don&#8217;t be seen. Just look good. At this point it is about inclusion and equity. Giving me that same access to that power pie that you have and not the crumbs. I don&#8217;t want the crumbs, I want the pie. I don&#8217;t think they value that. I don&#8217;t think they understand the value of it or intentionally underplaying it. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>So those early years to the subsequent later time that I came back onto the task force with AIGA under a different leadership, Julie, Julie Anixter, who I actually liked, I thought she was on point because it all comes down to leadership. Because at the time it was Bill Grant who was pushing this, but his term ended. The next president came in. He had a completely different agenda and it was not about D&#038;I. No. I forgot what he was working on. And then subsequently every board president after that has not picked up the ball with diversity. Let me stop saying diversity. With inclusion and equity.</p>
<p>And then they brought in Julie. At that time, the task force leader then was Jacinda Walker.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Jacinda Walker, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
And Jacinda I had met years ago from an OBD conference, and she was pegging me all these questions about a AIGA and I was telling her, because at the time I didn&#8217;t really know why. I was like, &#8220;All right, cool. You want to know about AIGA? Let me tell you the good, bad, ugly so you making an informed decision.&#8221; And she becomes the chairperson, which Jacinda has got energy for days. Which is great. I&#8217;m not that kind of person.</p>
<p>I loved how she reinvigorated, and actually that version of the task force got more stuff done than I ever seen. And I think a lot of it had to do with Julie. They were in sync. That got more traction and things going on, which reinvigorated me, honestly. I got reinspired. I didn&#8217;t want to do anything with leadership or anything like that. I was like, look, I&#8217;ll just be in the back. I&#8217;ll be a worker. Just put me in the back. I&#8217;ll work with you. I will say that was probably the best time working with AIGA was that iteration of the task force. From, I think I rejoined 2017 till 2018, until after Julie left. That was great. There was things happening and I really felt people were committed. That actually members were committed and that Julie was committed to it.</p>
<p>Now the board is another thing. Which at this point I feel the board has more power than the actual executive director of AIGA. I did not feel the same energy from the board. So with that, as we kept going through stuff and doing things and even the offshoots emerge, which was very interesting, and actually enjoyed working with that too. It was all about emerging designers, and that definitely was a more inclusive kind of recognizing designers and stuff like that. But Julie left, AIGA has gone through a major, major transformation. Seemed like they no longer support any of these programs. I haven&#8217;t seen anything about emerge. I no longer am a member of AIGA and won&#8217;t go back as a member of AIGA because during that last part, once Julie was gone, they had the interim CEO or interim executive director.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Barry.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, Barry. Somehow they got wind, I forgot, it was the engagement director or membership director who reached out to me. Because I had posted a Medium story about my frustration with AIGA, and they reached out to me probably just to cover their ass and for prep. &#8220;Oh we didn&#8217;t know this was going on. Explain this to us.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ll talk to you. I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m talking to you. You a membership person. What are you going to do?&#8221; Come to find out after I explain all this stuff, she left three days later, she had a new job.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So that went nowhere.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
That went nowhere. And I was like, okay, you guys are really wasting my damn time and you&#8217;re going to see Brooklyn come out with that if you keep going. So at that point I was like, I&#8217;m officially done. I&#8217;m officially done. Julie&#8217;s gone. I didn&#8217;t like how that went down. Definitely could see the support being pulled from the task force, left folks questioning what&#8217;s going on. So folks started peeling back and I was like, look, I&#8217;m not going through this road again. I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m officially done. I ended my membership the end of 2018. I let it lapse, I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not doing this anymore. I&#8217;ll join somebody else. I&#8217;ll go to SPD.&#8221; From that point on, I&#8217;ve just seen AIGA sort of disintegrate when they appointed the new executive director Bennie Johnson. Yeah, Bennie Johnson.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, Bennie F. Johnson.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I was like, oh wow. They actually appointed a Black man. And I&#8217;m like, now is that for show or are they actually really serious? But I hadn&#8217;t seen anything with AIGA after that. I slowly started seeing all the initiatives being peeled away. And then to now, D, E and I task force is just a picture on the webpage. That&#8217;s it. They don&#8217;t do anything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now Benny&#8217;s no longer the executive director, which will be news by the time people listen to this. But yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I mean, what, three years, again, that&#8217;s crazy. So essentially that signals one or two things to me. That AIGA definitely may be in its death knell, or two it really is lost in what it&#8217;s trying to be. It definitely does not serve its membership anymore. Definitely doesn&#8217;t serve a segment of its membership. Even though I still keep an eye on what AIGA is doing and some of the things, the conferences, don&#8217;t get me started on AIGA in New York because they do nothing. I don&#8217;t see anything there. I will say I do see more faces of color on the speaker panels, which instinctually I&#8217;ll say when I read the bios and stuff, I&#8217;m like okay, you got folks of color here but they&#8217;re still not creative leads. They&#8217;re from other industries. If this is a design conference, show me the Black design leadership. Show me the Latino design leadership. Asian American, not Pacific Asian, basically darker skin Asians. They&#8217;re not represented. But you still have what I say, the Eastern Asian representation. That&#8217;s still there. But you don&#8217;t really have in terms of when it comes to a whole lot of brown folks up there, that it is more from some ancillary industry.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m like and that&#8217;s great, you may have some inspirational stuff, but I want to know about people in my own industry, how they&#8217;re leading, how they&#8217;re faring, how their experiences to get where they&#8217;re going. I can&#8217;t relate to somebody that&#8217;s speaking from, I don&#8217;t know, they just got a motivational speaking company, I could care less about them. Give me somebody who&#8217;s leading a top design company. I want to know the trials and tribulations with that. So to me, I still see AIGA&#8217;s doing this sort of face paint. They&#8217;re really not digging into it. I don&#8217;t even see them really digging into some of the major things that they always used to do. It&#8217;s dialed very back.</p>
<p>So I just wonder how long is AIGA going to be around, and who&#8217;s going to pick up that vacuum? Because to me it feels like there is a emptiness there of addressing this issue. Leading into OBD, which I thought would be a good variant to AIGA, they don&#8217;t do much either. Because I got aware of them both around the same time as AIGA and OBD. Because I learned about OBD back in the early nineties and I just stumbled on it. I forget how I found out about that. I think it might have been in HOW design, where they were talking about the conference that they put on OBD did in Philadelphia back in I think &#8217;93, no, I think it was maybe &#8217;96.</p>
<p>It was full blown. I mean, I saw so many design professionals that looked like me in these companies I never heard about doing this amazing work that I really thought that was going to do something, and it did nothing. It went nowhere after that. But that&#8217;s a whole of other reasons of internal fighting and the genders and what are they really after. Seemed like it was somebody&#8217;s method of supporting themselves. It was just a lot of, again, empty promises that kind of went nowhere. That didn&#8217;t really help the community at large and stuff. But it did, at least that conference showed me that I wasn&#8217;t alone, and that was just the one thing I wanted to do with AIGA so that beginning students or students coming in to design know that they&#8217;re not alone. That there&#8217;s other people out here that look like them that may have similar stories so that they can look up to and aspire to.</p>
<p>I still try to do that to this day to let people know that you&#8217;re not alone. That there are folks out here. They may not get the shine but it&#8217;s up to us to give the shine to them and stuff. But that was the experience with AIGA.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. So much of what you described just now is point by point what my experience was like being on the D&#038;I task force with AIGA, it almost felt like your hands were tied at some point. You couldn&#8217;t say anything, you couldn&#8217;t do anything. We had a large amount of members, most of them never said a word. They just weren&#8217;t out there. And it was clear that for the people that were people of color that were out there, we were sort of being elevated more as the main group to the point almost where the group was more so associated with us personally than it was with AIGA.</p>
<p>And so when people started leaving, because when I came on, which was in 2014, Antoinette Carroll was a co-chair with this woman Aidan O&#8217;Connor who worked at AIGA. Antoinette was positioning to have a full-time diversity and inclusion employee at AIGA headquarters because she was making the case that this affects everything. This affects membership, this affects other organizations, having it as the side thing along with women in design and voting and stuff, it sort of takes it off of the main plate. It doesn&#8217;t give it as much prominence as it should. I know she was lobbying for that to happen. It didn&#8217;t happen. AIGA eventually hired this diversity and inclusion fellow I think who worked with the task force for a while. This guy named Obed Figueroa, he left and then people just started dropping off the task force left and right.</p>
<p>I left in 2017, not too long after Julie left the organization. And it&#8217;s funny you mentioned Jacinda. I brought Jacinda in.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Oh okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I had met Jacinda prior to AIGA through, I had heard about the work she was doing with the Organization of Black Designers and with this studio out in Cleveland called GoMedia. They were putting together this event called Weapons of Mass Creation Fest every year. And Jacinda was on their ass about how come you all do this every year in Black ass Cleveland and ain&#8217;t no Black people there, how is that? What is that? She was getting on them about it. That&#8217;s when I first learned about her, and then she knew about the stuff I was doing with AIGA, and I was like, &#8220;Well, you should join. I feel like you can take what you&#8217;re doing on this local level and really amplify it.&#8221; This is before I knew how much they would tie our hands to do anything. Everything had to go through a particular AIGA conduit. This woman that worked there&#8230;I&#8217;ll say it, she was racist. She was racist, hands down. I&#8217;m not going to say allegedly. She was racist.</p>
<p>We would mention stuff to her. And the thing was us, the people of color on the task force, put this together. We put two and two together and I was like, wait a minute, why is she telling you one thing and telling me another thing? And she&#8217;d send us these random emails that looked like a ransom note because she would copy and paste from all these different places, and it just pissed a lot of people off because it was like we can do more individually than being part of this task force with this organization, because you won&#8217;t let us say anything through AIGA. We can&#8217;t do anything. We couldn&#8217;t even get an Instagram profile. The Design Journeys and all that stuff, we would recommend people, they would never push that stuff through. A lot of us left after that.</p>
<p>I know Jacinda was chair for a while. I know she left. And I think the only person that might still be around, because after I left, I know Douglas Davis has been on the show before, he also teaches at City Tech. He was doing stuff with them. This woman out of DC, Phim Her was doing stuff. George Garrastegui who&#8217;s in New York was doing things, and Carlos Estrada who&#8217;s out of AIGA Detroit.</p>
<p>I want to say Carlos might be the last surviving member of the task force. Because I don&#8217;t think George is doing anything with them. I don&#8217;t think Pam is doing anything. I know Jacinda&#8217;s does not. I want to say Carlos is the last person standing. But the way that AIGA internally eroded that task force from within, I mean it was like an ulcer just eating away at everyone&#8217;s motivation. We were trying to do surveys and we were trying to do all sorts of things and everything would just get, nope, shot down, don&#8217;t want to do it, can&#8217;t do this, this, this, that and third.</p>
<p>And I was lucky to have Revision Path and still fall on that. And they did one or two features about Revision Path, but then people would say, &#8220;Well how come you have Maurice doing Revision Path and doing 28 Days of the Web and AIGA isn&#8217;t doing something like that?&#8221; And I was like, you got to talk to them about that. I don&#8217;t know nothing about how to get things on the website. It was a pain to get anything on the website because it had to go through another channel and it was a mess. It was an absolute mess. And what I left, and I rescinded my membership I want to say in 2017, 2018, I still sort of kept tabs with the organization, or rather I should say the organization kept tabs with me. Because they would would keep hitting me up about stuff and different chapters would hit me up and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Leave me alone. I don&#8217;t want to mess with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It got to the point, especially with my local chapter, with AIGA Atlanta, I literally had to go to them and say, &#8220;Keep my name out your mouth. I know you are using me, you&#8217;re dropping my name to get other people in here. You&#8217;re dropping my name about stuff. It&#8217;s coming back to me. Keep my name out your fucking mouth.&#8221; And to this day they don&#8217;t. I mean, it&#8217;s whatever. But I say all that to say Benny came on 2019, 2020 ish. And I had him on the show. We talked about the importance of him coming on as the first Black person in the organization&#8217;s hundred year history. I know there was a lot that he tried to do. The pandemic I think also just threw a wrench in a lot of things. And I&#8217;m not using that as an excuse, but I don&#8217;t know what AIGA is going to do now. Because like I said, by the time this airs, news would&#8217;ve went out that Benny is no longer the executive director. I don&#8217;t know who else they&#8217;re bringing in.</p>
<p>And as you&#8217;ve said, and as I know, D&#038;I through AIGA is only as strong as whomever the executive director is that&#8217;s championing for it. Without them being the person at the top to say, &#8220;We&#8217;re doing X, Y, Z,&#8221; nothing really happens. And I&#8217;ve been on the nominating committee for the board. So I see how the board operates, I know how that operates. And they do hold a lot of power. They can oust an ED. They&#8217;ve done it before. So I don&#8217;t know. AIGA is, look, if you are a designer and you hear the sound of my voice and you are actively paying dues to AIGA, and I&#8217;m not saying don&#8217;t do this, but I&#8217;m saying really take a hard look at what the organization provides for you as a modern designer.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I say modern because for a long time AIGA did not acknowledge UX. They didn&#8217;t acknowledge product design. And the reality is a lot of working designers now that work for tech companies or other places are UX designers. They are product designers. They&#8217;re experience designers. There are other designers that&#8217;s not just visual or web. I feel like the organization has started to acknowledge that a bit through some events. But what is the value of an AIGA membership to the modern designer? If you didn&#8217;t go to design school and picked up everything you know from YouTube or courses or a bootcamp or something and you&#8217;re working as a mid-level product designer at a tech company, what importance is AIGA going to be you? How is it really helping you as a career professional outside of just saying you&#8217;re a member?</p>
<p>I mean, I could be a member of the Subway Sub Club, but that don&#8217;t mean anything to the random, you know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m comparing this to RGD in Canada. If you&#8217;re an RGD member and you&#8217;re an RGD registered designer, that means something to companies because they found a way to really get themselves a part of the business community. I don&#8217;t think being an AIGA designer, now saying you&#8217;re a member of AIGA really means anything when you try to get a job or you&#8217;re talking to clients as a freelancer, I don&#8217;t think that means anything. It probably means something on a more local level depending on the visibility of the chapter.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But as a whole, what does it mean? So I&#8217;m not telling people to give up their memberships. I am asking them to take a hard look at the money that they&#8217;re paying and see, is it really worth it?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, you&#8217;re right. I mean, Canada, I&#8217;ve been contemplating moving to Canada mainly because of how the design community is looked at up there. I actually like the idea of registering as a graphic designer. I like that classification that Canada does because it seems like it has a more of a value added perk to you as a working professional and signifies that, hey, you know what you&#8217;re doing and you&#8217;re the real deal and that we&#8217;re going to help you with that.</p>
<p>I mean, for a whole host of reasons it&#8217;ll be like pulling teeth through I don&#8217;t know what in the US to do something like that. I don&#8217;t look upon AIGA in the same light as I did 20 years ago. I don&#8217;t look at it as like, oh, they&#8217;re going to help me. Because honestly, in my career, has AIGA ever got me a job? No. Has AIGA ever really connected me to any of the superstars within AIGA? No. I&#8217;ve met some in passing through meetings and workshops, but no one&#8217;s ever really vested any interest in trying to talk to me more than just, &#8220;Hey, how you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve actually been kind of shunned by some folks in AIGA. A lot of the events that I used to go to, every time I would kind of step in, I&#8217;d always get this look like, what are you doing here? Even when I went into the headquarters, last time I went to the headquarters for something, I forgot what it was. I mean, the staff there was looking at me, and they were younger than me, I mean, looking at me like who&#8217;s this Black man in here? What you doing?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I&#8217;m just like, ooh. So tell students that, I tell them AIGA is a good resource to find information. That&#8217;s what I look at AIGA as of right now. Just an information tool. I still think AIGA is very good in terms of the business information they have on there. It&#8217;s great. I don&#8217;t need to get in, I don&#8217;t need to talk to anybody about that. I can just pull off the information, look at the resources and stuff like that. Cool. You&#8217;re a great library for that. But for the true socialization and the true advancement for designers, as I&#8217;m seeing now as I guess I fall into the seasoned category now, I don&#8217;t see them doing anything about seasoned professionals. It&#8217;s more like you don&#8217;t exist. We&#8217;re only focused on designers up to 30.</p>
<p>I try to tell students it&#8217;s a good resource for that information. But as a member, really think about the value that you may get out of it. You go to some initial events to see how you think about it and see if you see any concrete pros and cons is going to help you personally from that experience. And being the fact that the national headquarters is the New York City chapter is a double edged sword, because the New York City chapter honestly to me is dead as a doornail. They don&#8217;t do much. They didn&#8217;t do much before Covid, they don&#8217;t do much now. And it&#8217;s like, so if you join that, what is it really helping? And I hate saying that to folks, but I don&#8217;t want them to go through the experience I&#8217;ve went through, especially when there&#8217;s other organizations that I see. Yeah, they&#8217;re more of a specific design orientation like Society of Publication Designers.</p>
<p>They seem a lot more active and a lot more forward thinking on what they&#8217;re trying to do and who they showcase and how they extend stuff. I&#8217;m really thinking about joining them. I&#8217;m kind of gun shy because I&#8217;m like, do I really want to join another organization at almost $300 a year? I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know. And then walk away feeling unsatisfied. I mean, because I could do something else with that money. It is tempting, at least what I see in the presence of what they do, they&#8217;re [inaudible 01:01:18] above more stuff than what AIGA does. AIGA&#8217;s big focus is their conference. And I think that&#8217;s just a money driver. I think it&#8217;s fair for folks to start questioning the value of it. And if it&#8217;s not of value, then it&#8217;s time to either create something brand new or maybe just dissolve it completely and rethink this whole process from scratch.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean it&#8217;s interesting because, yeah, you&#8217;re right. You&#8217;re right. I don&#8217;t have anything to add. No notes. 10 out of 10, right?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What gets you truly excited about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
It&#8217;s different nowadays. I&#8217;m approaching I guess 30 some odd years, 32 years working. Because I started working as a sophomore in college. What gets me excited now about what I do is not so much, I&#8217;m not driven by the money anymore, which is kind of backwards to say. But I actually just like trying to educate people about what design really is in terms of a strategic path. I think too many people see design as just make me something pretty. And I&#8217;m like, no, it&#8217;s a lot more deeper than that. It&#8217;s about a strategic path on how you can make your company&#8217;s voice sing. And I like doing that. I get more excited about doing work for not-for-profits because they&#8217;re doing some really good work, a lot of them. But when you come across them you&#8217;re like, oh my god, what is this?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no thought, no rhyme and reason. They look mismanaged when the organizations really aren&#8217;t. They have a plan, they know what they&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s just the only thing is their front facing is not as organized as their internal specter. And that stuff is what gets me excited today is doing a lot of not-for-profit, dare I say pro bono work where taking away, I mean, yeah, I do non-profit work at a discounted rate, but pro bono stuff, you take away the money thing and you just focus on just creating to help them just for the altruistic nature. I don&#8217;t know, I just get a very different feeling. It just really inspires me because it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m helping you become better, to help you take yourself to another level that you deserve to be at.</p>
<p>And that I find in this aspect of my career is what truly motivates me today. If folks are willing, I like telling them about design and how it helps and what it can do, which is why I like teaching. And I think design education is paramount both for clients and students. Because I think as a designer, I think it&#8217;s our responsibility to also educate our clients about the power of design and what it truly is. But teaching, I feel like with all the experience and everything that I&#8217;ve gained over these 30 years, I feel I&#8217;ve been very fortunate and blessed. My career&#8217;s gone through so many different curves. It&#8217;s nowhere where I initially started seeing myself, where I envisioned there&#8217;s going to be some high powered VP of design at some mega billionaire company where I&#8217;m jetting from country to country and stuff like that. That doesn&#8217;t appeal to me and stuff. What appeals to me is just passing forward this design legacy to beginnings designers and so that they have a better experience than what I have had in my beginning journeys and stuff. And so that&#8217;s what excites me today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does success look like now? I mean, you&#8217;re at this point in your career where you have really seen design through all these different changes. Of course you mentioned being a design educator. What does success look like?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I would say immediately, right off the top of the head, some of the successes I like is when some of my former students have landed jobs that they really wanted and they come back and say they actually really value what I&#8217;ve done and help push them to be better than what they were when they were studying. They say, &#8220;Well yeah, you&#8217;re a little bit of a hard ass, but I get why you did that. It&#8217;s got me where I am today.&#8221; And we still keep in touch. They&#8217;ll contact me about industry advice, to just basically to have an air. That&#8217;s a success to me. But overall, I just find success in that, if I can actually just help someone, an organization, just put their message out a little more clearer. That they feel better about themselves, that I feel is a success to me. That&#8217;s how I&#8217;m counting that. Is how well does my knowledge or how does my help make them feel better about what they&#8217;re doing and stuff like that.</p>
<p>To me, I feel that&#8217;s more of a success I count today. I&#8217;m not discarding money. I still [inaudible 01:06:44] money, but I&#8217;m not driven by that, and that&#8217;s a fleeting success. Because I&#8217;ve been there when it&#8217;s been coming in like buckets and then when it&#8217;s dust, [inaudible 01:06:55] desert, it is more of the untangible successes that I think is great because that&#8217;s what&#8217;s lasting. So if I can help somebody else, they will remember that, and that just helps propel them. So while the name may not be there, the root of that help grows forever. I mean who doesn&#8217;t want that? That&#8217;s eternal. That&#8217;s great. And I find that success. Yeah, that&#8217;s how I&#8217;d answer that. If that&#8217;s clear. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think so. Yeah. Now this might be a harder question to answer, but I&#8217;ll ask it.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Uh oh.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I&#8217;m actually asking myself that now. I&#8217;ve been toying with the idea of in about five years, which I&#8217;ll be 60, which I still can&#8217;t get my head wrapped around. God, I got to take a breath on that one. In five years I still want to be a practicing designer, but I want to see myself pull back. I want to see where I&#8217;m doing design more at a leisurely pace. I see myself still teaching part-time but in a different scenario where I&#8217;m really seriously contemplating on starting my master&#8217;s next year to be able to teach at any institution. Because you need a master&#8217;s to move around outside of where I&#8217;m teaching at community college. And I&#8217;m 75% sure, I think I may actually move from being an in-house designer and going back to a full-time studio. I&#8217;m thinking in five years I may want to resurrect a physical entity of Straight Design, which it probably will not be called Straight Design because I&#8217;m thinking about rebranding myself completely.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s sort of where I see, I don&#8217;t see myself ever retiring. Because people say, &#8220;Well okay, five years you&#8217;d be 60, then there&#8217;s 65. What about retirement?&#8221; I can&#8217;t do retirement. I have some friends who are retired early, they look bored as crap, and I can&#8217;t do that. And the thing is, I still feel design. I still get very much invigorated when I see great design. I still keep my nose to what&#8217;s happening in the industry as fast as it&#8217;s changing. And I&#8217;m also very interested in that, I&#8217;m hoping within the next five years that I can actually transition into a field that kind of peaks my curiosity, and that&#8217;s motion graphics. Whether or not to get a full-time gig for that, but to be able to offer that as a service. And to be honest, just to be selfish, I just think it looks cool.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done a little bit of motion graphics now and it&#8217;s intriguing, it&#8217;s fascinating and it&#8217;s fun. It&#8217;s fun doing that to take this static idea and bringing it into a motion life,, is something that I&#8217;d like to do more of, especially since I see that as the way design will start changing as we move from the platform of the basic augmented and virtual reality platforms we have now, which is clearly in its cell phase. I can&#8217;t even call it embryo, it&#8217;s still in the cell. That doing something, and I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m a big fan of social media, it has its place, but I like the premise of how you, not necessarily the still aspect of social media, how Instagram originally started that it was all photos. Now it&#8217;s all videos. So you might as well just say TikTok.</p>
<p>That aspect of promoting stuff from a brand ad perspective is fascinating to me, because that&#8217;s where you can apply the motion graphics to that. It&#8217;s high hopes, but I kind of see myself doing more of that in five years. So like I said, I&#8217;m dabbling a little bit right now with it, that I&#8217;m trying to incorporate a little bit more into my full-time job. To feel comfortable enough to be able to offer that to clientele. That&#8217;s about as far as I can see what I think myself for five years, because in just the last five years I&#8217;ve gone through such a major transition professionally and personally that I&#8217;ve learned I&#8217;m not trying to forecast anymore, because tomorrow could be very different right then and there. So five years could be a very, very long way aways, and many different things go. But that&#8217;s kind of where I see my vision board for five years might be.</p>
<p>And that could change next week too. Because I have become very sort of transitory, I&#8217;ve been very flexible about, oh, where we&#8217;re going to go. I don&#8217;t know. Let&#8217;s see where the journey takes us kind of thing. Because at this point I don&#8217;t feel I need to prove anything to anybody. I don&#8217;t need to prove anything to myself. I actually just want to enjoy myself and I just want to contribute with, especially more so in terms of, wow, as I&#8217;m listening to myself in my head as I&#8217;m thinking about this, that Lord help me, do I want to actually become more of a social activist? I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;d like to actually as these issues are popping up more and more in society, as a global society because you can&#8217;t really say we&#8217;re stuck in our own little neighborhoods anymore. But I want to do my part and help on that kind of scale.</p>
<p>In some part that also too is in that projection for the next five years. Maybe it&#8217;s a lofty idea, but it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s kind of sparking some initial interest now that I want to see how that, once I plant these seeds where it may grow within five years. But that&#8217;s where I see still doing the stuff and just hopefully still looking as young as I do now for five years. And just hoping my kids are, because they seem to, my son&#8217;s on this creative journey that I hope he&#8217;s successful in what he&#8217;s doing, and helping guide him as much as I can. As well as my daughter who is still trying to find herself. But she has a really strong creative base, even though she keeps trying to deny it. To make certain that they, like I said, my son makes certain that his career path is as solid as it can be, and to really try and guide my daughter because by that time she&#8217;ll be going to college. Kind of push her to be a creative too. So yeah, that&#8217;s what I see.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
They can find me on my website str8tdesignllc.com. But the domain is not spelled as you would say straight, it&#8217;s S-T-R, the number eight, the letter T, designllc.com, had to play off of that because somebody took the domain Str8t Design. They could find me there. They could also find me on Instagram as Str8t Design spelled as you just say it on Instagram. That&#8217;s generally my main two points where you can find me, because my social media presence really is contained to just Instagram. I no longer use Twitter and I don&#8217;t really use anything else. I just use Instagram and my basic website.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Andrew Bass, wow. I mean, I knew that this was going to be a great conversation, but this was a conversation and a history lesson and a therapy session. This was so much wrapped into one. I mean, first of all, I just want to thank you for just the work that you&#8217;ve done. I mean a lot of what you&#8217;ve done in terms of just educating and then also even the work with AIGA has really kind of set the platform for me to even do what I do here with Revision Path. Like you were one of the first people that I interviewed back before this was all a podcast and everything. And to see that you&#8217;re still continuing to do this work throughout the years, that you can really speak truth to history about how things have went and how technology has changed design and everything. I hope folks get a chance to really listen to both parts of this episode, of these episodes, I should say, to really get the full breadth of what it is that you bring to the design community. And I hope to see you honored one day. I mean, through AIGA, maybe we&#8217;ll see, I don&#8217;t know, but I think what you&#8217;ve brought to the design industry is indispensable. And I just want to thank you so much for sharing that perspective here with our audience. So thank you for coming on. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Well, I thank you for that and I thank you for interviewing me. It was a really cool talk, great to listen and listen to hearing myself talk. And actually it was very therapeutic to actually share some of the agony going through some of this and just trying to lay groundwork for future folks, trying to lessen the burdens that they&#8217;re going to have to face. And the fact that in 2022, coming into 2023, that this is still going to have to go on is sort of mind numbing to me. But it&#8217;s still very much the fight to happen. I may not have as much fire in this fight as I used to because I&#8217;ve taken a reprieve and taken a step back because it does kind of wear you down a bit. But I&#8217;m kind of been refreshing myself to like, you know what? Let&#8217;s throw my hat back in this one last time.</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t be with AIGA, it&#8217;ll be actually doing through some other things, because forget them. It&#8217;s time to go to other means out there, and actually just basically ourselves. Because I still have floating in my head, even though we&#8217;ve had OBD, no, yeah, OBD, which has had mixed results, I still feel very much that if this is going to change, that we have to do it for ourselves. Completely independent and self sustained.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
A hundred percent, a hundred percent. I believe that. Again, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
No problem. Thank you.</p>
