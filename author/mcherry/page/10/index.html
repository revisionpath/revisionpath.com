Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>What does it take to be an art director? For Victor Ware, it&#8217;s a combination of three things: talent, hard work, and maybe&#8230;never sleeping. Victor has over a decade of experience and has done everything from working on legacy media brands to doing full-scale brand overhauls. </p>
<p>Our conversation began with a look at Victor&#8217;s current gig at Wide Eye, and he talked a bit about how future tech like AI and machine learning play into the  work he does. He also talked about growing up in the DMV area, cutting his teeth in the design world at AOL and Vox Media, and balancing 9-to-5 work with starting his own design studio. Victor&#8217;s drive for excellence is evident, and I think we&#8217;ll be seeing a lot more from him in the years to come!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
All right. My name is Victor Ware. I&#8217;m an art director at Wide Eye Creative currently. And yeah, I was specializing branding. I&#8217;ve been doing that for about six years now, specialing in branding. And yeah, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing, what I&#8217;ve been focusing on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has the year been going for you so far? How&#8217;s 2023 been treating you?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
2023 has actually been really good to me. I just transferred to Wide Eye coming from another job, so this has been my first time being a full-fledged art director. And it&#8217;s been really successful. I feel like at home at this agency. Yeah, it&#8217;s been going so far really good, and we&#8217;ve created a lot of projects in the advertise&#8230; Not the advertising space, in the political space. We have some other creative agencies that we&#8217;re working for. It&#8217;s just been really, really good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I saw that Wide Eye, I think this might have been maybe a year or two ago, was recognized by Fast Company as one of the best agencies in the country.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Yes, yes. And I can say that is not an exaggeration. The people there are super talented, they are very driven and just kind. I think wherever you work, that&#8217;s one of the biggest things you look for. At least me, I look. I look for actual people caring about people. The work is super important, the work is always going to have that importance, but I think how you treat people is far above, beyond more important than that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, aside from the change over to Wide Eye, have there been any other things that you&#8217;ve noticed this year that&#8217;s different from last year? Have there been any changes for you?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Oh yeah, actually, personally, I moved to Baltimore a couple years ago from DC and bought a house. And I&#8217;m living with my partner, and we&#8217;re really coming into our own and trying to build a life. I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s this leveling up my career, my personal life, and it&#8217;s been good so far.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Congratulations to you.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk more about Wide Eye. I&#8217;m curious, what is a typical day like for you there?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Yeah, I think a typical day, I&#8217;m managing others designer, so I&#8217;m checking in with them, I&#8217;m checking on projects. Usually I&#8217;m on two to three projects, branding projects, either making sure we&#8217;re getting deliverables out the door for our clients. We also have retainers for clients, and then checking in on those projects. There&#8217;s always that balance between things that are due right now, things that will be due later in the week, and then things that are due in a month. Always checking and making sure I&#8217;m on top of things.</p>
<p>And then, yeah, I have time to design, so that&#8217;s either building a new logo or brand guidelines. A big part of my job is maintaining brand guidelines and creating those so that when we hand those over to clients, they have the best shot of executing their brand that we put all this energy into and they put all this energy into to make sure it will be useful and work for many years to come.</p>
<p>And then the other thing as meetings. I feel like a lot of designers hate meetings, but we really try to make sure our meetings are purposeful, that we have an agenda, that we know why we&#8217;re having a meeting. And that usually helps a lot. Yeah, that&#8217;s my typical day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s good that you get to have some hands on time with the work.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Yes. I love being a designer. Like I mentioned before, this is my first time being a full-fledged art director and having more of that strategic or managerial role. I don&#8217;t want to lose my skills as a designer either, so I&#8217;m building both of those skills at the same time. But yeah, I love creating. This is why I got into this originally.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve had other art directors and other folks working at agencies on the show, and it&#8217;s hard for them to get that time to be able to do that because, yeah, you are managing projects, you&#8217;re doing a lot of checking in, like you mentioned, you&#8217;re doing meetings, but it sounds like things are structured at Wide Eye where you still get that opportunity to get hands on with the work. You mentioned that you&#8217;re managing another designer. What does the team look like that you generally work with?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
We have a pretty small team. We break it down to we have interactive side, we have our branding side, and we have a couple of designers specializing in motion design as well. We&#8217;re really a small and nimble team with designers. We have engineers, project managers, and then also operations folks that help keep the business running.</p>
<p>I would say there&#8217;s about 30 to 40 people working total at Wide Eye right now. And yeah, it&#8217;s like a perfectly oil machine. Everyone that comes on board just fits. I think they&#8217;ve done a really good job of creating a team that is optimized to really do the best results. And then, like I mentioned before, people that are just good people, I think that makes it even more special.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I&#8217;m curious, with Wide Eye having the reputation that it has, even some of its clients like the White House, Democratic National Convention, et cetera&#8230; And I know that Wide Eye is not specifically just about progressive politics in that sense. A couple of episodes ago, I had on Rudy Manning. He&#8217;s an agency owner. He owns Pastilla Inc. out in Pasadena. And we were talking about the future of agencies. What does it mean to be an agency in the world that we&#8217;re currently in? Particularly when you think about the rise of AI technologies and stuff like that. I&#8217;m curious, is that something that you are dealing with now in your work? Are you having those conversations?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s something that has come up a lot. One of our creator directors is very interested in technology and how&#8230; I would say we all are to some extent, how that changes design, how it could benefit design, and what that means for the landscape and for our careers. We&#8217;ve started experimenting with adding either ChatGPT into writing copy or using it for brainstorming.</p>
<p>I think the way I look at technology is throughout design history, it&#8217;s always changed how we work. If you go back from type setting and using the printing press and letter press all the way to now everything&#8217;s digital, I think we just learn and grow with the technology and use it to our advantage. And so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m hoping happens. I know there&#8217;s a lot of fear that this will devalue design or it will make designers obsolete, but I think the opposite. I think designers, we&#8217;re always at the forefront of technology, we&#8217;re always trying to use that to communicate better. And so I&#8217;m hoping and I&#8217;m hopeful that the rise of AI technology will just help us communicate better if we use it right. And that&#8217;s the key. Are we using it correctly? And so that&#8217;s probably the biggest question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the correct way to use it?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
As a tool and not as a replacement. I think we should never forget that all of us are people. At the end of the day, we&#8217;re talking to people, we&#8217;re designing for, people are using our products, and they&#8217;re interacting with our websites or our brands or whatever. We shouldn&#8217;t forget that. We shouldn&#8217;t just think of people as commodities or as tools of themselves. No, we&#8217;re building these for other people like ourselves, we should use our tools, whether it&#8217;s AI or just regular dumb tools to help and make the world better. And yeah, it is a challenge because there are always those people who aren&#8217;t focused on doing the best, so I think it&#8217;s up to us who are interested in doing good to push that agenda even more.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting, I&#8217;m writing a book right now, I&#8217;ve mentioned this on the show before, and I&#8217;ve been using ChatGPT, not to, well, to help me write the book. I use it as a good assistant. If I need to find a lead or something that I need to pursue in terms of research, it&#8217;s been really great for that, especially for specific figures I may not know or people I may not be super familiar with. There&#8217;s only so far, I think, that you can go with just strict internet research. And what ChatGPT helps me to do is at least send me partially down the right path. Now, I will admit it&#8217;s not-</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
It&#8217;s not perfect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s not perfect. And in some cases, it&#8217;s not even correct. It&#8217;s-</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true. It&#8217;s funny, I&#8217;ve seen a lot of examples where it&#8217;s just got things totally wrong or just makes up stuff. And so I think that is also the thing that we have to be wary of. It&#8217;s like, we can&#8217;t give too much control over it, we have to make sure we&#8217;re still living in the real world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I was doing research on one person. I&#8217;m not going to mention who it is because they&#8217;re in the book, but I was doing research on this person, and I asked ChatGPT, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, assume that you are a world renowned civil rights scholar. Tell me in two or three paragraphs who this person is, or whatever, and where I can find more information on him.&#8221; And one of the things that said was, &#8220;Oh, you can go to the University of Chicago&#8217;s daily library.&#8221; No, I think it was University of Illinois in Chicago. You can go to their library, and they have a whole section of his letters and all this stuff. I was like, &#8220;Oh, okay. I didn&#8217;t know that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
That&#8217;s exciting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right? It&#8217;s exciting. I go to the website, I go to chat with the librarian, and I tell them, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ve heard you&#8217;ve got this archive of letters and things. And how can I gain access to it?&#8221; And the librarian was like, &#8220;We don&#8217;t have that. Where did you hear that from?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
ChatGPT. Because a computer told me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. &#8220;The computer told me that you had it,&#8221; and they don&#8217;t have it. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, shit.&#8221; But it was good because at least it didn&#8217;t send me too far down a rabbit hole that wouldn&#8217;t have went anywhere. Now I&#8217;m like, okay, that was a wrong lead. Let me pursue something else. And research, I think, can be like that; sometimes you get sent on these wild goose chases. And I guess what ChatGPT at least helped me to do in this particular instance is cut it off at the pass. Oh, don&#8217;t do that.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I think just like we had to learn how to use Google, for instance, I think we have to learn how to use AI tools. I remember the first time I used Google, I was in the 8th grade. No, I was younger than that, I was probably in the 4th grade trying to research a project. I had to go to the public library, and they had to show me how to use the Google. It is weird now because now we all use all these tools daily. It&#8217;s on our phone, it&#8217;s on our work computer, it&#8217;s on our personal computer. It&#8217;s so ubiquitous, we don&#8217;t think about it. And I think that&#8217;s basically how AI tools will evolve; it&#8217;ll become part of our life without us really knowing. And that sounds scary, but it&#8217;s also something that we&#8217;ve seen before. For example, autocorrect. Autocorrect, we use it all the time. It&#8217;s the most helpful thing. We don&#8217;t have to remember how to spell long words like expialidocious or something. And yeah, it&#8217;s those little tools that are helpful, that are ubiquitous that we don&#8217;t notice until it becomes that part of our life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, maybe this was about five or six months ago when people started rolling out the AI avatars. And one, there were people that were saying, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re paying for that. You&#8217;re paying for that?&#8221; Blah, blah, blah, all this stuff. Which I think gets into a whole other conversation around people that are using these sorts of things and then going to humans, expecting them to alter or change or make corrections on what the AI has done. That&#8217;s a whole other conversation.</p>
<p>But the thing is that we&#8217;ve been so used to face app and face tune and some form of digital retouching and all that stuff that AI avatars are not that much of a stretch to the imagination past that. And because these models are trained on pictures that, honestly, we are putting online, people putting immense amount of personal data online-</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
There&#8217;s so much data, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; through social media. We&#8217;re feeding the machine that&#8217;s making this happen, so can we really be that mad at it? I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s a really tricky conundrum. I think the ethics around it are still something that folks were trying to iron out even just on a personal level. I&#8217;ve had to tell people, even for the show, &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to send me a picture, send me a picture, don&#8217;t send me an AI avatar.&#8221; I prefer it to be you because we&#8217;re talking about you, we&#8217;re not talking about your avatar or whatever. But, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Yeah, amorphous representation of you. Yeah, it does. And that&#8217;s where I say it&#8217;s that scary part because I think we&#8217;re always pushing this line. And when I say we, I mean humanity as a collective, we&#8217;re always pushing this line of technology and what the next new thing, and we&#8217;re blurring this line between real and the virtual. It&#8217;s just going to get more confusing. But I&#8217;m hoping that we figure it out as we continue to do. I feel like in this time in history, it feels like technology is, by and large, a benefit. And I&#8217;m hoping that remains for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s a good point. What would you say is the best thing about the work that you do?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
I would say that the best thing is really being creative, is getting to work on new and exciting problems for a variety of people. And this is not just for where I&#8217;m at today, but throughout my career I&#8217;ve gotten to work on new things and that challenge me and allow me to think about problems in a different way and be creative.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been a creative person, even since I was a really young kid and loved doodling and drawing cartoon characters. I would tape Dragon Ball Z, and I would pause it so I can draw the characters. I don&#8217;t know, it was a way to express myself and a way to just have fun. I&#8217;m grateful to be in this field because I can still have fun, even in my daily job. Even though it&#8217;s still a job, it&#8217;s still hard, it&#8217;s still days where I&#8217;m frustrated and burnt out, but at the end of the day, I&#8217;m grateful that I can do what I love.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. There&#8217;s some saying about how even when you think about what you&#8217;re going through right now, think about who you were 10 years ago. You would&#8217;ve wished to be at the place that you&#8217;re at now. It&#8217;s helpful to put it in perspective.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Yeah, I think that&#8217;s very true. I think about myself 10 years ago. 10 years ago, I was just graduating or I was probably still in a design school. And I don&#8217;t know if I would dream I would be in this exact position. Yeah, I am lucky in that regard. And even if you&#8217;re not where you think you should be or where you want to be, I think there&#8217;s so many different possibilities of where you could be, and it could be worse, or it could be better. But I think we have to be grateful for our situations and not lose sight of what we&#8217;re striving for but also be in the moment; this is a good moment, or this is a bad moment, and be grateful for it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s get more into your background. You mentioned being really creative at a young age. Tell me more about that. Were you introduced a lot to art and design growing up?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Yeah, I think my mom, she raised me and my brother, actually, she was a single parent. We grew up in DC. My mom&#8217;s from DC, my grandfather&#8217;s from DC so we go way back. And she always encouraged us to paint or draw. She would spend time with us and make paintings. She loved to draw as well. I remember she would draw characters. And I don&#8217;t know, we had a lot of fun as a family doing that. She would take us to museums, we would go to parks. We had a lot of time to explore the world in a really positive way. And she encouraged me to be creative, she encouraged me to express myself, so I&#8217;m grateful for that as well. It really helped me just pursue what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>I was also really interested in science as a kid. I wasn&#8217;t sure if I wanted to be a scientist or be an artist. I really wanted to be an artist. And I feel like I met somewhere in the middle because I feel like design is very analytical, it&#8217;s very logical, but it also is very creative. I found a happy medium in the end.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When did you know that this was something that you really wanted to study and get into?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Yeah, I figured that out in high school. I took art for all four years. It was an elective at my high school. And I just loved it. I started looking up colleges. I was like, &#8220;Okay, I can actually go to school for this.&#8221; I really want to be an illustrator. That was my initial goal. And I got accepted to a few schools in New York and Chicago and DC, and so I chose to stay in DC. It made sense financially. The Corcoran College of Art and Design is where I attended. But they didn&#8217;t have an illustration program, they had a design program, so I said, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll try this out.&#8221; I had already been experimenting with Photoshop. Or not really Photoshop, the free version of Photoshop. I don&#8217;t know if you know about GIMP or-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah, mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
&#8230; you know about Inkscape. I didn&#8217;t have any money, I didn&#8217;t even have a laptop at the point. When I first went to school, I didn&#8217;t have a laptop for the first year. And I struggled so hard because you&#8217;re majoring in design and you don&#8217;t have a laptop. You&#8217;re going to have to spend extra hours at school working. I did that, and it was difficult. But yeah, I learned on the free software.</p>
<p>And I was just having fun. I was really into music. I still am. I really love album art, and so I was designing my own album art, I was designing album art for my brother, who&#8217;s also a musician. And yeah, that&#8217;s how I got into it. And I was like, &#8220;Oh, okay.&#8221; And I started learning about the fundamentals in school, and I was like, &#8220;Okay, I can do this. This is not that bad.&#8221; I know I wanted to be an illustrator, but I&#8217;m good at this design thing. And now I made a whole career out of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting how there&#8217;s such a connection between design and music in that way, I guess, because they&#8217;re both just these pure forms of creative expression. But I remember cutting my teeth on doing fake album designs and stuff. I didn&#8217;t use GIMP and Inkscape, though. I&#8217;ve heard of them, but I used&#8230; Well, this was back in the day, I was using basically a cracked version of Photoshop that didn&#8217;t give my computer a virus or something.</p>
<p>But I would do that, and I would go to a bookstore, like a Barnes and Noble. And you know how they had those Photoshop tips and tricks books and all this sort of stuff, and those.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Yes, yes. No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And they would have these big magazines, these $10 or $15 magazines that always came with a CD. I would copy the tutorials out of there and then go home and try to recreate stuff. That&#8217;s how I taught myself how to use Photoshop, how to use Illustrator. And I guess in the process of doing that, I&#8217;m also teaching myself about typography, negative space, color, things like that. And a lot of it was making fake album covers for groups that don&#8217;t exist, for artists that are not real people. Just taking a stock photo and being like, &#8220;What can I do with this? How can I change this around?&#8221; It&#8217;s interesting in that connection between those two.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Yeah, I was doing the same things. I watched so many tutorials online like psdtoots.com. I remember going in there and just like, &#8220;Oh, this is a new thing I&#8217;ve never tried before.&#8221; And it was just a lot of that. I was excited to learn and just having fun with it, not with any intention of, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to be this kind of designer, or I&#8217;m going go&#8230;&#8221; I just wanted to have fun. And like I said, I really love music. I was making my own music and making the album mark for it, and that was fun. And I saw that connection between them. But I&#8217;ve noticed there&#8217;s this weird percentage of designers who are also musicians. And it&#8217;s really scary because I honestly, maybe, I want to say two out of three designers in a room, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, okay. You make music. Okay, of course you do.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I was a musician before I started getting into design. I played trombone all through middle school, through high school, in college, out of college.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:26:00].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Did you play anything? Were you a singer? Or what did you do?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
I sang. I was in choir for a very long time. I taught myself the piano. I&#8217;m not a good piano player by any means, but I learned a little bit. And I could produce my own beats and things like that. And yeah, that was my outlet. After school, I would come home, rush home and spend hours making music, and then I would do some design tutorials. And that&#8217;s why it would always intertwine for me, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, tell me more about the school, about Corcoran. Do you feel like they really helped prepare you for the design world while you were there?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
It was the oldest design school in DC. Very, very famous gallery. They&#8217;ve been around for a long time. And I feel like the education was very traditional. There was a lot of focus on print. A lot of my teachers had been working in design field for decades. I got a really good basis on theory, on history. We had just amazing teachers, even on the technical side. But I would say it had nothing to do with what I ended up doing. Like I said, there was a lot of focus on print design, which is good though, because I think you learn all the fundamentals, the gestalt, you learn color theory, you learn how to layout type, and so I think having that basis was really helpful.</p>
<p>When I graduated, I straight went to doing UI and UX design, which really, I hadn&#8217;t learned a whole lot in school. I had to learn a lot on the job. But I had that foundation that really helped me just get a kickstart, so I didn&#8217;t floundering. But I had to learn a lot about UI conventions. I had to learn about HTML and CSS and how those things work, and I had to learn what UX design was. Product design wasn&#8217;t a title yet, really. It was [inaudible 00:28:08]. And so there was a lot of new stuff. I was learning how to design for iOS apps and Android and what the difference was. But yeah, it was exciting, it was an exciting time. But yeah, I would say school prepared me to learn more, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You were in school during the time when the web was really exploding in such a massive way. We&#8217;re talking about the rise of HTML5, we&#8217;re talking about the huge move away from table-based layouts to CSS. And yeah, UI and UX weren&#8217;t really even talked about as a thing yet. And that&#8217;s not to say they didn&#8217;t exist. I don&#8217;t think the terminology was really there.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Just wasn&#8217;t formalized.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it wasn&#8217;t formalized in a way where people could learn about it. And schools, I can tell you schools were not on it at all. A lot of places were still catching up. I taught design for two years in, I think it was 2012 to 2014, something like that. And when I started, they were still teaching table-based web design. And I was like, &#8220;Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, this has to be CSS. We can&#8217;t be teaching these students this kind of stuff, and then they go out to try to get a job and nobody&#8217;s going to hire them because all their designs are dated. We got to teach them what is actually being used now in the industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that was such a massive change, just even from a department standpoint, because they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, we have to change curriculum, we have to change tests.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re going to have to do it now, because the industry is&#8230;&#8221; Not only is the industry changing in terms of what is being done in terms of the languages and stuff like that, but even the browser itself is shifting from being something that used to be strictly presentational to now being a workspace; cross browsers compatibility, all these different frameworks and JavaScript libraries and all this stuff. The things that you&#8217;re able now to do in a browser you really could not do 10 or 15 years ago. It&#8217;s a massive shift.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Oh, no, no, unimaginable. Yeah. The way we work in browsers now was unthinkable. One, no browser can handle what we&#8217;re doing now, even close to&#8230; The speed of everything that&#8217;s developed since that time is lightning. Everyone talks about the shift from Web 2.0 to 3.0, but we&#8217;re talking about the shift from 1.0 to 2.0. And that was a big, big, big jump. I think the big players were just solidifying their stance in the playground, the Googles, the Facebook. That&#8217;s when they really became these big behemoths. But yeah, before that there was AOL and Netscape and Yahoo. But yeah, and no one had seen these Goliath companies, the Amazons of the world before. And yeah, it just happened really, really quickly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Speaking of AOL, oh, you worked there-</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
I did.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; for a little over four years. This was after you graduated from Corcoran. Tell me about that. Because first of all, I didn&#8217;t&#8230; I was doing my research, I was like, I didn&#8217;t even know AOL was still around. I remember getting the CDs, the American Online CDs in the mail as a teenager.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Oh, we had those, we had those, yeah. No, in the office they were still there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
One of my professors at the Corcoran College of Art and Design, he was creative director at AOL, and he was like, &#8220;There&#8217;s this internship. Apply.&#8221; Because I was a junior at the time. Yeah, that&#8217;s how I got my first job. And then after he left AOL, I ended up staying. I was just there for four years. And like I was saying, I learned a lot about UI and UX design. My first job was working on the AOL homepage. We also worked on AOL&#8217;s first news app that went in the iOS store and Android store. They hadn&#8217;t had&#8230; Which was crazy, they not had an app before.</p>
<p>And yeah, I learned so much in that job. As I was mentioning before, most of my education was more print focused, it was very traditional, and now I&#8217;m designing webpages, which I was like&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I thought I was going to be working on a magazine or something. It was really fun. We had a really small and nimble team, and I just learned so much. It was fun. And the only reason I left AOL is one thing, they were notorious for laying people off, so I hanged in there as long as I could. And I did get laid off, but it was fun. Like I said, I really learned a lot.</p>
<p>And yeah, it was weird being at a place that I remember from my childhood and the dial-up tone and just seeing all that. And they had this huge campus in Virginia near Dallas Airport. You can see how big AOL used to be. It was weird to be in a company where it&#8217;s not at its heyday, it&#8217;s slowly becoming less relevant. But we were still working, we were working on things. We were still bringing out new products. We were still trying to compete with the other players in the game. I do enjoy the people I worked with and the time I spent there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting about those old companies. We still have EarthLink in Atlanta.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Yeah. Really?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That threw me for a loop because I remember when EarthLink used to be in Midtown, it was a pretty big deal when it first came about. Now it&#8217;s a little bit further out in town. But I didn&#8217;t even know they were still a thing just in terms of it being an internet service provider. I was like, &#8220;People use EarthLink on purpose?&#8221; I did not know it was still around because a lot of those older Web 1.0 companies just either faded into obscurity or they just-</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Yep. Or got gobbled up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right, exactly. It was just very few from that era that still were around. You mentioned this art director at AOL was actually a mutual colleague of ours, Ted Irvine.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Yes, Ted Irvine, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Tell me more about working with him. What was that like?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
He was my instructor at Corcoran teaching after effects. He was very good at teaching. I&#8217;m not a motion designer, so he made it easy enough for me to understand. That was good. Working for him was really fun. He wasn&#8217;t at AOL super long by the time I joined. It was good to work with him. There was also a few other people I knew from Corcoran and that worked there. And it was just a good environment. We knew each other, we knew each other&#8217;s backgrounds, so we knew where we were coming from from a point of view. And it was very collaborative. He was a good mentor. He actually ended up moving to Espy Nation, which became Vox Media. And then I ended up joining him in Vox Media not four years later. It was just good to see him again then, and it was good working overall.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s a small world. I think people who have been longtime, longtime listeners of Revision Path remember that we used to do some stuff with Vox Media back in 2015. I think, I want to say 2015, 2016. I was doing some consulting with their product team, and then Vox ended up being a sponsor of Revision Path for a little while so I got to go to the office and sit down with the team. Actually, I can tell this story now. I interviewed for a job there. Didn&#8217;t get it, but-</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Honestly, I&#8217;ll tell you this. The first time I interviewed there, I didn&#8217;t get the job. I interviewed there twice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, really?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Yes, yes. Yeah. I went to work on the website, and I didn&#8217;t get that job. The job I did get the second time I interviewed was working in advertising, their custom ad, what they call Rev Ex. And then after a year doing that, they moved me to the brand team, which I worked on for five years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I went through six rounds of interviews for I think it was the product team coordinator position. And didn&#8217;t get it, but after I ended up consulting for a year. I think you probably were there when Ashley was there, right?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Because she was the product team coordinator.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Yeah. I was there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. Ashley&#8217;s great, by the way. This is no slight to her.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
She is, she is, she is amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I went through six rounds. And I was so pissed, I was so mad I did not get that interview because after they were doing the consulting, a lot of the consulting I did was around DEI stuff. They were like, &#8220;Yeah, well, how do we get more Black people to work here?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Gee, I don&#8217;t know. How do we get more Black people to work here? I wouldn&#8217;t know anything about that.&#8221; But-</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting that you mentioned that. Actually, one of the last projects I worked on before leaving Vox Media was around their DE and I initiatives. And what we did is revamped it, rebranded it, amplifying voices to make sure that, one, we&#8217;re focusing that message of how we are incorporating more diversity into the work, and then two, making sure that&#8217;s loud and clear too, both internally and externally. And that was a very meaningful project to me. I work with who&#8217;s the head of DE and I. I think he&#8217;s still there, Chris. Very, very inspirational person. And yeah, I think they really took it serious.</p>
<p>But yeah, it is very important to make sure you don&#8217;t just have one type of person in design field and in the tech field in general, and have that opening up for doors for people like me who probably traditionally, we didn&#8217;t get those opportunities/ or I didn&#8217;t even know design was an option really growing up until I started looking. And that was just by happenstance that I ended up in graphic design because, like I said, I was going to go a whole different route. But yeah, I&#8217;m hoping that projects like that continue to open the doors for people who don&#8217;t get those opportunities normally.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I think the person you&#8217;re talking about is Chris Claremont, right?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Yes. Chris Claremont, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And for folks listening, not the X-Men Chris Claremont, though it is spelled the same. But yeah, no, I don&#8217;t think I knew Chris. Chris might have been a little bit after the time that I worked with them, but I do remember, and this was something&#8230; Again, I can talk about this now because the NDA is up, but at the time I remember going in talking with the product team, and they had nothing in terms of diversity and inclusion stuff. They didn&#8217;t even no have a survey, didn&#8217;t know how many people of color worked in the product team. I was like, &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s start there. Let&#8217;s do that first.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
We had our own Slack channel just for the Black people that worked there. And we kept count; we knew exactly. But it was a problem, it was a problem, I have to say that. And I think it took them time to recognize that. Vox Media is one of those companies that, especially because they have Vox, it was one of those progressive companies, you knew, okay, they have these values. And I think what happens with sometimes is that they don&#8217;t see their blind spots. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
It&#8217;s hard because you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, we&#8217;re doing all this great work, we&#8217;re progressive.&#8221; But it&#8217;s like, no, we still have work to do. Just because we&#8217;re pushing these progressive ideas and we&#8217;re moving forward doesn&#8217;t mean we don&#8217;t also have work to do. I think that&#8217;s what we all have to remember no matter where we&#8217;re working, no matter what we&#8217;re doing is that we all have work to do. We still are not where we need to be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. A lot of companies back then during that period, that was a very common thing. Because I think the Clarion call was really starting to go out in the tech community around that time about diversity and inclusion, but in a way that made everyone accountable. You started to see statistics about the percentage of people of color on workforces and things like this, and companies were really trying to find ways to implement different programs or things of that nature to really increase that. Yeah, that was really emblematic of that time. And speaking of which, and not to go too much more, I know we&#8217;ve talked a lot about Vox and I don&#8217;t want to skip this part, right before you left AOL and before you went over to Vox, you started your own studio called Studio Never Sleeps. What made you decide to strike out on your own like that?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
I actually always wanted to be an entrepreneur. And this was a dream that I had from when I was a kid, so it was partially that. It was also partially because I needed some money. Like I said, I grew up poor. I didn&#8217;t have a lot of money growing up. Even after design school, I had bills to pay. I was in debt. I wanted to be more self-sufficient. One thing about being laid off of a job, you realize, oh, nothing&#8217;s permanent, nothing&#8217;s permanent. Nothing&#8217;s really guaranteed unless you build something for yourself. Partially, that was a reaction to that.</p>
<p>And then also, like I said, I really wanted to have my own vision and do things my way. It was a good run where I was doing freelance. I was doing really small projects. After a while, I started building regular clients, I started working on larger projects, on web design. A lot of the projects I was doing back then was web design. And it became a thing. After AOL, I had to find more employment. I ended up working at USA Today as a freelancer under the Studio Never Sleeps moniker, and as a contractor. That was also a very great experience of running a business and having other projects, but it was really great to have one client also that I knew I could count on that continual check. It was something that I&#8217;m grateful for that I took a chance and learned a lot about how to manage books and how to write proposals, how to put together presentation decks. It was hard. It&#8217;s not easy being a freelancer, so I applaud anyone that actually runs a creative agency or runs their own business. But yeah, it&#8217;s still a goal of mine to be able to one day have a fully fledged business and be able to hire people, be able to create opportunities for other people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How was it balancing full-time work and doing these freelance works at your studio?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
it was a lot of working at night. I had a full-time job working at a day, and then meeting with clients at night. I had a business center at my apartment complex, and I would have clients come by, &#8220;I need this logo for this thing.&#8221; And it was crazy, looking back at it. I think I was just hungry. I was a lot younger, and I was like, &#8220;Okay, I can do this. I can stay up. I can do 12-hour days, I can do 15-hour days.&#8221; But it did take a toll. It&#8217;s not easy keeping track of all that stuff and constantly trying to find clients and working around deadlines. But I made it work, just a lot of sleepless nights. That&#8217;s the joke in the name of the-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Of the name, Studio Never Sleeps?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, because I was not sleeping.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. I remember those early days when I had my studio trying to&#8230; I would tell people, &#8220;The great thing about being an entrepreneur is that you always work half days, any 12 hours you want.&#8221; And it&#8217;s true. You sometimes just get so into it. And you&#8217;re doing everything yourself until you manage to get a network or build out a team. It&#8217;s a lot to try to pull together.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Yeah, it is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now you&#8217;re at Wide Eye. Now you&#8217;re doing this great work as an art director. What advice would you give to someone that&#8217;s listening to this, they&#8217;re hearing your story and they want to follow in your example and become an art director? What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Yeah. I would say there&#8217;s no one path to getting to this field, to this job, or even my role specifically. I think a lot of people are trying to&#8230; When they see someone in a place they want to be, they want replicate it exactly. And I would say that there&#8217;s so many routes to this. I think the main thing is dedication to learning and to growing. And when I say learning, I don&#8217;t mean you have to go to design school, I don&#8217;t mean you have to go on online and look up tutorials. There&#8217;s so many different ways, whether it&#8217;s a bootcamp, whether you&#8217;re just drawing and teaching yourself or you&#8217;re just playing around on free design programs like I did. Some of the best designers I know didn&#8217;t go to design school. Some of the best designers I know went to graduate school, or some of the designers I know we&#8217;re doing something totally different before they decided design was their passion. There&#8217;s no one road.</p>
<p>And I think that can be freeing a little bit because to know that you can carve your own path is, for me at least, I think a great thing to know, that you don&#8217;t have to do this one way. You don&#8217;t have to go to design school and then go intern at this agency, and then get this child at AOL. No, you don&#8217;t have to do all that, you can start today and decide you want to be a designer. Or if you want to shift careers, you can do that and start. I think the most important thing is starting and being humble and saying, &#8220;Okay, I have to learn,&#8221; and being happy to learn.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of your influences for your creative work? Who inspires you?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
I would say a guy I work with, Alex Medina, he is a super talented creative director. We work together at Vox Media. I love his work. A lot of people that I went to design school with or art school with are working artists now, and their work is amazing. I really love just seeing what&#8217;s coming up. There&#8217;s a young designer, Josiah, who&#8217;s been doing a lot of stuff for music industry, album art. I love seeing that type of stuff. I gather an inspiration from all the up and coming designers, people who are just hungry and willing to try something different and new. And so that gives me a lot of energy and makes me want to just do something different.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
At this stage of where you&#8217;re at in your career, when you look back over the past 10 years from Corcoran to AOL to Vox to now, do you feel creatively satisfied?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a hard question. I think yes and no. Yes, I feel satisfied that I&#8217;m able to create and I&#8217;m able to express myself and solve these creative problems, but I think part of being an artist or a designer is a little bit of that never feeling completely satisfied. You&#8217;re always like, &#8220;There&#8217;s more that I could do. There&#8217;s another level I can reach.&#8221;<br>
I think about painters who&#8217;ve painted the same subject over and over again but never really feel they&#8217;ve captured the essence of it. That&#8217;s how I feel like. I&#8217;m satisfied in the moment of creating, but after it&#8217;s done, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, what&#8217;s the next thing?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want the next chapter of your story to look like?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
At this stage, I really want to continue growing as a design leader and helping the next generation of designers grow and find their own creative voices and become the best that they can be. And I really want to keep putting out great work. I want to make a positive difference in the world. That&#8217;s something I truly believe in. It&#8217;s one of the reasons I&#8217;m at Wide Eye is because they, all of them, everyone that works there truly believes in design for good. And I think that&#8217;s where I want to be. I want to keep doing design that will be a positive net good on the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
victorware, so that&#8217;s just my name, first and last name,.co. Don&#8217;t go to.com. That&#8217;s that&#8217;s a software company that I&#8217;m still trying to get the domain for. But yeah, that will have all my portfolio and links to my socials. That&#8217;s where you find me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Victor Ware, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
Thank you, Maurice. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Thank you really for just sharing your journey and design. It&#8217;s always good to see people&#8217;s progression and how they&#8217;ve gotten to where they are. That&#8217;s in part why the show is called Revision Path is to show the different sorts of ways that people can get to where they are, and so that&#8217;s why we have people from all over the industry. And I think it&#8217;s really important for folks to see how your hard work has paid off over the years, even starting your own studio and doing this while juggling the 9:00 to 5:00. I can see at each level of your story how you&#8217;ve progressed to get to where you are now, so I think it&#8217;ll be really exciting to see where you are in the next five years, see if you get to that point.</p>
<p><b>Victor Ware:</b><br>
I appreciate it. Yeah, it would be great to check in five years from now just and see where I&#8217;m at. But yeah, I appreciate talking with me today. This was a really great conversation.</p>

<p>There are so many options these days when it comes to learning how to code, but which is the best one for you? We all learn in different ways, and software engineer and educator Brandon Campbell-Kearns is just the person to help unlock what you need to succeed!</p>
<p>We spent the first part of our conversation on his business <a href="https://www.quarterlylearnings.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Quarterly Learnings</a>, including his current web development course through Atlanta nonprofit <a href="https://cityofrefugeatl.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">City of Refuge</a>. Brandon also talked to me about how first got into tech, and about how his stints teaching in Guatemala and Korea, as well as here in Atlanta at General Assembly and The Home Depot, helped guide him towards his current work. He even shared some great advice about breaking away from tying a job to your self-worth &#8212; something I think a lot of people can learn from during this current time.</p>
<p>For Brandon, understanding what lights him up has given him the drive to succeed. (Well, that and some lion&#8217;s mane mushrooms.) I hope this interview helps get you on the right track to finding your spark!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
My name is Brandon Campbell-Kearns, and I really like to teach. And mostly software engineering. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing lately, so that&#8217;s what I am. I&#8217;m an educator and a software engineer, a hybrid.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. How has this year been going for you So far?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
So far so good. Coming up on halfway, feeling good about it, learning a lot about myself through this year, but for sure, really, really enjoying 2023.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you say, when you look back at this time last year, how would you say that you&#8217;ve maybe grown and improved? Have you noticed anything?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Yeah, I think so. A lot of change has taken place. I think the biggest thing is self-reliance. And that does not mean a hyper independence where I don&#8217;t need anyone else, but more so jettisoning, previous dependencies that were helpful but not necessarily required in order for me to thrive and be my best self.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Jettisoning dependency, it sounds very much like what a software engineer would say.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Right, I totally outed myself, didn&#8217;t I? Yeah. It&#8217;s either like, yeah, I&#8217;m a software engineer or a pilot, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If you don&#8217;t mind me diving into that, what are some of those things you&#8217;ve kind of like jettisoned?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Totally. So I&#8217;m going to zoom out just a little bit to answer that. So growing up, I was a pleasure to have in class, as they say, you know what I mean? So a lot of my self-worth, I&#8217;ve outsourced into that progress report comment like, &#8220;Oh, how is he doing over this past nine weeks?&#8221; This is not unique to me. I think a lot of us had that experience, and then it&#8217;s like, okay, so my whole identity is being a good student at that point.</p>
<p>When I got into the workforce, it just became a paid version of that. So it&#8217;s like, oh, a pleasure to have in class turned into 2.5% increase or 3% increase and some shares or whatever it is. Now, am I upset about the incentives for working? Not at all. It&#8217;s just that for me, I knew that I was following that same trajectory that had already been blazed in grade school, and I needed to divorce myself from that cycle unless the entirety of my self-worth be wrapped up in my salary, and I did not want that feeling, and I did not like that feeling.</p>
<p>So this is something that I don&#8217;t tend to make very rash choices. I think about things for a long time, and I observe them for a long time to make sure that the patterns I&#8217;m observing are in fact correlated and not causations or the other way around causations and not correlations. So saying all that to say, in the past year, I left a job that was on paper, a great job, and even in practice a great job, but it was thus far, the zenith, the peak of that pattern that I was talking about of tying my self-worth to the prestige and the title and the salary.</p>
<p>Obviously, well, it&#8217;s not obvious, but to me it&#8217;s obvious. I was enjoying the work, but I wasn&#8217;t enjoying how I was viewing myself through the work. So I left the job in order to create my own thing. I got a little tired, Maurice, of getting paid the same no matter what I did. And I understand people hearing this, might think that that is an ungrateful thing to say or a privileged thing to say, but for me, I know what I&#8217;m working with and it&#8217;s like already having that foundation of maybe a bit of entitlement that I wanted to work through. So I&#8217;m actually using my career as a means of working through that. Because I mean, there&#8217;s nothing else. Not like there&#8217;s some other part of my life. My career is a part of my life, so there&#8217;s no way it doesn&#8217;t affect those cycles, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When did you decide to leave your job? Was this last year?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Yes. It was May 13th of 2022.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
So to circle back, those are the dependencies I was referencing, the sort of emotional dependencies that I&#8217;m jettisoning. And now it&#8217;s depending on me, my output. So currently, if I don&#8217;t have a contract after June, I won&#8217;t have money after June, and that is definitely much harder. But it&#8217;s also, it&#8217;s exciting to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It gives you something to strive for.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Correct. Instead of waiting on a cycle that is outside of me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s talk about what you&#8217;re doing now, which you know said you started your own company. It&#8217;s called Quarterly Learnings. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Yeah, Quarterly Learnings. Yeah, so it&#8217;s for sure a play on the&#8230; Very much related now that I think about it to what I was just talking about. So the idea of a quarterly earnings report or call that companies have, there&#8217;s one angle there, but it&#8217;s meant to be an appeal to that way of thinking. But we should now think about what we&#8217;re learning every quarter, what new capabilities do we have as an organization or also as an individual. And I think we should put just as much energy, I could even argue for more into learning in our organization as we do into the finances and the financial reports, et cetera.</p>
<p>So I created Quarterly Learnings because I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time with various organizations building out either internal learning organizations or actually just hosting and teaching workshops there. So I figured that I would create a business to wrap the freelance work that I do there around. So that&#8217;s what Quarterly Learnings is all about. For me it is a personal thing because it&#8217;s related to that, those cycles I talked to you about before, but also I know it can have an impact because I&#8217;ve seen it happen with the dozens of workshops that I&#8217;ve run at across organizations in industry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has business been going?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Just getting started. Really good for just getting started. Currently teaching a class at a nonprofit here in Atlanta, which is really fun. So so far, business really just kind of looks exactly like the work I was doing before, meaning still teaching, but doing it in a company, with a big difference being now I have to send invoices and everything I do is representative of the business. There&#8217;s no one I can point to for like, &#8220;Hey, this is your fault.&#8221; Or, &#8220;I would like to have this.&#8221; It&#8217;s really, everything&#8217;s on me. The next client that I get will be because of either my past work or something I did to get them. So of course that&#8217;s a challenge.</p>
<p>But so far, so far it&#8217;s been good. I&#8217;ve also, with the name Quarterly Learnings and also just by choice, I&#8217;ve been able to also have a bit of a consulting arm. For example, there&#8217;s one client I have who wants to learn a little bit more about how to modernize an organization he&#8217;s working with. So I&#8217;m putting that under the same umbrella. So it&#8217;s not just teaching on a workshop level. It&#8217;s also a consulting component for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you mentioned this nonprofit and this other business. What are the best kinds of businesses or clients for you to work with?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s a good question. I really like the idea of working with this very small organization who needs to have someone in their organization be multi-dimensional. For example, we could take the example of Home Depot. I know we haven&#8217;t quite gotten to talking about OrangeMethod yet, but that pattern is something I&#8217;d want to scale. For example, someone works at let&#8217;s say a retail store or a call center, and that person or that department may be about to undergo a reorganization or a restructure in layman&#8217;s terms, people are going to lose their jobs, but if they re-skill or have a new skill, then the value that they can provide to the organization evolves with their skills. So I like being able to stand in that gap and imbue those people who might otherwise not be useful to the company with a new set of skills that they can use to add value to their lives and also the company.</p>
<p>So for me, an ideal client is someone who has that problem, whether that is a large organization or just for example, a local law firm that has a few, let&#8217;s say, paralegals that they don&#8217;t need, but they do need some technology infrastructure to be built out. So let&#8217;s teach those paralegals then how to do that. Now they have both skills and the job that they may not have had since the organization needed to reallocate its capital.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m looking around on your website now. I see you&#8217;re on YouTube, you&#8217;re on TikTok. You have a podcast, and I want to get into the social media part in a bit, but tell me about the podcast. How does that sort of work along with what you&#8217;re doing?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Yeah, totally. So the Quarterly Learnings Podcast. A lot of people ask me, what do you like to do outside of work? But I really honestly am obsessed with the idea of learning a new skill, mostly because I think, or I know that learning how to code changed my life, and I did not have experience with software prior to learning. So I really like preaching that gospel and talking about that so that others can maybe have a similar experience.</p>
<p>So so far, I&#8217;ve interviewed people either about learning or organizations that they&#8217;ve been in who have learning as a primary focus. What I&#8217;m doing now is starting to interview my students, a couple of my students in the class so that I can hear about their actual day-to-day learning experience with me as an instructor. That&#8217;s not necessarily the focus, but it is interesting to me to see.</p>
<p>I think that especially with technology, it&#8217;s not the same instructor learner relationship that we&#8217;re used to in, I would say, traditional education. So I really like being able to have conversations with my students that may not focus specifically on the technical components, but more on the emotional work that&#8217;s required to learn a new skill like software engineering. So yeah, that&#8217;s where I see the podcast going. We&#8217;re still in early days, but it&#8217;s so much fun. Shout out to you for doing this for so long. It&#8217;s so much work. Especially, I&#8217;m pretty sure starting out you were kind of doing everything and that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m at now. Soon I&#8217;ll have a team like you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, starting out, I mean, I think it&#8217;s a lot different to start a podcast now than it was 10 years ago. I&#8217;ll just put it that way.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
That&#8217;s so true.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think you&#8217;re on anchor, right? You&#8217;re using Anchor?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, Anchor didn&#8217;t exist back then. If you started a podcast, you put it out and there were a handful of audio hosts. I think I&#8217;ve been using the same audio host for 10 years now, Simplecast, but there were a handful of audio hosts. But the learning curve now. To start your own show is really easy. I think as long as you have a Spotify account, you can start a podcast. It&#8217;s not a big step to start making your own content that way.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true. Yeah, exactly. And for me, the biggest step was, to your point, not at all the technical stuff with, any of the hosting or logistics. It was completely behavioral. Like, yep. Just do it. You know the ideas. You&#8217;ve even written out the scripts. You have some guests, all right, let&#8217;s send some emails.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Send emails, and then get the timing together. And it takes a while at least, I think when I did it took a while to finally get into a good rhythm.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Because the industry matured as my show went on. And so there were always new microphones, new scheduling tools, new this, new that, and you just try to find what works for your schedule because it&#8217;s so easy to just try to hop on whatever the newest thing is. I&#8217;ve used roughly the same setup for the past, I want to say five years. I haven&#8217;t really changed it a whole lot. Because I finally found something that was like, this is bulletproof whether I&#8217;m at home, on the road, whatever, this is what I&#8217;m going to use. Because there&#8217;s newer things that have come out, but I&#8217;m just like, no, but this works, so I&#8217;m going to use what works.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Are you talking from an equipment standpoint or from hosting or just all of it?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All of it. All of it.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
I love that. You know why I love that? Because it&#8217;s so easy to get caught up in the hype cycle of having the latest, and I think I observe this a lot with my students. Like, &#8220;I have to learn the latest framework.&#8221; Or even in life, like, &#8220;Oh, I need the latest car or a pair of shoes or whatever.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, maybe, maybe.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s more important to me, I like to think about this idea of levels versus resonance, so kind of like a scaler scale up and down compared to one that&#8217;s rooted in a frequency that aligns with you. Because one suggests you have to get to the next level, and, maybe, but it&#8217;s usually those levels are externally defined, I found for most people. But if you&#8217;re thinking about resonance, then it&#8217;s like wherever you are, whatever the actual value is, you can resonate at that place as long as you accept what&#8217;s happening. So it&#8217;s like, okay, this equipment is working for me. What would be the point to change it? Unless I was trying to keep up with something outside of me, but you&#8217;re not, you&#8217;re running your own race.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s one thing, and we&#8217;ll get to talking more about you and your work, but yeah, that&#8217;s one thing where especially doing a podcast, because there are so many podcasts out there now, you try to do what you think other people want. You try to model your show and you try to maybe do a certain release schedule or do a certain social media push or something to try to attract the audience that you think you want to have. Instead, you have to focus on the audience that you already have and making those your rabid fans because those are going to be the ones that will talk about your show on your behalf when you&#8217;re not there.</p>
<p>In my early days, I know I spent a lot of time trying to do, and that&#8217;s not to say this is a bad thing to do, I think it is still a good thing to do for beginning podcasters, but I remember reaching out to a lot of podcasters in the beginning, particularly other design podcasters and getting nothing, no response or getting a negative response. Because also I&#8217;m Black doing this and there&#8217;s not many, I don&#8217;t think I was the only Black person, but I certainly was one of few. So I was not getting a lot of good feedback from trying to reach out to other people to collaborate or maybe exchange guests or stuff like that.</p>
<p>It just wasn&#8217;t happening because of the one, I think because of the purpose of the show, and two, it was just a different time back then. I don&#8217;t think people realize back in 2015 how vehemently racist it was in the tech industry. Especially with trying to do something along with tech media. It was just people are like, &#8220;Why are you talking? Why are you even saying anything?&#8221; And I guess you would say now it&#8217;s a different story, but I don&#8217;t know, culture changes and society changes in such interesting ways. I feel like in a way there&#8217;s a bit of regression over the past year as it relates to some DEI. I&#8217;m using that in air quotes, but that sort of stuff. It&#8217;s been interesting. But yeah, it&#8217;s easy to try to model what you think is going to be the thing that will make you big as opposed to just focusing on getting better at exactly what it is that you&#8217;re already doing.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Right. Dialing in. Dialing in on your own deal. Yeah. That&#8217;s good. I like that a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has social media helped with your business? I know you&#8217;re, like you said, doing the podcast, but you&#8217;re also on YouTube, you&#8217;re streaming on Twitch. You&#8217;re on TikTok. How does social media help out with your business?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Right now, to be upfront, I haven&#8217;t gotten any direct leads from social media, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that it hasn&#8217;t helped with the business because in this case, as of right now, I am the business. So any sort of either validation or feedback or engagement I get with anything I put out online is helpful to me because I use it as input.</p>
<p>So for example, on my Twitch stream, I&#8217;ve gotten feedback about very tiny things like, &#8220;Hey, this audio sounds weird,&#8221; or &#8220;The way this is laid out makes it hard to see.&#8221; And even one of my students last week told me about how I had my OBS scene laid out and how it would be better if I had a smaller headshot of myself so they could see more of the code and they would also like to see what is happening there. So those sort of things are helpful because that really is the work. It&#8217;s presenting information. So any feedback around that is really helpful.</p>
<p>So those are auxiliary pieces of feedback that lend themselves to the point when someone will see a piece of content I&#8217;ve put out and say, &#8220;Hey, oh, okay, yeah, we could use that. We&#8217;d like to work with you to have a workshop on X, Y, Z.&#8221; Let&#8217;s say React for example, or how to do Flexbox in our layouts.</p>
<p>By the way, I&#8217;m not at all threatened by the prospect of them being able to just ask an AI assistant or chatbot or anything like that about how to do that, because that&#8217;s very possible these days and I think it&#8217;s a great thing. The thing that I provide is context within the given work stream. In other words, I can create a custom either curriculum or build out a prototype with a team that sure, an AI could do, but it requires a lot more custom work and inputs to the chatbots to make this work. It&#8217;s really difficult to replicate the in-class instruction experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m curious about that because we&#8217;ve seen AI really, I think, enter the mainstream over these past nine months. And one application that I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people using it for is for coding. You can tell ChatGPT to write you a function or write a program, and the code that it spits out is decent, I guess. I&#8217;m not a coder, but from what I&#8217;ve seen, the code looks decent. Have you found that to be an impediment to teaching, or does that help out with what you&#8217;re doing?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
It really depends on the student. So I saw someone in my class using ChatGPT, and I love it except for the fact that they were using it to kind of check the box to paste like, &#8220;Oh, I asked it how to do this and it did it. I&#8217;ll paste it in and submit my homework.&#8221; That is not the best way for a human to use ChatGPT to learn something. If you just needed that capability, that&#8217;s exactly what you should do. Okay, it does what I want to do, but this person, they&#8217;re in the classroom to gain the capability themselves. So in that instance, still ChatGPT is not a threat to me, it&#8217;s a tool that I can use to help this person best navigate the information. So you still have to know where to put the things.</p>
<p>So for example, if we were carpenters, it&#8217;s true that here&#8217;s all this wood, here&#8217;s some nails, here&#8217;s some hammers, and here&#8217;s a saw. Let&#8217;s say those are the raw materials. That&#8217;s everything you need to build, for example, an Adirondack chair. I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m thinking of those, but if you don&#8217;t know either A, what that is, or B, anything about let&#8217;s say perspective or what the actual client wants and how to turn a set of requirements into an output, then having all that information or that raw material is not going to be as helpful to you. And then of course I have other students who use it well. Like, &#8220;Hey, introduce me to this new concept, this new framework that I understand the,&#8221; let&#8217;s say, CSS, for example, &#8220;I understand CSS, but I don&#8217;t quite know how to use Tailwind as an example.&#8221; ChatGPT can help you get there to remove some of the, let&#8217;s say, boilerplate and get you right to being able to interpret what its output is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s like a good partner almost, but not a replacement.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Exactly. It&#8217;s your partner. It&#8217;s your, truly an assistant is how I&#8217;m seeing it. Now, is it true that there are some who might have overvalued the commodity of writing particular pieces of software? Yeah. So to me, software is a very much a humanistic in person to person game, and I understand that that might seem counterintuitive because it happens on the computer, but usually we build software with other people and for other people. So if there&#8217;s not a human input, there&#8217;s not going to be a very humanistic output.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Gotcha. Now you&#8217;re teaching both online and offline. I saw that you started back teaching in person in February this year. Tell me more about that. You said it&#8217;s with an Atlanta nonprofit?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Yeah, so it&#8217;s with this nonprofit in Bankhead called City of Refuge. And what I&#8217;m doing now is in the middle, we&#8217;re about halfway through a 16-week cohort folks who don&#8217;t have any software experience at all, and they are, through a Department of Labor grant, able to attend this course at no out-of-pocket cost to them for 16 weeks every day, Monday through Friday, nine to four, and we&#8217;ll build four projects. The traditional bootcamp model, we&#8217;ll build a few projects, they&#8217;ll have the skills. As you may know, there&#8217;s no tests or anything to take for software engineering. So I&#8217;m viewing it as, of course there&#8217;s the skills component, but you also have to know how to market yourself in order to be successful.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good course, a good group of people. I&#8217;ve got about 18, 19 students right now, which is sort of a big class, but I&#8217;ve got two TAs who are fantastic, so they&#8217;re really helpful as well, and it&#8217;s just really fun to be back in my zone. I&#8217;ve taught online before, and it&#8217;s good because it&#8217;s easy to put people into breakout rooms. I have a little mini keyboard here that I can play in the meantime where we&#8217;re having transitions or if I want some sound effects. That&#8217;s really fun. Having said that, it does require me to be in this room or some room for an extended period of time, eight hours. That&#8217;s also true in person, but at least I can walk around the room, see what folks are doing, interact with folks, smell breath, that kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Not smell breath.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
It&#8217;s an important part of the experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do your students teach you?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
I think they don&#8217;t believe me when I tell them that I&#8217;m consistently learning. Even though I&#8217;ve been doing this for a little bit of time, coming up on eight years, I learn every single lesson, whether it&#8217;s a tiny nuance in the code or whether it&#8217;s some perspective about the code that they have that I just don&#8217;t, always learn it from them.</p>
<p>One of the biggest things I think is every single person has a different proclivity to dealing with discomfort. Some people have a hunger for it. Some people have an immense aversion to it. Some people are neutral. They&#8217;re like, no, it&#8217;s uncomfortable, but they don&#8217;t want to do anything about the discomfort. It&#8217;s fascinating for every single person that, let&#8217;s say, coefficient or that value is different. So for me, the fun part is seeing the different ways to navigate that, because regardless of the person, there&#8217;s for sure a moment where you have to face the feeling of, I don&#8217;t know what is going on here. This is such a new thing to me that I don&#8217;t know what it is. So dealing with that is fascinating to observe.</p>
<p>So I get to see different perspectives on how to deal with, in some senses, it&#8217;s conflict. In some senses, it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t want to use the word inadequacy because it has a risk of sounding like they&#8217;re inadequate, but the feeling of, I don&#8217;t know this and I want to, could be handled in infinite number of ways. That&#8217;s the thing I learned. It&#8217;s the different approaches to that and where I fall on that spectrum within things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s kind of switch gears here a little bit and kind of learn more about you. I feel like we&#8217;re of course learning more just through you talking about how you teach, but I&#8217;m curious to get your origin story. Are you originally from Atlanta?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
No, I am from North Carolina. I was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, near what some people might recognize, Fayetteville for Fort Bragg, and then I moved to Charlotte, North Carolina when I was five, and then spent my whole childhood in North Carolina.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Were you interested in tech as a kid? Was that something your parents have tried to get you into?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
I had an interest for sure. So my grandma used to take me to computer expos as a kid. She was also my first AIM buddy. It&#8217;s really wild. She&#8217;s way ahead of the curve. So that&#8217;s what really got me interested in the idea of gadgets as a toy. Just learning about really just the interfaces. Wow, you can do this from nothing. It was really a whole new way to be interactive. Because up until then, it was just the TV and the radio and maybe let&#8217;s say an Etch A Sketch or a Lite-Brite for interfaces that you could modify and having something different happen.</p>
<p>So the computer was nuts to me because it&#8217;s like you get online, you click on something and then there&#8217;s some other information, and then when Limewire was popping, it&#8217;s like, oh, I can get music. So that was always really an interesting thing to me, but I was never a practitioner. I was always kind of a power user. When I tell people that I didn&#8217;t have any tech experience before I learned how to code, it&#8217;s true. But I was very, very familiar with the interface, like the computer itself. Itself was not foreign to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you eventually went to college at UNC Chapel Hill. What was your time like when you were there?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Yeah, it was good. No, still no coding. I took a little visual basic class in high school, but at the time, honestly, I got turned off from the profession because, it wasn&#8217;t the work, it just didn&#8217;t feel like it was for me. You know what I&#8217;m saying? It just didn&#8217;t line up. I didn&#8217;t see anybody who I felt was cool doing it. Not to disparage anyone, but there was a lot of neck beard energy, if you get what I&#8217;m saying.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I get what you&#8217;re saying.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
And it just didn&#8217;t feel like it was for me. So I took a long, long hiatus, pivoting to college. I did nothing related to software there. I studied political science and Hispanic studies. That period of four years was, for me, I was continuing to chase prestige that I alluded to earlier. So I went from everything from a major standpoint, I transitioned all over the place.</p>
<p>First I wanted to be a business student, then I wanted to be pre-med. Then I wanted to do the pre-law thing. Really what I wanted was prestige. I wanted a good answer to, &#8220;What do you do?&#8221; And by good, I was not defining what good was. I was letting that be something that I perceived other people would say is good. I&#8217;m saying all this to let folks know that that&#8217;s not a good carrot to chase in my view, in my experience. Chasing after prestige in how other people might respond to what your job is a bad, bad journey. In my opinion. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s people who have done it and are doing it and it&#8217;s working out for. I&#8217;m just after a different thing, that internal resonance more so than external comparisons and validations.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, it&#8217;s bad. It&#8217;s bad. I can say that. No, I mean, and the reason that I say that is because, and you probably have seen this too, there was certainly a time, I would say this time maybe is still going on, but certainly I think within the past 10 years, there has been this really big push to try to get kids to learn how to code. And that&#8217;s not to say these are bad programs. Shout out to Sure. Black Girls Code. I think there&#8217;s a Black Boys Code, all this stuff too. But those are good platforms because what it does is it at least gives them exposure to it to see if this is something that they would like to do or they would like to go into.</p>
<p>But the problem comes when it gets pushed on them to this point where it&#8217;s like you have to do this as a means of improving your life, getting generational wealth, uplifting the race. I&#8217;m probably taking a little bit too far by saying that, but these were the kinds of arguments at some point that a lot of people were pushing towards getting into tech. It was less about, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m doing this because I love programming, or I love building things,&#8221; but it&#8217;s like, &#8220;I&#8217;m doing this to be the next mega capitalist or something.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
That&#8217;s exactly correct. I agree with you big time. I am team learn about software and technology and computing because it helps you to think and because it helps you to navigate the world that we&#8217;re in. It&#8217;s almost like if you&#8217;re a fisherman, you better understand at least a little bit about fluid dynamics because the way the water works and is this saltwater, is this freshwater? How are the fish going to behave? You can&#8217;t become a fish, but you can understand as much as you can about the environment that you&#8217;re trying to navigate in.</p>
<p>To me, software is like that, and I agree about the pressure that we might be putting on some kids. It just changes from, let&#8217;s say, oh, nuts that I&#8217;m old enough to say generation to generation and be able to reflect on another one. But when I was coming up, it was kind of similar, like, oh, he&#8217;s smart. People would love to be like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m living with you when I get older.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, can I get a place first? So, yeah, I 100% feel you about the pressure we might be putting on kids to learn to code as a means of changing the narrative.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s true that it&#8217;s possible, but to me it&#8217;s way more interesting to look internally and see how we might be able to change our own personal narrative. And then what actually resonates with people is seeing someone who&#8217;s operating in their own frequency, who&#8217;s in their lane, that&#8217;s attractive, and then you&#8217;re marketable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So while you were in school, you mentioned sort of bopping around and trying out these different sort of fields. I saw that you talked for a bit in Guatemala while you were in school. What was that like?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Yeah. Totally. It was cool. Just a short little two week trip. So I knew Spanish and this organization called Safe Passage, where the first week it was just immersive doubling down on our language learning. So I knew the language, but not in a native tongue way. So worked with the tutor for a week, and then the next week we were at a school, an organization called Safe Passage, like I said, had a school in this neighborhood that we would go to and teach the kids daily. It was really nice.</p>
<p>I think that was one of my early formal teaching experiences, and I kind of fell in love with the idea of it being an impactful thing. I think it&#8217;s pretty clear that teaching is something that has the opportunity to really impact someone&#8217;s life, but in that case, and especially with it being my first introduction to it, to me that became the primary reason to teach. It was because I knew that I was having, while it was very short and only a week long, I knew for sure that I was having an impact on these kids&#8217; lives. Well, mostly because by the end of the week, they were crying that I had, that we were leaving.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Yeah. So that to me, shifted what education mean or what meant, or what being a teacher meant. It&#8217;s like, you&#8217;re not just up there passing the time. You&#8217;re having a big impact on this person&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>And I still bring that with me today, which is why I think it&#8217;s especially what I do on a day-to-day basis, teaching folks how to write software. The information&#8217;s out there. It&#8217;s not about me telling you what to do. It&#8217;s more about me observing you on this journey and get using my experience to say, &#8220;Hey, the way you&#8217;re approaching this might not be sustainable for your continued learning.&#8221; Or usually it will be some sort of a technical thing. But to me, I over-index on the, what some might call the soft skills or the emotional components of learning. But Guatemala was great, so I get a little excited when we start to talk about teaching because I go right to that. But to answer your question, Guatemala is a fantastic time. Would love to go back. Anybody&#8217;s going, I recommend visiting Lake Atitlan, and there&#8217;s a volcano not far called Volcan Pacaya, lovely. Walking next to lava, just underneath your feet. Absolutely crazy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Lava underneath your feet. Not actual molten lava?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Actual lava to where you can&#8217;t touch it. To where my little hiking shoes were getting warm.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh my God.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Yeah. It was a little nuts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s a little nuts.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
But it was a big exercise in trust. Because the people who were taking us up, I saw people coming down. I saw people going up. So I&#8217;m like, all right, if hope it works out. It&#8217;s cool when they do it&#8217;s a problem when I do it situation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, after you graduated, you also taught in Korea for a year?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
I did.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So how was that experience? Was it sort of similar to Guatemala?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Yeah, it was very different from Guatemala. For me, I thought it would be easy because I was teaching English, and I knew and still know English. I like to think I speak English pretty well, but teaching English is not the same as speaking English I learned real fast. Because my students, they were kind of like expert students, if I can be honest. They were in school all day, probably similar hours to our students here. And then after that, I worked at what&#8217;s called the Hagwon, which is a private academy.</p>
<p>So from 4:00 PM to 10:00 PM I had students. So in three hour sessions, four to seven was the what would be equivalent to elementary school over here, students, and then 7 to 10 were the high school students that I had. So they were used to having those Hagwons after school every day, the private academies, whether it&#8217;s math or maybe software engineering or computer science or English in my case, or there&#8217;s physical fitness ones as well. So they knew what they wanted out of an instructor, and they knew how to be model students. So they also shared that information with me. Very critical of the teaching.</p>
<p>Not in a bad way. At first, it kind of rubbed me the wrong way, but then I realized, oh, this is feedback to use and grow from. Just because they&#8217;re 11 years old doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t listen and learn from what they&#8217;re saying. I wasn&#8217;t thinking this then, but in hindsight, they&#8217;re customers that are giving me feedback about the product, which is my countenance in class. So it was very hard.</p>
<p>But since I had a year, it allowed me to have periods where I could reflect on my growth. I was not as self-aware then as I am now. And I think there&#8217;ll be a point in the future where I will be more self-aware than I am now. So at the time, I wasn&#8217;t able to clearly reflect on it as I can now, but I do know that I was able to, since I had a year, use that period as a time for growth. Even if I wasn&#8217;t aware of the growth, it&#8217;s still happening.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;ve actually had a couple of people on the show that have taught English in Korea. I think the last person I had on the show was, I&#8217;m going to butcher her name&#8230;Matshoshi [Matsafu]. I&#8217;m going to butcher her name. But I did have someone on the show last year.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
A few episodes back?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, a few episodes back that she&#8217;s currently at Microsoft and lives in Minneapolis, I want to say. But she taught English in Korea as well. Did you want to stay after you had done your year? Did you want to stay there?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Yeah, I did. I even considered going back once I came home. But here&#8217;s the reality. I&#8217;ve never said this out loud. I don&#8217;t know what happened, but I got fired at the very, very end of my contract.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Which, if I could just have a brief aside, I&#8217;m so hyped for myself that I felt feel comfortable just saying that without hiding it. Because I really still have no idea. And even, I wish I could know, it was 10 years ago, it was like a week or so before my contract, and they fired me. I have no idea why. I later found out some maybe not great things were happening at the Hagwon I was working at, that particular location, but I don&#8217;t have any ill will towards any of them. I&#8217;m just answering the question. I did want to stay and even considered going back, but once I got here to Atlanta, it was like, oh, well, maybe we could do something else. Let&#8217;s actually get a set of skills that&#8217;s a little more concrete. Let&#8217;s add to this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you left Korea, came back here.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Was kicked out of Korea.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Was kicked out of Korea, sorry. What brought you to Atlanta? Why I go back to North Carolina?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Right, totally. Okay. So here&#8217;s the true story. I was looking to for flights back, and the flight back to LaGuardia was something like $60 less than the one back to Raleigh in North Carolina. So I had an aunt that lived there, so I just called her. I was like, &#8220;Hey, I don&#8217;t want to go right back to North Carolina. Can I just kick it with you for a while?&#8221; So I lived with her for a year in the tri-state area, in Bergen County, New Jersey. And from the outside, that period would look like I wasn&#8217;t doing anything. For me, a lot was taking place.</p>
<p>Up until then, my identity was, like we talked about before, was being a student. My identity was that cyclical nine week he&#8217;s a pleasure to have in class a feedback loop. And I didn&#8217;t know what life was like outside of that. And even as a teacher in Korea, it was about giving that feedback, &#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re doing great.&#8221; And then experiencing life inside of an institution. That&#8217;s really what it was. Not to say to disparage that idea, I think the word institution might be loaded, but it&#8217;s the truth. I was still a part of a school.</p>
<p>So I needed a period of time where I was not that. I needed a break from that, and I really just needed nothing going on. So that&#8217;s what that year was for me. I was working in a restaurant, just trying to figure things out, become an adult. It&#8217;s my first time other than Korea being on my own, but also outside of, like I said before, an institution. Good year. For me that year is probably about detaching from needing others for every single thing. More about learning how to be independent.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So why Atlanta?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
I came to Atlanta because my sister lived here and still does. And I realized that I hadn&#8217;t spent that much time with my niece and nephew, and they were, let&#8217;s see, they were five and eight at the time. So made another phone call after a year in New Jersey and was like, &#8220;Hey, thinking of moving down to Atlanta, can I stay with you?&#8221; So she was like, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She was on board. So I&#8217;m so so grateful for her for that year. I lived with her for about a year, and during that time I got a job teaching English online to Koreans. Not the same group, but this time it was online. So it&#8217;s on the phone 10 minutes at a time.</p>
<p>And that was when I said, &#8220;Wait a minute, I&#8217;m spending a lot of time online. Why can&#8217;t I be a person who is responsible for creating experiences online? What would that look like?&#8221; Because sometimes you visit a website and it makes you feel stuff, which is nuts to think about. I was like, oh, I want to be a purveyor of those emotions, or at least have the skills to do so. So I started to try to teach myself how to code through Code Academy and other things. I even have a notebook that I try to take notes in, but I quickly learned it&#8217;s not a humanities profession. You have to actually learn by doing, I should say. And after being a little bit frustrated with the experience for me working in restaurants and kind of wanted my own place and all these sorts of things, I finally decided to enroll in a bootcamp called General Assembly. And that&#8217;s when I finally had a career that I felt empowered by.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You were at General Assembly for a while, the one down at Ponce City Market, right?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
At Ponce, yeah. So I took the course for a year, the boot camp, excuse me, not for a year, for 12 weeks at the boot camp. And then I almost immediately started working there as a TA for the front end web development course because, one, I knew I had teaching experience and I had the suspicion that teaching web development would make me better at it, and I was correct. So yeah, I did work there for a couple years on and off doing sessions even after I had already started working at Home Depot.</p>
<p>Which I was talking about this with one of my current students last week, and they were like, &#8220;Well, why did you keep working when you had already gotten your software engineering job? Why were you working two jobs?&#8221; And in some senses the answer is, well, that&#8217;s what I was used to. Having to work two jobs in order to keep things going. So that was still part of my psyche, my DNA, of like, okay, well, we got to keep working. That wasn&#8217;t the case from a need standpoint, I would say there wasn&#8217;t a financial gap, but it&#8217;s just what I liked to do. That&#8217;s how it became clear to me, oh, you just like teaching. That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re doing it even when you don&#8217;t need to do it.</p>
<p>And even my manager at the time was like, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need this job. Why are you doing six extra hours a week in person of teaching?&#8221;. But it&#8217;s really because I liked it and at the time, it wasn&#8217;t obvious obvious to me, but it&#8217;s clear to me now that this is really what I&#8217;m about. Especially when I&#8217;m teaching in person, when I&#8217;m engaged with a person, and at any point on their learning journey, I get so excited because it really is like, you know how you see people on stage like a hypnotist and they&#8217;re watching somebody&#8217;s brain just evolve and their physical behavior and all that changes because of what that person is talking to them about or navigating them through? That&#8217;s how it feels for me. Like I am watching a state change in somebody&#8217;s brain take place in real time, and it&#8217;s fascinating.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice, nice. So after your time at General Assembly, you went on to work for The Home Depot for a few years, and you taught there as well. You were a founding instructor for their kind of internal employee education resource called OrangeMethod. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right. Yeah. OrangeMethod was great. It&#8217;s still there. I think they&#8217;re doing a slightly different thing, but very much in the same vein, I had gotten a reputation for being someone who shared knowledge on my team, which was surprising to me. Coming out of a bootcamp, I thought, and this was the case, but I thought I would be doing most of the learning. That was for sure true, but I definitely didn&#8217;t expect that I&#8217;d have any knowledge to share. It turned out that that was the case. And I always tell my students that also. Software, it&#8217;s not 100% about the technical aspects because we&#8217;re building software for human beings most of the time. So one&#8217;s human experience is something to have as input into how the software&#8217;s created.</p>
<p>But anyway, I had garnered that reputation for sharing knowledge that I had. And one day someone DMed me on Slack and was like, &#8220;Hey, what would it look like if we tried to scale the work you&#8217;ve been doing on your team across the organization?&#8221; So I was like, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Maybe for me, a starting point was, well, maybe we could have a similar structure as the bootcamp I experienced, but make it custom to what outcome we want those folks having. So I started with that and I put together a little pitch deck for the director who messaged me and presented it to him about a week later. And then about a year later, everything that was on that pitch deck became a reality. They actually built out a physical space, I think four or five, maybe six classrooms, built out a team and actually started a cohort in, I think 2017, early 2017. So that was fantastic.</p>
<p>Started out with folks who worked in stores. Actually, no, first we started out with folks who were internally already at the store support center, which is the corporate headquarters, and who already knew the internals of more or less a corporate environment and then gave them the skills. And then from there, we moved on to having store associate cohorts, which that was a lot more fun because it was also learning the corporate environment for them, and also things like they didn&#8217;t spend much of their day writing emails, but now a lot of the way to communicate is written as opposed to in the store it&#8217;s a lot more verbal communication. So overall a good experience, really glad to have worked there. It&#8217;s a great place to work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I&#8217;ve heard really great things from people that do work there. And I don&#8217;t know if this might have been the case for you, but I&#8217;ve heard that there is sort of this pipeline from General Assembly to The Home Depot in terms of graduates ended up working there. Is that what happened in your case?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Yeah, I was actually Home Depot&#8217;s first boot camp hire.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, look at that. Making history.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
From a software engineering standpoint, they might have had some other designers, but I was the first person in the full site cohort to get hired there. And then from there, I definitely referred to a lot of people. So I&#8217;m really happy that they continue to believe in the prospect of having someone without, for let&#8217;s say, collegiate experience as a software engineer and having that be a thing going forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Cool. What have you learned about yourself through this whole process? I mean, it sounds like you really sort of caught the teaching bug first in college, and then you&#8217;ve continued to do it not just internationally, but then also here in the States as well. As you&#8217;ve been doing all this, and even now as you&#8217;re building your business, what have you really learned about yourself?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Lately, what I&#8217;m thinking about is I&#8217;ve talked about the idea of chasing prestige before, and I&#8217;m still at risk for that. So the big thing that I&#8217;ve learned is that realizing a tendency or a particular behavior pattern is not the same as addressing it. So I still know that I have the tendency to seek prestige, and this usually manifests itself in doubting the path of really doubling down and tripling down into teaching and education, because I feel like maybe I should, in quotes, be a practitioner, someone on the field, and it&#8217;s a false choice. I don&#8217;t have to choose one or the other. I can be both, probably not at the same time, but I just have to get to a place and I&#8217;m getting there where I&#8217;m comfortable with the cycles.</p>
<p>In other words, okay, right now I&#8217;m in a teaching phase. There&#8217;s nothing stopping me from finding a contract position to learn more stuff or practice more stuff or build more stuff and then cycle back out into a teaching phase. So the big lesson there for me is self-awareness and accepting what you become aware of about yourself rather than, again, looking outward for my validation or confirmation that the steps I&#8217;m making are for me. Because I know they are.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, you&#8217;ll find the more that you get into your business, I mean, it is, I&#8217;d say for every person that starts a business, it&#8217;s an extension of their cell themselves. And as you build the business, you&#8217;re building yourself, you&#8217;re learning more about your ins and outs and how you do things. Especially I think once you build a team too, you really start to learn more about that. Because then, I mean, it&#8217;s not about you in terms of you having to be responsible for everything, but you now have other people that you&#8217;re responsible for in terms of getting other parts of the business done. So you have to learn how to delegate and how to manage, and it&#8217;s a whole thing.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Totally. In your case, do you find your business actually behaves like you do? Like is it a scaled out version of you, or is it a part of you or something else?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a great question. It&#8217;s a part of me. I&#8217;ll say that because I can be very, I guess eccentric is probably a good way to put it. I can be kind of like a little hippy dippy, a little woo woo, that kind of stuff, right? But then when it comes to business, I am the exact opposite. I am serious documentation processes, and that can be a conflict for people, I think, because they may know me personally and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh yeah, Maurice is cool, da da da da.&#8221; But then when it comes down to business, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Why isn&#8217;t this done?&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re different.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s a part of me because I do take that stuff very seriously. I mean, one because it&#8217;s my livelihood, so I have to take it seriously. I mean, that&#8217;s not to say that I don&#8217;t inject some levity into business. It&#8217;s not a complete Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde transformation. But when it&#8217;s business, I&#8217;m about business. And when it&#8217;s not about business, people that have worked with me and know me know that sometimes it&#8217;s flipping a switch. It&#8217;s like, oh, workday&#8217;s over. Cool, let&#8217;s go out. But when we have to get work done, we have to get work done. Because to me, one feeds the other.</p>
<p>So for me, it&#8217;s a part of me. It&#8217;s not a hundred percent me. I&#8217;d say probably when it comes to some marketing and even some communication and stuff, I can be probably a bit more lax than I would say be more serious. But when it comes to the actual invoicing and business and some communication stuff, I tend to be pretty strict and rigid. It has to this way. So it&#8217;s an extension. It&#8217;s an extension, certainly.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
That&#8217;s really interesting. Really interesting. Are you Gemini? No, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Pisces.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Got it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Pisces, sun, Virgo, moon. It&#8217;s the duality.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:55:24].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So I can be very definitely creative, right brain, all that stuff. But then I&#8217;m also, when it comes to the business stuff, very logical, systematized, even to this podcast.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
You guys have systems in place.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
These conversations are lax because there&#8217;s a tight system behind it. Right.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Yeah, buddy. It&#8217;s lovely. I was loving all that. It&#8217;s fantastic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, aside from your business, what are you obsessed with lately? And I&#8217;m asking this because you mentioned earlier something about Lion&#8217;s Mane, and so I&#8217;d love to hear more about that.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Almost everybody that I meet and that I know I&#8217;m going to be around for an extended period, within the first day or week of knowing me. I&#8217;m probably going to pull up on you with a packet of Lion&#8217;s Mane and tell you to put it in your coffee or have it as a tea. Lion&#8217;s Mane is a mushroom. It is a legal mushroom. It is sold at the store. You can go to Whole Foods and buy some Lion&#8217;s Mane. You could go to GIAS Wholesale in East Point and buy some Lion&#8217;s Mane, local, Black-owned business plug.</p>
<p>And the thing about it is it has what they call it neuro-regenerative properties. So they used to think that if you lost brain cells, that was it. And side note, do your own research. I&#8217;m not a neurologist, but with Lion&#8217;s Mane, it has been found that it promotes new neural connections, which is really sick. It&#8217;s really important for learning too. And that&#8217;s all really learning is just making new neural connections. So I have it every single day since about 2015 I have it. And the way I describe it anecdotally to people is having a cup of coffee is like turning up the volume where having Lion&#8217;s Mane is increasing the brightness, getting a lot more clarity on just the lived experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve seen people eat Lion&#8217;s Mane. I&#8217;ve seen them prepare it like a steak or something. I haven&#8217;t heard of it in a powdered form that you would drink though.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Totally. Yeah. I&#8217;ve actually have cooked it earlier this year. Cooked it a few times, learning a lot about cooking mushrooms. You don&#8217;t need to put oil on them at first. You let them saute out. Because they already are full of water. I was messing up big time to start out. So you let them saute out, get the juices out, and then you go in.</p>
<p>But yeah, you can definitely eat them. I found out about this company called Four Sigmatic that makes a powder, but there&#8217;s lots of companies now that are doing this. The important thing is how it&#8217;s grown and whether or not you&#8217;re getting the fruiting body or the mycelium. I think so. And however, Four Sigmatic does it&#8217;s the way I like it. I don&#8217;t know which way it is, but how they do it is good for me. Because it doesn&#8217;t cake up in the liquid or whatever you&#8217;re trying to drink it out of, but a lot of the other ones get a little doughy at the bottom. You know how when you drink a mocha or something, the very last sip is just all the chocolate, it gets like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It doesn&#8217;t dissolve fully or something.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Correct. Exactly. But the Four Sigmatic one does.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m going to have to check it out. I don&#8217;t drink coffee.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Those are my favorite words. When someone, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll look into it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, no.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
No, I&#8217;m serious. Because you&#8217;re going to hit me up like, &#8220;Whoa, this is really working.&#8221; I live for that moment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, because I drink tea. I think people that know me for as long as I&#8217;ve done this podcast know I&#8217;m a very huge tea drinker. Actually had a tea podcast back in 2015 at a daily tea podcast called The Year of Tea. So I drink tea every day at least two or three times a day. And the one I have in the morning is this mix of, it&#8217;s black tea, I think it&#8217;s like an Assam black tea and roasted yerba mate, and I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll have that together. It&#8217;s called Morning Thunder. And that&#8217;ll get me going probably for most of the day, probably at least until after lunch. It&#8217;ll get me going. Then afternoon I may have a different yerba mate tea or something like that. But no, I&#8217;m curious about the mushrooms. Because I mean, I really like mushrooms. I like eating mushrooms. I haven&#8217;t drank mushrooms. I&#8217;ve not had them even in the illegal sense, but curious about the Lion&#8217;s Mane, certainly if it&#8217;s anything that&#8217;s going to help with brain function and stuff. I&#8217;m down to try it. Certainly. And it&#8217;s organic too. Yeah, I&#8217;m down to try it. Sure.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Yeah, you give it a shot, the brand, I&#8217;ll shoot you a link, but the brand I like is Four Sigmatic. They&#8217;re not paying me. Maybe they should, but they&#8217;re not. Four Sigmatic. Really good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you had any mentors that have helped you out along the way? I mean, I feel like this teaching journey isn&#8217;t one that you&#8217;ve walked alone.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
So it turns out that teaching is a part of my lineage. My, I think it&#8217;s great great, maybe three greats, grandfather was a teacher and moved from, let&#8217;s say, migrated from Barbados to North Carolina, if I&#8217;m not mistaken, and started a school or was one of the founding people for a school. So that&#8217;s kind of cool. I did not know this man, but he&#8217;s like a mentor in my lineage, which I&#8217;m using as validation for the possibility. In other words, not only is he another person who&#8217;s done the teaching, but he&#8217;s in my lineage, so it&#8217;s that much closer. And not only do I know it&#8217;s possible, I know it&#8217;s possible with someone who has closer DNA to me than statistically everyone on earth. So I would say that story.</p>
<p>And then of course there&#8217;s lots of teachers down the line in my family. My grandma&#8217;s a teacher, my mom&#8217;s a nurse, which is not teaching, but it is still like hand-to-hand combat with let&#8217;s not use combat, hand-to-hand interaction with people. So I am really inspired by people who are good at that. My dad&#8217;s also great at that. He&#8217;s got a funeral home and a lot of that work is just hand-to-hand, face-to-face with people. That&#8217;s the work that&#8217;s required. So I know that I am for sure a product of those personalities and those experiences.</p>
<p>From a professional standpoint, that&#8217;s actually something I struggle with, Maurice, is I really feel like I&#8217;m on a journey for which it&#8217;s difficult to find comps. I also don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a prerequisite for a mentor that they want to do the same exact thing you&#8217;re doing or you&#8217;re on the same path. But I&#8217;ve honestly struggled with finding someone with a path that I&#8217;d necessarily like to follow. So that might be a weakness of mine honestly, is reaching out and finding day-to-day help. And I don&#8217;t think I need somebody to say, &#8220;Hey, this is what you should do.&#8221; It&#8217;s more like, I like talking through what I&#8217;m doing, which is why I&#8217;m really enjoying this. It&#8217;s not even bouncing ideas, just verbalizing what I&#8217;m up to really helps to clarify it for me. So that&#8217;s probably my biggest need. And if that&#8217;s called a mentor, then I need one if anybody&#8217;s listening wants to hold me accountable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious about this because we talked a little bit about this before we started recording because I mentioned that I asked you where you lived and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;I live in Atlanta.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t really get to have that many guests that are on in Atlanta.&#8221; Outside of your students and I guess maybe some ex-coworkers or something, have you found that support locally? Have you been able to tap into some networks or something?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
In terms of just having a sounding board and that sort of thing?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Yeah. So what I think happened, Maurice, is Covid turned all of the connection for me. It made me put it all in the one box, my professional box, and I did not really do a good job of nurturing a network of people to fellowship with about whatever it is. But I think it&#8217;s there and I think that I need to just put in energy into, I need to actually make an effort to reach out and create or build or find community in the area. Because I know it&#8217;s here, but for me, I just find often the motivation is kind of to the earlier point you were making, but kind of an adult version, often the motivation is like, let&#8217;s get this money, which is fine, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Atlanta&#8217;s very much a let&#8217;s get this money city, so I get it.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Which okay, I&#8217;m on board, let&#8217;s get to it, right? But I think there&#8217;s so many more needs than that that people have. It&#8217;s not just like, okay, good. What if you&#8217;ve gotten to the money and you&#8217;re like, okay, now let&#8217;s sustain ourselves. Why aren&#8217;t there songs about that? So I guess the answer to your question is not yet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I gotcha. What advice do you have for somebody that wants to follow in your footsteps? They&#8217;re hearing about your journey and they want to do that too?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
I&#8217;d like to think my journey is one that reflects and represents awareness of self. So I&#8217;ll answer it that way. But first, if there is anybody who particularly wants to follow in the actual steps, it&#8217;s important. If I&#8217;m looking back on my professional career so far, it&#8217;s important to understand what lights you up. If I wasn&#8217;t listening enough to myself to know that I really am enliven and fulfilled by teaching, then I probably would&#8217;ve stopped doing it because I would&#8217;ve been chasing again that prestige. So that&#8217;s the internal battle for me, like prestige versus fulfillment. It seems so obvious which one&#8217;s more important, fulfillment, but I still struggle with like, oh, that would be nice. People would love it if I said this right? And I think we all have to some extent a level of that. So for me, the journey has been about understanding and managing that.</p>
<p>And even specifically in my case, if somebody is learning how to write code right now and they really love, this is the first thing that&#8217;s coming to mind, let&#8217;s say fly-fishing, then you should be thinking about how to make connections or what are the metaphors or analogies between fly-fishing and software engineering that you can see from your perspective such that it becomes ingrained in your being so that you can sustain it long enough to make something out of it.</p>
<p>And I think that particular piece of advice I&#8217;m giving might seem antithetical to the idea of work life-balance, but I actually think that it&#8217;s more important to have an integration like a work-life integration because you, there&#8217;s no avoiding the fact that we have to work. You have to feed yourself, you have to bring some money to the table. But it&#8217;s going to be much easier to do that if what you&#8217;re doing is something that you enjoy.</p>
<p>So first, find what lights you up, then incorporate your skill into that thing. It might be that software engineering for example, or designing or whatever the actual competency is. It might be that thing lights you up maybe, but it&#8217;s so much better, I feel, if you can attach it to another thing that you can apply to multiple things. So I could teach English, I could teach software engineering, I could teach someone how to do a workout that I just learned. So for me, the [inaudible 01:07:28] is the vessel and what I put in it is up to me. So currently professionally, it&#8217;s software engineering, and that&#8217;s how I get paid. So that&#8217;s the advice. Find something that lights you up and add the skill inside of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? Where do you want the next chapter of your story to be?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
I have no idea how it&#8217;s going to look. What I&#8217;d like to happen in the next short term period is I&#8217;m really loving in-person instruction and I&#8217;d love for that to take me overseas somewhere to a place I haven&#8217;t been because I just love people. I&#8217;m a big fan of people and learning about them. So to me it&#8217;s just an exchange.</p>
<p>So in the next five years, I hope to continue exchanging my energy with other people and using my energy to bring folks along, learning paths and journeys that they want to go on. And so far that&#8217;s been through software, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if at some point there were other competencies or skills I found myself sharing with others to the end of doing something. So next five years, I hope to continue to be doing that and maybe traveling as an instructor to different places. Let&#8217;s do some live manifesting in two years. I&#8217;m so excited to meet everybody at the class in Morocco where we&#8217;re learning about building web apps using some framework that doesn&#8217;t exist yet. So I can&#8217;t wait to meet everybody in Morocco.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I like that.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
You like that?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your business and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Yeah, for sure. So available on LinkedIn at Brandon Campbell-Kearns. I&#8217;m on TikTok as Quarterly Learnings, and you can also hear about the podcast on quarterlylearnings.com. The name of the podcast is Quarterly Learnings, any of those places. I&#8217;m also on Twitter @campbellkearns_, and I&#8217;d love to chat about anything you want to related to learning, and especially if you have a group of people at the place you work that need to have a particular skill, I&#8217;d love to offer a workshop for them, whether that&#8217;s a small group or a medium-sized group. That is something that I really love doing in person or online, but I&#8217;d really love to meet you in person.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Brandon Campbell-Kearns, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I think what you really had to say about kind of breaking out of these expectations to really discover what it is that you want to do, that&#8217;s a super important lesson for a lot of us to learn.</p>
<p>I would say probably now within this past year or so, it&#8217;s really important as people&#8217;s relationship to work has changed. Whether that&#8217;s been from leaving a job voluntarily, leaving a job involuntarily. I think a lot of people right now are trying to discover what&#8217;s next for them as they look at kind of this vast landscape of where things are going. And it sounds like you&#8217;ve really been able to tap into what speaks to you on a molecular level and use that to kind of put your gifts out there in the world, which I think is something that a lot of people are trying to find. And I&#8217;m really glad to have had you on the show to share your journey and to let people know about what it is you&#8217;re doing. So thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Campbell-Kearns:</b><br>
Yeah, thank you so much, Maurice, for having me, and I appreciate you synthesizing my thoughts back to me. That gives me even more perspective. You&#8217;re good at what you do. You know this.</p>

<p>What can I say about Dr. Cheryl D. Miller that hasn&#8217;t already been said? Her groundbreaking work as a designer in the 1980s and 1990s has paved the way for Black designers in this industry. Her first-hand knowledge and experience is sought after by colleges and universities all over the country. And now, in this season of her life, she is being celebrated and awarded as a pioneering figure in the field of contemporary graphic design by AIGA, The One Club, Cooper Hewitt, IBM, and many others. Honestly, I couldn&#8217;t think of a better guest to have for this episode!</p>
<p>Cheryl and I talked about her recent work as a design educator, and she shared her newfound dedication to writing and why it&#8217;s so important to transition from oral tradition to scholarship. She also shared her interest in new tech, and spoke about mentoring younger designers who are blazing their own trails in the industry. Lastly, we explored what success looks like for her now, and she talked about what&#8217;s coming up next as her passions for art, writing, and design intersect. Sit back and enjoy this thought-provoking conversation with a true design legend.</p>
<p>(And thank you all for 500 episodes of the podcast!)</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Maurice, I am Cheryl D. Miller.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No introduction needed.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
No. No, I barely have a website, and now it&#8217;s come down to just, &#8220;Google that, okay? And I&#8217;m not the basketball player.&#8221; There are three of us, and I think there&#8217;s a psychologist and a basketball player. &#8220;Just put in Cheryl D. Miller, and that&#8217;s it.&#8221; That&#8217;s it in a nutshell. &#8220;Just Google, Cheryl D. Miller.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How is 2023 going so far?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
2023 is going really, really well. And I say that I&#8217;ve been granted much favor and grace through the pandemic, and it&#8217;s continuing. And 2023 has just expanded with new platforms, new vision, new sharing, that really all has been birthed from our pandemic season. It&#8217;s going really well. My projects&#8230; I&#8217;ve been a professor at several universities, I&#8217;m now with three. And that&#8217;s a unique experience, because everyone that&#8217;s working with me is developing this hybrid pedagogy. And I say the only thing that&#8217;s left for me to explore with this is that I&#8217;ll hologram into my classrooms next. So somebody has that figured out next. I&#8217;ll be lecturing via hologram in the Metaverse. I don&#8217;t&#8230; I would say soon.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you&#8217;re at Howard, you&#8217;re at UT Austin, ad ArtCenter, right? ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yes. All three.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yeah. And I&#8217;m crossing my fingers. I&#8217;ve been talking with University of Connecticut UConn, because it&#8217;s in my geography. I&#8217;ve wanted to do something locally. I might be with them in the fall as well. Since pandemic, I have carried four universities at a time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Light work for Cheryl Miller.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, outside of that, do you have any big goals or projects that you are working on now?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Well, yeah. I&#8217;ve dedicated myself to writing the rest of way out. I have a lot of things to write, Maurice. And I don&#8217;t want to talk too much about the writing, but I&#8217;m writing crazy. And one of the things that I do pride myself on, I do pride myself on a few things, that is, I don&#8217;t compile footnotes. My work, I make footnotes. So my revelation, my development of scholarship, I am creating conversation that I&#8217;m hoping they will be, my footnotes and the things I write, finding proof for my revelations, I&#8217;m leaving a trail of breadcrumbs. I will never write as many books as footnotes that I will leave to my scholarship.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one of the things that I really, really believe in that our community, which I represent the BIPOC, indigenous community with being African-American, but a woman of many, many colors. And we must write, we must publish, but we can&#8217;t do that if we don&#8217;t have content. So my work is, I want to make sure that I leave as many footnotes and content as possible. And that doesn&#8217;t always mean that it&#8217;s in the form of a book. So I&#8217;m putting up my YouTubes, my lectures, recordings, all these things that if you study the things that I&#8217;m leaving behind, those that are really writing and researching have footnotes that they can create and compile for their books and so forth. We can&#8217;t write if we don&#8217;t have content.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I always contend is that I think Bond House is a hundred and a few years old. I&#8217;ve lived two thirds of that history. So my lived experience must be documented, which is much different than compiling footnotes out of the library. But you can&#8217;t do that if you don&#8217;t have content. I&#8217;m leaving content. Valuable, I know what&#8217;s in the card catalogs, I know what I&#8217;ve experienced, I know what I&#8217;ve lived through. I don&#8217;t compile footnotes in my work. I create them. So my lived experience, my lived history, I&#8217;ve been an eyewitness to a lot of things, I&#8217;ve known a lot of people. So writing that out in different forms, which is really my scholarship and revelation, I&#8217;m creating footnotes. And then I&#8217;m documenting those notes in places where if you&#8217;re going to really going to do the work, you&#8217;ll find Cheryl Miller. You&#8217;ll find Cheryl Miller found this out. You&#8217;re going to find Cheryl Miller&#8217;s research.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll be lucky if I get maybe three books out. But making sure the ingredients for you all to write, that&#8217;s been a big part of my work, which is&#8230; I&#8217;m in a sacred project of collecting Black graphic design history that&#8217;s in collections with Stanford University and Cooper Union Herb Lubalin Center. It&#8217;s sacred work, because I find deceased Black designers and estates. I&#8217;m working with families that know that their loved one had some crazy kind of career, and it&#8217;s all in a box in the attic or in the basement, and they don&#8217;t know what to do with that ephemeral. And usually, I show up giving them a place to have their work preserved and cataloged. So with that, that&#8217;s really important, because we can&#8217;t write a history if it&#8217;s all oral tradition and lost and dry rotting in somebody&#8217;s attic or basement.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m meeting so many families. I have a daughter, I won&#8217;t call her name. I have one I&#8217;m meeting this afternoon. I&#8217;ve worked with Sheldon Dixon&#8217;s daughter, I&#8217;ve worked with Dorothy Hayes&#8217;s niece. They all tell me these incredible stories and trust these sacred boxes that I will take care of them. And thus far, Stanford has received the concept of this without charge. That&#8217;s what they do. They bring in collections, they preserve art. I think they have MLK papers. This is what they do. And some people say, &#8220;Well, why didn&#8217;t you take it to HBCU,&#8221; and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Stanford will preserve the work freely for us.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve given everyone an invitation. Some people have wondered my motive. My motive is, &#8220;Okay. Well, you keep that stuff in your attic if you want. Or you have an opportunity for somebody to come by, pick it up, and you have a name and a catalog annotation. You have your own numbers. You don&#8217;t come underneath Cheryl Miller. This is not the umbrella. You have your own note. You have your own archive. You have your own collection. And it&#8217;s being preserved.&#8221; So we started with, I don&#8217;t know, somewhere between 40 and 60 invitations. And it is sincere, and it&#8217;s real. And I think the ones that are really moving me are the ones of estates where the designer is dead.</p>
<p>And I can&#8217;t tell you. Like my conversation with Dorothy Hayes&#8217;s niece, she says, &#8220;Thank God for you. I inherited everything. My aunt left me everything. And I haven&#8217;t had a clue what to do with it.&#8221; It&#8217;s sacred, because I listened to estate members, those who have inherited. I hear the stories of, &#8220;my dad,&#8221; &#8220;my aunt,&#8221; &#8220;Thank God it&#8217;s not going to be lost. I don&#8217;t have to toss it out. I have no idea what I was going to do with this.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s really an honor to work with the families who tell me their oral traditions and give me their boxes of goodies. And there&#8217;s all kinds of things. There are all kinds of things that we have a culture of. See, I&#8217;ve been at this since I was 17. And we have this culture of saving things in case something big happens. Okay?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
In case somebody gets discovered, or it&#8217;s hidden or lost. Who knew footnote on the back of a match cover, right? And these boxes are full of these things for a rainy day. Oh my God, you talking about the Black designers, they&#8217;re full of, &#8220;Oh my God, I got to save this for a rainy day in case&#8230; Just in case.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve had the privilege of talking to families, working with Stanford to pick up the collections, sampling the collections. They come in, they come into a holding area, they have special buildings, and it&#8217;s a process to bring these boxes in from everybody&#8217;s attic. And I&#8217;ve been telling you all, the ones that I&#8217;ve invited down to land of the living, &#8220;Open your file, open your collection.&#8221; Maurice, open your collection. You have an invitation. Open it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
So that means fill out the papers, go through it, and start it. Meaning you&#8217;ve got transcripts, you&#8217;ve got all kinds of notes from when you started this, and you remain an archivist to your collection. You don&#8217;t have to put anything new in it. You own all your rights and all of that. So it&#8217;s an honor. I&#8217;m telling all of my younger scholars, &#8220;If I&#8217;ve invited you, fill out the papers and start. You don&#8217;t have to put your current work in, because you&#8217;re working with it. Put your stuff in from college. Put your thoughts in. What did you write? Where are your diaries? That kind of thing. It&#8217;s not for me, and it&#8217;s not for you. It&#8217;s for the next generation that&#8217;ll come and needs to write about Revision Path.&#8221; Well, if Revision Path doesn&#8217;t have a record of that and hasn&#8217;t left footnotes, or you don&#8217;t pay the website bill, it&#8217;s all gone.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
It&#8217;s gone. So preserving our stories so that we have content for the next future generations to do the scholarship that&#8217;s required, that&#8217;s really important before I die. And if you get a book or two out of me, well, good. Good. You&#8217;ll get a book or two out of me. All right? They&#8217;re forthcoming. But collecting content so that we move this out of oral traditions and storytelling into scholarship and into history books, you can&#8217;t do it if you don&#8217;t have the ingredients, Maurice. So that&#8217;s a big portion of my work. And writing the most intriguing research I discover, and don&#8217;t ask me, just wait, but I have found some intriguing research that answers my primary questions for us all. So I&#8217;m writing that and working out where that will be published and how that will be published. I&#8217;m not anxious for publishing. I&#8217;m anxious to make sure that we have what&#8217;s necessary to publish.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
There&#8217;s no agenda to that. And nobody&#8217;s making any money on that, so we don&#8217;t worry about that. Yeah. Look, yeah, I have friends and foes, and friends and foes worry, &#8220;Is Cheryl Miller making anything?&#8221; Cheryl Miller&#8230; Listen, I&#8217;m waiting for the MacArthur, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, I hear you. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
I haven&#8217;t received a dime, you hear me? Not a dime for over 50 years of work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Waiting on that Genius Grant.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m waiting on the&#8230; I pray on it every day. I do, because&#8230; And these things are for the young at heart, all these awards and things. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, well, we are going to get this award, because it&#8217;s like art collecting.&#8221; I&#8217;ve learned some stuff about fine art too. &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll collect, buy low.&#8221; When they&#8217;re young, they&#8217;ve got performance. We collect and buy cheap now, because we know that they&#8217;re going to be producing for 30, 40 years. We are not going to give her that. She&#8217;s going to be good for 10 years. This should be going to glory.</p>
<p>No, but I haven&#8217;t monetized. There isn&#8217;t anything. There isn&#8217;t anything. Monetization, if you will, of this advocacy, man, I don&#8217;t even have a T-shirt. I don&#8217;t have a baseball hat, no merch, no nothing. Okay? It&#8217;s been 100% advocacy, because scholarship, I&#8217;ve learned, and in your work, statistics, the two together, the two signs of a coin, just marching and picketing, and I&#8217;m a civil rights girl. All of that brings awareness. But what has moved the needle in my life is one thesis, one document of footnotes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Cheryl Miller&#8217;s a footnote lady. And I wrote one piece, and here we are. So I believe in designers who write, I believe in scholarship. And there were years that I wondered how and why I went to seminary. I&#8217;m a theologian. And I was running the studio in New York, and Union Theological became my client. And I started part-time, and oh, that&#8217;s a whole nother story. Me in seminary is a whole nother story. But I got led into theological work. And when I got led&#8230; Theological work is not religious work.</p>
<p>So when I got into the process, I learned things that I use now. And I would say that I&#8217;ve created a genre of design social justice. Oh, you study with Delores Williams and the works and likes of Cornel West in and out of the alcoves, and James Cohen. You walk through some liberation theology, you walk through some social justice and change, pedagogy. Your tools will sharpen to slay the dragon. And then Union does not pride itself on making ministers. I mean, you can walk out and be a minister if you want with an MDF, but you are trained in dynamic levels of critical thinking, research development of scholarship in the recording of history.</p>
<p>And I got led in to be trained. And I did not need&#8230; When I wanted to go to grad school again, I went. Of course it makes sense, so you got a Master&#8217;s, go get a PhD. Well, PhD in art, unless you&#8217;re doing art history, the Master&#8217;s from Pratt was terminal for anything I needed to do, even to teach. And Union wouldn&#8217;t let me get a PhD in any form of any branch of what they had theologically, because I didn&#8217;t come up that route of a BA, a graduate degree, all of that.</p>
<p>So getting a Master&#8217;s of Divinity yet put me into what it is that is dynamic for me now. I see things that people don&#8217;t see. I answer questions that people don&#8217;t even think to answer. And that comes, and I document create footnotes and scholarship. My work is sound. And that came from being theologically trained. They train you, sharpen your knife to be able to cut prime rib with your eyes closed. And there were days like, &#8220;Why in the world am I doing this?&#8221; I&#8217;m running Cheryl Miller Design downtown, &#8220;What am I doing up here with all these intellects?&#8221; But I had learned the importance. I had leaned into my academic coach with the thesis.</p>
<p>Leslie King-Hammond, she was a PhD from Johns Hopkins. And I met her when&#8230; You know my life story, my dad died, I couldn&#8217;t go back to RSID, and I ended up with MICA. She was an adjunct African history, what, if not the first Black professor at MICA 50 some odd years ago. I was grieving, and the Dean put her in my care, put me in her care. &#8220;Here, take care of this child. She&#8217;s supposed to be in Providence. Her father died, and now she&#8217;s in Baltimore. Take care of her.&#8221; And she was a newly minted PhD, and now claimed emeritus in her own right, of course.</p>
<p>Dr. Leslie King-Hammond, she was my coach. Everybody asked me, &#8220;Cheryl, you got a mentor?&#8221; No, I had no design mentor. Nobody took interest. I&#8217;ve always had Leslie, I&#8217;ve had writing coaches. I&#8217;ve had some of the best editors to take care of my work, to take care of my writing. Leslie inspired me to be a scrum. I said, &#8220;Oh, this is more than doing a book report.&#8221; She guided me. It was rigorous. And she guided me through the infamous Pratt thesis. And we all know what that thesis has done in our lives. I was charged with Cheryl, the chair of the design department of Pratt says, &#8220;You can&#8217;t do a design project to graduate out of this program.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know what he told anybody else. All I know is Anton Minasi had a studio in Lincoln Plaza, and we all had senior reviews. &#8220;What are you doing for your thesis?&#8221; We all had appointments.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never forget it. I went upstairs. He was in a loft across the street from Lincoln Center. And God rest his soul, he said, &#8220;Cheryl, we&#8217;ve talked about you. You can&#8217;t do a design project for your thesis.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m in design school, I&#8217;m in graduate school, and I can&#8217;t do a thesis. Come on.&#8221; &#8220;No.&#8221; And he gave me a charge. He said, &#8220;We want you to make a contribution to the industry.&#8221; Well, I just took a deep breath, and I knew what it meant. I knew exactly what it meant. I left his office. I got down, and this is back in the day, there was no cell phone. I went over to the&#8230; And he used to have little calling cards. I went over to the payphone on the corner, and I called Leslie. I said, &#8220;Dr. King. Pratt&#8217;s not letting me graduate with a design project. I got to write my way through this. Will you be my coach?&#8221; Thus, brought Transcending the Problems of the Black Graphic Designer to Success in the Marketplace, starting with Cheryl Miller. How about that? Starting with Cheryl Miller.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve always been a writer. People don&#8217;t know I was recruited to RISD, and I was also invited to Wellesley. So I had a choice go to RISD&#8230; When I graduated high school, after Martin Luther King was assassinated, we were in a season of reparation, and all the Ivy League schools and New England schools came down to all of the urban towns. And they came to New York, they came to Philadelphia, they came to DC. They scooped up most likely to succeed SAT scores. We all got&#8230; Everybody got invited to go to college, or at least to apply. So I was invited to RISD, and I was invited to Wellesley, English Lit and writing.</p>
<p>And I always say now, &#8220;Well, I went to RISD, ended up a writer, I got something to write about.&#8221; So I got trained. I got trained in scholarship and design and art and design, and its equalities and inequalities is my topic of conversation. So graduate degree number one gives me me something to write about. And graduate degree number two has given me the skillset to do it.</p>
<p>So we lean into that, and that&#8217;s how this has happened. Because I will tell you, what I&#8217;m doing now, the only thing that being a designer and having gone to all the design schools and all of that, just Google it. The only thing that has done for me in my work has identified a problem and gives me my content for my purpose, for what I write for. So I lean theological work as being trained as a scholar. It has equipped me in ways that design school could never.</p>
<p>And I just think about those years of, &#8220;Oh my God, what am I doing? Why am I here? Why am I here? Why am I in seminary?&#8221; And I got Cheryl Miller downtown going, I got AIGA, I got all this stuff that&#8217;s now in articles, and so forth and so on. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Why I was there was to prepare me for this moment that keeps me relevant and pertinent. I write the solutions to the injustices that I see, and I create scholarship.&#8221; And the only other thing that turns the needle like that is statistics. When you back it up with your type of work, well, 2% of this and 3% of this and 4% of this, and oh, back that up with some footnotes, this, that, and the other, then it&#8217;s like you got your deposition for your court case. Short of that, it&#8217;s like a whole bunch of people complaining and making noise.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, first of all, you mentioned a couple of things I&#8217;d love to touch on. One thing that you said about Stanford and Cooper Union, which I thought was interesting, because I got a similar criticism when some of the Revision Path episodes got inducted into the Smithsonian. People were writing, and they were like, &#8220;Well, why didn&#8217;t you go to HBCU? You went to Morehouse. Why did Morehouse take it?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Well, Morehouse, first of all, I don&#8217;t think they even have an archive or something like that with design. And I already had a relationship with one of the curators at the Smithsonian.&#8221; It was a four-year sort of thing. That&#8217;s interesting though that you would get that sort of criticism about that. I mean, when you first came on Revision Path, I remember, I saw the pictures of you boxing up the stuff, and the folks from Stanford coming over and taking pictures and everything.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a weird criticism to have gotten.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s not a lot, but it sits in the back of people&#8217;s like, &#8220;Do I dare ask her?&#8221; Well, the thing about it is, preserving art costs money. It costs money, the archival process. So if someone is going to say, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to care in perpetuity for all the artwork that you bring in and make sure it&#8217;s annotated and credited and made available,&#8221; listen, you go work with that. I&#8217;m grateful. I&#8217;m grateful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, speaking of those five years or so, since you were first on Revision Path, a lot has happened. I mean, you&#8217;ve had&#8230; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen a designer have such an award tour, a victory lap, I don&#8217;t know what to call it. But you have had a number of accolades since then. Of course, you mentioned your professorships. You mentioned the collections at Stanford, at Cooper Union. There&#8217;s also your AIGA medal, your honorary doctorates, one from VCFA in 2021, one from MICA and RISD, from both of those in 2022. I mean, this has to be a tremendous validation of your work and your career. How does that make you feel?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
I&#8217;m humbled, and I&#8217;m honored. And honestly, I&#8217;m grateful that I&#8217;m alive to see it happen. Like the gospel song, I&#8217;m alive to see it happen, Maurice. And to have achieved three design awards of our industry, the Cooper Hewitt, Visionary, the AIGA. And the one that touched me in an interesting spot, and maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m a New York designer, was being inducted into, it&#8217;s the one club, but it&#8217;s the old school advertising Madison Avenue Club, being inducted into the Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m like, I have delayed, but not denied. And God&#8217;s been faithful that in the midnight hour how much work I&#8217;ve done for our community that no one knows. I&#8217;m appreciative that I&#8217;m alive, Maurice. And I&#8217;m still vibrant, so that I can use it. So all of these awards and things, I&#8217;m not retiring and I&#8217;m not expiring. I&#8217;m on the other side of this history, but it&#8217;s opening up doors for me to continue to do my work and to correct the wrongs that I see. And it&#8217;s opening doors that otherwise would&#8217;ve remained shut. So they&#8217;re honors hard, hard-earned. Someone posted that on a LinkedIn. I was just being peppered with acknowledgements and well-deserved, long overdue, but somebody said hard-earned on LinkedIn, and I said, &#8220;Glory.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the first one, I was with [inaudible 00:29:21] Debbie Allen. And if you heard my reflection remarks, receiving AIGA, the night before, she&#8217;d earned the revered award, and she was wearing red, and I decided I was going to wear red to stand with her. And these are lifetime hard-earned acknowledgements. And I always tell folks, &#8220;Don&#8217;t get it twisted. I&#8217;m not an overnight success.&#8221; Overnight success that took 50 years, Maurice. And I&#8217;m not above the law. I don&#8217;t want anybody to go through what I&#8217;ve been through. So you can&#8217;t do this if you haven&#8217;t had your own measure. You can&#8217;t work like I work if you haven&#8217;t had your own measure of challenge, pain, suffering, disappointment at the hand of this industry. And I couldn&#8217;t lay my life down like this if it hadn&#8217;t touched my door, that&#8217;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had my measure, I&#8217;m not above the law, and it&#8217;s been hard earned. And what it does now is, it gives me for those who want me. I&#8217;m on invitation only now. Invitation only is, there are a lot of things that are going on now that I&#8217;m not invited to the table. Well, I don&#8217;t have to be invited to everything, but the ones who invite me really want transformation and not performance. You don&#8217;t call me if you really don&#8217;t want to change your situation. So that&#8217;s a design model, less is more. I don&#8217;t have to be everywhere because I don&#8217;t trust everywhere to take care of my heart.</p>
<p>And with that said, every place that&#8217;s acknowledging, everyone that&#8217;s inviting me, they really want me. And for what I&#8217;ve been through, all of the horror of disappointment and rejection, why would I want to beat my head against performative projects where you just want my name? I don&#8217;t need that, Maurice. And especially on this side of history, I can get more done, I can get more done with people that want me, that really want transformation. I can get more done in one year than most people can get done in 10. You call Cheryl Miller. You want to get it done? Call Cheryl Miller. You want to look like you&#8217;re getting it done, she&#8217;s not the one. Because I&#8217;m really going to do it. So don&#8217;t call me unless you really want to hear it, you really want to do it, because I&#8217;ve always been truthful to this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I would wager your years of experience definitely has given you a sharp eye for discerning that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Oh God, yes. I can tell performative requests a mile away. It starts with the ones that don&#8217;t ask me. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, I see you. I see you. I&#8217;m not even on that distribution list. Okay. All right.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I feel like we&#8217;re sharing an inside joke with that, but I know exactly what you mean.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yeah. So it doesn&#8217;t mean I have to be everywhere, it doesn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s just that where I am are in genuine places that want growth. I shout out University of Texas Austin Design. Listen, I have to shout out to them. They had just three alumni write a letter, just three. And they&#8217;ve been transforming. They didn&#8217;t have to have board meetings, and this, that, and the other. I came for a residency and they invited me to stay and, &#8220;Would you like to create a class?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Yep, I would be honored.&#8221; You&#8217;ll have to ask them what&#8217;s it been like inviting Cheryl Miller to the faculty? Same thing. And I honor that, they really mean business. It&#8217;s a good school, it&#8217;s a great design school, heading up the ranks. And a part of it is, it&#8217;s reaching, and embracing, and being sincere to a diverse design community. And they said, Cheryl Miller, you got something you&#8217;d like to share?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;You better believe it.&#8221; And I got this crazy class that keeps me crazy busy.</p>
<p>Decolonizing graphic design from a Black perspective. It&#8217;s not Black history, Cheryl Miller&#8217;s not doing Black history, not like that. This is, I have decolonized the entire canon. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh my God.&#8221; And the point of the class is that a Black perspective is my perspective. I set the example of how to do it, how to take a one, number one, week one, and the basic canonical history goes all the way down until you get to Christmas, depending on your school. I go through each era and I show you how I decolonize the modernist perspective, but the prompts and the rehearsal back is, well, where do you come from? What&#8217;s beyond this modernist canon?</p>
<p>So this one class, I won an award from Howard with it. I&#8217;ve taught it at Roger Williams, I teach it at Howard, I teach it at University of Texas. And it&#8217;s the platform. I say platform because it&#8217;s the lectures that undergird two classes that I&#8217;m teaching at ArtCenter. And so ArtCenter, I teach communication design, I&#8217;m a co-professor, we teach publication design. But the prompts for the course, I&#8217;m a publication designer, so we&#8217;re teaching the craft of publication design, but the books that are being produced are not modernist solutions. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, so where do you come from? What are you bringing to the conversation of the book you&#8217;re designing?&#8221; And it&#8217;s intriguing. And I&#8217;ve been co-teacher, I also teach grad school there. And what I&#8217;m finding, I teach the capstone thesis graduate course, I&#8217;m a co-professor there, and I did that also at Leslie. People are asking me to teach capstone thesis. Well, who better knows how to write a thesis than Cheryl Miller? So to be a professor of thesis capstone books.</p>
<p>And I come and partner with those professors that are well oiled machines. The crit that we go through, it&#8217;s my training, how to do a thesis. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to renowned thesis, it&#8217;s crazy. One thesis, and here we are. Cheryl Miller can do a thesis, and so Cheryl Miller can teach you how to do a thesis.&#8221; I&#8217;m teaching Senior and graduate capstone thesis research and development. Now at Howard, which is exciting, is that they wanted me to teach that class. And so I think it&#8217;s two years, have I been with them two or three years? I&#8217;m not sure. Either two or three, whichever one. The first two, I&#8217;ve taught that basic class two semesters. And then they asked me, &#8220;Can you do a part two?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Apart two of the part one?&#8221;</p>
<p>And then I won an award last year, I was so honored. I got adjunct award, Phylicia Rashad, one of her first awards as Dean, for this course. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Here goes my work again.&#8221; So the course is unique and it&#8217;s transformative, and so they asked me what I do part two. And so part two at Howard is I do believe it&#8217;s one of a kind, I never say I&#8217;m the only, I will always say one of the first. But I&#8217;m teaching the history of Black graphic design at Howard University, part two of the design one that I teach in the Fall. So part one is decolonizing graphic design from a Black perspective, which is how to rework the canon base, how do we get new stories? That&#8217;s part one. And part two is strictly the history of Black graphic design. And I follow the canonical errors, but I don&#8217;t talk about any White designers at all.</p>
<p>And without a textbook, how about that? Because we&#8217;re still waiting for textbooks. And it&#8217;s the first university college, three credit class, strictly the history of Black graphic design. And so I&#8217;ve created my syllabus, I&#8217;ve got my lectures, I&#8217;ve got my content. The first class is extremely popular, and we are working with University of Texas to make it e-learning. So we prototyped it with a few professors last Summer, and I&#8217;m hoping that it will help as continued education for my colleagues. It&#8217;s inspiration of how I expand the traditional modernist canonical syllabus. And it&#8217;s a popular class, and it&#8217;s the basis for everything I&#8217;m doing. The only way that you can get the class is, either you take it from me, or we wait on University of Texas to make it. I&#8217;ve got to keep it in an academic environment, so I&#8217;m not doing it streaming and all that kind of thing. It&#8217;s going to be fully accredited and you can get a badge and all that.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re working on getting it so that people can take it. But if we&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to have one another in a class, then you&#8217;ve taken it with me. And I&#8217;m taking as many university engagements that will work with me this way, and I&#8217;m very busy during the day. Mondays are my hardest days. And inviting me to do this means that you are also working out what&#8217;s happening in design pedagogy, and curriculum, and education. So I have to shout out to Howard, UT, and ArtCenter. They are Zooming me in, and they&#8217;re working with it. So working with Canvas, and Blackboard, and Zooming me into the classroom, and these hybrid tech situations is opening up a world of knowledge-based wisdom.</p>
<p>Not only Cheryl Miller, but the pandemic has put us into this place, and I have grown in this space. And so are institutions that are willing to work that out. We&#8217;re not only but content experts from around the world, and it&#8217;s exciting. And I would say that schools should not frustrate themselves. And when we talk about looking at how we&#8217;re coming out of pandemic, listen, I tell my students, the ones that I teach at my other class at UT, is branding for diversity, I tell them all the time and the graduates preparing their portfolios and things, I said, Put some Zoom screenshots on.&#8221; These are aggressive design classes, Maurice. &#8220;And when you&#8217;re presenting, this means that you can design globally, you can be a design leader globally. You can manage how to be virtual, how to be remote, how to be global.&#8221; I said, it&#8217;s a skillset now.&#8221; We&#8217;re just not landlocked to walking around New York with black portfolios from corner to corner.</p>
<p>So Cheryl Miller has taken advantage of the pandemic and those that have heard the crying to diversify. And so these schools have wanted me and I want them, and they have blessed me and taken care of me in these years of mine now. And I have space for a couple more universities, but they have to be patient with me. Like I said, I&#8217;ve got my fingers crossed. I know that I&#8217;ve reached out. We have a campus here where I live, University of Connecticut, and so we&#8217;re looking at that. But I will work with this with whoever will work with me, and the two places that you want me. I don&#8217;t have to teach typography and this, that, and the other. I don&#8217;t have to do all that. You want me for one I do.</p>
<p>So the decolonizing of graphic design from a Black perspective, you want me to teach that. It&#8217;s a writing class, the prompts are writing. But I&#8217;ll tell you one thing that has stirred my heart is, when I teach this class of Howard, the way my scholars write the papers to the same prompts. Maurice, they help me get up every day because they are appalled that our history is not included in the main canonical story of North American graphic design. Their papers are unapologetic, and they keep me going like, &#8220;Oh my God my dear, I won&#8217;t labor through this one more year just to make sure you have a history.&#8221; So my hardest day, you asked me what&#8217;s a day like for Cheryl Miller?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take the first day, Monday is my hardest. I teach 12 hours straight. I get up, I&#8217;m online with Howard at 9:00 for three hours, I take a break. Then I move across the time zone, across the country, so I&#8217;m Eastern Standard Time. I start at 9:00, I&#8217;m with them for three hours. We lecture, we dialogue, we work out. We really work out on the content. Then my Texas class starts their time, 2:00, 3:00, and I&#8217;m there until 6:00, three hours with them. So 2:00 to 5:00 Central Time, 3:00 to 6:00 my time. I take a little break, then I head to California. There 2:00 is my 5:00, I have some transition time. Sometimes I&#8217;m early or late, depending on which way my Texas class goes. And I&#8217;m online, that&#8217;s a five hour class. My class starts all over again. My day starts all over day, all over again. It&#8217;s a five hour class that they go to at 2:00 and it&#8217;s over at 7:00.</p>
<p>And so I really have to shout out to the team there, the tech team. I Zoom in, review the work. We&#8217;re teaching publication design with a different spin. We&#8217;re working that Zoom in design, I&#8217;m telling you, it&#8217;s really an aggressive ArtCenter class for five hours. I start again. They come in fresh at 2:00, from 2:00 to 7:00, and I clock in 5:00 or 6:00, and I work until 10:00. I put in another five hours. So my family helps me, and everybody makes sure that I get water. I get water Maurice, I get water. I get a glass of water, I get a bio break, I get dinner, and I just keep moving. I keep moving. So my Mondays are my hardest things. The rest of my schedule, I write. I allow interviews, I do interviews. My door is still open. I&#8217;m here today with any popularity or notoriety because I never say no to the young designers.</p>
<p>So if you catch me, I do portfolio reviews. People want to stop by my LinkedIn Messenger, or my Instagram Messenger all the time. Ms. Miller, thank you for everything, can I talk to you? I talk to everybody, Maurice. I still do, I can&#8217;t not. I&#8217;m totally accessible all the time, which I think is the secret ingredient. I would say if there&#8217;s any secret potion to Cheryl Miller, I&#8217;ve been accessible. I don&#8217;t care who you are, you want to talk to me, I&#8217;ll talk to you. Because nobody ever wanted talk to me, Maurice, and that&#8217;s it. Nobody ever wanted to talk to me, not really. And so I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, if you want to talk to me, I&#8217;ll talk to you.&#8221; And so young scholars, young designers, I have a motto, if you see me on Instagram, or you see me on LinkedIn, and the green light is on, that means I have time to talk to you. I said &#8220;Don&#8217;t even make an appointment.</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;The way pandemic and strange diseases and everything gets us, I might not be here. If you see my green light, you better catch me right now.&#8221; I&#8217;m a right now, lady. Let&#8217;s do it, do it now. And so every day somebody text me, &#8220;Ms. Miller, can you talk?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yep, I surely can.&#8221; So I still do portfolio, I still do portfolio reviews, interviews. Everybody wants a little quote or something for their thesis. I&#8217;m still at it, and I don&#8217;t burn out within this, I&#8217;m built for this. So this is my training, so I know when to stop, I know when to rest. I do not work on the weekends, I do not work on Sundays. So to run a marathon, you have to know where to take your Gatorade breaks. And I&#8217;ve never been in a situation where I have burned out or lost my way emotionally, spiritually, break down, nothing. I&#8217;ve learned early my capacity, my boundaries. I rest a lot.</p>
<p>On Tuesdays I don&#8217;t do anything. After a Monday like that, I don&#8217;t do it. I go to the gym, leave me alone. I got a couch corner. And then I&#8217;m back up. I can get more done in two days than most people get done in two weeks. The key is rest and pacing yourself. The key is rest. Don&#8217;t go past being tired, stop. And so I learned that. Running a business in New York, client&#8217;s crazy. But I guess I learned to run the race there in New York. I learned how to take care of myself, and glory to God, I&#8217;ve got divine health, except for a left cranky knee. I&#8217;m on no medicine, nothing. Antacid it every now and again. But no pills, nothing. And so I&#8217;ve learned the art of self-care in running destiny&#8217;s journey. And my family plays a big part of that. My family plays a big part of that. I have a blessed marriage. Phil is enjoying all of this with me. We started when we were teenagers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I see the pictures on Instagram. You all are living it up.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yeah. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Cheryl, when&#8217;s the next gala award? I&#8217;ll take you. Cheryl, I&#8217;ll take you.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; So the invitation comes with Phillip. And he comes with Philip. And what&#8217;s interesting, I&#8217;ve got some interesting photos that I will release. When I went to RISD Freshman year, there was a young lady, Freshman, I don&#8217;t know what happened with her because I left out after Freshman year. But she came up there to study photography, and he came up to visit me one weekend. And we had these, Civil Rights kids, I had this bush. And she took these love affair photos of Phil and myself, and we both had these well cropped precision bushes. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Cheryl, how&#8217;d you do that?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Listen, I vinegared up my hair. Listen, I did what I had to do to be in the notice.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be left.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I worked that out. And so when we got invited to come to RISD, I said, &#8220;You know what? I&#8217;m going to entertain my community.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Let me show me post some militant Angela Davis freshman shots of Cheryl going to RISD Freshman year. And so he&#8217;s been with me the whole way, and it is a pleasure. We just did a cameo last week. A week before I woke up and I said, &#8220;RISD was inviting folks to come up to their Senior show.&#8221; And we live two hours from Providence, that&#8217;s nothing. So I said, &#8220;Phil, I want to go up to the Senior show, a cameo. Can you drive me up to Providence?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Really?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, what else are we going to do? We were just going to sit here and watch CNN and these crazy people on television.&#8221; So he says, &#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>So we jumped in the truck, and he took me to Providence, and saw the show, which is, oh my God, RISD design. Oh my God, just go to Instagram and look it up. Oh my God. Eye candy. If I say something is design candy, trust me, eye candy, design candy. Oh my God. Oh my God. And so it just warmed my heart. We were up there with Gary Manchin, is where the gallery is, and there&#8217;s a patio, when you walk out it overlooks Providence. And I sat there and took a familiar picture with him. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You remember when we were kids we took this picture from this venue, not knowing where life would leave us?&#8221; So he&#8217;s been with me. And the kids, it was a good decision for me to leave New York City with the practice and concentrate on them. I have good kids. Oh my God, they&#8217;re such a blessing.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s so funny, as they were coming along when if they misbehaved or anything, I would always say, &#8220;I want you to know I was a famous designer, and now I&#8217;m on this pickup line with you people.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m a famous designer, and now I&#8217;m in kindergarten.&#8221; So I chuckled with them over the course of raising them. And so now with all the awards, we have a group text and I said, &#8220;I told you I was a famous designer, but more than anything in the whole wide world, I wanted to be with you all.&#8221; So I&#8217;m a soccer mom, I&#8217;m a basketball mom, I&#8217;m a baseball mom, and never looked back about the design business. But I always wrote, the phone rang constantly. You called me, oh my God, can I have a copy of the thesis? Can I have a copy of the thesis? Can I have a copy of the thesis?</p>
<p>Oh my God, my phone has never stopped ringing because of the thesis. Now I&#8217;m with the awards, they come with me, they went to RISD with me. Got a chance, I&#8217;m so proud, they treated us so well. I&#8217;m so proud of President Crystal Williams, the 18th President of Rhode Island School of Design, first African American president of a top ranked art school. They just treated us so well, and the kids were so proud. And they go like, &#8220;Yeah mom, we know, you are a famous designer.&#8221; So what I have wanted to missed all of that for the sake of these crazy people in the industry slaying dragons? No. I have my teenage prom date is my husband, and we have two kids that have grown up to do their thing, and well, and they know that I was telling the truth. &#8220;Your mother was a famous designer and now she&#8217;s in kindergarten with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a blessing to be here. So it&#8217;s a blessing to be alive because a lot of these peers of mine, dead and gone, they&#8217;re getting these awards posthumously. That&#8217;s no fun. Thank you for the acknowledgement, but they&#8217;re dead and gone. I gave Nicole, she doesn&#8217;t have to do it anymore, but I gave her, that&#8217;s my daughter. I said, &#8220;Nicole, if anybody from New York calls you and wants to give your mother an award and I&#8217;m dead, don&#8217;t go get it unless it&#8217;s monetized. Say you had a chance to do it when she was alive and you didn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not coming to New York unless there&#8217;s money assigned to it for her estate.&#8221; So we joke about it, but I&#8217;m proud of them, they&#8217;re proud of me, and I balanced it. But I work hard. When I work, I work hard. And when I play, I play hard. So there you go. You got another question?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;re everywhere, you&#8217;re super active on social media, I see you even have a collection of NFTs. I want to ask you about two things. One, where do you see the future of design with all these new technological advances? And then secondly, what impact do you think social media is going to have on design?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Okay. Well, first and foremost, a lot of what I see tomorrow that is happening today comes from the experience of something very simple. I started in this business at the age of 17, 18 years old, and they invented the Magic Marker. Listen to me carefully, I say this all the time. I entered into this business when they discovered the Magic Marker. They were eight in a box, and the name of it was Magic Marker. Up until then, which was transitional, I was trained doing layouts with guash, a wooden teeth square, and charcoal, and speed balling. If I resisted Magic Markers and said, &#8220;Oh my God, I got to have my guash.&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t be here today. I entered the television industry, when everybody interviews me about BET and all of that, and I always put these markers so people can locate time in history.</p>
<p>Gayle King, I worked in a television station, WTOP-TV, post Newsweek channel nine, was my first design job when I graduated from MICA and moved back to Washington. And Phil and I had just gotten married. Gayle King was a news trainee, news program upstairs in the news department, and Oprah was in Baltimore. And everything was done in film. And in the art department we did old school art cards in color, and the art department, we&#8217;d have to make the news graphics, the promo titling, the whole thing. And we had stands where the cameras would roll up onto the art. The station had its first animation camera was filmed.</p>
<p>And then they brought in videotape, this new, oh my god, videotape. And so what happened in that transition period in Washington, they started putting production companies around the area of the television stations, right over the key bridge. They had some colored video production houses because everything was film. So to make the 5:00 or 6:00 news, all the film had to be developed, and edited, and cut, and whatever&#8217;s going to happen. The whole place was filmed Maurice, in the New technology. So when I met Bob Johnson, he was trying to figure out BET, which you hear me in that prototype story. I love it. But he asked me would I work at the BET star and prototype TV cards? And after we&#8217;ve had this one conversation about his idea, it&#8217;s a crazy story. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is before he incorporated, he was working out the idea. And I met him in the prototype stage. So he was at the station and trying to sell this concept. And he says, &#8220;Any black designers around here?&#8221; And they send them down to me. All I can say in that conversation, I don&#8217;t want to go over that conversation because it&#8217;s all over the internet. He said, &#8220;Will you art direct my prototype show? Take the BET logo card and what we call lower thirds and all of that, because we&#8217;re going to do it in video, we&#8217;re not going to do it in film.&#8221; And so my conversation here is that, well, if I stayed there figuring out how to do lower thirds and graphics with film and didn&#8217;t learn kyron, and digital, and video, I wouldn&#8217;t be here today. Video, and that production, and those production houses that were lined up in Virginia, and if the TV stations were holding on the film, where would we be today?</p>
<p>And so I&#8217;ve always been in this transitional, one foot in and one foot out. Well, let me tell you, by the time I got to New York, just look at your history of the McIntosh. New York City, the Macintosh wiped out God knows how many businesses. I don&#8217;t do small businesses, genre of business. So the first thing that really impacted the business at large, the design industry in New York City, was they began to bundle Page Maker on HP computers. And people started, &#8220;Well, I can do my own brochure.&#8221; And I&#8217;m saying, &#8220;Oh Jesus, look at this. What&#8217;s happening?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then I had Danita and [inaudible 00:59:27], you&#8217;ll see them on these award tapes. Danita Albert, one of my art directors. I said, &#8220;Listen, I got to keep up with this. Whatever this is, we got to do it.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;I bring the machines in. In other words, I sign my name to the leases, buy all the programs and stuff. I don&#8217;t have time to go figure this stuff out, go figure it out. And we got to pull up these drafting tables.&#8221; And the speedball turned into the rapidograph, into the uniball. Man, I have been through some technology.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Man, I have been through some technology. But when this Macintosh QuarkXPress one and Adobe and Photoshop, when they bundled this stuff, well they didn&#8217;t bundle, you had to buy it. The stuff was expensive and I had to buy&#8230; I had my own staff camera because I had a firm, it wasn&#8217;t freelance. I had a firm and that&#8217;s why I have logo sheets and stuff. If you didn&#8217;t have a camera, you couldn&#8217;t do this stuff.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s why I have crafted logo sheets that are flying all over because I don&#8217;t know about anybody else but Cheryl Miller had, unless you were on a job and you were freelancing and hustling stats after you worked, you know, needed a camera. There was no Adobe Illustrator skewing and all of that. This is Herb Lubalin, Tom Carnase, Tony DiSpigna crafting by hand.</p>
<p>So there were whole businesses for this. And type setting, my office was full of type catalogs. So you had type houses that only did headline type. You had type houses that did body type, you had retouch, retouching, retouchers. You had stack houses for negatives. Okay? So everything the computer did was a business inclusive of the deliveries.</p>
<p>So you had to move camera-ready art from uptown, midtown where the studios were, to the printers downtown. So the delivery services, this thing wiped out New York City. QuarkXPress, Macintosh, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. And those who were too cheap to figure it out &#8211; how to pay for all of that &#8211; took PageMaker on a HP and it went into DIY, do-it-yourself.</p>
<p>All those business folded and I just don&#8217;t mean they sea change. You know what sea change is? A sea change is different than a paradigm shift. A sea change is it&#8217;s gone. It&#8217;s gone. Never. To. Return.</p>
<p>And I saw this and I said, &#8220;Oh.&#8221; And the delivery service, AOL and the internet was flying, printing files, no more bikes running. The only thing moving now on bikes in New York City is Uber Eats.</p>
<p>I saw these businesses go if you could not keep up. And the resistance. Okay, well you can resist if you want. And listen, I used to visit Tony Dispena&#8217;s office downtown, and I was a regular go-by-and-visit.</p>
<p>And you can see, Douglas Davis has a retirement celebration documentary on Tony. You can find it on YouTube. And he shows you old school Tom Carnase, Herb Lubalin, and all of that crafting.</p>
<p>He had a well-tuned studio and you had to have equipment for that stuff. I still have that equipment, man. We had to have ellipses and drafting tools and&#8230; Oh Jesus, all that stuff by hand. I still have it all packed away. Okay, I&#8217;m looking for a museum&#8217;s installation. Cheryl Miller Design Studio still exists. Can you believe it?</p>
<p>I saw Tony&#8217;s shop pivot. He did not linger in holding onto speed balls. Speed ball pins and ink, and drafting to&#8230; See there was a process of how you did this stuff. You drew it out, you had your tissues and you had to have that camera. This thing hit New York City so fast. I went in there one day and he had a number Macintosh.</p>
<p>So what I&#8217;m sharing with you is University of Texas, I saw is starting a master&#8217;s program of AI. Next year it&#8217;s going to launch. MIT has a has a six week continue ed. Resist it if you want. Resist it and see where you&#8217;ll be. You&#8217;ll be right there with Uber Eats. You&#8217;ll be right there with Uber Eats. All right?</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve been through too much technology to know, don&#8217;t resist. Learn it. And while you&#8217;re learning it, they will figure out the copyright stuff, they will figure out the legality, they will figure out&#8230; But it&#8217;s going to do you no good if this technology doesn&#8217;t have some content experts.</p>
<p>And so I&#8217;m like, learn it and figure out your code of ethics for using it and compete. Don&#8217;t resist. Or you&#8217;ll be on your bike riding around with Uber Eats, still looking for pay stub deliveries to printers downtown.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is it. I&#8217;m curious about NFTs. I have several collections on Foundation. Phillip is doing that part of my practice. I think there&#8217;s something there. You know, got to watch out for moving west for gold, because the only ones that make gold are the ones who make the shovels. The only ones who find gold out west are those who sell the shovels. Is there a there, there? But I won&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a there, there, if I don&#8217;t jump in the game.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;ve got a Foundation collection, I&#8217;ve got a collection up now for women&#8217;s&#8230; He put up one for, there&#8217;s some women&#8217;s images. Yeah, I get it. Phil&#8217;s trained in blockchain for his business.</p>
<p>So we just keep it moving. We just keep it moving. I&#8217;m far from &#8211; well, I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m just getting started &#8211; but I&#8217;m into Cheryl Miller 2.0. Or 3.0, 4.0, whatever it is. I&#8217;m curious. I have some entree, but I haven&#8217;t had time to work it out yet. But I&#8217;m curious about teaching in the metaverse and I do not jest when I think before it&#8217;s all said and done I can hologram into some space to teach.</p>
<p>The only proof of anything that I&#8217;ve said here that it&#8217;s important. You&#8217;ll always hear me say, &#8220;Design doesn&#8217;t change. Technology does.&#8221; There&#8217;s not a thing about design that changes. Technology changes. And I&#8217;m a designer. I&#8217;m a good designer. So if I want to be left behind, I&#8217;ll go back with my magic markers.</p>
<p>I told you all of that to show you how much technology I have grown through. And I was inspired as a kid. TV was brand new. George Olden moved down to Washington DC to be with CBS when I was born. And so I grew up on art cards. And I&#8217;ve always been able to be blessed enough to be able to keep up with the technology. When I say &#8220;keep up,&#8221; is to afford the computers, to afford the programs, to afford the training.</p>
<p>And so we&#8217;re just going to keep it going and inspiring young designers to compete. So the answer to the question is Star Trek. We&#8217;re on an odyssey. I can only tell you if you don&#8217;t want to get lost, you better get your little continuing head. Or go to YouTube University. I always love going to YouTube University. They&#8217;ll teach you anything. They&#8217;ll teach anything you want to know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That is so true. That&#8217;s so true.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
I also like The Verve, Terrence Moline&#8217;s group. They throw up their tips and they keep it moving in that group. So you want to learn some technology and what&#8217;s going on, they&#8217;re really working those programs and talking about mid journey and all these dolly and rainbow this.</p>
<p>But you have to show up to these things. You have to participate. You have to always be inquisitive and be excellent. Like Oprah says, you got to do the work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, you and I have talked about some young designers that you have been mentoring. You&#8217;ve talked about &#8211; or I&#8217;ve seen pictures at least I know &#8211; but you and I have talked about Simon Charway, Taeler Breathwaite.</p>
<p>How has your mentoring been going? I mean, I know you&#8217;re everywhere in terms of social media and of course like you said, you want to be on the metaverse. Like in the real world here, how&#8217;s your mentoring been going?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Oh well, listen, apples don&#8217;t fall far from the tree. Everyone that&#8217;s in my tribe, they have their gifts. I think in my life I&#8217;ve inspired them to touch their gift. And the proof that they are of my tribe, they&#8217;re all winning awards too. The family that prays together stays together. So my tribe, they&#8217;re award-winning, they&#8217;re doing the same thing.</p>
<p>They stop by every now and again and say, &#8220;Auntie&#8221; &#8211; they know, don&#8217;t call me &#8220;Abuela&#8221; or &#8220;Nana&#8221; or anything &#8211; so everybody knows to call me &#8220;Auntie.&#8221; I just speak into their lives, hope and inspiration and to identify your gift.</p>
<p>And I do have some tips Maurice, and they have been kind enough to regard some of my wisdom. And when applied, they get the same results. So they are competitive designers. I&#8217;ve got so many of them. But what you can&#8217;t do is write me and say, &#8220;Cheryl, will you be my mentor?&#8221; That&#8217;s not the way that works.</p>
<p>Usually I see a giftedness. And I think one of my favorite, you mentioned Tr√© [Seals] and Taeler. Tr√©, I love Tr√©. I love him dearly. And I love how he always remembers me. And he&#8217;s the man of the hour and he will be the man of the hour. On several occasions, his YouTubes and his articles, he will tell you that he ran into my article in 1987.</p>
<p>And most people run into the article 1987. And they find me, they do everything they can do to find me. And if you&#8217;ve gone through all that trouble to find a vintage, he said he paid 60 bucks. He found it on eBay. Somebody gave it to him, and then he found his own copy. I know I bought 200 of them, so I know 200 of them are around someplace.</p>
<p>He found it, someone gave it to him, he read it, he found me. I don&#8217;t know how he found me, but back when I was raising the kids I had a website. You could write me on the website. And he said, &#8220;Ms. Miller, I got an idea.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Mm-hmm.&#8221; I always listen. I said, &#8220;Mm-hmm, we all got ideas. Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;I found your article. I read your article. I have an idea.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Mm-hmm.&#8221; And he says, &#8220;I want to make typefaces from the lettering on Civil Rights posters.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Mm-hmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;What do you think about that? Is that a good idea, Ms. Miller? I paused. And he quotes me pretty well, I remember it like it was yesterday. I said, &#8220;Tr√©, do it now. If you don&#8217;t do it, somebody else will.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t have to tell him twice. And here we are.</p>
<p>See, this is what I tell everybody. You&#8217;re not going to be the only one, but could you try to be the first one? Try to be the first one. You&#8217;re not going to be the only one. Don&#8217;t you still go to McDonald&#8217;s and look up and say, &#8220;Can I have a Coke, please?&#8221; Well, we only have Pepsi, will you take Pepsi?&#8221; Don&#8217;t you go to FedEx and say, &#8220;Can I have a Xerox?&#8221; In the Canon machines back then.</p>
<p>First name recognition. I will never be the only one, but I&#8217;m going to be the first one, one of the first. I will never say &#8220;only.&#8221; You will always hear me say, &#8220;I&#8217;m one of the first.&#8221; Because just when I have the audacity to say I&#8217;m the first, somebody else comes up and says, &#8220;Well, I was there before you Miller.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh yeah, you were.&#8221;</p>
<p>So you got to stay humble with it. But you got to be the first one, one of the first to the application of your gift, your idea. That&#8217;s your brilliance. And so I see people now trying to do that, and they&#8217;re coming up with civil rights. And I said, &#8220;Man, don&#8217;t imitate. Don&#8217;t duplicate. Create.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taeler. Listen, that little baby can design. You hear me? She&#8217;s my youngest. I met her in Texas. Now, I don&#8217;t know the statistics, I don&#8217;t keep up with it, but she must be one of the first young black designers to have gotten as many grad school acceptances, top rank schools. And you&#8217;ll have to interview her to ask her where she got accepted.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not saying she&#8217;s the only one. I don&#8217;t know if she is the only one. She&#8217;s the only one I know out of University of Texas of Austin Design that got grad school acceptances, top rank schools and money. She&#8217;s selected prac. She&#8217;s got some intriguing work that she&#8217;s going to be doing and finishing out.</p>
<p>So you have to go interview her. And what was it like? I was one of her senior design teachers in Texas. And so, she was competitive. And boy, she was racking in those admissions and scholarships. I&#8217;m like, oh my God.</p>
<p>Simon. Oh listen, I love Simon Charway. I met Simon Charwey online. And one of the things that is so important to this work that I&#8217;m doing is that, and even there&#8217;s a segment in Dori Tunstall&#8217;s new book, Decolonizing Design. She&#8217;s got a piece in there that talks about the importance of the place to start is to understand your indigenous origins. It&#8217;s a requirement.</p>
<p>And I have researched, I had a family issue. I&#8217;m African American, but I&#8217;m also Filipino American and I&#8217;m West Indian. And I&#8217;m from DC. My backgrounds, my Zoom backgrounds, my story, everything. I&#8217;m what they call MGM: multi-generational mixed.</p>
<p>And I was raised African American. But culturally, I am Danish West Indian and I&#8217;m African American from D.C. I can hand dance. But I got four different grandparents, four different places.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m Filipino from Cavite. So I&#8217;ve got a Filipino family, I have a West Indian family, I have an African American family, and I have a Native American family. So my grandfather was white, an American Indian from Fauquier County.</p>
<p>So in this story I have one African-American grandmother, my father&#8217;s mother was African-American. And all of these people resolved at Howard and ended up in D.C. And I learned to hand dance. And that&#8217;s my story.</p>
<p>But in that richness is I&#8217;m Danish West Indies. My grandmother is indigenous Danish West Indian and Ghanaian. And my research led me to finding&#8230; Long story, but you can buy my book. Black Coral is my memoir. That work needed to be done in my life before I could even begin to do the scholarship on design.</p>
<p>And I have Ghanaian, DNA that I needed to process. I had a missing Filipino family that I needed to deal with. My mother came up looking a hundred percent Filipino on Howard&#8217;s campus. There was so much that needed to be dealt with in my origin, my heritage, my being born into this drama, that Black Coral &#8211; you can get it on Amazon &#8211; was a lifetime work that I ended up publishing in 2013. And with that, I found my tribe and origins of my Ghanaian DNA.</p>
<p>And with that comes the authenticity of my African aesthetic. You have to know the slave trade. So I know the Ghanaian slave trade is my history. The colonizers, the French and Martinique, the Dutch, the Portuguese. I know my colonizers are the Danes. And I know my history is with the Ghanaian Kings.</p>
<p>I traveled all through the West Indies for years. Census records, census projects, studied Danish census records, putting together and answering the question, &#8220;How in the world do I have Ghanaian DNA?&#8221; It&#8217;s from the slave trade.</p>
<p>And so with that, I found my tribe and where they are in Accra. I have a cousin, my great-grandmother&#8217;s nephew, who went back and became what they call &#8220;enstooled.&#8221; And he sojourned back to Ghana, and he&#8217;s a chief of the Virgin Islands. They enstooled him and met the lineage of all the tribal leaders.</p>
<p>So I have all of these records and pictures of the tribe, which is really genuine. I mean, it&#8217;s research. I&#8217;m hoping to go to Ghana. It&#8217;d be my second trip to Africa. But I&#8217;m hoping to go on a research trip to look at the decorative painting houses and things. I&#8217;m going looking at the Ghanaian aesthetic.</p>
<p>And I met Simon online. He wanted my advice on his African Design Matters project. We began a conversation on Instagram. And I saw him, and while everybody&#8217;s sleeping, I&#8217;d wake up and go to their conferences. They&#8217;re like 7, 12 hours.</p>
<p>So y&#8217;all sleeping. While y&#8217;all sleeping I&#8217;m with the Ghanaian designers and I&#8217;m hearing their agenda. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, these Pan-African brothers and sisters, they got a manifesto. And while we sleeping, they&#8217;re manifesto-ing.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I saw him interface online, working hard to integrate his research into a North American discussion. So he&#8217;s trying to meet us. He&#8217;s working with AIGA. And I was fascinated with his work because I would get up and listen to them lecture and their conferences. And I said, &#8220;Simon, the only way that you are going to break through with your research in North America, you got to get it ratified. And the only way that I know to get what you&#8217;re doing ratified is Yale.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did. I just said, &#8220;Simon, go to Yale.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how to get to Yale, but you got Professor Mafundikwa, you know him. He&#8217;ll tell you how to get to Yale. Use your network to get where you&#8217;re going.&#8221;</p>
<p>All I can tell you is that I did what I had to do in that invitation of inspiring. I never say I&#8217;m anybody&#8217;s mentor. Let him say it. I inspired him to reach, you got to ratify this work. And the only place I kind of think this fits is Yale grad school.</p>
<p>And Mafundikwa can help you. I just live in Connecticut, so I can tell you the highway and the exit to get off. Yale isn&#8217;t my school, RISD and MICA, they&#8217;re my schools. I said, &#8220;I can just tell you the exit off of A 85. But you got enough that&#8230; Try.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I didn&#8217;t even say, &#8220;Try.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Do it.&#8221; And all the way up to the last moment he got accepted, we walked him through application, acceptance, the airplane ticket. We walked him through the whole thing. And so when he got here, it was the week after, two weeks maybe he&#8217;d been here and it was summertime. He finally got here.</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;Phil, would you take me up to Yale? &#8220;I want to meet Simon.&#8221; And I asked my son and I said, &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to hit him. We got some coats around here?&#8221; He&#8217;s in New England, he&#8217;s never seen snow. He&#8217;s going to wake up and it&#8217;s going to be, &#8220;Oh my God, where are the ancestors? Where are the outfits?&#8221;</p>
<p>So the guys put together a few sweaters because he didn&#8217;t know. So he is just going to wake up and it&#8217;s going to be frigid. But you wake up and it&#8217;s freezing, you know, what you going to do? So I said, &#8220;Brothers, give me some sweaters and some coats. And Phil, can you take me to Yale?&#8221;</p>
<p>I found him and he was so grateful to meet me. And then he touched my heart. He touched my heart, Maurice. He said, &#8220;Will you take a picture with me?&#8221; I took pictures out in front of where he was living. He said, &#8220;Ms. Miller, can you take a picture with me at the Yale sign, Welcome to Yale?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, do you know where it is? He said, &#8220;No. But I got to have a picture with you standing in front of Welcome to Yale.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh my God. And Phillip was so patient. We drove around Yale&#8217;s campus looking for this one sign that Simon wanted. It&#8217;s one of these entranceway gate things to the campus, and he could not tell us on what corner, what street. And we drove all around Yale, which is a city school. Where&#8217;s the sign that says, Welcome to Yale? Well, we finally got it. He was so excited. You can see the picture on Instagram.</p>
<p>And he was so excited to meet me. We stood out and he kept taking pictures. He says, &#8220;The elders won&#8217;t believe it.&#8221; That&#8217;s what he kept saying. He says, &#8220;The elders won&#8217;t believe that I got here unless I take a picture of Welcome to Yale with you. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, Simon.&#8221;</p>
<p>It took him three years to get here. It started pandemic. He started reaching out. Everybody&#8217;s online. He found me. I started going to their conferences. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Mm, I get it. I get what you&#8217;re doing. I see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Simon is just proclaiming and got his research. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, you trying to cross over into an international space. I got it. You need to go to Yale, brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>So from inspiring him, it took three years. The process of application, getting to work together, through the interviews, through the plane ticket, through the whole thing, through &#8220;Professor Miller, can you meet me and stand in front of the sign?&#8221; And forever grateful. And he knows I have Ghanaian DNA.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m like, &#8220;For the elders, Simon, I know I don&#8217;t look Ghanaian, but trust me, I know some Ghanaian art. I know Ghana. I know I got Ghana family. I got a chief. I know my chiefs. I know my story. We are craftsmen artisans. My tribe is, if you&#8217;ve seen the decorative coffin makers, the Sowa tribe, Accra Ghana, is my tribe. And so I come natural. We&#8217;re designers, we are wood cutters, ship makers, and we build the decorative coffins of Ghana.</p>
<p>And so when I start talking to you all about some African design, I know what I&#8217;m talking about. And that&#8217;s what I mean. That&#8217;s what mean about, I got stories to tell that nobody else can tell. I got footnotes to make that nobody else can make. I&#8217;m not compiling footnotes. I&#8217;m creating these footnotes and I&#8217;m leaving them in places for somebody to write something, whatever you&#8217;re writing.</p>
<p>And Cheryl Miller said, &#8220;Well, if I said it, it&#8217;s a footnote, and it&#8217;s a research and it&#8217;s a proof.&#8221; And my DNA says, I&#8217;m Ghanaian. And Simon and I connected. The ancestors connected us. Okay, so that&#8217;s the way the drum beats.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
At this stage of your career, how do you measure success? I mean, what does it look like for you now with all of the accolades and the awards and the prestige? What&#8217;s success like now?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Just remember me and acknowledge my friends. And when the ones that I&#8217;ve poured into make success on their own, that they remember. I do not talk about this famous thesis without acknowledging Dr. Leslie King Hammond. I refuse to talk about all these awards that stem from one thesis without celebrating Dr. Leslie King Hammond who was my academic coach and the scholar in my life that said, &#8220;Go get some skills.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I always tell y&#8217;all, well, when y&#8217;all have your big conferences and stuff, just make sure somebody got Ms. Miller. Is she is on the plane? Is she on the train? Somebody got her bag? Just remember me.</p>
<p>I went to AIGA, I met Teressa Moses from University of Minneapolis. We were walking out of the main theater at one of the breaks. And she and her friends were going to dinner and she turned to me and she said, &#8220;Professor Miller, you want to come and go to dinner with us?&#8221; And I kind of looked like, &#8220;Y&#8217;all don&#8217;t want me coming to dinner with y&#8217;all.&#8221; And she welcomed me. She said, &#8220;Come on, go to dinner with us. We&#8217;re skipping the rest of this. We going to go find dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that meant more to me in the world that she included me. I can&#8217;t have gone through and have the passion for our community if I haven&#8217;t been through the pit of hell with this industry. The only reason I did this is so that you all, any measure of it, you don&#8217;t have to go through anything I went through. You don&#8217;t want to go through what I went through.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t want to go through Jim Crow trying to steal my portfolio and not giving anybody a chance. I don&#8217;t want to bore you through the civil rights era. So the only reason I&#8217;m accessible at all&#8230;</p>
<p>Maurice, you don&#8217;t want to go through anything that I&#8217;ve gone through, not even a measure of it. So if there&#8217;s anything I can do to help you not go through it, I&#8217;m going to do it because I&#8217;m not above the law.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there something that you haven&#8217;t done yet that you want to do?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve thought about that. And the answer is not really. I&#8217;ve thought about, do I want a branding project? Do I want a book? Do I want&#8230;? When I really was performing and servicing, I ran hard for my clients. There were projects I really wanted and I just knocked on those doors until I found the project. I worked for my portfolio. And I did the best, the absolute best I could do in the area and the era of performance that anyone could do.</p>
<p>And I say that because I came through pre-civil rights, civil rights, and post-civil rights era. And some of these anthologies and biographies and stuff I read online, I&#8217;m not far from Thomas Miller.</p>
<p>Thomas Miller has a clip I use in my lectures. You find them on history.org. I use them in my lecture when I&#8217;m talking about corporate designers A1, number 2. Week 2, symbols.</p>
<p>I got a YouTube university in him. He&#8217;s 80 some odd years old. He just got a posthumous AIGA medal, and I just met his daughter because he won the award the same year with me. But they got a clip on history.com and he&#8217;s 82 years old. And the pain in his eyes, I felt, and I knew. He said before Gold Shark Associates, his voice was frail, but you could see it in his eyes. &#8220;I just wanted to open a little place&#8221; &#8211; he&#8217;s talking about Chicago &#8211; &#8220;And I wanted to open a little place and do little brochures and logos, but no one would patronize me.&#8221; And I saw it in his eyes.</p>
<p>And he was awarded the medal for endurance or persistence or something like that. And when they were reading his bio and his daughter was there to accept posthumously, my mind flashed back to that history.org clip. And I saw the pain in his eyes and I said, &#8220;Mr. Miller, I get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll tell you on this other side of this story, I have so many answers to stuff I was going through when I was younger. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Where&#8217;d that come from? Why am I doing this? Why is this so difficult?&#8221; This, that, and the other.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example. I won&#8217;t call his name. Out of respect, because I don&#8217;t know whether he&#8217;s alive or not with us. But a gentleman on Dorothy Hayes&#8217; list. See, I&#8217;m young enough and old enough to be in New York at the same time and many of those on the list, I knew personally. One in particular, I won&#8217;t call his name, had a studio downtown. And he called me one.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
&#8230; I had a studio downtown, and he called me one day. I knew him personally, and he said, &#8220;Cheryl, I want to give you my studio.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What?&#8221; He says, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; He says, &#8220;I want to give you my studio.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, where you going?&#8221; He says, &#8220;I&#8217;m leaving New York.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t give me an explanation. I didn&#8217;t understand it. He said, &#8220;Have Philip run in a truck and come down and take it all out of here.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I want you to have this. In other words, maybe you can do something with this because I&#8217;m pulling out of New York,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wow. Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, Philip rented the truck, we went down and I pulled out this guy&#8217;s studio. Sometimes, depending on where I zoom, I have two plants. They were loft plants. I have one in my living room and one in my office. They&#8217;re 40, 45 years old with these plants, I took out of this gentleman&#8217;s studio. Every time I see those plants, it reminds me of how difficult it was for us to make it in New York City, and I never understood why in the world he closed his business and pulled out in New York, until I started working with the history and working with systemic racist practices, and working on my research. I said, &#8220;Oh my god, none of us were scheduled to live.&#8221; One of my favorite questions I answered, why did Milton Glaser get all the black work? That thing was driving me nuts, so Cheryl, you&#8217;re going to figure that out. Stevie Wonder, Mahalia Jackson, Hugh Masekela, all of these black&#8230; How&#8217;d he get all the black work? Dorothy Hayes&#8217;s people are hanging all around.</p>
<p>For me to realize, Cheryl, you were living in that. You were living in that era, and this is why your friend, who&#8217;s on Dorothy&#8217;s list, who was in the show, why he called you up. You&#8217;re a young kid, okay? Next likely to succeed, he&#8217;s just going to give you his stuff and pull out. I didn&#8217;t realize that till I saw his name on the list. And then, I dropped into history, and then I dropped into Jim Crow. I dropped into the cannon. I dropped in&#8230; I said, &#8220;And, now none of them could&#8230; How far could they get?&#8221; He gave me everything. Library books, equipment, chairs, drafting tables. I picked it all up. Two plants that remind me of the story. One is in my office here, it must be eight feet tall of&#8230; Yeah, one of those scheffleras, and then I have a ficus, it&#8217;s gorgeous. It&#8217;s very comfortable in my living room, about seven, eight feet tall, was in his loft.</p>
<p>See, this is the kind of stuff I live through. You&#8217;re not going to find a footnote unless I make it. I don&#8217;t have time to compile footnotes. I have time to make footnotes. I just made you a footnote. Okay? I just made your footnote. This whole conversation is a footnote. Anything I&#8217;ve, said recorded on this&#8230; You know The Chicago Style?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yeah, the whole conversation&#8217;s footnote. So, success for me, is that I lived to see it happen. I lived to see you all prosper. Congratulations on your 10 years. I listened to your anniversary.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
You&#8217;re doing what someone should have done for you, which is the key to this. You interviewed yourself. Somebody should have interviewed you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes, yes.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Maurice, tell me something about this. I don&#8217;t know. Okay, so this is at, you threw you all an anniversary party. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No. Somebody, I won&#8217;t call names, should interviewed you.&#8221; I don&#8217;t do podcasts except, I fill up a studio room. Okay? That&#8217;s not what I do. I don&#8217;t make them, but I&#8217;ll talk. Don&#8217;t invite me if you don&#8217;t want me to talk. That&#8217;s not what I do, but I know who&#8217;s doing them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
So, whoever&#8217;s listening to this one, y&#8217;all should have interviewed him and see, I&#8217;m crazy enough now I say that. Y&#8217;all should have interviewed&#8230; Maurice got to interview himself for 10 year victory. Okay, so guess what? I enjoyed your anniversary interview.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
If I had a all that design show, I would&#8217;ve interviewed you. I would&#8217;ve known to interview you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I appreciate hearing that. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
I enjoyed the story, and I enjoyed&#8230; Thank you for having me for the 500, thank you for 248. I know my number. I&#8217;m 248 and I&#8217;m in the Smithsonian. I am proud of you. Okay? Apples don&#8217;t fall far from the tree, and listen, I just shouted out, somebody with all that podcast show, needs to interview you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve been quoted as saying, &#8220;My motto is to live your life is your story, to live your life for others is your legacy. Leave a legacy.&#8221; I feel like so much of this conversation has been about your legacy. What do you want the next chapter of that to be? What do you want it to look like?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
I just have&#8230; My writing needs to be done. Please don&#8217;t ask me about it. Okay? Don&#8217;t ask me, I&#8217;m not going to tell you. I need my writing to complete, and I have investigated places I should be, I mean, I could be. There&#8217;s no should, there ain&#8217;t no should in life. Places I could be. I want to just give my gift in the right place, for the rest of my time, and Maurice, I don&#8217;t know where that is, but I can feel it. I&#8217;m doing what I&#8217;m supposed to be doing right now. I&#8217;m supposed to be leaving the footnotes, collecting the archival work from dead designer estates. I was so touched. I met Reynold Ruffin&#8217;s son. He went out to Stanford to see his father&#8217;s collection. For the heirs, to say thank you is a blessing for me. I think being someplace high and mighty would take me off course.</p>
<p>High and mighty is&#8230; What? Don&#8217;t you want to be a dean of this or this, that, and then I&#8217;ll be doing so much administration, I wouldn&#8217;t be there for you. I can&#8217;t change what I&#8217;ve been doing, I&#8217;m just going to keep doing it. I&#8217;m there for you, Maurice. I&#8217;ve always been there for you. I&#8217;m leaving footnotes. I&#8217;m there for you, and if you all remember me, I&#8217;m touched, and all of the accolades helping my visibility so I can do more of that in places that want me. There are still places that do not want me, and when they don&#8217;t want me, they don&#8217;t want us collectively, they&#8217;re still there. But, like I said when we started, &#8220;Oh, I see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, there are plenty that want me in my community, and want to share this center stage of design and experience. That&#8217;s it. I want to finish my journey, and I think I&#8217;m also in a place, where the expectancy of surprise is, I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;ll be led and where I&#8217;ll be invited, but my heart has been good about this for 50 years. So, I have an expectancy that God will reward openly, what I have done secretly, for the body of Christ in this, and for the body of designers, wherever they come from. I&#8217;m good, Maurice. I&#8217;m good. And by the way, I&#8217;m waiting on the MacArthur because&#8230; I&#8217;m waiting on the MacArthur.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That needs to be on the next chapter, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
The reason that I want it is, it will just help me finish. That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;ll help me finish. Because imagine doing all of what I&#8217;ve done with no payment. It is a heart&#8217;s desire because it will help me finish my work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up, and I know, of course, people can Google you and find you in many, many places, but are there any places in particular, that you want to point people to, so they can keep track of what&#8217;s going on with Cheryl? Cheryl Miller everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Cheryl Miller, everywhere. No, I post every&#8230; I don&#8217;t like Twitter, so you don&#8217;t find me much over there. I&#8217;m on Instagram, I&#8217;m on LinkedIn, and if you want to support the NFTs, I&#8217;m on foundation. I&#8217;m painting, I paint in the summer. That was an empty nester, right before pandemic exploration. I left DC to go paint at RISD, and life&#8217;s pivot got me sophomore year signing up for graphic design at MICA. So, I always&#8230; In the empty nesting era, right before all of this took flight again, I said, &#8220;Charles, is anything left of your painting?&#8221; I paint in the summer and I paint during the break, and I would like a good gallery. I hate all these rules and regulations, Maurice, when it comes to art and design. You got to have this, you got to have that. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh man, I can paint.&#8221; Really?</p>
<p>I can design with my eyes closed. Really? I would love a gallery to just get in relationship with me and let me just send you paintings, and you do what you do. If you ask me what I want, it&#8217;s like can&#8217;t this be a touch easier? That&#8217;s all. Because I&#8217;ll put in the hard work, man. I&#8217;ve done the work. This is not been an easy tour duty. I did all this with the design studio and my family, and all this, the advocacy, the legacy part, so I have worked some and I continue to work. So, anything that gives me grace and favor, I&#8217;m appreciative.</p>
<p>So, when the schools invite me, &#8220;Would you like a teach a class? We&#8217;ll figure out the tech.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Thank God. Thank God, University of Texas. Thank God, Howard. Thank God ArtCenter. Thank God, somebody&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;Miss Miller, we&#8217;ll make it easy for you. All you got to do is beam in with your lectures and grade and read, and do whatever you have to do. Come visit every now and again.&#8221; Just make my path a little easier. So, when I say the MacArthur, &#8220;Yeah, just make it a little easier, a gallery.&#8221; Oh, I&#8217;m not going all over New York, querying for a gallery for my paintings. Philip&#8217;s got a catalog. You want to see them? He&#8217;ll send you a catalog. You want to do business or what?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not doing that. No. You want to do business? I&#8217;ll give you some paintings. I guarantee you, you take my paintings, you&#8217;re going to make money. This is what this is about. I know how to make money in art, but I just don&#8217;t have the patience for the hurdles, and the exclusion, and what the industry does something so simple. Kids just want to draw and paint and make a living. And so, it can&#8217;t be that difficult, so if you ask me anything that will make my life easier with what God gave me to do, from the time I was a kid, would be a blessing in my life, Maurice, and you guys just remember me when you go to the conference, &#8220;Does somebody get Miss Miller? Does she have a seat?&#8221; Do like Professor Teressa, &#8220;You want to go dinner?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, I want to go dinner. I want to hear what y&#8217;all are doing the road ahead is, think about your retirement people. We can come back and talk about that. Think about it. Make decisions now, because your clients will get old with you, they won&#8217;t be there. Hiring managers are your age, they won&#8217;t be there, so you&#8217;ve got to plan that out, and we can come back and talk about that we need the industry, we need professors. Oh my god, we need professors. If I get a call once, I get a call a hundred times a day. &#8220;Cheryl Miller, you got any more Cheryl Millers?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, I got professors, associate professors that can get&#8230; Who can&#8230; Associate professors, not adjuncts, associates that can&#8230; Ready for tenure. We need them up the ranks terribly. The opportunities are there, but they&#8217;re not many of us. They&#8217;re not many of us. Silas, Pierre and Tasheka can only teach a couple places, at a time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been like, get your paperwork. Let&#8217;s get going. We need professors. Integrate that with your practice. Figure out your retirement, live happily ever after. Stand up, show up on these teams. Don&#8217;t drift back. Be outstanding and stand out, Maurice. I&#8217;ll say that one again. Be outstanding and stand out from the rest. When you can, make your gift the first. You won&#8217;t be the only one, but you&#8217;ll be most memorable. Don&#8217;t imitate. Don&#8217;t duplicate. Create. Prosper the God-given gifts in you, and don&#8217;t take no for an answer. Sometimes you got to wait. Have some patience. God knows if I can wait 50 years for the wind of change, y&#8217;all can wait 50 weeks. You can wait 50 days. I still meet people today. Cheryl Miller, I didn&#8217;t know anything about it. I said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m sorry you didn&#8217;t read the article 35, 40 years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>You know why they didn&#8217;t read it? Because the books used to come in the mail, and if you didn&#8217;t see your picture in the front of the book with an award, you toss it to the side. But, I was right there writing. The article&#8217;s in the back of the book, and I shout out and thank everybody, and always thank. Thank you, thank you, thank you to my allies in this season. Both Ellen Lupton and Brian Collins have been a blessing for me, and I just want to make sure that I thank them openly and I thank them for their favor and their grace. I always thank everybody who&#8217;s helped me. Michelle Spellman, I acknowledge her in my lectures, she&#8217;s first black female art director, Time Inc. I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing. No Sports Illustrated. I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing. She gave me my first job for Time Inc, and next thing I knew Time Inc. Corporate was my client, and I had Cheryl Miller Design.</p>
<p>I thanked Michelle. I always thank Fo [Wilson]. Yeah, 50 years, Hip Hop graphics. Listen, Fo said Cheryl Miller to McDonald&#8217;s, one of the best jobs I had while she was art director of YSB. We helped each other. I was in seminary and Michele Washington remembered me, when they were doing those design before. They weren&#8217;t giving us any design medals and stuff, she wrote one of those profiles for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, Design Journeys. I remember that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yeah. So, we helped each other, we did what we could. I gave everybody work. Then, I&#8217;ve had some wonderful allies in this season. Professor Sansone, and all of my professors at UT, Doreen Lorenzo, and Kate Canales, and Kelsey Gray, and Sean Adams, and Bruce&#8230; I mean, I&#8217;m thanking everybody like I&#8217;m getting an Emmy here. When I met you with former president, Julie [inaudible 01:46:21], she said, &#8220;Come on out of here. Get out of the woods. I&#8217;m going to take you to Chicago.&#8221; Regina Roberts came all the way, and beautiful allies, brought me all the way, came all the way over here, get my boxes. Philip said, &#8220;Cheryl, how many times we got to move these boxes?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Until I figure out where to go.&#8221; I saved everything. The whole Cheryl Miller, I don&#8217;t dare put up all my work on the internet, y&#8217;all got a sample.</p>
<p>So many people, all of the awards people, all of the Smithsonian, and there&#8217;s so many people to thank, and so many people to remember, my allies and everybody who&#8217;s asked me for lectures, there&#8217;s so many people to thank. And so, I&#8217;ve had grace, in spite of, so expect the grace. Expect favor. Live well and life will be well to you. This is the last time we going to have this conversation. I want to shout out to Pratt. We&#8217;re keynoting their graduation and they&#8217;re honoring me with&#8230; I guess they&#8217;ll be announcing it soon, by April. I&#8217;m sure that by the time this runs, it&#8217;ll be announced. Yeah, they&#8217;re giving me an honorary degree. I&#8217;ll be keynoting at Radio City musical, for their graduation. And so, Maurice, it&#8217;s really simple. Whoever will love me, well, I will love well back, and when you love me, you love my community I represent.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, amen to that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
And, I love you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Amen to that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
I love you and I&#8217;m proud of you. Congratulations for your 10 years. You&#8217;ve been a blessing for me. I wish you well in all of your endeavors, and all of your segues, victories, transitions, your writing, the podcast, God will smile on you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
We keep doing this and I&#8217;m honored to be number 500. I know for sure this will be, unless we&#8217;re doing this again, and I&#8217;m a hundred years old and you&#8217;re like&#8230; I expect a long life, but I don&#8217;t expect that you&#8217;ll interview me again, but maybe so. We don&#8217;t ever know. We don&#8217;t know yet. And so, I&#8217;m just listening. I think there&#8217;s some places where I&#8217;m yet to arrive. God doesn&#8217;t show it to you all, and He doesn&#8217;t give you everything that you want. When your gift, you get sent and you get placed. So, each and every day I pray, &#8220;Okay, lead me, guide me what you want me to do next.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think there are other schools, I think there are other projects. I think there are other kids and scholars, and I&#8217;m proud of everyone&#8217;s life that I&#8217;ve touched. I&#8217;m grateful for all my allies in this season, who&#8217;ve helped me, and they&#8217;ve helped me greatly. For everyone who&#8217;s supported me, over the years, clients and the stories are truthful. I pray a special prayer that God would thank you, because I can&#8217;t thank you better than when the God can touch your life and say, &#8220;Oh, well, that thank you came from Cheryl Miller. She prays for you.&#8221; So, that&#8217;s what you want. You want God to thank you for how your kindness and open door to me has blessed me.</p>
<p>Once again, I want to thank you for always supporting me and having interest in everything that I&#8217;ve been doing, and I&#8217;ve been thanking everybody, and I just want to make sure that I shout out to my universities that have accepted me and brought me into my new work. And, of course, we mentioned University of Texas, Austin Design with Doreen Lorenzo and Kate Canales, and everybody in Austin there, has been great to have me and my new scholarship. It all really started rolling with Nikki Juen at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island, and Professor Kristina Sansone at Lesley Art and Design in Boston, and put me on the faculty there. I want to shout out and thank Bartley and Howard University, I was blessed to win an award for my new class there, and that&#8217;s been exciting and a real, real big shout out to ArtCenter, and Sean Adams had a vision to have me join out there.</p>
<p>And so, it&#8217;s crazy, but this new hybrid scenario is allowing me to reach all of the universities that would have me, and so I&#8217;m very, very grateful and thankful for that. Everyone that nominated me for all these great awards, Ashley over at AIGA and everyone at Cooper Hewitt and the One Club. Oh my goodness, everybody has just blessed me, all my friends at the Poster House keep remembering me. A special shout out to, not sure if I mentioned before, Regina Roberts over at Stanford has been helping me with our collections and making sure all those footnotes are in place for the next generation. And, the universities that have honored me with our honorary awards. And keynote speaking. I&#8217;m going to shout out to Vermont College of Fine Arts, MICA, RISD and I&#8217;m going to be keynote and receiving honorary from Pratt for this graduation 2023.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve gotten everybody, there&#8217;s so many people to thank over the course of a 50-year career, and especially no one had to remember me, Maurice, and pull me out of the card catalog in this season of Renaissance and resurrection and restoration, or whatever we want to talk about Cheryl D. Miller 2.0 since the pandemic, it&#8217;s really been a blessing. Everyone who has had me write, speak, lecture, teach something, it&#8217;s all keeping me alive, and we&#8217;re moving. Especially you, Maurice, I&#8217;m so, so appreciative of everything that you&#8217;ve done and from remembering me from the very first, back when you were doing South by Southwest presentation, you came looking for me. I was definitely in the card catalogs of the decimal Dewey system and you brought me forward, so there&#8217;ve been a lot of people that have been instrumental. I don&#8217;t want to forget anybody, and if I have, please trust me, I remember every good will and wish toward me. I just am appreciative of the path of revision and vision that you have given us. I just want to say thank you.</p>
<p>And so, one more shout out to ArtCenter and Howard and UT, I&#8217;m just really grateful for the universities that are having me. Of course, all the clients that put up with me, and my designers that put up with me over the years, it&#8217;s been really&#8230; What a crazy journey. But, I&#8217;m living to see it happen, and in the next generation of those who seek this to embrace this career. So Maurice, thank you. God bless you, God keep you and keep revisioning the past, over and over again for us, and thank you. This is your buddy, Cheryl on [inaudible 01:53:37], and we thank you. So, with that, congratulations. Thank you for having me. Once again, you have my permission to make this one collectible. How about that?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Thank you for&#8230; I mean, I don&#8217;t really even know where to start. Just thank you for being you, for being an example, for being a trailblazer, for continuing to write and rewrite the canon, to show that we are here, we&#8217;ve done the work, we&#8217;ve existed, and we can continue to be here, and we have you as an example to show for that. So, thank you. Thank you again for coming on the show, for our 500th episode. It was a pleasure. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yes, Maurice. To everybody, just keep going and compete. Just compete. That&#8217;s all I have to say. And, don&#8217;t shy back. You have to be in it to win it, so go for it. There&#8217;s so many more now. There were only a few of us back in the day, Maurice. But now, the tribe is an army. All right? And so, we can move forward mightily, and I pray that blessing upon us all, and don&#8217;t resist AI, go get your certificate. Okay, my love.</p>

<p>Agencies play a critical role in ensuring that the next generation of creatives reflects the world we live in, and Rudy Manning takes that responsibility very seriously. As the co-founder and chief creative officer of <a href="https://pastilla.co/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Pastilla Inc.</a>, he is dedicated to not only providing services for a diverse range of clients, but also for making opportunities to get more people of color working in the design.</p>
<p>Rudy starts off talking more about Pastilla, and showing the ins and outs of what it takes to operate an agency. He also spoke about growing up in Panama and Germany before coming to the U.S., shared some stories of his early days designing DVD magazines, and how the combination of these experiences brought him to founding his own creative agency. Rudy also talked about teaching the next generation of designers at ArtCenter, being board president at <a href="https://www.artdivision.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Art Division</a>, and gave some great advice for anyone looking to start their own agency one day. Rudy&#8217;s passion for all things design and his drive to help uplift others truly makes him a design leader worth following!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
My name is Rudy Manning and I am a creative director. My title is the Chief Creative Officer for an agency that I started about 18 years ago or 19 years ago now, called Pastilla based out of Pasadena or Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, that&#8217;s pretty good. So you&#8217;re coming up on 20 years of that.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, I know. We&#8217;re getting excited. We put a big event together for everybody who&#8217;s been a part of this journey. So yeah, it&#8217;s a big milestone.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It feels like the milestones sneak up on you. You&#8217;re so busy sometimes in the work and doing it that you look up and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Wait a minute, I&#8217;ve been doing this for 20 years?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m telling you, it goes by&#8230; When you&#8217;re in it, sometimes it feels like it&#8217;s treading along, but then you look back and you&#8217;re like, wow, awesome. Yeah. Super grateful to still be in business and have it continue to thrive. So super excited.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2023 been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Really, really good. There was a lot of things shifted in the agency about five years ago. I merged with another agency that was one of our partners. They were doing a lot of development for us and probably for most of the time at the agency, up to that point, they were the main development partner for anything we did that was digital base. We decided after a long relationship to just come together, it just made sense. And that really shifted the trajectory of the agency the past five years. We&#8217;ve matured, we&#8217;ve grown substantially in that time. Really, really just have a little bit more of a focus.</p>
<p>2023 is, I think, really excited because, although a lot of things in the economy are uncertain, I feel like we&#8217;ve done some pretty smart things that have kept us afloat and kept us strong. Definitely the kind of work that we do in those years of the pandemic really ended up helping out for us because we&#8217;re a creative branding agency, really branding led, but we do a lot of digital products. So obviously there was a lot of investment in things digital. So that really helped out and now we&#8217;re positioned for a very steady growth of 2023. So, so far so good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, were there any big goals that you wanted to accomplish this year?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Well, last year one of the big goals we had was growth. I&#8217;m going to go a little bit into agency talk. This might go a little bit deep, but I think if somebody&#8217;s out there listening and has an agency, I think this is really important. Every year is different. Sometimes it&#8217;s like revenue, sometimes it&#8217;s profit, sometimes it might be people. There&#8217;s the goal, growing. And last year it was a lot about refining the team, making sure that the people who we had were working well together. Not only just processes, but the personalities and the right roles and the right balance of folks that really can help continue to lead and build the company and service our clients.</p>
<p>So that was a really huge goal and we owe huge testament to a lot of people in our agency, but definitely our HR team and we really refined a team. At the end we started off the year now knowing that the staff that we have is solid, they&#8217;re working together, a really well oiled machine and I feel like we&#8217;ve achieved that last year and this year now it&#8217;s becoming about really working. I&#8217;m calling the title for this year, nurture the details, which is about going a little deeper into the relationships that we have with our clients and not just servicing them, but really understanding their needs from a full 360 to be able to deliver as much value as we can. Not necessarily growth from growing clients, but growing the clients that we have currently.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s really what I&#8217;m focused on for this year, and so far so good. We&#8217;ve already in the first two months have been able to do that pretty well. So I&#8217;m looking to continue to foster that in the team. And from the creative, the same thing. Being able to push the creative further and further, be able to deliver the best at every single thing that the client sees and making sure that they continue to stay with us, continue to come back and continue to see us as a strong partner to be able to service them in other things that maybe they didn&#8217;t even think we can help them with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s jump more into talking about Pastilla. You&#8217;re the co-founder and chief creative officer. You&#8217;ve already given a little bit of background about the team and the services and stuff. What really sets Pastilla apart from other agencies?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny, when I was in school, in design school, I graduated and a lot of people during that time were like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to jump into web. I&#8217;m going to work in motion. I&#8217;m going to work in print.&#8221; But really at that time, you had to know a little bit of everything, but I really liked having to cross-discipline position and I was working everything from packaging to environmental to doing film titles, commercials, apps, even back in 2003, 2004. I&#8217;ve always been in this cross sector of creative where it didn&#8217;t matter what discipline it was.</p>
<p>Now, that&#8217;s been really fun. A really, really exciting 20 years. I&#8217;ve learned a lot. It wasn&#8217;t easy because you do have to, to continue to sell, there is a certain pattern and you want agencies or you want clients to have that one thing that they think about you. And when you&#8217;re working and building the agency, it&#8217;s really tough to figure that out because you&#8217;re just taking things as it comes. And especially if I&#8217;m the kind of person that&#8217;s excited about a lot of different things, it&#8217;s been tough. It was really tough, I would say the first 12, 13 years. We were doing motion one year and the next year we&#8217;re doing the launch campaign for Microsoft Surface Tablet in 2012 or &#8217;13. So very, very different projects, but exciting nonetheless. But made it difficult because when you tell the story of who your agency is, you really want to have the repeat factor. Even if it&#8217;s a different story and positioning, you do want to have this focus. So that was tough.</p>
<p>Around that time, 2013, I decided what we really do well and what I really like to do the most out of everything we did was branding and really looking at every client that came to us from a branding perspective, whether it was a brand new client where it&#8217;s a brand new company where you&#8217;re doing strategy, naming, identity system, and then executing that, which makes sense because we had that full service. That was something that finally, I would say at that time, we were able to start really honing down who we are as a branding agency. But at the same time, what made it interesting is we also had a deep understanding of how to put that company or that brand in action. So how it applies in digital, how it applies in motion, how it applies in print, and being able to do the full picture after we do the identity system.</p>
<p>It took a long time to do that and to get to that point, but I feel like that was one huge defining point at refining who we are, that made us stand out, at least let&#8217;s say in 2013 to 2016 or so. Then, I would say around that time, 2016, I started feeling like I wanted to do work that mattered a little bit more. Not that any of the work that we did didn&#8217;t matter, but something was in me that felt like I want to be able to be a part of the communication and deliver creative to projects and initiatives that had some kind of social impact through some different situations.</p>
<p>I ended up learning a little bit about the government work and how to approach it. It took a very long time, but I really got interested in being able to service the same kind of level of high end creative, the same kind of level of thinking and focus that we give to the private sector clients, but give it to more civic, public or nonprofit clients. And I would say it was specifically public sector. So we won one project, for the city of Pasadena we did a anti-tobacco campaign. That went really, really well and that&#8217;s when I got the bug of like, &#8220;Wow, I really like this idea of designing for the people directly, designing for communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>And now looking at eight years later or so, just last year rebranded&#8230; Well, this year, we actually just finished rebranding a city, the identity, the strategy and we&#8217;re going to continue to serve them. It was a really amazing experience to be able to put all that we&#8217;ve learned this first 18 years into branding a city. One of the reasons they picked us was because we weren&#8217;t a typical public sector type of agency. They said it right in the first town hall that they had. They chose us because we were not the typical public agency that spoke government and so forth. They felt like we were a little bit more on the ground and had a fresh perspective. We commend them for that as well because I know that often we lose because there&#8217;s other agencies that know how to speak that.</p>
<p>So I would say we have this well-rounded full service agency that&#8217;s branding focused, most of our clients come through us for that. And that we&#8217;re civic minded, civic social impact minded. We do things in sustainability and so forth. And sometimes some private sector clients come to us because of that. We also have that passion for doing work that matters and that directly affects people and communities.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I would have to imagine that city branding project was a lot of fun. When you think about the scope of what that entails, it&#8217;s not just, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re going to make a logo and a style guide.&#8221; There&#8217;s so much that has to go into that level of branding because a city is more than just a company, it&#8217;s more than just a brand. It&#8217;s not a society but I say that to say that the scope of something like that is immense.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. We underestimated some parts of it. The discovery and the research that we had to do, especially because we&#8217;re not based in the city. It was the city of Corona and we&#8217;re maybe about an hour away from them. One of the comments in the beginning when they first introduced us to the city council was like, &#8220;Oh, why didn&#8217;t you guys go with a company that was in the city of Corona, or from the city?&#8221; We had to invest a lot of time into proving that an outsider, an agency that comes can have a fresh perspective, can do just as good if not a better job than somebody who&#8217;s really close to the city.</p>
<p>So the discovery and the strategy was a lot of work, a lot of workshops, a lot of meetings, a lot of popups that we had to do to get engagement and really validate the messaging and the final outcome of the identity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s tough to get right, because so many people that are in a city, it&#8217;s not just business, it&#8217;s not just commerce, it&#8217;s everyday citizens. It&#8217;s so so hard to get right. I guess the reason I&#8217;m speaking about this so passionately is because I&#8217;m in Atlanta and we were known for a spectacularly bad city branding campaign back in the early to mid 2000s. I happened to be working in the city, working in tourism. So I got to see it unfold from the inside about how bad it was. But yeah, we were known for a spectacularly bad branding campaign called Brand Atlanta. I was working in the city in tourism at the time, and just seeing it unfold from the inside was horrible because you could tell that the people that were putting this together, and I think they got a local agency to do it, but what can happen, and I think you probably know this too, is that the client can get so held up in what their vision of it should be, that it&#8217;s hard for the agency to do the necessary research and work that needs to happen in order to really provide good work.</p>
<p>And so basically we just had all these suits that were in our tourism board. There were like, &#8220;Atlanta is this,&#8221; and as someone who&#8230; I&#8217;m not from Atlanta, but I&#8217;ve lived in Atlanta, I&#8217;m from the South. I was like, &#8220;Atlanta is so much more than these things that you think it is.&#8221; They thought Atlanta was the zoo and the baseball team and all the very family friendly, squeaky clean sort of stuff. But I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Atlanta is also hip hop and strip clubs, it&#8217;s all of that. And you&#8217;re trying to sanitize this vision of what the city is, because at the time they were trying to get more conferences to come to the city, which was the main point of them doing the rebrand is to make the city seem more appealing.</p>
<p>They did it. They rolled it out. We had, I think it happened at a Falcons game where they did the whole Brand Atlanta rollout. They had the symphony and they wrote this song. They had this song that was written with T.I. and Usher and it was all horrible. People hated it. It was so bad. It was so bad. There are very little, if any traces of it still around in the city because they quickly covered it up after it went out. So city branding is tough. It&#8217;s so tough to get right.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
That would be our worst nightmare. And actually, there&#8217;s one project that we had pitched a couple years ago. I can&#8217;t name the university, but we came in very close to winning it. We ended up losing it to another company who had a lot of experience in higher ed. One of the main things I pitched that got us very close is I said, &#8220;This is not a logo identity we&#8217;re doing. We&#8217;re really doing a political campaign in a sense. We have to approach everything we do to get people, the students, the instructors, to believe in the direction before we even go in that direction. So we have to really understand what it is that the students and the faculty need and what do they believe to then be able to communicate an identity system.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what happened is at some point it seemed like they jumped the gun. We didn&#8217;t get it. Three years later, they end up reaching back to us saying, &#8220;This was a horrible experience what happened to us, everybody hated the logo. There was political nightmare, PR nightmare, communication nightmare in the school.&#8221; And obviously it was too late at that point, but they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Definitely we should have gone by you.&#8221; There&#8217;s literally an email saying, &#8220;We regret going with this other agency. We should have gone by you because the direction that you were pitching was exactly what we needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the ideas was the students at the school, the graphic design students, they need to be a part of this identity for the school. They need to have their hands in it in some kind of way. All of that just really gets people to feel that this came from within. It has to feel like that with anything like that. If not, it&#8217;s really, really hard. So I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s crazy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:18:34]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When new projects come in with you sitting at the head of the company, do you get to work hands-on with them?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
I do. We&#8217;re about 35 or so people with some contractors definitely goes up to maybe even close to 50. The design team, we&#8217;re pretty nimble. So I&#8217;m the creative director. We have an art director and we have a few graphic designers and UX designers and so forth. But I still am, as the acting creative director, at least maybe for the next couple years, I am potentially looking to bring in a creative director.</p>
<p>So that means that basically I don&#8217;t design, but I review. I give critiques. I give from either my art director or my lead designers, senior designers. They will go and do the work themselves and then come back, present to me. I give them feedback, I give my thoughts. They present to me, I give them feedback on how to present, what kinds of things to say. And every now and then I&#8217;ll have to present. But seldom, less and less. I think my team&#8217;s gotten to the point where they&#8217;re pretty good at understanding my vision and so forth.</p>
<p>Sometimes in the beginning I set some parameters, I would say, around the direction of where we should go based off the strategy or whatever it may be. But often they&#8217;ll come to me with some ideas and then I&#8217;ll take those ideas and give them some feedback on refining them, even if it&#8217;s just general higher level concepts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you&#8217;re not, like you said, working hands on but you&#8217;re still pretty close to the project in that you get to see it unfold, kind of step by step.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I do a lot of other things. My partner now rents most of the operations, but I&#8217;m still really responsible for a lot of the business development, the relationship of our clients and overseeing all the accounts, not just from the creative, but managing the entire perspective of the direction of that client.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does a regular day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Lot of calls. I think these days, we&#8217;ve had an office for probably the first 15 years of our company and just after we merged with Kremsa, is the name of the company that we merged with. Just after that, we decided, you know what? Let&#8217;s go remote for a little bit. We were trying to figure out how the two companies were going to come together. We did that for about a year, year and a half. We started looking for an office. Then the pandemic hit. So it was frustrating for me working remote, but I literally learned to adapt. We all have adapted pretty well for it. Sometimes we obviously meet, and I say that because one of the drawbacks now is on a lot of meetings because we have to force those kind of interactions between people. So that means my days are pretty booked up with calls.</p>
<p>I would probably say I spend about at least five to six hours a day on calls. I would say half of it is internal things, whether it be operational meetings or looking at something we&#8217;re doing internally to market ourselves or project stuff, account managers presenting to me where we&#8217;re at with the client, the margins, what new projects are coming along and so forth. So I do that and then probably 10, 20% of the day might be some creative meeting that I have with the team where they&#8217;re presenting some ideas or so forth. But most of it&#8217;s operational business meetings. Yeah, I would say that&#8217;s basically my whole entire day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Business development&#8217;s important though, because you got to bring them in, you got to bring the client work in.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. It&#8217;s always been something I&#8217;ve done forever, just naturally, it&#8217;s been something that I&#8217;ve always just somehow understood. So it&#8217;s the thing that probably, from a financial point of view, that&#8217;s the biggest value right now that I bring to the company is the business development. Most of the projects come through something of my relationship or some doing of our content or so forth. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is it tough balancing the creative and the business sides of running an agency?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
It is, and it&#8217;s getting harder and harder because I talk about how we&#8217;re now remote and how many hours I&#8217;m on calls, because so much of it is that higher level strategic thinking of the business, the client, operations, who do we need to hire? What&#8217;s happening with this hire? Do we need to bring in another person for this? Hey, there&#8217;s an issue with this client, this is what we need to do, or here&#8217;s some cool things that we can do or new projects, pitches, proposals. All of that really takes up most of my time.</p>
<p>So staying creative is really, really important for me. I try to do that as much as I can. I sort of time box it. So one of the things, we just moved into a new house a year and a half ago, two years ago. So I&#8217;ve had a lot of fun just doing interior design and designing the space and just remodeling the house and not just hands on, but the actual design part of it. So I&#8217;ve had a lot of fun doing that and bringing my design into that. It&#8217;s been something I&#8217;ve been enjoying. At least right now, that&#8217;s definitely a way I&#8217;m getting my creative output. Also teaching is really great as well. Hearing students work and giving feedback at that level as well, that also feeds me tremendously.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I want to talk more about your teaching later, but before we get to that, I want to learn more about you. I want to learn about how you got to where you are now, where you&#8217;re running an agency and you&#8217;ve got it staffed with all these designers and things like that. So tell me about where you grew up. Are you originally from California?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
No, actually I&#8217;m Panameno. I was born in Panama. Yeah, I came here. We immigrated with my parents here when I was seven or eight years old. We came here. My dad joined the Army. He thought this is probably the best way for us to make a living for him and provide for us. Immediately after that, I would say about a year after we moved here, he got shipped to Germany. So I was basically, that&#8217;s where I learned English was in Germany.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
I only spoke Spanish, so I was there for about almost four years, I think. Then we came back to United States when I was 11. We were basically in Los Angeles, and then we moved to Rialto. So basically from 11, 12 up, I&#8217;ve been in Southern California area. I went to high school in Redlands. After my mom and dad divorced, my mom moved towards that area and that&#8217;s where actually I ended up meeting somebody who gave me a little bit of a hint about me wanting to maybe study graphic design at the high school. So I went to Redlands High School and then from there I graduated, went to Cal Poly Pomona for a couple years, and then ended up transferring to ArtCenter, which is what brought me to Pasadena.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, back before you went to Cal Poly Pomona and everything, as you were traveling between these different countries as a kid and then eventually settling in California, did you always have an interest in design and creativity and stuff like that?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
I think it was mainly just drawing. I loved to draw since I was a little kid. My brother as well. We both used to just draw together, and he&#8217;s a graphic designer too. My dad studied architecture for a little bit in Panama, but he&#8217;s always drawn and painted his whole life. We have a pretty artistic family. So my dad, since we were little, always was drawing and we&#8217;d copy his drawings and he&#8217;d go one by one and then we&#8217;d follow what he was doing. We&#8217;d do that all the time, in front of the TV. We&#8217;d sit down and he&#8217;d be talking, he&#8217;d be showing us what to do. Did that for many years and my mom, a little bit after, my mom and dad divorced, my mom started a business. So then got to see that part of it. She&#8217;s been really successful at it.</p>
<p>So got to see the benefits of owning your own company and your own business and what kind of freedom that gives you, and the satisfaction and seeing her in it, that drove that part of it as well. So I think those two things combined is what got me the framework of thinking of building an agency.</p>
<p>I would say, I remember I stopped drawing at 11 or 12 years old. I don&#8217;t know why.I think I just ended up playing baseball. My focus was different and I was just playing baseball all the time. And then one day, I don&#8217;t know why, I just remember, I was 14 and I was just like, &#8220;You know what? Let me draw a baseball player.&#8221; That&#8217;s what I loved. And I remember I drew Orel Hershiser. I had it in my art class and I took it to school. I remember that feeling of everybody like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, you drew this? How did you&#8230;&#8221; That reaction, you kind of had a similar background as an artist, you&#8217;re like, man, there&#8217;s this feedback that you get that&#8217;s a little bit of this high. I&#8217;ll never forget that. So I just kept on drawing and then that went to painting, and then I was just taking art and painting classes. And eventually that took over my passion for baseball, and that&#8217;s all I wanted to do, was draw on paint sports figures.</p>
<p>I wanted to be like Leroy Neiman, who&#8217;s a very famous sports fine artist painter. And then until I was in one of my art classes, I think I was a junior or something, it was a student in there who was a really good artist who was going to graduate. And I asked him, &#8220;Hey, what are you going to do after school?&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to go to PCC, Pasadena City College, and then I&#8217;m going to transfer to ArtCenter and study graphic design.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s that?&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;It&#8217;s like doing things for MTV.&#8221; And I remember going, &#8220;Dang.&#8221; That was the days of MTV, MTV, the real MTV. And I was like, &#8220;That is amazing. Graphics for MTV.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t even know the word graphics actually. I just thought art for TV that people could see. So I remember that, and that always stuck with me.</p>
<p>So when I graduated, I was just looking for a school that had graphic design, which wasn&#8217;t that many. And Cal Poly ended up being one of those schools. So that&#8217;s where I dove into graphic design for the first time there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How was your time at Cal Poly Pomona?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
It was interesting because I think in high school I was pretty kept in. I didn&#8217;t do a lot of stuff. I feel like when I got to Cal Poly, I was in the dorms and I just got this freedom of like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, I&#8217;m on myself.&#8221; So I went down that, it was a lot of fun, but it was like I probably didn&#8217;t know what to do with all of that energy. So one thing is I would say my focus wasn&#8217;t there as it should be those first couple years. I want to say, despite that, I struggled a bit with graphic design there. For whatever reason, I didn&#8217;t make the connection.</p>
<p>There was a lettering class I remember. The lettering class that we had, it was all about craftsmanship. You had to draw, let&#8217;s say the letter E with Prisma color, and it was like a five-inch height type and you have to draw it so it literally looks like it&#8217;s printed. It was very difficult that class for me, not because I couldn&#8217;t do it, I could do it, but I didn&#8217;t have the patience. I wanted to design. I wanted to draw. I remember the instructor saying, &#8220;If you get a C or under in this class, I highly suggest you don&#8217;t continue in graphic design, &#8217;cause graphic design is really tough.&#8221; And I remember as, not to say fine artist, tough as well, but in terms of, I think what he was saying is, &#8220;You really have to love this to really continue in this direction.&#8221; It was one of the first classes in graphic design you were suppose to take.</p>
<p>So towards the whole class, I was just like, I&#8217;m struggling. I think I&#8217;m going to get a C. The final project was you get to draw something and use letter form and typography and visuals together. So I got to do this book cover. I remember I did a Malcolm X book cover and you put it up to class, the final, and everybody was just looking at this project, looking at my project, and the teacher was like, &#8220;Who did this?&#8221; It was the first time out of the whole entire term that I felt any kind of positivity in that class. All the time, it was just like&#8230; I remember going, &#8220;What&#8217;s happening?&#8221; And so I walked out of class and the instructor, said, &#8220;Hey, I know I said you shouldn&#8217;t be in graphic design, or if you get a C or lower, I think you&#8217;re going to get a C.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, I know.&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, I think you should stay in graphic design though.&#8221; So I was like, &#8220;Oh, huh, okay.&#8221; I walked away, still struggled, still was a tough time in the other classes.</p>
<p>Somebody had told me, &#8220;Hey, you got to take a class at ArtCenter. You&#8217;d be really good at it.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you see, because I&#8217;m struggling in every graphic design.&#8221; I did great in the painting classes. Those are the ones I really loved. So I took a night class. She ended up just convincing me, and I was nervous because I thought, man, back then I thought ArtCenter&#8217;s this sort of mecca. I took a night class, like an extension class while I was still at Cal Poly.</p>
<p>The first day you go and you present your ideas for a logo. I was just drawing and sketching and concepting stuff, put it up. I knew the moment the teacher started talking, the first, not even to my project, another student, I thought this, I&#8217;m in love. I literally felt like this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. And I just never took another class at Cal Poly. Again, Cal Poly, this was early on in Cal Poly for their graphic design. So they really were working things and some amazing designers came out of this. So that was just me at that time. But I just fell in love with graphic design at ArtCenter. I eventually finished my foundation at Cal Poly. Then I got a full scholarship actually after a couple classes I took at ArtCenter. I built my portfolio, some from Cal Poly, some from the ArtCenter, and I got a full scholarship, a James Irvine scholarship.</p>
<p>That was it. Kind of changed my life. The only hiccup during that time is a girl that I had been dating ended up getting pregnant. So I ended up having a child pretty early on. So I was starting ArtCenter while learning to be a father at the same time. So that&#8217;s another story.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Definitely all came all at once, but definitely matured me and I think eventually was all for the good, of course.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I&#8217;ve heard from a lot of folks on this show that sometimes when they go into school having a lot of this artistic ability and love, sometimes the school can almost effectively snuff it out of them through the professors or the courses or anything like that. So it&#8217;s good that you still had that spark and decided to continue it by going somewhere else that was probably more focused in the direction that you needed to go, which of course now, based on where you&#8217;re at right now, that was a good direction to take.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. It&#8217;s crazy. You never know. Those little moments. I remember thinking like, &#8220;Oh gosh, the classes are at night and this and that.&#8221; But yeah, I loved those classes. I wanted to spend all my time in the ArtCenter at night classes then. So, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;ve graduated, you&#8217;re out there as a working designer. What was your early career before you started Pastilla?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
As I mentioned during school, I definitely like to get my hands in everything that was design. I think it&#8217;s one of the reasons I mentioned earlier, I like even just interior design. I have a passion for anything that is where you&#8217;re taking these elements of your artistic being and putting into some physical space or visual space or designing a city. So I definitely can see how all those things combining works together. And I did the same thing at school. And so when I graduated, I wanted to work somewhere that didn&#8217;t want to push me into one direction. I didn&#8217;t want to work in an agency that only had me do print, only doing web, or only doing motion. So the best place was a company then called&#8230; I had a couple different companies, but I think towards the end it was called Quick Band Networks or DVD Mags, which was you basically are designing a DVD magazine is what they call it.</p>
<p>So every month you would get a subscription of a DVD. One of them was short films. You get one DVD of short films, another one was music. So you get to have these music videos and all this content on these DVDs. I got to design basically the editorial, but the interactive part. So I got to do the identity of each of the magazines. I got to do the interactive part of the DVD. I got to do the animation of the DVD. I got to do the ads. So that to me was perfect. I got to get my hands in all of that. That&#8217;s really where I started for the first couple of years. I started freelancing a little bit after that. And that took me to Nokia for about four years. I worked there really as a freelancer.</p>
<p>I had a feeling at that time that at some point I&#8217;m going to start my own company just because I really enjoyed working with my own clients. So in between that, I took freelance projects at night and weekends, and I really enjoyed having full control of like, I&#8217;m presenting to the client, I&#8217;m giving them my vision, and I&#8217;m able to directly connect with them to be able to persuade them of the concept that I think is right. Rather than, here&#8217;s a bunch of ideas, now you have somebody else pitching it for you. So I really love that. So I thought, I&#8217;m going to start my own studio. But I needed to build up enough momentum as a freelancer.</p>
<p>So I really freelanced for about six years. Then when I was at Nokia, I said it was a time of my life, I got divorced in my late 20s and I thought might be a good time for me to do this now for a lot of different reasons. So I told Nokia, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to start my own company. If you guys would like to hire more of me, I&#8217;d be happy to take the work and continue as my own company.&#8221; And so Nokia was my first client. So I&#8217;m super thankful for that. For the first couple years, a lot of the work we did was Nokia. And so that was the first momentum of Pastilla, which was then called Pastilla Studio.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s amazing. You must have made some really great relationships at Nokia in order for them to entrust you with that. Say, I&#8217;m going to go out on my own. And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, great. We&#8217;ll still toss some work your way.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. I worked really hard for them, was really great people, a lot of them, some of them I knew from ArtCenter. I got to meet people from all over the world there and really was a time where technology was in a bit of transition. Imagine that was like 2000, a couple years before that. The iPhone definitely hadn&#8217;t come out. But before that, Google had just come out a couple years before that. It&#8217;s really early on. So I think I came with that diverse background of motion, interactive and print, and being able to cross-discipline. I think that really, the design director, Gerardo, liked that so I was able to really use my diverse background and experiences to Nokia and help the team out for those four years. So yeah, we did some great work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Honestly, coming with those skills at a time when as soon as you said DVD magazines, I was like, oh, I already know when this happened. This is turn of the century or turn the millennium, whatever, like &#8217;99, 2000. I remember those DVD magazines vividly. But yeah, coming with all those skills at a time when technology and design and the web were growing at this rapid pace, the stuff that you were doing didn&#8217;t really even exist 10 years ago. The advent of the personal computer and the internet becoming something that was no longer bound to DVDs or CDs that you get in the mail. The fact that things were growing at this rapid pace and you&#8217;re coming in with all these skills, especially at a time when companies are trying to decide, &#8220;How do I become a part of this new thing? How do I have a website? How do I take orders online or do all this stuff?&#8221; And you show up to the scene well-equipped like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ve got the skills if you got the work.&#8221; Sounds good.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yep, exactly. Exactly, exactly. It was a really fun time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now while you were building Pastilla, it sounds like there were other ventures that you were doing as well, right? You did some work with an app, you founded a film company, I guess. Tell me about those other ventures.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Obviously from let&#8217;s say 2004, those first 10 years were extremely busy for me. Continues to be anytime you&#8217;re a business owner. But those first 10 years I was basically raising my kids. I have a boy and a girl from my first marriage. And so I was raising the kids while starting this company essentially. We have 50-50 custody. So they got to share that experience. So those first 10 years was extremely busy. I would say around 2014 maybe, 2013, a friend came to me about an idea that he had for a startup, and he wanted me to look at it and see if I was interested in being his partner. He presented to me, did this whole pitch. And basically what it was is, to be honest, it&#8217;s not that different than what Instagram Reels is, what TikTok is now. The only company that was doing something sort of similar was musically that ended up becoming TikTok back then.</p>
<p>But even then it was very different, the UX. So basically at the end, what it was is you select video clips from your phone and it strings a video edited to music together. The thing that it did a little different was it took the music patterns and did the edit based on the pattern of the music, the rhythm, the beats per minute. There were 5 second ones, 15, 20, 30 I think it was. And so we built the app, we started it, we got some funding.</p>
<p>I learned a lot. Number one, I was able to use all of the tools and experience that I have learned, not just from owning an agency, but also working with clients as well. So it was really great. But it was tough. It was tough because it was at a time where we saw Instagram really starting to, I hate to say it, but just copy what everybody else was doing, so see what&#8217;s happening. And so like, &#8220;Oh, I like discovery. I like how Snapchat&#8217;s doing. Okay. Yeah. All right, let&#8217;s do this.&#8221; And then they bought the music catalog of Universal then.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s where, okay, this is going to be really tough to&#8230; Even though the technology was different and interesting, it was not going to be able to compete because it had to be a platform. So it was more like a tool and a feature. So after I would say couple years, we got some awards and things out of it and definitely some really good recognition. But we decided to close that. Around that time, I got married in 2014, so we&#8217;ve been married about nine years. And my wife is actually a filmmaker. She has always wanted to be a director. And during that time, she was building her career. So she started making brand films. She&#8217;s an amazing storyteller. It was perfect because obviously I had done motion, I had been part of doing BFX for films and so forth.</p>
<p>So we started&#8230; It&#8217;s her thing. This is what she runs to this day now. It&#8217;s been maybe five years, but we took some of the experience that I had in motion and put it into what now it&#8217;s actually called Fe Films, Fe Brand Films or Fe Films. So she does brand films, she does motion graphics work, but really the thrust is she&#8217;s looking to have it be a full-fledged feature film company. So she&#8217;s doing some short films and some narrative work on that. She&#8217;s got a couple scripts that have been optioned and she&#8217;s been working with. So that&#8217;s, when you saw Fe Brand Films, that&#8217;s what it is. All of the motion parts that were Pastilla or most of it got diverted into Fe Films now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now also you&#8217;re board president of Art Division. Can you tell me a bit about that?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah. About two, three years ago, let me back up a little bit from that because, say about 10 years ago I had this thought and I had mentioned to my wife, &#8220;Wow, our studios are empty on Saturdays and Sundays. Wouldn&#8217;t be amazing to go out and bus students from the different areas in Los Angeles and different groups and be able to teach kids graphic design?&#8221; I&#8217;ve always had a passion for kids. And at that point I had just started teaching as well. So I thought, yeah, this could be really interesting to do. And so I had it in the back of my head, but with everything else, this was really busy and I never really was able to put the gas on that.</p>
<p>And then about two, three years ago, somebody recommended me, introduced me to Art Division, which was a school in Rampart District of Los Angeles that was teaching fine arts, visual arts to kids specifically in that area, primarily of Latino immigrants. Me speaking Spanish, being Latino, I felt like, I wanted to get to know a little bit more about the school. So went in, heard a little bit about it. Definitely saw some potential for me from my background coming from teaching at ArtCenter. Also, some of the things I have been thinking about in the past and learning from what they&#8217;re doing, seeing if that could be something I can learn from and be a part of something that was really giving kids who have graduated high school, have amazing art talent, be able to give them the ability for another chance to develop a career in arts. And then me maybe be a part of introducing design to their curriculum.</p>
<p>So after six months of being on the board, I was selected as the board president. And for the past year and a half, that&#8217;s been my role. What I&#8217;ve been doing is slowly trying to find ways to include graphic design into the curriculum. And we hope, hopefully by this fall, we have at least a couple classes that we start to teach. We&#8217;re developing that right now. We&#8217;ve done some graphic design workshops where kids have come in to hear a little bit about who I am. I&#8217;m also looking to introduce some of the designers from Pastilla also potentially to even go there and do some teaching and so forth and be able to give back to these kids. Because some of them, they&#8217;re artists, they have a passion for art and design, but who knows? That art background could end up becoming a design passion and graphic design passion and can end up having a career. It&#8217;s really tough and really expensive to go to school these days, especially art school. So giving them some of these opportunities I think could be really interesting. So I&#8217;m looking forward to how this develops.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now along with this community work, which by the way sounds amazing. I would love to have been a part of a program like that when I was a kid. But you&#8217;re also an instructor at ArtCenter College of Design where you went to college. You&#8217;ve taught there now for almost nine years. Tell me a bit about what you teach.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah. I started teaching in the product design department, which is industrial design, we call industrial design, product design at ArtCenter. I was brought in to teach graphic design to the product design students essentially. And then that turned into me teaching the students, there was a class that helped the product design students or industrial design students how to brand themselves as they get ready to graduate, how do they position who they are and so forth. Those first classes, I would say that first year, year and a half, which for me to just get my feet wet and see do I like teaching period, how can I fit into my schedule? Does it work for me? And what are we getting out of it myself personally? And also am I being able to deliver and be good at it?</p>
<p>I loved it. I really, really liked doing it. I got as much out of the students as they get as much out of me. It&#8217;s definitely a very symbiotic relationship and I think that really helps my perspective in how I teach. And so I taught in that department and immediately obviously, I wanted to teach in the graphic design department. I was a natural inkling. It&#8217;s kind of tough to jump into teaching, especially ArtCenter because you have some of the top designers in the world and artists in the world teaching there and everybody wants to teach there. So I ended up getting asked to teach a branding class. They knew the work and stuff that I did. So I started teaching what now, the bulk of those years, up until maybe last year, I was teaching what was called Transmedia, which is basically a branding class that looks at what I mentioned, the cross sector of how branding and identity systems get implemented into and go into action when it comes to digital, motion, space, environmental.</p>
<p>So that was my class and I absolutely loved teaching, it was called Communication Design Five, Branding for Trans Media, I think. I did that for about six, seven years. I took a pause on that class. I was teaching two classes a week while I was still running the agency, still with this transition of the two new companies. Well, last summer I took a pause for two terms because teaching remotely and being remote as an agency was taking a toll on me. The classes at ArtCenter are about five hours. So if I was teaching two classes, that&#8217;s two days that I&#8217;m on class for five hours on screen. And then as I mentioned, my work is screen time stuff. So I ended up feeling after six, seven years, I don&#8217;t know if I have enough bandwidth.</p>
<p>Things started opening up obviously in the fall, but I started now with Art Division and my focus on there, I&#8217;m started to rethink a little bit of my long-term strategy in teaching and am I going to continue teaching at ArtCenter? So currently, I&#8217;m still teaching now. I&#8217;m back to teaching in the masters program, a branding futures class, which is I&#8217;m teaching with another instructor about strategies of future casting, how brands could future cast either their audience, either the business models, any kind of future strategic thinking of a brand. So I&#8217;m teaching that class now and I&#8217;m going to be teaching one more during the summer. But I think that after that I&#8217;ll be taking a pause for a while to do some art work and thinking with Art Division and put my time into that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look, you got to fill up your own cup first. It sounds like with everything you&#8217;re doing with Pastilla of course, and then also with teaching, you can get depleted very quickly.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. Definitely. It all kind of works together in a way. So it is definitely a lot to juggle, but it all works for the greater good, really, ultimately also of Pastilla because when I do things for Art Division, not only am I helping feed ourselves, but we also tell that story of how we&#8217;re involved in Art Division when we work with some of our other clients. So that&#8217;s really a important part, shows that our agency isn&#8217;t just working directly with clients that have social impact, but we are actually volunteering our time as well.</p>
<p>And then for ArtCenter, the same thing. I&#8217;ve learned so much from teaching, communicating your thoughts of visuals. I&#8217;m sure you know this, it&#8217;s very, very underestimated how difficult it is to be able to say, communicate in words what something should be visually. I don&#8217;t think we think too much about that, but it&#8217;s extremely hard and it&#8217;s definitely an art to that. I learned a lot of that through teaching and different personalities of creatives and designers and so forth that I think has also helped Pastilla. And also just teaching at ArtCenter as my brand, my personal brand has definitely just validates the agency, validates me and so forth. So it all works together in my head for a bigger vision.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, no, it makes sense. It all feeds into each other. I don&#8217;t mean this in a bad way, but the work you&#8217;re doing teaching, of course, that informs how you talk to clients or how you present the business to clients. But then you also say, &#8220;We&#8217;re not just an agency, we also give back to the community.&#8221; And so that is where Art Division comes in, where you&#8217;re saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m doing this to help out students that are interested in design or kids that are interested in design.&#8221; So it does all feed into each other, but I think what it does overall is it shows just how passionate you are about design, just outside of a client-vendor relationship. This is your lifeblood. You live and breathe this stuff.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Exactly. Love that. That&#8217;s exactly it. Yep.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do your students teach you?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Patience. I think, number one, it absolutely keeps me on the cusp of the, I hate to say design trends, but how culture is affecting design. How each generation takes what we&#8217;ve done and reinvents it, takes what they see in their environment and mixes it up to have this new creative aesthetic and how that continues to evolve. Absolutely, I always want to make sure that I am not blinded by my past or my history of what I always thought the design aesthetic was. I always want to feel like I&#8217;m at the edge of what&#8217;s happening, if not what&#8217;s also how things are changing and looking even ahead of that. So the students definitely keep me on my toes when it comes to that.</p>
<p>Second is understanding different design, creative mindsets or personalities. Different students take feedback completely different. And how you have to be very agile and nimble in how you communicate things. It could be how direct you are. It could be how open you are about a direction. Some students are really great at giving, they need very prescriptive directions on something and they need to develop that. They need to know things aren&#8217;t going to be so prescriptive. You need to connect the dots yourself, but you still have to be somewhat prescriptive. And then other students, if you&#8217;re too prescriptive, they literally will get stuck and confused because they don&#8217;t really understand exactly what you&#8217;re saying. And there&#8217;s everything in between.</p>
<p>So being able to read, pick up on how a student is reading you quickly, that&#8217;s really important, and being able to adjust your communication style. And that&#8217;s the same for our design team in-house and also clients as well. Communicating to clients, like you mentioned, we&#8217;re all creative to some point and when we&#8217;re communicating visuals, I take those little tools that I&#8217;ve learned in communicating to the students and I borrow those things to communicate to clients as well when I need to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you are at a really unique vantage point, I feel. One, you&#8217;re an agency owner with Pastilla, you&#8217;re also an instructor, so you&#8217;re teaching the next generation of designers. How has being a design instructor informed how you approach Pastilla?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny because we ended up changing the name of Pastilla from Pastilla Studio and in 2012 to Pasta Institute. It was supposed to be this sort of cheeky way to institutionalize something that isn&#8217;t really institutional and formalize it when it really isn&#8217;t formal. It was a very small studio then still. But there was something that made it feel like it&#8217;s established, but then at the end you&#8217;re kind of like, no, they&#8217;re a very buttoned down agency. So the one thing is that it was funny because the kind of person that I was and the designers that I would get, was naturally sort of a mentor and people would say, it&#8217;s kind of like a school where I saw designers really grow when they came to work at Pastilla and go and do amazing things, even after Pastilla.</p>
<p>And so that teaching part, I think was a part of Pastilla from the beginning, just naturally, I guess, maybe it just came from me or maybe just because I had to. Because I needed help and I needed freelancing and I had different people from different points of view, and that&#8217;s just my communication style. So that institute, I remember that now, it&#8217;s just Pastilla, obviously. We simplified it, but that part is still there. And for I would say a good eight years, every quarter at least, we had a different intern. I wanted to make sure that the designers that we have respect the interns and part of the work is that they do have to mentor. I&#8217;m mentoring as a creative director, the student, and also our design team that&#8217;s also working with the mentors is also teaching.</p>
<p>Teaching, it&#8217;s absolutely critical to any leadership. You can&#8217;t have a leader, not be a good teacher. You have to have somebody that can have that empathy of understanding that how to communicate to do something is an important part of being a leader and that not everybody takes or understands the same words or receives the same kind of communication the same way. And I think that&#8217;s an important part of being a good leader. And I felt like that&#8217;s an important part of Pastilla. And the creative team, the account team, the management team, and I try to continue to infuse that. Sometimes probably, I would say maybe the designers are like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, there&#8217;s too much work. I&#8217;m teaching and designing.&#8221; But I think in the long run, they&#8217;re going to see that this is some important tools that they learned.</p>
<p>So in short, before I was teaching at ArtCenter, I think we had that part embedded into our culture, that teaching impact or that element. Then I started teaching, that just got elevated, and then I just literally created with Pastilla, I would just have internship programs. So the students would come from ArtCenter. They&#8217;d intern at Pastilla for three months, continue getting taught there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you mentioned with the education work you&#8217;re doing with ArtCenter, that part of what you&#8217;re teaching is about future strategic thinking. From your perspective, what do you think agencies can do moving forward to ensure that the future of creatives reflect this world that we&#8217;re in right now? Of course we hear a lot about diversity and inclusion. There&#8217;s always going to be some new bleeding edge tech, which right now is what AI, Chat GPT, et cetera. How can agencies start to move forward, making sure that this next generation of designers, creators, et cetera, really reflect the world that we&#8217;re communicating and creating for?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
I think one of the things, along the line of teaching, I feel like at least that was a feeling when I was in school, was that if you don&#8217;t come with a absolutely impeccable portfolio, you cannot work at some of these big larger agencies. This was the case. Thankfully, I went to ArtCenter, I had that experience, I had that portfolio at that time. But not everybody gets those opportunities. Not everybody finds those paths. Maybe they might have the opportunity, but they somehow didn&#8217;t have that one person that said, &#8220;Hey, take a class here,&#8221; or whatever. There&#8217;s lots of amazing schools in the world, in the country. But I feel that a lot of it starts in looking, when you&#8217;re interviewing somebody, agencies and design companies need to look farther deep into who that person is that they&#8217;re interviewing, way past their physical, where they&#8217;re at, at that moment with their portfolio.</p>
<p>Because for us to start developing or having the agencies and creative agencies, digital agencies, every kind of agency, reflect the real world, the designers that we have, the copywriters, the creative directors, the animators, the programmers reflect the world that we actually live in. We have to know that not everybody is getting the opportunities that everybody who&#8217;s working currently in the agency&#8217;s got, period. And to do that, we have to take some risk and we have to take initiative. I think the number one thing is to open our eyes to giving opportunities to people who are not at that moment fully polished to be working at that company. And there&#8217;s portfolio schools, there&#8217;s lots of different ways that somebody can advance themselves, but most of it is about the work. But you can get that experience sometimes working at an agency. If you have just a little bit of the excitement, the passion, the energy, and that natural creative tendency, even without having a finished portfolio, if you&#8217;re given the opportunity at an agency, you can develop that portfolio quick.</p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s not easy. It is not easy, and it&#8217;s expensive because the design teams, everything we do is labor. So things will take longer, the people. But I think in the long run, we have to give people the opportunities to, especially underserved, people of color when they come knocking at our doors as an agency and you see their work, you see where they&#8217;re at, not turn them down or away just because their portfolio isn&#8217;t fully finished. There is space for them to grow. And those, sadly, a lot of the opportunities that come are because of that network. And I understand, you get portfolios come at you 24-7, but every now and then I&#8217;ll get one and I&#8217;m like, huh. Their portfolio is not fully fleshed out. And they don&#8217;t have the ArtCenter, art school, art design, design portfolio, but there&#8217;s something in their personality, something in their CV, something in their work, one project, it could be that can show some kind of interesting perspective that you could look at. And if we&#8217;re looking closer, we&#8217;re able to maybe find some talent that just hasn&#8217;t had the opportunity.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen that with Pastilla. One of our top designers that we have, I would say one of the top designers we&#8217;ve ever had at Pastilla didn&#8217;t go to art school like that. He went to a two-year school, it wasn&#8217;t a really fully flushed out program, didn&#8217;t have that kind of portfolio at all. We gave him that opportunity and he&#8217;s an amazing designer. So I think agencies need to be open to giving more experiences like that. That&#8217;s what I hope to do with Art Division is take that with the designers that go there, is find those ones that have that passion, be able to connect them. If the student wants to be connected, connect them to some of these other agencies. Just a simple, &#8220;Hey, check out this person&#8217;s work. I thought this. I thought this was interesting.&#8221; And giving them an opportunity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I highly agree with what you&#8217;re saying. I was just talking to a colleague of mine, Ricardo Roberts. He has a agency in New York called Bien, B-I-E-N. They do an apprenticeship type program where they bring in designers, maybe they&#8217;re junior designers or maybe they don&#8217;t have a fully polished portfolio, but they help to give them that experience that they need in order to then get out there and really work, whether that&#8217;s with agencies, whether that&#8217;s directly with brands in house, more of those types of opportunities need to be available.</p>
<p>I agree with you, as I&#8217;ve talked to folks here on the show that have worked in advertising and such, agencies can be pretty stuck in their ways about the type of people that they want and the type of experience that they have to have. They have to have followed almost a particular script in order to just get in the door. This is even at smaller boutique agencies. So it definitely sounds like that whole world needs a bit of a paradigm shift, I think.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah, no, absolutely. I love that. I would love to hear more about his program. I think formalizing something like that is awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I will connect the two of you after this interview. I will most certainly do that.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you stay creative and inspired in your work? With everything that you&#8217;re doing, I feel like you have a lot of input coming at you.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve always been a pretty curious person and I hope that I continue to be until my last days because I feel like that is the thing that hopefully will keep me up to speed on everything that is design at that moment. I would say design&#8217;s going to be completely different the next 30, 40 years. And I hope to know what&#8217;s happening and not be like, I would always say when I was in school with some of the older instructors, everything that we were doing was like, &#8220;Ah, everything looks the same.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like now I see some designers say the same thing to people in their early 20s. We have to understand things evolve, things change, and I want to be able to have that understanding. So staying curious and questioning and being, like I mentioned earlier, teaching and having young designers is a really important part of understanding that, how things evolve.</p>
<p>And so that definitely always keeps me fresh. I always have that curiosity of what is new, what is next, definitely keeps me fresh and excited. Right now obviously, everything happening with AI is really, really interesting to me. It&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ve always known is coming and we&#8217;ve seen it coming. And now tools are just more in front of us and the potential to be now in design where we&#8217;re going to see a total evolution of, and even fast forward of how we think and how we can be more hyper-focused in the creative and not so much of the doing. How we create is going to change as well. Even how to take simple things like a logo, what does that mean now in AI? Can a logo be so dynamic that it&#8217;s absolutely never static? Can a company have a logo where every customer has their own version because it&#8217;s that dynamic? Asking these questions I think are going to be super interesting. So always being on top of what&#8217;s happening, combining that with my experiences in the past, taking that in, I think that excites me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give for aspiring creative professionals out there? They&#8217;re heard your story in this interview. They see everything that you&#8217;re doing in the community. What advice would you have for them?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Wanting to be, let&#8217;s say, own a design agency or just jumping into graphic design?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;ll say wanting to own an agency because I feel like a lot of folks that I speak with now are definitely leaning towards more entrepreneurial efforts. Even folks in-house are trying to strike out on their own. So yeah, approach it that way.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
I would say, number one, you need to be extremely patient. We hear that. We know like, &#8220;Oh yeah, you got to be patient. Things come to those who wait.&#8221; But it really does. In that patience, you&#8217;re going to have a lot of times where you feel like you can&#8217;t continue. I remember the first 10 years when I started Pastilla, there was about three moments that I thought&#8230; Okay, I remember the first time was in the financial crisis. I thought, &#8220;Okay, crap, this really sucks. I don&#8217;t like this feeling. I don&#8217;t like this uncertainty. I don&#8217;t like this weight that&#8217;s on me.&#8221; And I thought, &#8220;If I make it through this and something like this happens again, I can&#8217;t continue.&#8221; And then four or five years later, boom, another blip and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Crap. Dang it. No, I&#8217;m going to continue, but you know what? This is it. After this one, that&#8217;s it.&#8221; Then you get one more, boom.</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s crazy is that over time, you learn that those blips, those bumps, you just learn how to deal with them. You&#8217;re smarter behind dealing with them. It&#8217;s not that the blips go away, you just aren&#8217;t scared of them at all. You&#8217;ve faced everything and every single time you&#8217;re a better entrepreneur, you&#8217;re a better planner, you&#8217;re more strategic. You know how to handle the downturns. That tends to scare away people. I know because I had those thoughts and I thought like, &#8220;That&#8217;s it.&#8221; But every single time you have to have that faith of, &#8220;You know what? I&#8217;ve got to believe in myself. I think I can do it. I love this.&#8221; You have to love this design industry. You got to love what you do. You got to love your clients and who you work with, and being creative, that definitely has to drive everything because if not, you could just be a banker or investment banker or something because there&#8217;s other ways to make money.</p>
<p>But this definitely is a combination of a lifestyle. And yeah, obviously there&#8217;s financial reward with it as well, but it definitely isn&#8217;t easy. Then I would say consistency. It&#8217;s not a sprint, it&#8217;s definitely a marathon. And there&#8217;s I would say in that marathon, there&#8217;s a bunch of small sprints. It&#8217;s one sprint and then you go into one phase and you got a marathon, marathon, marathon, another sprint. But it&#8217;s the consistency, the compounding effect of all of those moments of sprinting and marathoning and sitting and waiting and moving that all compile together for the good.</p>
<p>I would say in terms of, I think probably the biggest thing is people always ask, &#8220;How do you get clients?&#8221; And things like that. I think for me, one of the things that I learned early on, and I learned this as a freelancer, and this might seem super simple, but to this day, it&#8217;s probably the main thing that continues to feed our business, which is show people the work that you do. You finish a project, show it to people, tell the story. In the beginning, one on ones. I remember I was freelancing. I&#8217;d finish a project and then I&#8217;d have seven or people that I wanted to share that work with. And I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Hey John, how&#8217;s it going? I haven&#8217;t seen you for a while. We should have lunch, da da da. Are you still working at blah, blah, blah? I just finished this project. It&#8217;s down around where you live. It&#8217;s a new identity. It was a lot of fun, da da da.&#8221; That&#8217;s it. It was like a PDF or jpg in the email.</p>
<p>That was the first five, seven years of that I continued to freelance work that then got to start the company. And to this day, that&#8217;s exactly what I do. Now, it&#8217;s more formalized. And we do more of them. It&#8217;s not just projects, it&#8217;s articles, it&#8217;s stories. It&#8217;s the same thing everybody does. But I was doing it very early on where I didn&#8217;t really have anything to say other than sharing my work. And it was very intentional and very sincere as well. Because this business is about relationships. It&#8217;s a lot about relationships.</p>
<p>So you treat people good, you do really good work. You do everything you can to make sure the client&#8217;s happy and that will pay for itself. And from there, you share the work with those people, they&#8217;re going to tell other people about that, about you. And that continues to build more and more and more.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want that next chapter of your story to be?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
The past five years, we&#8217;ve grown exponentially. I feel that things are a lot more, I would say self-running, automated. The agency and the team is much more structured than it ever was. There&#8217;s some positive and negatives to that. The positive part is that it&#8217;s less weight on me. The positive part is that we can grow necessarily, not directly with me having to be on the ground every single second. There&#8217;s things that are built that can continue to feed the company on its own even without me. So those are the good things.</p>
<p>The downside is that there&#8217;s a lot of weight, or the downside I would say is that I do less creative than I did before, and I do more strategic thinking of the company. There&#8217;s been great things and I have to continue doing that. And I know in the next five years with that growth that&#8217;s happened, we have had some interest in people acquiring us, purchasing us. But I think we&#8217;ve contemplated a lot of those things in the past, especially last year and we continue to. But I think this kind of growth in the next, I would say five to seven years, is probably going to continue.</p>
<p>But what we&#8217;re going to do is, it&#8217;s a hard question because I think we&#8217;re in the middle of pivoting a little bit, but I would say potentially doubling or tripling in size to then have a bigger creative team, to serve more of the same kind of clients that we do, that we have right now. And where I feel, and that by note means we&#8217;re going to be a hundred million dollar agency or anything like that, but that&#8217;s going to be able to scale us to the point where I don&#8217;t have to do the kind of operationalizing, the strategic business work that I do on a day-to-day. I think that&#8217;s the goal. Where I then focus my time is on more of the relationship parts of the company, my relationships and how to continue to foster that and less being on the ground for the business right now.</p>
<p>To do that, we&#8217;re probably going to find maybe more partners to do that growth or maybe do some larger hires. We have to see. There&#8217;s some different strategies we have and options we have to do that. But I think double, triple in size than where we are now and me being less of those&#8230; Let&#8217;s say if we had another talk, Maurice, like in five, six years, I&#8217;m not telling you that I&#8217;m on a call six, seven hours a day, maybe three. And then the rest of the time I&#8217;m maybe meeting people or maybe more involved in Art Division or have some other nonprofit that&#8217;s maybe a part of not Pastilla or part of Art Division that is involved in the same kind of topics that we&#8217;re talking about, bringing art and design to youth to create more opportunities. Something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about Pastilla, about your work? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Our agency&#8217;s website is pastilla.co, so pastilla.co, P-A-S-T-I-L-L-A .co. You can also find our agency on Instagram. And our Instagram is, it&#8217;s Pastilla, P-A-S-T-I-L-L-A, Agency, A-G-E-N-C-Y. That&#8217;s her Instagram. And my Instagram also is Rudy, R-U-D-Y, M, V, so upside down A, V-N-N-I-N-G. So again, Rudy, R-U-D-Y, M-V-N-N-I-N-G. You can find me there as well. Yeah, those are my main channels. I&#8217;m also on LinkedIn. You probably just search me there. I don&#8217;t know what the exact profile name is there, but probably search Rudy Manning, you could find me on LinkedIn as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, we&#8217;ll find it. We&#8217;ll link it all down in the show notes. Rudy Manning, thank you so much for coming on the show. I think it&#8217;s definitely evident from your story, from the work you do out in the community, your education work, Pastilla, like I alluded to earlier in the interview, it&#8217;s clear you live and breathe design, but outside of that you have this sort of fiery passion to give back to the community and to also push the industry forward.</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;re doing it at a pace and a rate and a breadth that is inspiring for me to see. I hope it&#8217;s inspiring for our audience as well, for them to see what more can they do to try to really advance and push things forward. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
That&#8217;s awesome, Maurice. Thank you. Thank you so much for having me. Appreciate it. Awesome podcast. So thank you so much for having me again.</p>

<p>The past few years has been a testing ground for a lot of creatives. For Breon Waters II, he&#8217;s used this time to dive deeper into design across the digital world and the real world. And the results have been paying off!</p>
<p>Our conversation began with a look at his line of letterpress greeting cards, which are a fun mix of old-world printing techniques and cutting-edge technology. We also talked about his work at DEPT, and Breon shared how he came into product design throughs his earlier explorations in visual design and UI/UX. Breon has been steadily building his career brick by brick, and that&#8217;s given him a strong design foundation that will serve him well into the future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Hi, I&#8217;m Breon Waters II. By day, I&#8217;m a senior product designer at an agency called DEPT. By a later part of the day, I&#8217;m the founder of Holiday Free Of, a company that creates weird but memorable experiences that merge print and augmented reality.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I remember when we met a few years ago, you were sending out these letterpress Christmas cards. That&#8217;s where Holiday Free Of sort of grew out of, right?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yep. It started back when I graduated from ArtCenter, so back in 2011, which is wild to think it&#8217;s been that long. It was just a way back in before times, having in-person meetings or interviews and having to leave behind something for people I was doing interviews with to remember me, hopefully help me get a job. I&#8217;m not exactly sure how the hell I thought of Christmas cards. The whole idea is being not about Christmas, so it&#8217;s a Holiday Free Of these weird things happening for me. I think the first one was wishing me a Holiday Free Of a Christmas tree filled with renegade ninja squirrels. So really kind of off-the-wall, bizarre things, but really showing my personality. But also gave me a chance to really do the type of things I&#8217;m going to do creatively and really just get out of my comfort zone.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The cards are great. I have the one that you sent me last year right here by my desk. It&#8217;s great, really thick paper stock, of course, because it&#8217;s letterpress. And it&#8217;s so fun to interact with. It&#8217;s really a great idea.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Oh, thank you. I&#8217;m glad that people don&#8217;t just think I&#8217;m some weirdo and just people actually enjoy it and not just me laughing like a little schoolgirl while I make these, so I really appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, how has the year been going so far? How&#8217;s 2023 been treating you?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been fast. I know I&#8217;m not the only one, but it seems unimaginable that we&#8217;re basically almost, I guess, a quarter of the way done with the year already. My son just turned two. My daughter&#8217;s about to turn five. I&#8217;m going to turn 40 next month. So just a whole lot of milestones are happening. But yeah, definitely blessed. Things could have definitely been worse in the pandemic, but thankfully we have a roof over our head, haven&#8217;t really had to have much pain or strife or whatnot. But all is good, just working and then trying to actually launch Holiday Free Of this year. That&#8217;s my third baby, if you will, is just seeing if there&#8217;s a market for that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I definitely think there&#8217;s a market for that. I mean, it&#8217;s funny, I think about the last place where I worked, and one of the things that I was helping them with was getting together their swag. Because, you know, people think of tech startups, they think of T-shirts or maybe some little glossy pamphlet that you might get at a trade show and that you&#8217;ll throw away later. I find a lot of tech startups, like SaaS companies, et cetera, are always looking for unique merch.</p>
<p>So, at the last place I was at, I know we were looking at socks, we were looking at custom one-by-one keycaps for mechanical keyboards. I think those cards could be great. And I say this also because we did dabble in doing some print. We did a legit print magazine. That could be something great if you want to tap into that. The swag markets doing custom AR letterpress cards for companies. That&#8217;d be great. That could be a good way to do it.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
No, thank you for that, Maurice. I&#8217;ll definitely keep that in mind because that&#8217;s a damn good idea. I&#8217;ll have to [inaudible 00:06:24] on to that one for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you come up with the ideas for the card? I know you mentioned the name of it being Holiday Free Of. Do you keep a running list of stuff?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah. It always happens last minute, unfortunately. I think maybe one year I had the idea done maybe by September. But last year I was basically working on the design in November, a couple weeks before Thanksgiving. I have sketchbooks since starting design in college and I keep onto them and just writing word stuff. And sometimes, I think actually for this year&#8217;s, I was looking back at a sketchbook, it was a couple years ago, and just the idea of rock, paper, scissors. I was like, &#8220;Huh, there&#8217;s something kind of interesting there.&#8221;</p>
<p>It starts with a theme and just trying to figure out, &#8220;Okay, what&#8217;s the story from that theme?&#8221; And I can&#8217;t reveal the story fully yet, but it&#8217;s pulling inspiration from old school wrestling posters, boxing posters, patch show print-type posters and things like that for inspiration. I remember just being a kid, too, watching old school WWF back in the day. And just taking those memories, and what would happen if that fell in this world?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I could see something like that, that could be pretty fun.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
I was lucky to get a really talented 3D animator and illustrator, Mr Lubo Designs, to collaborate with him, and just really took my silly idea and really made it possible. Because I wasn&#8217;t sure if I could even make it move with animation. I thought it was going to be static. He was able to make it move, and knocked it out the park. Really proud of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So let&#8217;s talk about DEPT, which is the agency where you work at. You&#8217;re working there as a senior product designer. Tell me a little bit about your work and how you found out about them.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Well, when I joined them, they were called it Rocket Insights. They were acquired by DEPT, I think five or four years ago. We&#8217;re officially known as the digital products US arm of DEPT. So, we basically design digital products for DEPT on the state side here. And how I found them actually was reached out, I forgot the name of the actual site, but you know there&#8217;s job placing sites, recruiters. But this one was basically by AI. And so I was working actually with another East Coast agency, funny enough, and I left and got approached by DEPT and the rest is history. I&#8217;ll be working with them two years in April.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does a typical day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
There&#8217;s not really a typical day. We&#8217;re kind of weird. We&#8217;re an agency, we work as consultants. But depending on the client, we could really be almost working an in-house counterpart to their company. So right now I&#8217;ve been working with FIFA for NFT projects. I joined it in November right before the World Cup started, which is the craziest time to join the project. But also learned a ton though too, because the project was going on way before that in preparations for all that goes into World Cups and big events like that.</p>
<p>So for this, basically, there&#8217;s two designers, a team of developers on our end and a project manager. And we have two different clients on behalf of the other side. And really just working with them for new features, figuring out what are things need to be included. One big push is the Women&#8217;s World Cup is coming up this year, and so we&#8217;re working on initiatives and features specifically for that. So that&#8217;s been basically the start of this year has been all focused on designing for the Women&#8217;s World Cup for this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you mentioned the team. Are you working between different clients or do you just focus on one client for that specific project?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah, thankfully it&#8217;s just been one client. In the past I&#8217;ve had multiple clients. I&#8217;m trying to think back. Actually, before this project, I was on a design sprint and we were working with a mom and pop jewelry that&#8217;s looking to explore NFTs, and really seeing if they were to decide to create something within NFT world, what would it be? Is there a market for it? Who would it be for? And so that was basically a two-week sprint, just kind of along with the client learning what the hell NFTs are. Like what they&#8217;re all about, what&#8217;s Web 3.0?</p>
<p>And really just talking with them and potential users, just seeing what makes sense for them. What&#8217;s the story to tell? What would be their version of NFT? And it was really eye-opening just because NFT&#8217;s a real buzzword now. You hear the CryptoPunks and Tiffany&#8217;s collab&#8217;d and made millions of dollars. And people think, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s so easy, I&#8217;ll do that.&#8221; But every artist wants to be Picasso, or insert famous&#8230; or Basquiat. But there&#8217;s how many different artists and how many Basquiats? It&#8217;s not the same. It&#8217;s not as easy as that. So it&#8217;s really all about value. How do you really show that people should care or buy what you&#8217;re selling?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
This might be an odd question to ask, but do people still care about NFTs? I mean, I ask this because a year ago, I swear you were seeing success stories about NFTs, and Adidas was making NFTs, and people were designing NFTs and making all this money. And now it&#8217;s like you barely hear about NFTs. Have they fallen out of favor?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Right. No, I think there&#8217;s something to that. I remember last year the Super Bowl was everything about crypto. And all those companies basically are bankrupt or out of work. I think there still is, but I think we&#8217;re still so early in NFTs and Web 3.0 that it&#8217;s kind of like looking back in the first websites, where it&#8217;s just wild, wild west, crazy colors, rainbows everywhere. But it&#8217;s kind of matured. And I guess the trails of social media were there before, but it&#8217;s more mature now. And even still, trying to figure out what that&#8217;s going to be moving on forward. I think it&#8217;s kind of same for NFTs. NBA Top Shot is still popular, but it&#8217;s weird though, where it&#8217;s like you watch a game, it&#8217;s copyrighted by ESPN or Fox or insert whatever big broadcasting company.</p>
<p>And so it&#8217;s not even really clear. They own the rights to play it, so how&#8217;s it work you owning a highlight? I&#8217;m not sure exactly how that works. But even in that workshop I mentioned earlier, they mentioned NFTs for buying houses or for even for the contract sides, for if you&#8217;re working with artists. And having basically Web 3.0, big word, but basically it&#8217;s receipts. So basically capturing from the first person that bought it to fast-forward endless in the future. And so something like that, it&#8217;s not big and exciting and sexy as a Ja Morant NFT. But I think something that&#8217;s transaction-based, that could be a huge thing for it, but we&#8217;re still early for it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I still don&#8217;t know if NFTs&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve really penetrated the mainstream yet. I know why brands are jumping on it now. It&#8217;s all about that perceived value. Just like folks were really bang on about the metaverse a year and a half ago and stuff. I think people probably still are, but not to the fervor that it was back then. I attended a conference&#8230; When was this, was this in 2020? Might have been 2021. I attended a conference about the metaverse in the metaverse.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like, I have a Meta Quest, one of those helmet things or whatever. It was an interesting conference. There were some sessions that were, I don&#8217;t know if there was intentionally supposed to be that hokey and sales pitchy. There was one where this guy had bought some virtual real estate inside of the metaverse during a talk.</p>
<p>He bought a 800 square foot piece of land for, I don&#8217;t know, $10,000 or something like that. Probably more than that. 25,000, that&#8217;s what it was, he bought it for $25,000. And I&#8217;m like, why? It only exists in this particular metaverse subdivision, which is the best way that I could put it. Because there&#8217;s still a big interoperability problem with the metaverse. And I think this extends to NFTs too, where you can use an NFT maybe in Horizon World, but can you use it in Solana World or can you use it in another metaverse? Are you really able to take it with you? But speaking of things to take with you, after the conference, they gave us an NFT.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They sent us an email, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Here&#8217;s your NFT.&#8221; And then they&#8217;re like, &#8220;This is how you claim it. Get your hardware wallet and do this, this and this.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not doing that.&#8221; First of all, I have no idea what that is. Do I have to buy that? It&#8217;s all good. I&#8217;ll just tell people I went, it&#8217;s not that big a deal.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah, that sounds like&#8230; I imagine it wasn&#8217;t the same as actual attending a conference in real life. It doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;s on par with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. You attend the conference in real life, you get a badge. I keep all my conference badges. You get something like that. But this was something called POAP, Proof of Attendance Picture or something like that. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Is this like a Foursquare badge? What do I do with this?&#8221; I don&#8217;t know what it means for me to have that, or how to obtain it or why it&#8217;s useful. So I think I let it lapse because they kept sending me emails like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget to claim your NFT.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how, nor do I care, but thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a bad sort of a gift when you have to repeatedly ask that person, &#8220;Hey, you want to open the gift? Hey, you want to open the gift?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I think it&#8217;s cool, though, that you get to work with of new technologies with clients. So then you as an individual get to find a way to get your own understanding around it.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. Even DEPT, our CEO, Dimi, there&#8217;s been a huge push and they&#8217;re all in for all things Web 3.0 and AI. Just like you said, being at the forefront where of course there&#8217;s a lot&#8230; Just like the experience you mentioned for the conference, where it&#8217;s not the greatest, but for the ones that do figure it out early on, being well-versed to really design and tell stories within this, it really will be a huge thing. But just early on, it&#8217;s going to be really rough and wacky. And a lot of bad things are&#8230; Hopefully not bad things, but bad experiences happening. But yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;m looking at the DEPT website now. You all have a Web 3.0 division, it says, &#8220;With a global team of over 300 specialists, including solidity engineers, ethicists, economists and game designers, we have been building for Web 3.0 And the metaverse since 2015. Our pioneering work is fueled by patented and proprietary technology.&#8221; Okay. I didn&#8217;t know the Web 3.0 was a thing in 2015, but that&#8217;s cool. I mean, I&#8217;m not doubting y&#8217;all, I&#8217;m just saying, I&#8217;m looking through it like, &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s cool.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
I agree. [inaudible 00:17:34] my paycheck.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the most satisfying thing about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
I think really, and it&#8217;s going to sound sappy or cheesy, but when a client comes and they have an issue, or they&#8217;re working on something not sure of, it&#8217;s a really good feeling of helping people actualize, not their dreams, that&#8217;s too big and broad, but helping them get past their hurdle or issue or their problem. I think that&#8217;s really cool. Even for things like design sprints where on day one you have this big issue, you don&#8217;t know what the hell you&#8217;re going to do. It&#8217;s a whole mystery. And day by day everybody&#8217;s learning from it. And on that Friday, you do five user tests and just learn so much. And just that feeling of going from not knowing to, &#8220;Hey, there&#8217;s some [inaudible 00:18:28] here.&#8221; That&#8217;s a really good feeling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you approach that process of designing a new product or a new feature? I know you&#8217;ve mentioned the team that you usually are working with, but what does that process look like?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
It definitely varies on what we&#8217;re doing. But a lot of times we have a lot of really talented strategists that during the sprint doing the work together with us or sometimes doing it before our project or our phase of the project starts. So, really getting insights from that. And I think it sounds cheesy again, but some of the biggest skill sets for designers, not just product designers, but designers in general, just listening and just asking questions, just trying to learn as much as you can from your client.</p>
<p>They know it better than you do, but they&#8217;re coming to you for your expertise to actually how to visualize and build this. And a lot of times, too, people aren&#8217;t able to really say what they&#8217;re trying to say. And be able to decipher between that what are they really trying to say? And even user testing, talk with users, really listening, paying attention, getting out of the way and seeing what they&#8217;re doing. And taking all that together and helping it to inform your designs.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s learn a little bit more about you, about how you got to where you are now. You&#8217;re originally from California, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yep. A city called Rialto, California.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Rialto, where&#8217;s that?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
That&#8217;s in the Inland Empire. I like to say, if you&#8217;ve seen Friday After Next, it&#8217;s where Day-Day and his dad moved to, Rancho Cucamonga. So, next door to that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. All right. So, outside of LA, but it&#8217;s not quite a suburb I would say, right?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Right. It&#8217;s not quite the desert, but desert adjacent. And yeah, it&#8217;s a big bunch of different cities where basically you&#8217;ll go through it if you drive to Palm Springs, or if you&#8217;re looking to drive to Vegas, you&#8217;ll have to go through it. At least from going through LA.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. What was it like growing up there?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
It was cool. I loved it. Basically, imagine like most kids, you play out in the streets, playing tag or football, basketball, hide and go seek and whatnot. Where basically, it&#8217;s old school, but once the street lights came on, okay, you better bring your ass inside before you get in trouble. But yeah, just having friends around the neighborhood, just hanging out there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is that where you first got exposed to a lot of design and art and stuff?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Thinking back, the first design or art was from my dad. And he wasn&#8217;t a classically-trained artist or anything, but I remember growing up, there&#8217;s a big portrait of my mom he painted. And there&#8217;s also, he did some different scratchboard pieces. They&#8217;re hanging up and just always remember seeing them as a kid. And so I&#8217;d always see that. And I was always sketching stuff. My thing was being a baseball player and designing airplanes, which are a perfect pair, right?</p>
<p>So, I would always draw that. And when I was in middle school, back when you would take shopping paper bags and wrap them around your books, I would draw Jimi Hendrix and baseball players on it. So never really blatantly had someone as a kid say, &#8220;Hey, this is designer art.&#8221; But from that and my dad really artistic in drawing, that&#8217;s where I really got my first dose of it. Or dose is the wrong word, but first learned about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so you kept with that imagination of drawing and getting into it enough to the point where you decided you wanted to study it in college. I&#8217;m curious about this, and I know we talked about this a little bit before recording, but you went to college in North Dakota.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yep, that&#8217;s correct.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Which is, I mean, it&#8217;s not far from California, but you got to tell me-</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:22:17]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s far? Okay. Oh, okay. I mean, I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;s not on the other coast. But what brought that on? You went to Minot State University. That&#8217;s in North Dakota near the Canadian border, so you&#8217;re up there.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yes, sir. [inaudible 00:22:31]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Why? What brought you to Minot?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
You sound like you&#8217;re my therapist, which I don&#8217;t have, Maurice, so maybe I should have you be my therapist. Young Breon thought he was going to be a major league baseball player, playing first base for the Angels, and so I was hell-bent on playing baseball. After high school, I went to Cal Poly Pomona, which is a really good college for different engineering disciplines and especially aerospace. It&#8217;s in Pomona, California, actually, not far from where my folks live. So I was there, and excited being in college. But well, I didn&#8217;t just learn then, but I was terrible in math. I&#8217;d forget equations, especially on finals day. When you move into the senior level of classes, you do really cool stuff. They have partnerships with Boeing, working on airplanes and different things like that. I imagine now they&#8217;re probably working on drones and stuff. But I was bad at math. I thought, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to play baseball there.&#8221; I tried walking on and tried out for the team two years and didn&#8217;t make it, but I was still&#8230; The desire to play baseball, I wanted to do that.</p>
<p>And it was funny, a family friend of ours was working in the career center at the time. And she had me do a career placement test where you answer a series of questions. Whatever you pick, it&#8217;s kind of like, &#8220;Hey, you should do this,&#8221; or, &#8220;Hey, you should do this.&#8221; And so, one of the results was graphic design. I was like, &#8220;Huh, I never really heard about that.&#8221; I took some art classes in high school but didn&#8217;t really think too much of it. And so after that it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to switch to graphic design, but I still want to play baseball.&#8221; So I looked online and looked for colleges that had a baseball team and graphic design programs and just emailed a bunch of their coaches and whatnot. And I heard back from Minot State University and a school, Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa or Sioux Falls, Iowa.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Iowa&#8217;s Sioux City. I think Sioux Falls is in North Dakota.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Okay, thank you. So, Sioux City, Iowa. And so my mom, God bless her heart, I told my mom and dad, &#8220;I was going to major in aerospace engineering and you&#8217;re paying for college. So yeah, I&#8217;m not going to do that. I&#8217;m going to go move to the Midwest and play baseball and do graphic design.&#8221; [inaudible 00:24:48] my dad, but my mom is just&#8230; And I get that too, my dad, you want your kid to be having something secure, not the whole starving artist kind of visualization. So I definitely get that now, being a dad. But my mom was really just supportive, &#8220;Okay, yep, we&#8217;re going to do this.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so we flew out to Minot State. I visited the school, tried out, and we rented the car and we drove from Minot to Sioux City, Iowa. Tried out there too. And just so happened where I got a chance to meet the team in Minot, it was during their tournament days, and just hit it off with them and just wanted to be a part of it. And that was how I went to being from California to moving to North Dakota, never having seen snow in my life, and being in blizzards there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I was going to say, I mean, of course, weather-wise that&#8217;s wild. But I mean, baseball and graphic design, that would&#8217;ve been an interesting Venn diagram intersection.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah. And it doesn&#8217;t make sense either, where California is one of the best parts for baseball. And I moved from there to North Dakota, which is not known for baseball. So, on hindsight, not the wisest decision, but it did lead me towards that graphic design path, so I&#8217;m grateful for that. And that was the right path for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So, while you were at Minot, you studied art, you focused on graphic design and marketing as well. How was your time there? Do you feel like you got a good foundation as a designer?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah, I think it was a good entry level way. Whereas, I actually was playing baseball there. I couldn&#8217;t play my senior year, which was at the time devastating, but it really worked out because I actually did my own senior solo show instead of&#8230; That wouldn&#8217;t have been possible at all if I was playing baseball. So basically, there, they introduce you, you have a class on typography, photography. I forgot what level of Photoshop or Illustrator it was, but it was back when you had the fifties looking MacBooks, or not MacBooks [inaudible 00:26:52]. So that was the time of that. So it did give me that sense, but I think one of the best part was the art side.</p>
<p>I had a lot of good professors there. Bill, and Walter Piehl was really amazing [inaudible 00:27:07]. He does these really amazing abstract rodeo paintings. And I remember he was the first person that put me onto Basquiat, was like, &#8220;You should check out this artist.&#8221; And really just was amazed, of course, rightfully so. Basquiat was an amazing artist. But I think that being an artist, getting your hands dirty, the first time doing screen printing and stuff like that, I think looking back it did set a foundation of having that kind of different approach to things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What position did you play?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
I was first base but didn&#8217;t hit a lot of home runs and couldn&#8217;t hit a curveball to save my life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know. I think that&#8217;s just really cool that you were able to pursue this design degree and you were effectively also a college athlete. We&#8217;ve had college athletes and designers on here before, maybe not at that exact intersection. That&#8217;s pretty unique. I mean, out of the hundreds of interviews I&#8217;ve done, you are the first one I could say that has done baseball and graphic design. So that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Oh, thank you for that. Yeah, it was NAIA, which is basically division two. But one cool thing, though, is that we actually did play, in spring before we started league play we played in the Metrodome. They knocked it down years ago to build the new arena where the Vikings play. But playing in a Major League baseball stadium was cool. So that was really something I&#8217;ll keep with me for the rest of my life, even though we got destroyed and we actually were playing wood bats for the first time. So we&#8217;re playing wood bats against metal bats, so as you can imagine, we lost, and it didn&#8217;t work out so well. But it was still fun, though.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I mean, I&#8217;ve met you, you&#8217;re tall, so it helps to be tall as a first baseman.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Right, yeah. No, definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So after you graduated, did you stay in North Dakota? What was the game plan after that?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Oh no, once I graduated I got a U-Haul. Had a truck at the time, put all my stuff there and drove back. And I moved back home to my folks and just trying to get a job but found it was really hard to actually find a job. Actually, couldn&#8217;t find a job. When I was in Minot, I first heard about AIGA and spent a lot of time in Minneapolis for it, and just loved the city there. I think I went to my first portfolio show there. And so, okay, I&#8217;m going to go to a portfolio show. I went to one at USC at the time and I believe Ed Fellows was the actual speaker at the time. Does amazing work.</p>
<p>And I remember when I was getting my book reviewed and one of the persons there was like, &#8220;You know, you really need to go to a place that&#8217;s going to teach you design.&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;If you develop that eye for design.&#8221; And he mentioned a couple different design schools. And so I researched it and was thinking about, I think, actually, Creative Circus and Portfolio Center. But I think I got a booklet or something from ArtCenter. And funny, living in Rialto, never actually heard of it before that time. And just visited the campus, fell in love. You know where they have the bridge, it&#8217;s this 1950s-style architecture and just all the amazing work that students did there. And I was like, &#8220;Okay, yeah, I want to be here.&#8221; Decided to attend ArtCenter.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. ArtCenter out in Pasadena. It&#8217;s a beautiful campus. I&#8217;ve been there once. I know the bridge that you&#8217;re talking about, though.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s weird now, though. They actually have bought&#8230; So there&#8217;s South Campus in South Pasadena, and so a lot of, I think&#8230; Graphic design has a big building there, illustration. So there&#8217;s still stuff on the bridge, the Hillside campus, but not as much as it used to be. But still really talented folks go there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How was ArtCenter different from Minot? Did you feel like because you had that four-year education already that it was easy?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
No. It was really intimidating. In other words, I remember in my initial class, people whose parents were designers, had done designs, had their own T-shirt companies and stuff like that. I&#8217;m sure like most folks you have imposter syndrome in your life, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, how am I going to cut it?&#8221; But a blessing was Jay Chapman is a creativity coach there. And I will always be in debt and love Jay for the rest of my life. Just an awesome person and he&#8217;s really all about just helping you get out your way and have a sense of play in your work. And just would visit him at the time. I remember would visit him for a project and it clicked for you. You think of ArtCenter, it&#8217;s great design but it could be kind of stuffy, I guess, in a way.</p>
<p>Think of Bauhaus. It&#8217;s really kind of beautiful design but sometimes inject some life into it. So Jay is complete opposite, where it&#8217;s ArtCenter, this amazing school, but surrounded by a bunch of rich houses. And you basically, most folks just stay on there and design and work and work and stress out. And where you have LA and all the different cultures and cities that make up LA right around you but don&#8217;t even experience it. So really just enjoying life and experiencing different things and then injecting that into your work. Once from that just really did that and that really helped open the doors for me there. Just really, okay, it&#8217;s not worrying about other&#8217;s story, but what are my experiences? What does my perspective look like? And really just going well with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it sounds like the combination of Minot and ArtCenter probably gave you a much stronger foundation once you got out there and worked as a designer. Because of course you had this foundational knowledge from Minot, but then as you mentioned, with ArtCenter, you&#8217;re learning about this sense of play as well as also probably learning about some different techniques and such that you didn&#8217;t get from a four-year college that you&#8217;re now getting at an arts college.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What was your early career like?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
After ArtCenter?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a great question. It&#8217;s funny thinking back. It&#8217;s funny, in design school, and it might be for the majors too, you&#8217;re taught basically the world&#8217;s your oyster, right? Designs going to save the world and work on these amazing projects. And so it was funny, my first actual project, at ArtCenter, they have what&#8217;s called, as part of your last day is speed dating. So different companies come to your spot where you&#8217;re presenting your work. Basically, you&#8217;re showing off, &#8220;Hey, this is the work I&#8217;m proud of from my time at ArtCenter. Hire me.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, one of the people that did was someone from Saputo Design, which is an agency in Westlake LA. Or not Westlake LA but Westlake, California, excuse me. They&#8217;re a small ad agency and they were working on a pitch for K-Swiss. And I had some collage work in my portfolio from a project for my senior year. And they basically had me work on a freelance project with them for a little bit from that. So that was my actual first one. So that was cool, just like, &#8220;Hey, you liked the stuff I did for a class and able to use it for a pitch for a shoe company.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you started out doing visual design, right?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yep. After that, I was there, moved on to another place where a professor worked. And actually it was my first time being fired on the spot. And that was-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Whoa.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah. Of course, at the time I was not laughing at all. I remember basically was working on a branding project. I forgot what I did, but made a mistake and basically the person&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, thank you for your time, but kindly pack up your things and go.&#8221; I&#8217;m paraphrasing that. So, by the grace of God, I managed to say thank you, shake hands and head down to the lobby and that&#8217;s when I burst into tears. And I remember the security guard or someone down there, like, &#8220;Hey, are you okay?&#8221; And me just melting down, where it&#8217;s fresh out of ArtCenter, have, what, six figures in student loans?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still living at my parents&#8217; house. And how am I going to tell my parents and also my girlfriend, my now wife, at the time girlfriend, that, &#8220;Hey, I got fired.&#8221; Just feeling like a complete failure. But looking back, it&#8217;s one of the best things that happened to me just really because it really was my first lesson, a big lesson, that there&#8217;s no such thing as security. Things could change in the instant. Not in a way of being afraid of, &#8220;Oh, this could be gone,&#8221; but there&#8217;s some freedom of, &#8220;Okay, this happened but I&#8217;m still surviving. This is not going to end me. Yeah, it sucks right now, but I&#8217;m going to keep going forward.&#8221; And that&#8217;s definitely something that&#8217;s really helped me along the way, just because it&#8217;s tough finding a job at times. The design world especially is really small and it can seem like everything&#8217;s turning against you and things aren&#8217;t going to turn around. But if it&#8217;s not like being any smarter or talent makes you &#8220;successful.&#8221; But just sticking in there, getting back up and that&#8217;s really helped me in my career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m really glad you said that because I think designers now, particularly during this wild period of layoffs that&#8217;s happening in not just the tech industry but the design industry and others as well, I think it helps to just hear that. When this sort of stuff happens, it&#8217;s not the end of the world. It certainly can feel that way. But you have to find a way to bounce back from it. And I think it also helps, and maybe in this particular instance, to know that you&#8217;re not alone when this stuff happens. I mean, yes, it&#8217;s the ending of one thing, but it also has the potential to open up into new opportunities that you can do. So, after that happens, how did you pull yourself out of that?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
So, funny enough, you mentioned you&#8217;re not alone, and that was something that actually helped too. A friend of mine at ArtCenter, Megan, was working at a company called Guess Clothing Company. And so she mentioned me to her boss Hiro, and basically I forgot, it might have been a month or two after that. I&#8217;m wondering what the hell&#8217;s going to happen next. And Megan hits me up saying, &#8220;Hey, would you want to work at Guess?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Of course,&#8221; so I actually ended up working there for a little bit. And I went on from there to Live Nation/Ticketmaster. And Hiro&#8217;s been a boss that I&#8217;ve&#8230; He attended my wedding, someone I consider a really good friend and kept in touch with and still keep in touch with now and just helped, advice. It&#8217;s really just like you never know when things are going to change, but having those people around you that are rooting for you really helps you out.</p>
<p>It may not happen exactly then, but along the way in a little bit of time, things will really pan out where it&#8217;s like, oh, okay. I&#8217;ve actually worked with when he joined a different startup and was looking for work. And yep, &#8220;Hey, Breon, looking for work?&#8221; And &#8220;Hell, yeah, I am.&#8221; And so I joined that too. So I definitely think it helped later on.</p>

So for you, keeping that community in line is something that was really a good asset for you.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Definitely. I know I&#8217;m not alone in this too where just I hate asking for help. And it&#8217;s just being stubborn. Just, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m going to do it myself.&#8221; But you need help and asking for help is not a sign of weakness. And I think one of the best things too is turning it forward when you actually are in a position to help people out, be able to do that too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What inspired you to pursue product design? I mean, you were doing visual design and I see just from looking at your LinkedIn, you did UI/UX design. What brought you to product?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
So, back when I was at ArtCenter, there weren&#8217;t product design classes, or at least not for what we mainly consider it now. Product design as I knew it then was basically designing shoes or physical products or physical objects. So, I was actually, my specialization was in branding. So basically the idea of once you know, you do your research and your strategy and figuring out who you&#8217;re designing for, you can design whatever the hell you want to design. Whether that&#8217;s a logo, traditional stationary assets, things like that, or packaging, websites, you name it. So it wasn&#8217;t until I was working out in the field. I worked at Ticketmaster for about a year and just wanted to move to the Bay, where it still, it&#8217;s like that now, but it&#8217;s kind of awesome design place. It&#8217;s kind of like Starbucks, there&#8217;s one on every block pretty much.</p>
<p>And just wanted to really try to make a name for myself in the Bay. And so moved there. First learned about UI and then UX design and then later product design. And it was really from a point of trying to have more ownership on the project, where I went to the place, I was working as a UI designer. And it was the first time, once I moved back down to LA after a couple years. And it was the first time in my career where it just basically felt like it was a complete wrong fit. The design team overall was nice, friendly and whatnot. But the actual team I was working on seemed like basically didn&#8217;t really care, value my contributions to the team. And also from the company standpoint, the things we&#8217;re working on, we&#8217;re basically the red-headed stepchild of the company.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not really having the funding or developmental talent to work on what we&#8217;re doing. It was basically like that, where I was working as a UI designer, but basically just it&#8217;s like, okay, the UX person does the UX, does user testing focus, all that stuff, does even some mockups. And, &#8220;Okay, here you go, Breon. Make it look pretty.&#8221; And just not what I got into design for. So I ended up leaving and I did an online class at General Assembly on product design, or UX design, rather. And just wanted to see, is this something that I do? And I had worked alongside some in-house teams, really great UX teams, UX designers, and learned a lot during that. And really found out this is all stuff that I could do, just all the things I took from them and be able to apply it from there.</p>
<p>And so I did that online course, it was basically a month long. And after that, Hiro, my boss from Guess earlier in the years actually reached out, because he had moved to the Flex Company as a creative director there and was looking to build a design team there. And so he hit me up and that was actually my first UI product design-type role after that General Assembly class. So it kind of all snowballed there where I was working there, really great company, they&#8217;re really small, tight-knit. Got to know the head of marketing, Maytal there, a really great person. And she put me on to someone who she knew who was an entrepreneur, has his own company, is looking to actually rebrand the logo, the website and app. And so that was another project where actually applying what I applied from that General Assembly class to that. So it kind of all just, unbeknownst to me at the time, lit and connected to each other and just slowly but surely evolving to being able to apply what I was looking to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now that you&#8217;ve been working as a senior product designer at DEPT and you&#8217;ve been doing this work, do you feel like it&#8217;s been a natural evolution of your skills over the years?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah, I think so. There&#8217;s things from the branding side I definitely take in. As a product designer, you have design patterns you leverage. So think about, you open up your smartphone, buttons typically look the same, or different interactions or swiping and things like that, where they make sense because they&#8217;re something we&#8217;re all used to or trained to use. But there&#8217;s still a lot of design, a lot of digital products look the same. If you cover up a logo, it&#8217;s hard to tell what&#8217;s what.</p>
<p>And so I think from the branding side, that&#8217;s where it&#8217;s a chance to inject personality and experience into things. Not sacrificing the overall experience from a usability standpoint, but from a personality standpoint, how can you make an experience that really feels like this? So if you think of Apple products, where if it&#8217;s opening up your iPhone, the physical packaging to it, or looking at your iPhone or looking at the website or looking at things like that, it&#8217;s different things but it all feels the same. It feels like an overall same experience, so that kind of idea to it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, looking ahead, how do you see the field evolving in the years to come?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good question. I think rightfully so, there is some hesitation or the sky is falling there with ChatGPT or we&#8217;re talking about AI before. Where those things are real, but thinking about it, having read some stuff, it seems like that&#8217;s the natural order of things. So I imagine designers before were working with their hands, like calligraphers, when you have the setting presses, type presses were kind of the same thing for that. Like, &#8220;Oh no, what&#8217;s going to happen for us?&#8221; And then after that, fast-forward to the computer. And so thinking that same thing too. But it seems like all those things, yeah, they did take away some jobs, but it seems like the bulk of the jobs they took away were things or actions that you don&#8217;t like to do, the more repetitive things.</p>
<p>Where it feels like more of these being our assistants of sorts. Maybe if it&#8217;s for ChatGPT. ChatGPT, I know I use it for coming up with ideas for the copy for the website for Holiday Free Of I&#8217;m generating for copy. I&#8217;m not a copywriter, but at least, it&#8217;s not perfect, but having a place to start from or even really refining ideas I have. So, in that sense, almost a old school ad idea like the partners, you have a copywriter, AD paired together. So a team where it&#8217;s helping you generate ideas and work towards a common goal.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I use Chat GPT now, and I mentioned this before we recorded, I use it a bit like a writing partner. It&#8217;s good to give some prompts on some things and maybe help guide you in the right direction, but it&#8217;s certainly not a magic bullet. Although I feel like that&#8217;s how the media is certainly reporting on it. They&#8217;re sort of anthropomorphizing Chat GPT and similar types of things like, &#8220;Oh, they can think, they can hallucinate.&#8221; They can only do what they&#8217;re trained on based on the data that we give them. That&#8217;s just how it works. I mean, we taught rocks how to think and now we have computers, so what&#8217;d you expect?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
No, it&#8217;s spot on where they could do things, but the soul of what makes people people, that personality, at least not yet, it&#8217;s not easily repeatable by AI or machines. So, at least we got that going for us.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is it that keeps you motivated and inspired these days?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Really just experiences. I think now when you typically think of a product designer, you think automatic like a phone or websites and apps and things like that. And that&#8217;s great, but I&#8217;m more interested in things that span mediums. Like going back to the cards, how do you create something that&#8217;s in experienced physically in your hands, but also digitally. But it may be slightly different, but carries along the actual same storyline you&#8217;re trying to tell. So things like that. Things like AR and VR, virtual reality, augmented reality. How do you really create meaningful experiences with that? I think that&#8217;s, at this point in my career, is really fascinating to me. Not so focused on the devices or the mediums, but more of these experiences or touchpoints for you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is the best advice that you&#8217;ve been given about design?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
I probably want to say it&#8217;s not even directly design related, but more of&#8230; And I&#8217;m not sure who I heard it from, but basically the point where it&#8217;s at one point in time everybody was a novice, or basically no one has all the answers. And I think that&#8217;s been really eye-opening just because when you&#8217;re coming up or just moving to something new, you think, &#8220;Oh, okay, they may have their ish together.&#8221; But a lot of times they don&#8217;t, or even at one point they didn&#8217;t. Even thinking about Web 3.0 or NFTs and all that stuff where no one has all the answers for it, so don&#8217;t feel like you have to be a &#8220;guru&#8221; or so much experience to know what&#8217;s going on there. Just having a sense of curiosity and playing around, asking questions, eager really to contribute to things. So it&#8217;s like there&#8217;s not this one elite path to doing anything it seems like.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you appreciate the most about your life right now?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Just my family. It&#8217;s wild even thinking of being almost 40 and having a family. And you can have bad days and just have things of being an adult, what makes being an adult tough, but still hearing my&#8230; My kids are still young enough where they&#8217;ll call for me and actually want to be around me and my wife. I know that&#8217;s going to change, especially when they&#8217;re teenagers, but that&#8217;s the most awesome thing where just people are super happy to see you and just that sheer look of happiness.</p>
<p>And just their laughter, their personality is so infectious too. I love to create things. I&#8217;ll create things till my last breath. My kids will be the most inspirational, best part of something I had a part of actually creating. And so that&#8217;s really a humbling and also a daunting challenge, but also just so rewarding, though, too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, your kids are also, at least the oldest one, probably, you say the oldest one is five, right?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yep.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is she at that age where she&#8217;s interested&#8230; I want to say interested in design, but I feel like kids, just the way that we structure things for them, they have so much time and freedom to just play and do creative stuff. Are you finding that she&#8217;s into painting and drawing and stuff like that?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s funny. My daughter Essie and my son Mackaye. Essie is super in singing and dancing. She loves to draw. Like Jackson Pollock work, just wild and chaotic with making marks and things like that, but also that freedom for it. So I&#8217;m not really sure what she&#8217;s going to do, but I think she&#8217;ll be a lot better at it than I am, just because just how passionate she is and just loving to sing and dance and just that freedom that she has. For my son, McKay, I&#8217;m not sure. He&#8217;s like the Tasmanian devil. He loves books. So I think they&#8217;ll do something maybe in the creative world somehow, or at least have those hobbies and things like that. I definitely won&#8217;t pressure them to do that, but I think there&#8217;s something there that they have from me, which I got from my dad.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, you can pass on the legacy of design in a way.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah, we&#8217;ll see. It&#8217;s wild, too, I wonder will there be a point in time in their lives when they&#8217;re older, will there still be jobs? Just how automated things are, it seems it&#8217;s not out of the realm of possibility where these things called jobs aren&#8217;t a part of our lives. But if that&#8217;s the case, what the hell&#8217;s going to fill that? So, I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
I think in a perfect world, if Holiday Free Of is something that catches on, and not even just that, but I think to a point where just I could survive off of my weird ideas and creating experiences and building a team potentially around it. Or actually, in January, last month, we&#8217;ll figure, I started teaching for the first time. And I had wanted for the longest time to teach, and just like a dummy feeling, &#8220;I have to be at a certain level of my career to actually teach,&#8221; which doesn&#8217;t make sense. And it&#8217;s been early, but I really get a lot of pleasure out of teaching. Early to see how, it&#8217;s a cheesy saying, but just if you want to learn something, teach. And just there&#8217;s so much that you have to do and learn just to be able to know what the heck you&#8217;re actually trying to teach.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like how do you actually communicate your ideas, and knowing enough to actually try to teach something, but knowing that you&#8217;re not going to know everything? So I&#8217;d love to do more of that. And just really too would like to be, when I think about my career, what I want to be, ultimately, I really think of a conductor, or just having an idea, but assembling talents to actually help them do their best by helping to overall steer the goal for it.</p>
<p>When I was working years ago back on my senior art show, I first heard about Duke Ellington and Count Basie. Amazing talents, but had these amazing bands built around them. And now if you think of Robert Glasper and the work he&#8217;s doing, I&#8217;d love to do something of that ilk where it&#8217;s maybe me creating my creative type of interests, like maybe a Nick Fury type of person, I guess, I think. Just really designing different things, even if it&#8217;s more like a sociological type study or things like that. Really just thinking about things or experiments and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The Design Avengers, I could see that. You could pull it off, though. You could pull off Nick Fury with the iPads. You could do it.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Luckily, he doesn&#8217;t have hair, right? So I got that [inaudible 00:52:03].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
By the time this comes out, Holiday Free Of will be out. So I&#8217;m launching that. So you can check out Holiday Free Of on holidayfreeof.com. On Instagram it&#8217;s @HolidayFreeOf. For my personal portfolio, it&#8217;s breonwatersii.com. Personally on Instagram, I don&#8217;t do it that much, but [inaudible 00:52:35] politemanliness.com. And really just trying to do more things, really just more storytelling with that. So look out for some interesting things and experiments, explorations on Holiday Free Of.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Breon Waters II, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. Like I mentioned at the top of the episode, I think you had reached out to me several years ago and asked for my address because you wanted to send me a Christmas card. And I was like, &#8220;Yeah, sure, go ahead and send me a Christmas card.&#8221; And I mean, we&#8217;ve kept in touch since then. I&#8217;ve seen how your career has grown since then.</p>
<p>And also I think just hearing your story now and seeing the path that you&#8217;ve taken to get here, you&#8217;ve always struck me as someone that really has their eye on the prize, like you know what it is that you want to do and you&#8217;re steadily working and going towards that goal. So, I could see in five years, the cards really taking off and being a success. And I just want to thank you so much for the work that you&#8217;re doing, for continuing to blaze a trail in the industry, and just for being, I mean, to somebody like me, just being a positive influence in the industry, family man, doing the work that you&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s just good to see from this vantage point, somebody that&#8217;s really out there making their dreams happen. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
That means the world, Maurice. Thank you so much, and thank you for your platform. Like I was saying before, the work you and Cheryl Miller, all different platforms that came out during 2020, like Where Are the Black Designers? It&#8217;s been a huge blessing for us, just knowing we&#8217;re not alone, there&#8217;s others like us. And just thank you for giving us a platform to share our stories and connect, so thank you so much for it.</p>
