Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>It was a real joy to connect with Fungi Dube for this week&#8217;s episode of the podcast. She&#8217;s a skilled brand, web, and Webflow designer in Harare, Zimbabwe, and I love how she leverages her culture in her designs to create stunning visual and digital experiences for clients around the world.</p>
<p>We covered a range of topics related to design and creativity. Fungi shared the importance of understanding a client&#8217;s needs and goals, spoke about the creative community in Zimbabwe, and talked about how she transitioned from being a trained scientist to a talented designer. If you&#8217;re looking to find inspiration from within, then this interview with Fungi will definitely bring it to you!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
I am Fungi Dube. I am a brand visual and Webflow web designer based in Harare, Zimbabwe. I have been designing, according to LinkedIn, for almost eight years now. So I think that&#8217;s super cool. And I mostly am inspired&#8230; not mostly, largely inspired by the profound nuances that are embedded in African culture. So if you are to interact with my work or engage with my work online, you&#8217;re probably going to see that a lot of it is really centered on African narratives and seeing how I can tell their stories in a really fresh and inspiring way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So how has the year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
The year has been good. I feel like at the very start of it, I was kind of flailing about, just trying to get everything in place and trying to organize myself personally, just getting my goals out there and that sort of thing. So it was a bit of a whirlwind, but as it has progressed, it&#8217;s gotten better. I feel like I am more in control. I&#8217;ve regained all balance and it&#8217;s been really good. I&#8217;ve been working on some super exciting projects that hopefully you&#8217;ll see the light of day soon. But yeah, so far so good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have any goals in particular that you want to accomplish for the year?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Definitely, definitely. I have a lot of sort of business-centered goals when it comes to being a solopreneur and running my own design brand, but I also have goals with regards to sort of tapping more into the design education space and seeing what I can do with that. So I do have two big, major self-initiated projects that I&#8217;m working on that I&#8217;m also funding that I&#8217;m hoping are going to work, and then I can go and ask people for money to make them bigger. But yeah, I definitely have a few things that I&#8217;m working on at the moment that I would like to see done by the end of the year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. I mean, I&#8217;d love to learn a little bit more about them, as much as you want to go into detail about them.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t want to keep it too generic, but pretty much the focus of these projects is that I feel that there&#8217;s a gap, and the gap is seen in how when it comes to African design systems or African design education or African inspiration in general when it comes to design is a little bit lacking. So you are able to find references and that sort of thing on Google. You could probably go outside and have a chat with a roadside vendor or with your grandmother and find out about things and that sort of thing, but I want to be able to at least contribute towards the documentation of some of these things. So there&#8217;s definitely a gap when it comes to the literature that we can read with regards to African narratives and how to implement them in design. So the project&#8217;s really one which is digital and one which is actually physical or centered on being able to start this documentation process, not only for designers now, but for designers to come.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds really interesting. I&#8217;d love to hear more about that once it&#8217;s out in the world.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Definitely. I&#8217;ll definitely let you in once there&#8217;s something to actually see.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, you just earlier described yourself as a solopreneur. Tell me just kind of more in general about your design work and what you specialize in doing.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if I should take the audience all the way back, but initially when I did start designing, I sort of was everywhere. So you could have told me to do, I don&#8217;t know, to design a flyer for the most random thing ever and I would&#8217;ve done it because I was still learning and sort of getting my feet or dipping my toes in the water just to see what the industry was like. But I want to say probably at the four-year mark of my seven plus, almost eight year journey, it sort of clicked that I wanted to be able to work on projects that I could see myself in as a young Black, Zimbabwean female African designer.</p>
<p>So I made the shift and my focus since then has been seeing how I can leverage African culture, African narratives, nuances that are embedded in African cultures like textures, colors, patterns, the use of graphic symbols as a way of visual and global communication, and just seeing how I can interpret that in a fresh, modern, and inspired way and send that out to the world. So that is the base or the foundation of the work, and then the sort of disciplines that I work within would be the brand design space, the visual design space, and more recently the Webflow design space.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I worked briefly, this was back from 2017 to 2020-ish, I worked for a company that was doing a lot of, not no code, low code, they really actually wanted to be more code, but we worked a lot with or kind of in congress with other companies that were doing those sort of similar things, like Webflow, basically taking the process of design and sort of democratizing it in a way where you could use a product to create things. I&#8217;ve used Webflow before. It&#8217;s super powerful. I love how you&#8217;re able to really create full, really fully functioning sites with just dragging and dropping. And if you want to get into the code you can, but I like that the code is not a hindrance in order for you to create something.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s really changed my perspective on design as well, because there&#8217;s just so much that you can do. So Webflow is super flexible, infinite possibilities when it comes to very unique user experiences and customizing really cool interfaces and animations and interactions. So yeah, it&#8217;s been a really cool journey so far. This would be my second year in Webflow, but I&#8217;m just super excited to really learn more about it and see what I can create with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So what does a typical day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Goodness. Okay. So my routine has changed a little bit as the start of this year, but I used to be 5:00 AM club. I am not anymore. I have become 7:00 or 8:00 AM club, and that&#8217;s perfectly fine. So that&#8217;s the time that I usually wake up. I tend to have my little morning routine, so whether that&#8217;s cleaning my space, making my bed, taking a shower, having some breakfast, but I will be settled at my desk around 9:00 in the morning. I like to get administrative tasks out of the way first, so I check my emails, I check my socials. I am also a brand design coach with Flux Academy, so I tend to check all of those emails as well and see what&#8217;s happening in the community with the students. And then right after that, which is probably maybe an hour, an hour and a half, then I&#8217;ll dive into any kind work that I could be working on.</p>
<p>So I tend to also like to work in little sprints throughout the day. So I&#8217;ll dedicate an hour block or an hour and a half block to a certain task, and then I&#8217;ll move on to the next one. But with each and every single day, I do at least make sure that I prioritize time to go to the gym. So that&#8217;s usually in the late afternoon. And if I am able to, I also schedule nap and nap time because I think it&#8217;s important to recharge and occasional dance breaks. It&#8217;s so weird, but I have it in my schedule to be like, &#8220;Okay, I think that we need to just blast some tunes right now and just have a vibe at the desk,&#8221; so that things don&#8217;t get too hectic and you don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re losing your mind. So yeah, that&#8217;s pretty much what a typical day looks like for me. In the evenings after gym, dinner, shower, cup of tea, I&#8217;ll wind down and maybe watch something on Netflix, read something before I go to bed, and we start it all over again. But my workday is usually done around 10:00 PM in the evening.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love that you have these breaks in the day scheduled for play, or I would say for non-work, but you&#8217;ve got them scheduled in your calendar and you don&#8217;t move them around or anything. I love that.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Yeah, I think it&#8217;s super important to prioritize things such as help us to also relax as designers, because I think it&#8217;s super easy for us to be at our desks plugged behind our computer screens for 16 hours a day and you actually don&#8217;t realize that you&#8217;ve been working for so long. So I&#8217;m a strong advocate for making sure that&#8230; and balance looks different for everyone, I should add that, but just for ensuring that at least there&#8217;s a little bit of me time even in the chaos and the busyness of work. So even if it&#8217;s 20 minutes of just, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s do some chair dancing, or let&#8217;s take a quick nap,&#8221; I&#8217;m definitely going to take it for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I think it&#8217;s super important, especially when you&#8217;re a solopreneur, because nobody&#8217;s going to prompt you to do that. Nobody&#8217;s going to tell you, &#8220;Hey, maybe you should take a break.&#8221; You have to do it. You have to schedule it in in order to make sure that you get that done.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Yeah. And that&#8217;s the thing as well. When you&#8217;re a solopreneur, you have to wear many hats. So it can get really overwhelming and you find yourself sort of feeling a lot more burnt out and that sort of thing. So I had to be very intentional about ensuring that I scheduled this into my day-to-day so that at least I can cope with everything else that I have to do, because I have to be social media manager, I have to be accountant, I have to be administrator, designer, strategist, all in one. So just having that time to yourself where you can just do nothing or where you can play really, really, really makes a difference.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re starting a new project. It can be from a new client, from a current client. What does your creative process look like?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
From the jump, I like to have a discovery call. With any potential leads, I will write to them and just find out when they&#8217;re available for us to meet. I will introduce myself in this call. I will also listen to them talk about their brand/their business, their service, their product, what it is that they think they need for their brand, because sometimes you will actually find out that they may think that they need branding, but maybe they actually need a strategy first and that sort of thing. So once we&#8217;ve had that discovery call, then I follow that up with documentation and what this documentation is, depending on what sort of service they&#8217;re after. So whether it&#8217;s brand design, whether it&#8217;s web design, I&#8217;m just going to send them a questionnaire where they can then put all the words that we discussed in the call onto paper just as a form of reference for the both of us so that if I need to pick up any vital information and that sort of thing, then I know that I can always refer back to that document.</p>
<p>It also helps me to set a project proposal, which covers all of our working terms. So issues to deal with costing, with deliverables, with turnover times, just for general terms of engagement that allow for us to be happy as you go throughout, as we work on the project and that sort of thing. And then once that&#8217;s signed, sealed and delivered, then I will then start working on the project. So it&#8217;s very collaborative on my end, where I tend to also include and involve my clients in the project as much as possible. And so I set up a central workspace on Notion where we can exchange ideas, where we can shorten the feedback loop, where everyone has access to everything. So at any stage of the project they can see exactly what&#8217;s going on, they can see what assets are being created and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>So when it actually comes to the design process of it, I&#8217;m going to start off with the visual mood boarding phase, which is basically putting together or curating some reference images that capture the essence of the brand or how we are trying to get it to look like. Once that&#8217;s approved, then I go into development, which will obviously be very different depending on what the project is. So it could be the logo suite and then colors type, supporting assets like iconography, brand patterns, maybe illustrations to accompany some of the assets that have been created and that sort of thing. And then, I will iterate on that of which in my project proposal I also stipulate how many rounds of revision are allowed for the project depending on the price and everything.</p>
<p>And then once it&#8217;s happiness and joy, we&#8217;ve sort of worked through it, we&#8217;ve edited what needs to be edited, we&#8217;ve revised what needs to be revised, then I will hand over all the asset files to them, inclusive of all the high resolution formats, inclusive of the original source files, and obviously guidelines and that sort of thing as to how they should retain the integrity of the brand identity that we have just worked on together. And yeah, that&#8217;s it. So that&#8217;s sort of how I cycle through it, but it&#8217;s all also very, very, very, very heavily based on research. I think that probably takes me 80% of the time and then executing everything is like 20% of the time, because I want to make sure that I am obviously creating something that is distinct, something that&#8217;s memorable, something that&#8217;s competitive, but something that also captures the heart and the essence of their story. So yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you find that clients often want skip that research step and they just want to go right into the creation part?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
I have had instances where that has happened, but it hasn&#8217;t been that often in the recent years. But if that has been the case, that&#8217;s been an immediate red flag because I think the discovery call has helped me to get a sense of whether they would be open to my process or not. So if we are on the call and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Hey, you know what? Let&#8217;s just skip over that. Don&#8217;t really matter. Let&#8217;s just design the logo and let&#8217;s go,&#8221; then I know almost immediately that that&#8217;s not going to work because there&#8217;s a lot more work that goes into the visuals or into the final outcome that people are then going to engage with. So it does happen. It has happened. It doesn&#8217;t happen as often now, but I mean, we are dealing with people at the end of the day, so everyone has a different way of thinking of how things should be done, so there&#8217;s that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ve often found even when clients want to skip that step, it always extends the project because what ends up happening is you&#8217;re making something, you&#8217;re just jumping right into it, and then you have to do X number rounds of revisions, which I like that you put in, you stipulate, &#8220;I&#8217;m only doing this many revisions.&#8221; The research helps so you stick to that, so you&#8217;re not kind of doing this constantly iterating process of trying to appease the client without doing the research first so you can try to get it right the first two or three times as opposed to, &#8220;Here&#8217;s version 12 of what we&#8217;ve been working on.&#8221; No one has time for that.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Yeah, no one has time for that for sure. And what I actually wanted to add on to that is to say that when you find that you have clients who sort of jump the gun in that way or want to do that, it really takes away from the process in the sense that you&#8217;re saying you definitely will find yourself maybe having to go back to V1 or after you are at V7 of the project, and it&#8217;s really not going to benefit you and it&#8217;s not going to benefit them either, because I think there&#8217;s going to be a lot of frustration there.</p>
<p>Research really, really, really helps you to get to that point where also you are not designing according to your client&#8217;s preference, which is another thing that we need to mention, because they are going to have their personal taste and everything like that, which is fair and fine, and we should definitely consider that, but we need to understand that when it comes to these sort of branding and visual projects, we&#8217;re also designing together or to appeal towards a certain target market or audience. So that research is essential. It really ensures that, &#8220;Hey, when we push this out, are we going to be speaking to the right people and then are they going to take it the way that we intend for them to do so?&#8221; So if anyone is listening, and if your client or potential lead is like, &#8220;No, no, no, we are not going to do research. We are just going to skip through this,&#8221; then I will tell you to not take that project. It&#8217;s not going to be worth your peace of mind.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What are the best types of clients for you to work with?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
So I have had a broad range of individuals and small businesses and corporates that I&#8217;ve worked with, and I can&#8217;t even pin it down to who the best kind of client is because I think everyone comes with a different kind of energy and a different kind of vibe. But what I&#8217;ll say is that in general, some of the projects that I&#8217;ve really enjoyed working on with individuals or small businesses, startups, enterprises who really value the importance of storytelling in one way or another.</p>
<p>So if we&#8217;re on the call and off the bat they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, we started this in 1897 and it was because my grandmother did this and did that,&#8221; and you just get this wholesome story that they just tie together and they tell you the background of why they&#8217;re doing it and that sort of thing, immediately I get good vibes from that because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, this is going to be something good to work on because there&#8217;s a lot more meaning and there&#8217;s that strong emotional connection to what they&#8217;re doing as opposed to just selling a product.&#8221; So those have been that clash of individuals who come with that sort of energy and that value storytelling in one form or another have been some of the best project that I&#8217;ve worked on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;re in Harare, Zimbabwe. I&#8217;d love for you to just paint a picture for the audience. I would say our audience is probably largely in the US. What does the creative industry look like there? Is it centered around Harare? Just kind of give us a window into what the industry is like there.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
So I would say that it is. We do have another major city called Bulawayo. Harare is the capitol, and a lot of what happens on the creative scene definitely happens here. And what&#8217;s really exciting about this time that we&#8217;re in is that we&#8217;re in a season where the creative scene in Harare or in Zimbabwe in general is on the rise. So even when it comes to novel ways of expressing fashion, of expressing fine art, of expressing expressive photography, there have been some really cool live exhibitions that have happened. They&#8217;ve been very urban fashion and photography exhibitions and shows that have also happened in the most unlikely places as well, where you would see these sort of things. And it&#8217;s just been really exciting seeing how young Zimbabwean creators are really stepping up or really stepping into their own, are really honing their craft and are really thinking of new ways of expressing the ideas. So it&#8217;s on the rise. It&#8217;s on the rise. I&#8217;m hoping that it infiltrates and sort of starts to penetrate crowd supporters overseas, but there&#8217;s a lot, a lot, a lot of exciting things that are happening currently.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you been able to tap into a creative community where you&#8217;re at?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
So I am a part of creative communities, not just here alone. I think if anything, when it comes to more of the work that I do with regards to branding web, there&#8217;s definitely room for there to be something that sort of unites creatives who do the same thing that I do. But that is, it&#8217;s there, but it&#8217;s not there. I know that&#8217;s very vague, but it makes so much sense in my head. I think there&#8217;s definitely room to see where that can go and what can be done with regards to that, but in terms of just general design communities and stuff like that, I am a part of and have had the wonderful opportunities to connect with other African creatives on the continent who are based in different cities to me. So that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve been able to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I think if the creative scene is on the rise, like you mentioned it, it kind of I guess would make sense that there&#8217;s maybe not a lot of creative groups yet because things are still, it&#8217;s in that sort of burgeoning state where stuff&#8217;s beginning, stuff&#8217;s starting to pop off, stuff is starting to gain attention and gaining traction. So it&#8217;s probably just the visibility thing I would imagine at this point because yeah, I think it might just be a visibility thing. I&#8217;m completely guessing. I have no idea what it&#8217;s like in Zimbabwe, but I just know usually when I&#8217;ve talked with other people in other cities all across the world, when they&#8217;ve had those sort of small design spaces or creative spaces that are starting to pop up, the community just hasn&#8217;t coalesced yet around something. So I think as the scene rises, those types of things will happen. I think you&#8217;ll be able to find some community there, but it&#8217;s good, like you said, that you&#8217;ve been able to find it elsewhere, too.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
And I agree with you. I think it&#8217;s definitely a visibility thing for sure, but it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re slowly breaking into. But yeah, everything in strides, I would say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, let&#8217;s learn more about you as a person. I know you kind of gave us a hint into your kind of daily creative routine, but I&#8217;d love to hear more about you growing up. Were you really into design and art as a kid? Tell me more about that.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
So I always enjoy talking about my childhood. It&#8217;s a very special, special time for me. I grew up with what I would say were liberal parents in the sense that they let me explore. So both my parents were vet surgeons and we lived in a very small town here in Zimbabwe called Norton. It&#8217;s very nice, it&#8217;s very peaceful there. So I say liberal in the sense that whenever my parents went out on site visits, whether it was to farms for vaccinations and that sort of thing, they sort of let me wonder often see what I could find. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s dangerous or not, but they kind of let me do it, to the point that on one of my site visits with my dad, I sort of snuck into an ostrich pen and I saw a massive ostrich egg, and I surprised my dad when he got home and he was like, &#8220;What is that? When did that happen?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;well, listen, you kind of let me wander off, so that&#8217;s what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I do find that even from that, it really sort of opened up my mind in terms of how I thought and what I did. So I spent a lot of time outside. I built a lot of sandcastles, I played with dirt, I built things with sticks. So because of that, even when I then started going to primary school, I&#8217;m not sure what you would call it, but when you&#8217;re maybe six years old and you start going off to school, so we call it primary school, I found myself also taking time out to make special DIY cards for my family members at that young age for special occasions. So if my aunt had a birthday, if my cousin had a birthday, I would draw my favorite cartoon characters on the front of the card, just a blank sheet of paper, fold it in half, draw my favorite characters, color them in and give that to them as a birthday card.</p>
<p>So I think the creative sort of inclinations and the creative bone or creative DNA has been there from the time that I was born really, but I didn&#8217;t know that I could actually sort of capitalize on it or I could really bring it in and do something with it, which is why, like you mentioned earlier, as you were talking before this, that I went on to study science instead of anything creative. So instead of anything design related. I think maybe it probably worked as well because my parents essentially would&#8217;ve been in the scientific field because of the veterinary surgery and all of that. So it made sense for me to also do something in line with that or try and go into the scientific field.</p>
<p>But yeah, I kind of realized it much later after I graduated. I was like, &#8220;Wait, okay. There&#8217;s this thing called design and I could probably take it up and let&#8217;s see where it goes.&#8221; But again, I wouldn&#8217;t say that it&#8217;s something that I really thought of. It happened also in a very freakish way because after I graduated from university in 2014, I was job hunting for six months at the start of 2015, and I couldn&#8217;t find anything anywhere. I put my CV in the most random corners of the world and nothing came up, and I was so frustrated and I had no idea what I was going to do.</p>
<p>So in order to curb my frustration, I decided that I needed to teach myself a new skill. But even how design came about, again, maybe it&#8217;s divine order, maybe it&#8217;s something in the universe, I don&#8217;t know what it is. I was on YouTube and my top recommended video was a Photoshop tutorial. And it&#8217;s so weird, Maurice, because I had never heard of Photoshop before and I had never remotely&#8230; you could be like maybe the algorithm was doing things or whatever, but I had not even searched anything that is even closely linked to anything to do with Photoshop. So it was so weird. I just kind of clicked into it and my mind was blown because I was like, &#8220;Wait, are you telling me that people can actually do this with your computers and people make money from this and it&#8217;s a whole thing that you can do?&#8221; It was so bizarre to me.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s how it sort of started, and I started self-learning in design, and I also happened to get a full-time job that I started going to towards the middle of May in education. So I worked in education for six years with children age between 6 and 12 years old, and I was in the sports and coaching and conditioning department at the school, so in line more with the human physiology part of what I studied, but I was learning design on the side. I would go to work and come back and be like, &#8220;Wait, what can I learn today? Let me pull up another YouTube tutorial.&#8221; And at the time, I had a jet engine of a laptop and I had cracked Photoshop.</p>
<p>So yeah, I don&#8217;t know if the audience would be familiar with this, but maybe it&#8217;s going to show my age, too. But it was a time of torrents as well, so you could sort of download the torrent for Photoshop. Yeah, so that&#8217;s what I did, and it just kind of stuck and I loved it, and I just kept going with it, up until eventually I left my job at the end of 2020. I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be a full-time creative solopreneur,&#8221; and it&#8217;s been one hell of a ride ever since then.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think there&#8217;s certainly going to be a good bit of our audience that relates to using a cracked version of Photoshop to start learning about how to design. That&#8217;s how I started up. I was using a cracked version of Photoshop, and I was going to a local bookstore, and I mean, I&#8217;m dating myself now. This is early&#8230; not early, maybe mid-2000s or so, 2004, 2005. Because there used to be these books published about Photoshop, like Photoshop 6: Dirty Tips and Tricks, and it would show you all these different little effects that you could make. &#8220;This is how you make a metal effect. This is how you make a gold effect. This is how you make a water effect.&#8221; And I didn&#8217;t have the money to purchase those books because those things were $50. I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have $50 to buy this book, but what I can do is write down all the steps in my notebook and take it back home, or I could take a picture,&#8221; because I had this little dinky point and shoot camera, and I would take a picture of the page and just go back home and download the pictures and have the picture up, and then have Photoshop up and try to mimic the steps and stuff. So I mean, that&#8217;s how you learn. It&#8217;s that hands-on kind of stuff. So I completely, completely understand where you&#8217;re coming from there.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, it&#8217;s a real life case of trust the process.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. When you look back at your time in college, you were studying human anatomy, physiology, biochemistry. In hindsight, did you see any elements of design in that work?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Yeah, actually, because now, especially when it comes to maybe my research methodology just for creative projects, I see that I borrow a lot from what I learned during that time. So even when it comes to general experiments, obviously you&#8217;ve got to know what sort of equipment you&#8217;re going to use. You got to know what you need in order to get a certain result, you&#8217;re going to have to evaluate that result. Maybe you&#8217;re going to have to redo things and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>So that entire process of being able to design an experiment, I think is the same thing that I use now when it comes to coming up with concepts for brands. The research part of it definitely comes from there, because I can read any sort of, what may seem very boring content, especially within my line of work and my influences. I probably need to also read research papers, see what other maybe anthropologists or just historians have come up with regards to a certain topic. So that&#8217;s pages and pages of just literature, and I blur through that with ease. It doesn&#8217;t even feel like anything to me because I think just having been trained in a specific way when it came to my formal education really has helped a lot, and more so even when it comes to coming up with solutions and dissecting briefs and that sort of thing, I see a lot of my scientific background coming to play there. In hindsight, I&#8217;m definitely grateful for it because I think it&#8217;s made me a better creative and it&#8217;s also made me a better problem solver and a better thinker. So yeah, I definitely see how the two roles come together to form something quite beautiful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s great that your scientific background influences your approach because we were talking earlier about research. If you were a doctor or you just try to diagnose someone or just jump right in without doing research, you would not be a good doctor. So similarly, it&#8217;s the same way with design. You have to do that research to know, &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the best approach? How do I know the best way to tackle this particular thing?&#8221; As you mentioned that, it just reminded me of what I&#8217;ve went through as a math&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say a mathematician, but my degree as a math. I didn&#8217;t study design professionally. I just studied as a hobby and managed to turn it into a career. And when I look back even at the times where I was drawing 3D graphs by hand on a chalkboard or trying to create certain graphs and functions in mathematical or whatever, tessellations, fractals, et cetera, there&#8217;s design in those elements, too. There&#8217;s a lot of design in math that I don&#8217;t think probably, I don&#8217;t want to say traditional designers, but I think most designers probably don&#8217;t look at math that way. It&#8217;s funny, I even mentioned it and folks are like, &#8220;Ugh, math, I hate math.&#8221; And I mean, I like math.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t blame them. I don&#8217;t blame them. It&#8217;s math [inaudible 00:36:14]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I mean, I think what math does, and probably similarly to what you have went through studying anatomy and physiology and biochemistry, it gives you a different way to process information. So for you, it&#8217;s really about making sure that you have that thorough research to execute the designs in the right way. When I think about math, math really taught me how to structure my thinking and that I&#8217;ve been able to use in proofs, in proposals, in any sorts of things when it comes to getting that message across succinctly to a client or something like that. So for designers out there that are like, &#8220;Ugh, the sciences,&#8221; don&#8217;t rule out the sciences. There&#8217;s ways that you can tie these things together.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Yeah. And it&#8217;s actually so interesting, because like you&#8217;re saying it really shapes your process and how you dissect creativity in general. I&#8217;ve had the most interesting conversations. I feel like some of the most interesting conversations I&#8217;ve had are obviously with you right now because this is very enlightening, but also with people who have made career pivots, so accountants who are now creatives or medical doctors, which is so crazy, who are now creatives or engineers who are now creatives. And also just looking into their process and how they do things and how even the final outcome looks. It&#8217;s so interesting, because you see how based off of the different professional backgrounds or the different educational backgrounds, the process is just going to be entirely different, but the outcome is going to be just as beautiful. Sorry. So it&#8217;s just really interesting just seeing how people merge all these different worlds and then just come up with this solid body of creative work. It&#8217;s fascinating to me, absolutely fascinating.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What do you want our audience to know about, I guess, design in Zimbabwe? What do you want them to know about, whether it&#8217;s the work that you see coming out of it, other creatives that you know that are kind of on the rise? What do you want to let our audience know about that?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Oh, gosh, there&#8217;s so much. I just wish that this was a video presentation and I could show you some of the work because it&#8217;s so good. But I think if anything, there&#8217;s a shift. There&#8217;s a shift, and I definitely want to speak on this, but not in greater detail because that&#8217;s not why we are here. But I think there has been a lot of external imposition on what creative work looks like or should look like based off of history and colonization and everything that has happened.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s this massive shift where what we are trying to do is to decolonize design in the sense that we want to say, &#8220;Hey, design can actually look like this, and that&#8217;s perfectly fine. Photography can look like this, and that&#8217;s perfectly fine.&#8221; So if anything, like I was referring to earlier, within the creative scene in Zimbabwe, there is definitely a lot that is coming up and on the rise, but even as you engage with the visuals, when you engage with the patterns, with the colors, with the execution, and I spoke of how you have these fashion shows that are being done in the most unlikely locations, you see that there&#8217;s definitely this big drive to ensure that the work is great, but also the way that the work is executed and the way that people engage with the work is unlike anything that we&#8217;ve seen before.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s really, really exciting just seeing how more young Africans are stepping into their own really claiming and owning their identity and are just saying, &#8220;Hey, this may be a lot for people to take in. Maybe it&#8217;s too African, maybe it&#8217;s just too much energy, but it&#8217;s fine because this is who we are and we want to be able to tell our story the way that it should be told.&#8221; So yeah, it&#8217;s fun times ahead, fun times ahead. Fun times ahead. Let&#8217;s look into the future. Two years from now, five years from now, I believe that Zimbabwe and Zimbabwean creativity and Zimbabwean design is going to be on a whole other level.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you consider to be your biggest success in your design career so far?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
I am going to go more on the qualitative route, where I feel like my biggest success has been the chance and the opportunity to be able to connect with other creatives who are like me and have them sort of recognize themselves in the work that I do. I could easily say something like, &#8220;Oh, I worked with a client who paid me X amount, or I did this and that,&#8221; but I think that just the sense of community is something that has really, really, really, really impacted me the most.</p>
<p>I get so much joy when I&#8217;m able to talk to, or someone who&#8217;s just an up and coming designer or thinking of design, and they&#8217;re based maybe in Kenya or they&#8217;re based in Burundi, and they just write me a message on social. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Hey, I saw your work and I just absolutely feel really inspired that I can actually sort of tap into my own culture and see what I can come up with,&#8221; and that sort of thing. And that is something that really, really, really, really, like I can wake up every day to that and not get paid a single dime and I&#8217;ll be fine. So that has been my biggest success, my biggest achievement, and I want to see how I can continue to build on that and see how I can continue to hopefully inspire and encourage other young African creatives to really step up and showcase your work and showcase their heritage, their culture, your tradition, and just take that to the global market. So yeah, that&#8217;s it for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve mentioned, I read this as I was sort of doing my research, you mentioned that you find inspiration from within when it comes to your work. Can you talk with me a little bit more about that? How do you build that sort of internal fortitude? How do you build that?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
So it hasn&#8217;t always been there, and I should be very honest about that because I think that as we were growing up and also the public education system that we&#8217;re exposed to, a lot of what we were taught doesn&#8217;t really resonate with who we are. So I probably at that point knew a lot more about Western history than I did about my own history, and I think that is something that needs to be fixed. So the resolve, I guess, or the tenacity has really come from wanting to do more when it comes to that. And I sort of had my light bulb moment when I encountered a book by well known as Zimbabwean graphic designer, but he&#8217;s also known in the international community. His name is Professor Saki Mafundikwa. He actually went to school in New York, I believe. So he studied there, and then he came back and he started the first graphic design school here in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also given a TED Talk, and in his TED Talk he talks about looking for inspiration within. So after encountering his book, which is called African Alphabets, I was completely blown away because again, it comes back to that whole issue of documentation where I didn&#8217;t really know that it was possible to document African design systems in the way that he did. And it&#8217;s mostly based on typography and it&#8217;s absolutely fascinating stuff. So if anything, that&#8217;s where the initial point of contact or inspiration came from, and it just made so much sense to me because I had sort of been lost in this design world where I was doing anything and everything. And I&#8217;m sure you can attest to this as well, when you start out, you do everything. You&#8217;ll do your company profile, you&#8217;ll do a brochure, you&#8217;ll do a flyer, a poster, doesn&#8217;t really matter what the subject matter is.</p>
<p>I mean, it does, don&#8217;t get me wrong, because people will be like, &#8220;Hey, what kind of things were you designing?&#8221; But not in that sense. But that point gave me a sense of direction and really inspired me to be like, &#8220;Hey, actually we can flip this thing around. Let&#8217;s take all of these fundamentals that we&#8217;ve learned and convey them into a message that I would actually want for people to engage with and a message that I would want to see myself in.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I guess that is where that internal resolution has come from, and it&#8217;s been the driving and motivating factor ever since then to be like, &#8220;What can I do today? What can I do different? How can I take this story that people may have perceived in this way or this narrative and turn it into something that&#8217;s Afro-positive?&#8221; Because there are a lot of stories, there are a lot of things that I see about who we are and what we do and where we eat and where we live and that sort of thing and the world may see us a certain way, but I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No, actually, if we take power and we actually tell our story the way that it&#8217;s supposed to be told, then there&#8217;s so much more that we can actually get out of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>So really the looking within is to say as much as I can go out and seek inspiration online, on Pinterest, on [inaudible 00:46:11], what is in my backyard? Because when you look at the global and historical context, even between the two of us, we may share the same skin color, but when it comes to our historical context, our global context, there&#8217;s absolutely no way that you would be able to design like a designer who is in Harare, Zimbabwe, when you&#8217;re in Atlanta, Georgia. It&#8217;s just different.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s where really the looking within comes into be like, &#8220;Hey, what am I exposed to? What do I see on a daily? What sort of conversations can I have to seek inspiration? Can I go and speak to an outside vendor and find out how he weaves his basket? Can I have a conversation with my grandmother about how she designed her mud hut kitchen and all the paintings and murals that are on the outside?&#8221; Things like that really, really make a difference because you actually start to see that there&#8217;s creativity in a lot of the crafts that I see around me, and how can I leverage that? What can I draw from their processes as well, and how can I turn that into this fresh thing and tell it in a different way for everyone else on the internet to interact with? So that is really where it comes from.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
At this stage of your career, how do you define success?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Ooh, that is a loaded question, now, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is it?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Yeah, because I&#8217;ve really got to think about it. But I think at this stage, what I think is really cool and what I&#8217;m really grateful for is the fact that even in interactions where I may not be there, so whether it&#8217;s physical spaces, whether it&#8217;s calls, it&#8217;s the fact that people are able to sort of recognize my work, and I think that&#8217;s so cool.</p>
<p>I get humbled every single time when I go on LinkedIn and someone will maybe tag me or mention me and be like, &#8220;Hey, is this your work?&#8221; And I&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Oh, no, it&#8217;s not my work, but I think that it&#8217;s so cool that you think that it could be my work.&#8221; So that really, really, really, really inspires me and motivates me to keep going. Just the fact that I&#8217;m in a position where people tend to think of me when it comes to a certain style or when it comes to a certain interpretation of design, I think it&#8217;s super cool. So that is one of my proudest moments, I think, and I&#8217;ve been working hard at it, so I&#8217;m glad that it&#8217;s paying off.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to any aspiring designers out there that maybe want to sort of follow in your footsteps? What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
This is going to sound so cliche, but I think the thing is to just go for it. I have come to learn that there are beautiful things that grow when you step outside of your comfort zone. It&#8217;s not the easiest thing to do, but I think that if you put yourself in a position where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, this is a little bit crazy, it&#8217;s a little bit scary. I have absolutely no idea how I am going to pull this off, but I&#8217;m going to go for it,&#8221; which is sort of what I had to do.</p>
<p>So I spoke of leaving my job, but I was sort of unsafe, like unfairly dismissed. In pandemic year in 2020 was the most heartbreaking experience ever. And I was kind of left thinking, &#8220;Whoa, what am I going to do with this thing and how am I going to make money and how am I going to take care of myself,&#8221; and everything like that. But you realize that certain doors get shut and they get shut in the most uncomfortable way ever because they&#8217;re sort of pushing you to get to the next thing, to start working on the next thing.</p>
<p>So if anything, if it feels a little bit scary, if it feels like you have absolutely no idea how you are going to do it, then I would encourage you to go for that thing because you never know what&#8217;s going to come out of it. But I mean, go with it. Go in it, sorry, having a plan of sorts. It may not be something that&#8217;s super solid, but at least make sure that you work on your strategy, make sure that you know what it is that you want to be doing and where you&#8217;re going to be doing it and who you&#8217;re going to be doing it with. Write all of that down and see if you can break it down into actionable steps and then see how far you can push it. But that really would be my advice. If you want to make a career pivot, too. I mean, former mathematician who says that he doesn&#8217;t want to call himself a mathematician and former scientist-ish over here. So if you also want to transition, if you want to go over the bridge, it&#8217;s never too late. You can always do that, as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want your next chapter to look like?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Oh, I love this. I definitely see myself in design education. So as we have been talking, I&#8217;ve been talking about documenting processes and that sort of thing, and I am grateful that I&#8217;ve already sort of started dipping my toes in design education when it comes to my mentorship and my coaching role with Flux Academy. So we work with brand&#8230; we work with students across the world to enroll for various design programs, and one of them happens to be a brand design program. So I sort of offer them support with that. I offer them feedback as they go through their modules and everything like that. It&#8217;s a very diverse group of students, as young as 20, as old as 70. So it&#8217;s very interesting seeing what that is like, but it really feels like sort of the next step for me because I really want to see myself more in the African design education space. So can we have more design curriculum? Can we have more design curriculum that is geared towards African creatives? Can we get more literature? Can we get more books? Can you get more additional platforms that help African students learn about design and a more African aesthetic? Things like that. So that&#8217;s definitely where I would want to see myself five years from now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
I am everywhere except for TikTok because it scares me. I have a burner account on TikTok where I just follow amazing people, but the comments section scares me there. So you can always find me on my website, so fungidube.com, or my social links are also on my website, so you can find my Behance, you can find my Twitter, you can find my Instagram. You can also find my LinkedIn there, but it&#8217;s fungidube.com.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Fungi Dube, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. One, I think it&#8217;s awesome that you can give us just a window into what it&#8217;s like being a creative solopreneur in Africa, in Zimbabwe, giving us a sense of what that looks like. But also, just thank you for sharing your story about just determination and passion and how you&#8217;ve been able to really cultivate that creative engine within to create great work and showing people that you don&#8217;t necessarily have to go down a specific path, no pun intended for the name of the show, but you don&#8217;t have to go down a specific path in order to become a creative, be a creative, and even to leverage your own culture in the work that you do. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Thank you so much for having me. This has been so much fun, now.</p>

<p>Maintaining authenticity is an important part of every creative&#8217;s journey, especially as you move up the ranks and gain more experience. But does it come at a cost? That certainly came up during my conversation with the highly acclaimed designer Ube Urban. Ube defines a space that is unclear &#8212; the innovation space &#8212; but he&#8217;s learned to wield that in his favor and now he&#8217;s on the lookout for his next opportunity.</p>
<p>Ube explained more about what he does, going in-depth with how he first got involved in design and how he works with brands. He also shared his story about growing up in Hawai&#8217;i, moving to California for college, and how his early entrepreneurial journey as a creative in San Francisco eventually brought him to Atlanta. We also spent some time talking about how he maintains his authentic self in an industry that often forces you into a box. Ube is so much more than his profession, and I think by the end of this conversation, you&#8217;ll see that too!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Hello everyone. This is Ube Urban, and I&#8217;m a customer user experience either director, practitioner, and chameleon within the customer experience space and digital transformations.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, just to I think level set a bit for the audience, and we&#8217;ll probably go into this later. But what is customer experience? What does that mean?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Customer experience is kind of, here&#8217;s another buzzword for you. The phy-gital experience. So physical and digital, omnichannel experiences. So really focusing on each individual point where a customer may interact with the brand, whether through social channels, going to a website. Or even going through some type of service, whether it&#8217;s a buy flow, creating an account, and what have you. Basically, you&#8217;re looking at the efficiencies and/or pain points, and trying to create opportunities from that to create a holistically better and hyper personalized experience. And this is done through many other ways that we can unpack later.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now when you and I last talked, you were working at a company, Simon-Kucher &#038; Partners, I think is what it&#8217;s called. How&#8217;s that been going?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been going great. We officially separated. So yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I guess it is great. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;It&#8217;s great. I&#8217;m no longer working there. It&#8217;s wonderful.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Hence the tone in my voice may seem more joyful, and relaxed, and even keel, and less anxiety in the background. And it was for the best choice of both of us, having that leadership support and buy-in. Also trying to meet goals within a year. I mean, at the digital space, if you ask anybody, it&#8217;s pretty much like dog years. So in your first year, you pretty much have to create any type of game changing go-to-market strategies with these unrealistic expectations.</p>
<p>But at the same time, you&#8217;re just up for the challenge. You think you can meet and exceed that. But given the amount of time giving how you unpackage processes and methodologies, culture within an organization, it&#8217;s very difficult. Especially shifts in org, so this is very problematic within the space. Everybody is moving jobs. Your leaders are changing probably anywhere from one to maybe even three times a year. And this is not necessarily healthy not only from myself, but the people that you interface with and lead.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of fluctuations in morale, and it&#8217;s really hard when your job is on the line. Bot because of what you do as a practitioner and what you bring to the table, but rather if you&#8217;re a useful resource, a number. &#8220;What can you do for me? Do I like you? Can we interface? Can you opt into my swim lanes of success? And it&#8217;s usually sink or swim. Are you the gatekeeper of your success? Not anymore.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So what do your current days look like now? What kind of work are you doing just in general?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
My current days, the separation is very fresh. So it&#8217;s going back to the pastures, and seeing the grass is greener. And whether I want to go into pixel pushing and being a quintessential user experience, user interface designer within the tech space. Or do I want to lead and build another department. There&#8217;s a lot of open-ended questions and instant gratifications. Yes, of course I want to go back into my designer years.</p>
<p>But to be honest, I know too much behind a curtain. So it&#8217;s hard to have that niche aperture to put on my blinders. I cannot do it, because I&#8217;m exposed to so many different aspects of the professional space. And not only as the design space as a collection, but more of the business, who you have to interface with, the different dialects that you have to speak. Cultivating the relationships in order to really bring up your sense of self, your accountability, and basically the reach you have within an organization or clients. And this has everything and nothing to do with the reason why I got into being an artist or a designer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know what you mean. I think when you get to a certain stage in your career, you&#8217;ve just seen too much. You know how the sausage is made, you&#8217;re not interested. And I mean it&#8217;s too much in that it sort of prevents you from really getting into the work, because now there&#8217;s all these other things that you have to contend with, that don&#8217;t have to do with the work as you&#8217;ve mentioned. That can impede your performance, your progress, what you&#8217;re able to accomplish, etc. Yeah. I feel you. Especially in a space that changes as much as design and technology do, particularly the tech space. I mean the tech space over the past, six months has been the red wedding, Game of Thrones. Every week, I&#8217;m hearing 10,000 people are laid off from these companies and it&#8217;s like, geez, what does that-</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
What are all these new openings here? And you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Because the work doesn&#8217;t disappear just because they laid these people off. So it&#8217;s an odd time. So I get what you mean about just slowing down and trying to figure out what the next move is going to be. Because look, the older you get, it ain&#8217;t too many more moves you can make. That same bounce back doesn&#8217;t get easier. I would say one, the older you get. And two, just the more that you get into it, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay. What do I want the next thing to be?&#8221; Now you&#8217;ve been occupying what you call the innovation space for the past five or six years now. How do you define that?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Innovation is not innovative anymore. When I self-reflect and look back, let&#8217;s just say on revisiting my CV, innovation just doesn&#8217;t mean what it is today. And what I mean by that is when you&#8217;re working on an initiative and you&#8217;re doing something that is unheard of, at least within let&#8217;s just say the direct to consumer, even retail space. And you&#8217;re doing heat tracking, you&#8217;re doing eye gazing, you&#8217;re doing everything that Nestles under machine learning and computer vision. It feels like you&#8217;re basically trendsetting that particular space.</p>
<p>But when six months go by or even to a year, and it feels that everybody&#8217;s on that bandwagon, where you could do a quick Google search and find research segmentation of various customer markets and how they use it, or how larger companies are using this type of technology within their flagship stores. It&#8217;s not innovative anymore, it&#8217;s just part of the work. It&#8217;s business as usual.</p>
<p>Innovative spaces is basically trying to nurture and shift with the customer and what the behavior is ,of what they&#8217;re interfacing at that given time. Platforms shift in so many different ways depending how you&#8217;re using it. Basically having a computer in your back pocket, we&#8217;re used to that. We&#8217;re used to doing every single thing that we can do on a computer, on our phones. Let alone you have an iPad, or you have a desktop setup or what have you. So we are basically spoiled by all these experiences, and basically selling our digital footprint and souls to a lot of these organizations.</p>
<p>So this is something also that we didn&#8217;t really talk about. We&#8217;re kind of skimming the surface of what it meant to have privacy, what it meant to start to establish trust. If we&#8217;re starting to peel back the layers and find out a lot more about one particular person, or even thousands of people. Are people with basically selling their digital souls for hyper personalized experiences? It&#8217;s very controversy. And no matter where that landscape goes, people are always thinking about it.</p>
<p>Where&#8217;s my data? Where&#8217;s my work landing? What server is it on? If it&#8217;s in the cloud, what does that mean? Is it safe? Where are my archives at? What is attached to my name? If somebody&#8217;s trying to extract and just find out a little bit more about you, is that information correct? There&#8217;s so many different outliers and things to consider, especially within the umbrella of innovation.</p>
<p>So innovation, it was a word that you could use for anything that didn&#8217;t have a set definition. User experience UI. Organizations still don&#8217;t know what these practitioners really do and what they can bring to the table. But you can lump that under innovation practices because it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, we have people that are basically jack of all trades.&#8221; They&#8217;re chameleons, they&#8217;re entrepreneurs. That&#8217;s usually the newer way of, &#8220;Hey, you have so many different traits. And interest in your background, here, we&#8217;ll just slap this buzzword on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So as I went through it at the time in this trend setting space, and trying to basically peel back these layers of what identity was within the technological space, it was very interesting. But as it became pretty much shifting into the status quo, it&#8217;s hard to make something compelling and different.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You said innovation is not innovative anymore. I felt that. That is so true. I mean, I think to even your earlier point about these new considerations around privacy, and where our data is going, and things like that, I think if there&#8217;s anything in the past few years have taught us is that people, while they are concerned about what company is selling their data, they&#8217;re also giving it away freely.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think over the past few months, the biggest topics in tech&#8230; I feel like our intersections of technology and culture have revolved around AI generated art, ChatGPT, etc. And it&#8217;s like yes, it is these artificial intelligence things, these language models that are outputting this stuff. But it&#8217;s only as good as what we give it or what we use for it. The AI art is pulling from stuff that is already publicly available on the internet. The ChatGPT stuff is pulling from the immense corpus of text that&#8217;s already available online.</p>
<p>Now granted, I think when the web and the internet were first created, especially as they got popularized, that&#8217;s not something that we even considered, as people started sharing stuff. I remember vividly the age of &#8220;user generated&#8221; content, the whole Web 2.0 era. People could not put enough stuff willingly online. Videos, photos, location. I mean, Foursquare? People ain&#8217;t doing Foursquare no more. You mean to tell me I could track exactly where I&#8217;ve been, and where people are, and congregating? That shit is now a huge security risk. So it&#8217;s interesting now that the innovation space has shifted and changed as technology has improved.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
And then we go into instant gratification. This piggybacks off of all the behavior of these data breaches and basically providing all this information. You have a driver&#8217;s license, you have a credit card. You have PreCheck to fly. You&#8217;re basically selling your whole background just to have a better experience. But this means you&#8217;re giving your fingerprints. You have your mugshot. You&#8217;re basically getting a background check pulled.</p>
<p>And a lot of this is happening even if you have an email. And a lot of times, it&#8217;s great to have these interactions to demystify&#8230; You have these broad statements. I don&#8217;t share my data, or I don&#8217;t put my stuff on a drive. And I just ask people simple questions. &#8220;Do you have a driver&#8217;s license? Do you have a credit card? Do you have an email?&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, I have all of those. Of course.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What is your email title?&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s a Gmail.&#8221; &#8220;Interesting.&#8221; And when I was at AT&#038;T, we had some pretty top secret products where you can essentially see what your marketers are pushing your segments, how to respond to that. What campaigns would be basically pushed out, if it triggered any type of red flags. So basically what you&#8217;re seeing and what you&#8217;re being pushed, you&#8217;re not controlling that in the backend.</p>
<p>And it even got to a point where you could see the types of emails that were coming into a particular customer&#8217;s account. And you think, &#8220;Yeah my email, it&#8217;s my safe space. It&#8217;s my haven. Nobody has access to it.&#8221; That&#8217;s not true. And if you work for any large company, you pretty much have to sign over any T&#038;C. And I mean, who reads terms and conditions anymore?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not happening. You want to use the latest, cool, amazing flagship phone? Guess what? You&#8217;re going to have to go through all that terms and conditions to basically sign over everything that you do on this computer, to me, the company.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s something where you say it in retrospect, either you&#8217;re okay with it or not. Sometimes you have visibility. Most societal trends, a lot of people don&#8217;t really know the extent of how things move in the back end. Which is expected, and it&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p>But I think that&#8217;s why you start to see a lot of this narrative shift around, how do we build trust? How do we build transparency? Well, you&#8217;ve hid everything that you do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, you&#8217;re right. Even going to what you said about these unusual licensing agreements, you can easily just scroll to the bottom and click a checkbox. You don&#8217;t have to read all of that. I mean, it&#8217;s a design decision to put it in a place, or gate it in such a way where it&#8217;s going to be an impedance to the flow of how you move through the service. So people are just like, &#8220;Let me just get to the thing.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yeah. If I click a next button and it has me [inaudible 00:19:49] or scroll through six pages of legal, yeah, I&#8217;ll click that. You just saved me what? Five, 15 minutes of reading all that? I don&#8217;t want to read that. I just want to use my new shiny device.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. So let&#8217;s learn more about Ube. Let&#8217;s learn more about you, the person. We&#8217;ll get more into your work later. You&#8217;re originally from Hawaii, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yes. Yeah, this is correct.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me what it was growing up there.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a lot of different emotions with growing up on an island. And although it&#8217;s part of the colonized US states, it still embraces a lot of island culture. People that are Guamanian, or Samoan, Tongan. Even islanders that are from Portugal, even. Japan, you have right around the corner as well. And then all the Pacific Islands. Filipinos also came and kind of congregated that at this island.</p>
<p>So you have a lot of mixed cultures. You speak a lot of different languages. And people, or at least my family, we really embraced the cultures that we occupied. Mine in particular focused more on the Japanese-Filipino makeup. For all the people that don&#8217;t know, I am Black, Japanese, Native American, Cherokee, and Filipino. So there&#8217;s a lot going on in the background. And a lot that is a juxtaposition of welcome identity, and trying to reconfigure and how that aligns with my political visual self, especially on the mainland market.</p>
<p>But when you&#8217;re in pretty much the melting pot and brown bag of the islands, it feels like there&#8217;s no worries. And you have this expectation kind of like where anybody has grown up, that it&#8217;s like that everywhere else. You really embrace the culture, the food. You love the people around you. You love to congregate. You have parties all the time. You have the karaoke jams in the background and what have you.</p>
<p>And a lot of the culture is embraced in the kitchen. That&#8217;s how you brought these valued connections. It wasn&#8217;t about classification, or how much money you brought to the family, or how much you made, or what you did as a job. It was just more bringing your sense of self and coming to a gathering.</p>
<p>And these parties were mostly in people&#8217;s backyards and garages. There&#8217;s nothing fancy about it. And it was pretty much true to the heart of having the laulau or a pig cooked in the backyard, or a goat, or what have you. You had your older grandmothers, aunts, uncles cooking in the kitchen. You had some oysters in the corner. You had the kids playing and what have you. A lot of this sentiment and feeling is essentially what I try to go back to and showcase within different parts of my professional experience, personal experience, and all the different social channels that I occupy. And this adds and is a huge anchor to bringing that consistency within authentic experiences, is how do I capture what I went through as a kid in the islands into the new environments that I occupy? And it&#8217;s very difficult. But at the same time, there&#8217;s people that are welcoming, that are up for buying into this overall lay of the land.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now growing up there, were you really getting into design, or art, or anything? Were you a really creative kid or a creative teenager?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yes. Yeah. I was a very creative kid. I was one of those kids that were very particular, had OCD. But I was the only person that had that in my family. So I grew up in an environment where a lot of my family members, they were like hoarders. They were pack rats. A lot of stuff around them. So maybe it was rejection of having all this stuff around and trying to figure out, how do I create a controlled space within the perspective of a four or five year old, or even into a teenager?</p>
<p>I played with Legos a lot. I would build based on the instructions, and then dismantle it, create a new invention. I did basically pixelation of the Ninja Turtles, which was amazing at the time. I would build planes, motorized sets, marble creations, and what have you.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&#8217;s that part. And then I had my artistic side. Bob Ross, it was pretty big time. So I got into oil painting, and that&#8217;s where I started to really work with a new medium, and what have you.</p>
<p>And then I always drew my own Marvel cards. X-Men cards were very popular along with any other type of sports cards. So I wanted to try to make my own set and what have you.</p>
<p>So a lot of what I did was self-taught. And nobody even knew what being a creative, or a designer, or a practitioner in the artistic space. Feels was very foreign to my family. And essentially, let&#8217;s be clear. Nobody thought you could have a profession out of that. And the overall perception was, &#8220;Hey, are you painting pictures? Are you sketching? Okay, I guess that&#8217;s okay, but what else are you doing? Are you an engineer? Are you a doctor? Are you a lawyer?&#8221; It was just something that everybody gravitated to within my family, because it was all that we knew. And nobody was really going down to those verticals.</p>
<p>I grew up not in the best place of Hawaii islands. It&#8217;s not the glitz and glamour of what people visit. It&#8217;s in a pretty rough area of [inaudible 00:26:21]. And rough in the context of looking back. Growing up, that was just the state of mind. That was just who I was. But that&#8217;s why as an adult, pulling in whatever revenue, having the visibility, having this working knowledge. It&#8217;s great to have something that wasn&#8217;t in particular accessible to our family. It&#8217;s a lot of colorism. It&#8217;s dealing with being landlocked. And also just coming back to the island. If you went to the mainland, basically US to go to school, have a job, you always came back to support the family. You would never leave and keep going off to different, greener pastures. It was just an unwritten rule, unfortunately.</p>
<p>So it got to a point where hey, how do we build and use these new kind of outliers? New to me, predefined for many people that already had this structure and safety nets in place. Going to school, going to college, knowing what you&#8217;re going to major in, knowing what your interest is in high school. Doing AP classes. That&#8217;s more the academia side.</p>
<p>Then you have this cultural shift of okay, there&#8217;s a language barrier. Because I grew up speaking, mostly it was a mixture of Japanese, Hawaiian, and Filipino, and sprinkle of English. In a Pidgin way, that&#8217;s basically a slang. So not the correct way to speak English, I quickly realized. But having that interaction with somebody in the mainland and then coming from the islands, it just makes you self-conscious. Because you&#8217;re the only one speaking with an accent. You&#8217;re the only one that embraces different traits of your culture. And essentially, you&#8217;re trying to integrate yourself into something that you&#8217;re always built up to look forward to, which was American quintessential culture. Things that you see on TV. The white picket fences, and the large property, and the house. And that was something that you kind of strive towards, and that was ingrained in you.</p>
<p>In the mainland, you have the paper bag test to determine your worth based on how fair-skinned you were. And this was very prevalent even in the islands. Even in a melting pot. Still you have this if you&#8217;re a lighter skin, you can tell that you&#8217;re a tourist, a Haole. You have to darken up. Which is not like the status quo, but you have contradictory thoughts in your family because they&#8217;re trying to enforce, &#8220;Hey, you need to be lighter to enable you to navigate within the mainland space of America.&#8221; So stay out of the sun, be lighter, stifle your accent, try to speak more quote unquote &#8220;American.&#8221; Have that vernacular, that slang. And you&#8217;re kind of brought to embrace your culture. But at the same time, try to adopt another one and strive towards that, while concealing your own identity.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s something that even till this day, I tend to struggle with. Even though we&#8217;ve shared a stage many times, Maurice, where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, how do we bring our authentic selves? What does that mean? Is it even true? Is it prevalent?&#8221;</p>
<p>The long and short of it is no. If I brought my authentic self to work, the foundation island boy. A, there would be a language barrier. B, it would just be too welcoming, too hyper empathetic. Giving your sense of self in order to embrace these new connections. Nobody really does that in corporate identity, let alone in a professional landscape. So we can unpack that a lot more, but I&#8217;ll pause there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, you already unpacked a lot. Part of that, I do want to revisit I think a little bit later. But I&#8217;m curious. It sounds like all of this might have been the impetus for you to leave Hawaii and go to San Francisco. You studied design there at a few colleges in San Francisco. Walk me through that time. I mean, you were at Berkeley. You were at CCA. Walk me through that time.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yeah. I would say in sophomore year of high school, that&#8217;s where I was pretty much going through a huge transition culturally, self-identity. Also, just seeing how things, and structures, and academia worked in the mainland. And it was very different from what I was used to, and it was a very hard experience.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I found out that I was incredibly bright. So I would go through all the different classes. I wasn&#8217;t really challenged. And this is why I started to leverage City College. So you can do all AP classes. But if you do that, what is next? You have to start doing undergraduate classes. And then I figured out in high school, &#8220;Hey, the more classes you take for a college credit, you can apply that to whatever school you go to for your undergrad. That&#8217;s very lucrative. That sounds about right.&#8221;</p>
<p>And take note. Nobody&#8217;s funneling my rent, my groceries, let alone my higher education and extracurricular activities. Which was sports and playing a little football. I did bowling, pool. I tried to get into a lot of different areas, while at the same time trying to find myself and see where I fit within the new landscape of these cliques that form in high school.</p>
<p>And I quickly realized, at least looking back, that being hyper empathetic&#8230; I wasn&#8217;t hyper empathetic, but I really cared about the wellbeing of others. I didn&#8217;t agree with bullying. I tried to make everybody feel welcome. But at the same time, tried to be very personal to different demographics. I never saw myself as just one thing. It was something that I always I wouldn&#8217;t say rejected, but I could never pigeonhole myself to be one thing, because I embrace so many different things in cultures. I could never call myself, &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m American.&#8221; I could never pick one particular identity that I embrace, or even my makeup of myself. It&#8217;s something that going through the evolvement and starting to learn who I was, I think I embraced different channels of that, to really play into the gray area and see what the benefits are for, hey, if I&#8217;m signing on for a job interview at a retail store? Was it better to put my Filipino background, or Japanese, or mix? Or could I play my Black card?</p>
<p>These were things that I was starting to find out, and just trying to demystify what it meant to be these different backgrounds, and whether it was cool to be quote unquote &#8220;mixed.&#8221; There was a period where it was. But even if you were, you still identified with one particular identity. And that was your dominant one. And typically if you&#8217;re mixed with African American or Black, you identify with that. It&#8217;s better. You can segue into groups more. You have more of a support structure. But if you identify that kind of ambiguity, it just goes off into the abyss. You have to figure that on your own. Google search is not going to help you out.</p>
<p>Back to the academia, I first got into computer programming surprisingly, and did C+, Unix, Linux, Java, CSS, HTML, HTML 3.0. And that&#8217;s where I thought my digital calling was. And let&#8217;s be clear. I&#8217;m trying to figure this out. I don&#8217;t have mentors. I don&#8217;t even know what a mentor is. Nobody in my family knows, &#8220;Hey, this is digital arts.&#8221; So I&#8217;m kind of finding this out, and finding out that I really don&#8217;t want to be an engineer. I don&#8217;t want to write code.</p>
<p>And when I was at Berkeley, I found out through an instructor. And he turned me on to web development. And this is when I also met, I would consider them my mentors today. Ricardo Gomes and Steve Jones. And they really shaped and they provided that color of, &#8220;Hey, this is industrial design.&#8221; I can&#8217;t remember if it was specifically&#8230; I think it was Ricardo Gomes, but he wanted me to enter, what is this? A sneaker design competition. And I was like, &#8220;What is this? What do you mean? I don&#8217;t design sneakers. I have a pretty good portfolio that I built in up in high school. But what do you mean a competition for drawing?&#8221; It was just so foreign to me. And I&#8217;m just quiet islander boy, just trying to figure it out. I was always hesitant to speak up, because I was very self-conscious of my accent, not saying the right words, and articulating myself in a way that could reflect my thoughts. That was very hard. I knew it in different dialects. But in the English dialect, I could not think of some of the words. So that made me hesitant when I had these interactions.</p>
<p>So this is the beauty of going into art is that you could use other channels to really showcase how you think as an individual, no matter what linguistics barriers you have.</p>
<p>So I went into that competition. I was runner up, I didn&#8217;t win. But it was great to have somebody invest in you. And that&#8217;s when I also met Steve Jones as well. And he really provided that aperture mainly into graphic design and showing that, &#8220;Hey, there&#8217;s art schools out there. Here&#8217;s this thing called industrial design.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What is that? That&#8217;s kind of like an inventor, but wait. I could use a little bit of my programming background. I could work on different platforms, whether it&#8217;s digital, whether it&#8217;s an interface, human ergonomics. Whoa, this is kind of cool. I could get behind that.&#8221;</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s when I applied to CCAC, and then I got in. I pretty much didn&#8217;t make it to a lot of other art schools. But again, on this journey of trying to figure it out, trying to peel back the layers, and see what my calling was. Because honestly, going through this trip, I was lost half the time. It wasn&#8217;t like I had this predetermined track where it was like, &#8220;Yes, Ube Urban today, and customer user experience, and the digital platforms.&#8221; That&#8217;s what I was going to do as a kid. I didn&#8217;t know I wanted to become an inventor. Nobody knew what that was. Nobody even knew that it was a job in my family, let alone my network.</p>
<p>Going back into shifting into going to CCAC, that&#8217;s where I really started to flex my creative muscle, and started to really adopt this new culture. And adopting this new culture, you&#8217;ll start to uncover that it&#8217;s intersectional. It&#8217;s the fabric of who I am, because it&#8217;s the involvement. It&#8217;s how I interacted. It&#8217;s how I presented myself. It&#8217;s how I develop these methodologies. It was me starting to learn what I did and didn&#8217;t like within a culture that was very foreign to me. And trying to adopt the culture that essentially wasn&#8217;t designed for us was something that I was living and still living to this day, which is quite amazing.</p>
<p>So my aperture of the overall world started to just really open up. And I started to go into different art forms, learning about art history, all the different channels. From interior design, fashion, the creative writing arts, and what have you. My mind was blown.</p>
<p>And then I&#8217;m around eclectic amount of mindsets and diversity. From people around the world, from various economic levels. And it was just refreshing. I met a lot of great people that I never had experience meeting in my whole lifetime, until I went to college. So yeah, it was basically an eye-opener of, &#8220;Hey, there&#8217;s supportive people. There&#8217;s people that think the same way I do, but they&#8217;re from different backgrounds.&#8221; You&#8217;re getting to know me for me, and I don&#8217;t have to provide my professional sense of soul forward, or the person I want to put forward, and have that perceived value in order to gain acceptance.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like this was when I was starting to drop down my walls, lower my guard. Because I was pretty much on guard until my early twenties. And this is something that also I learned about myself, speeding up in to current day of some friction points.</p>
<p>If that one particular pain point is pressed in that way that I&#8217;ve experienced when I was a kid, boom, the guard goes up. And then I shut down. And when I look back into who I was, and tried to showcase and flourish into this more charismatic, and open person, and bringing your authentic self to the forefront, that wasn&#8217;t me. I was the introverted self for a very long time. And I still am a hybrid. I&#8217;m introverted, but I&#8217;m extroverted and I can turn it on. But I do need to recharge myself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I&#8217;ve heard in past interviews, that you&#8217;ve talked about this transition to the mainland as a culture shock. Which I think you definitely have outlined that this was a real shifting and changing of worlds. Not just because you&#8217;re breaking out from the island to the mainland. I think that&#8217;s one part of the narrative. But also expanding your own awareness of what you can do as a creative and as a designer.</p>
<p>And I think it&#8217;s also just really cool that part of that story is getting inspired by Black designers. Steve Jones that we&#8217;ve had on the show. Steve was one of my first guests back in 2013, 10 years ago. Jesus. Oh my God.</p>
<p>But I say all that to say that I think it&#8217;s really cool that through your education and even through getting inspired by these Black designers, that it helped to shape who you were at, I think this very important stage. I would say late teens, early twenties, going into college. That&#8217;s such a highly impressionable time in terms of the kind of work that you want to do, the kind of person that you want to become. I just think it&#8217;s really great how much that time has really shaped you.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yes, it has. And that timeline, we pretty much all cultivate it in so many different points of our lives. And that&#8217;s why for me personally, yes, that was a groundbreaking time. But even people that I influence and interface with today, you never know if that moment is going to be that pinnacle moment. Whether it&#8217;s their first job, or they are a senior within their field. But you never know when you&#8217;re going to have these meaningful experience that people are going to reflect on and be like, &#8220;Hey, I have this conversation with Ube. He pointed me in this direction. We kind of went back and forth, and I spun off and did my own thing.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t have to come back full circle. And this is why I really love to embrace these relationships. Whether they form into a new bond, or they pretty much spin off and go into their own trajectory. It&#8217;s just very interesting how we kind of influence the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now speaking of spinning off and going into your own trajectory, and this was a really interesting part that I learned about you coming into this. Tell me about Ube&#8217;s Icecream Shop. How did that come about? Tell me about all of that.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, sure. This was basically an answer to working into smaller consultancies and boutique agencies in San Francisco. During that time, it was you wanted to work at basically the two main spots, which was either Frog Design or IDEO. I could go down the list of other ones that were very hot during that design culture.</p>
<p>I went through a lot of different management styles. I was a pixel pusher at that time. So I was at that stage where I was just trying to get my leg in the door, get that professional experience. And also start really building these tools that I either learned at Berkeley, or at CCAC, or what have you, and bring that to the forefront.</p>
<p>Most of my interactions with management probably wasn&#8217;t the greatest. Never really saw eye to eye, or I just didn&#8217;t like other people being treated basically of where you sat in the ladder, myself included. Let&#8217;s be clear, you can pretty much feel if you&#8217;re not being respected as a person, let alone a professional. And that doesn&#8217;t feel good. You don&#8217;t go back from a long working day and be like, &#8220;Oh yes, I feel recharged.&#8221; A lot of these experiences kind of break you down and make you self-reflect. That&#8217;s what I could call it now. But during its time, was navigating to something that was better. So that was basically a rejection of how I wanted to treat people. If I had my own company, how would I want to embrace others? What would be my methodology? How would we interface with our clients? Do we want to flatten the org? Whatever that meant. That didn&#8217;t exist during its time. It was just like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m a true person. I&#8217;m a big grunge. I&#8217;m a really play into the boutique street life, and also showcase a little bit of my graffiti background.&#8221; Actually, a lot of it.</p>
<p>And Ube&#8217;s Icecream Shop pretty much comprised of omnichannel experiences or how we defined that today. It spun into doing graphic prints, to doing custom bicycles. That&#8217;s what the primary business was. And we did this for small, medium, large businesses. We did it for a lot of prolific clients as well. From Robin Williams, to Prince the artist, Mel Gibson. I mean, we&#8217;ve done so many different custom initiatives for a lot of A-listers, sports players as well.</p>
<p>But the long and short of it was if you went into our environment, our studio, it was there to just pretty much what you&#8217;re doing now, Maurice, is breaking down the walls. Be your authentic self, be who you want to be. Check your ego, check yourself, check your personified value at the door. Here, we&#8217;re going to have a different way of building our packages or ice cream. So when people came back returning customers, they would have this kind of lingo, this dialect that pulled us together, &#8220;Hey, I want to come to have a single scoop of your service.&#8221; That meant just pretty much the basic package. Or, &#8220;Hey Ube, I want the full experience. I want the banana split with the sprinkles on top.&#8221; &#8220;Okay, cool. I&#8217;m going to have to allocate more of my team to your initiative. This is really big. This is a high valued target for any particular client.&#8221;</p>
<p>But you started to have this overall internal culture and feeling of, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re creating something new.&#8221; But it&#8217;s so modular where I didn&#8217;t want to have control. But as the business started to flourish, as the visibility started to become a little bit more known, also tapping into a global market, you have to start growing up. And it&#8217;s kind of counterintuitive of the graffiti world.<br>
You do this amazing art. You don&#8217;t know how long it&#8217;s going to be on the walls, on bus, on whatever surface that you choose. You&#8217;re competing with either your friends, some competing artists, to really get your name out there, to put your art out there on a street level. But you never put your actual name to it.</p>
<p>It was always your graffiti name. It&#8217;s this personified value. &#8220;Yeah, if you knew me, you knew the art. You knew my name.&#8221; And vice versa for all my friends out there.</p>
<p>But when you start to have more of that public lens, I had to start making these decisions of should I represent the brand, the business, and sell it with my face on it? Or should I sell it for the brand of the name? I went down the route of really popularizing the brand through the name, through the face. And there&#8217;s positives and negatives about it that we can go into later. But that&#8217;s pretty much the beginnings and involvement of the ice cream shop.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I mean let&#8217;s get into it now. I mean, it sounds like you were really making a name for yourself as a creative in San Francisco. You&#8217;re an artist, you&#8217;re a painter. Look, I saw the videos of you on the track bikes zooming through San Francisco, which surprised me because I was like, &#8220;This is not a movie that I made before.&#8221; On a track bike, got chopsticks in here. I was like, &#8220;Who is this? This is not who I knew.&#8221; Talk more about that.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Basically, I was just doing whatever I wanted brand wise. I didn&#8217;t care about what my identity was on the forefront. I pretty much was a trendsetter within my own world. And being in San Francisco, everybody embraces that. You could be whoever you want to be. You could be whatever niche culture. Guess what? You&#8217;re going to have your group there. And if you want to cross pollinate your group and try to find somebody that&#8217;s completely opposite to you, that is readily available as well.</p>
<p>So you had this mixing pot of a lot of what I embraced and what I could relate to growing up. But it was just really pushing the behavior of my social interactions, and starting to really embrace and be proud of who I am and who I was meant to be at that given time, and forward.</p>
<p>I could call myself a entrepreneur or a creator. But it came down to, that&#8217;s where I started to take people under my wing. That&#8217;s when I started to glorify personalized mentorships, doing internship programs and what have you. Worked with schools in the Bay Area and whatnot.</p>
<p>I learned a lot of different elements of what I embrace today, which is something I would never look back and have that reasoning that, &#8220;Hey, I could be an evangelist in the space. People could actually look towards my guidance for doing better or exploring other areas.&#8221; That just wasn&#8217;t top of mind. It was more about, how can we run a successful business? How do we keep it grunge and small? And how do we keep it a boutique agency in the city? We&#8217;re trying to embrace and reflect the culture of San Francisco. We are proud of that. But also, I was proud of my heritage. So I had the long hair. I had my man bun. Yeah, I had a lot of chopsticks that match with all the different outfits and whatnot. I wore a lot of purple, a lot of lavender, because Ube is a purple yam, and my family is infatuated with purple. So if you see that in a branding or anything going forward, it goes down to basically the crux of what I&#8217;m based off of is this purple identity.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where I started to also flourish my management styles and start to explore what areas of expertise that we wanted to define ourselves by. And long and short of it, I just wanted to not want a pigeonhole.</p>
<p>So you&#8217;ll start to see this over and over again. You&#8217;ll start to see the pattern of me not wanting to be defined as one particular thing. And this is both in my personal landscape and professional world. I don&#8217;t want to be known as one, two, three. Or, &#8220;Hey, he&#8217;s this. Hey, he&#8217;s that.&#8221; I know we have to have these nomenclatures in order to define who we are within different spaces. But I essentially just wanted to put the brand of the people first. Myself first, my team, and really embrace that.</p>
<p>And this was before we would showcase to everybody in our narratives or in our proposals, &#8220;Hey, this is the team. Here&#8217;s all the stories. Here are all the people you&#8217;re working with.&#8221; We&#8217;re doing that. And we didn&#8217;t know if it was popular or not. We just thought, &#8220;Hey, it would be great to just really showcase cool individuals.&#8221; We have different working styles. We are essentially doing our own things. This is my own thing, but it&#8217;s becoming popular. And my friends would pretty much go towards, &#8220;Hey, Ube&#8217;s doing something big. I want to get on that.&#8221; And I would have friends that would be videographers, or other graphic designers, or even photographers.</p>
<p>And this also helped put that brand out there. And then you had the Japanese market and people from around the world really chomp out the bit with what&#8217;s going on in San Francisco. Because you&#8217;re doing something anywhere trend setting in the bay, the bay proper. If you&#8217;re doing it in that seven grid of San Francisco, you&#8217;re doing something well, whether you know it at that given time or you self-reflect.</p>
<p>At the time, I didn&#8217;t know I was doing something that big. I mean yes, the A-listers came in. But when you&#8217;re doing a one-off client project, they don&#8217;t really have that sustainability as opposed to doing a large contract with a corporate gig or something.</p>
<p>But the long and short of it is we&#8217;re just essentially doing what we loved. We&#8217;re riding track bikes everywhere. Track bikes, FYI, do not have brakes. So basically, you&#8217;re carving a snowboard using your back tire to slow down, going down the hills of San Francisco. Or climbing them. Let&#8217;s just say my legs were double the size they are today. And they&#8217;re fueled by tacos, and burritos, and horchata. That&#8217;s all we ate all the time.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful grunge time before a lot of the gentrification happened within the rest of the parts of the neighborhood and what have you. The city that it is today was way different from the early 2000s. I would say the shift happened in about 2014. And that would be my catapult out of the Bay Area into a newer metropolitan city.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So is that what precipitated your move from San Francisco here to Atlanta?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
It is. And I also met my wife in the Bay, which was quite amazing. This added to just that overall mindset of, &#8220;Okay, what is the new pastures going to be?&#8221; And yes, being in a lucrative industry and having your name out there, it was great. But you have to hustle hard. And let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s hard to make good money, and live in the Bay Area, and have all the overhead.</p>
<p>So it just got to a point where I was at a pinnacle point of my career of, &#8220;What do I want to do next? Do I want to grow the company? Do I want to sell it? Do I want to get back into maybe leadership for another company? Do I want to try corporate identity?&#8221; Because I rejected it. And everybody around me, especially being in San Francisco, you didn&#8217;t really support larger corporations. You always try to keep things more small and intimate. And a lot of the larger firms like the IDEOs and the Frogs, they&#8217;re basically bought from larger parent companies now. And just the overall culture and what it meant as a designer, it&#8217;s just very different.</p>
<p>And then you have these new industries and titles of UX/UI, UX researchers, copywriters. And this digital existence pretty much shaping what people do as a craft. Being an artist, a designer. This is something that&#8217;s outside of that digital field. This is like using your hands. This is like using the city as your landscape. This is like tinkering to come up with these amazing ideas.</p>
<p>And I feel like there&#8217;s just a lost art and direction for that. People develop their skills, which is great in the tech world. But in order to push that to a different barrier, you have to really leverage those meaningful connections. Whether it&#8217;s through your relationships, or even you as a core artist, what that meant. How do you bring it back to that space?</p>
<p>And this is something that it&#8217;s an infinite circle. How do I re-embrace why I got into this industry? Like we talked about before, Maurice, we&#8217;re just so jaded. We know what&#8217;s happening behind a curtain. We&#8217;ve been around this space for more than 15 years. Things are changing. But a lot of the crux of it, guess what? Still the same. You can change the landscape, you can change the platform, methodologies. They still stand. The tools change. Whatever, learn a new tool. But people aren&#8217;t paying for you to be basically a pixel pusher. They&#8217;re paying for you to look beyond what is in this occupation.</p>
<p>How can you be a proven leader? How do you know about all these different aspects and verticals of the business? That&#8217;s what they want. And if they can get more titles and more hats out of you, guess what? That&#8217;s their benefit. And is it your benefit? Is that what you want to do? I don&#8217;t know. It depends. It depends on the grass is greener.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been times where I want to wear one or two hats. And there&#8217;s other times where I want to wear eight, and I&#8217;ll do it at a cost. So it all depends on where you&#8217;re at that given time within your career, life, and what have you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, there&#8217;s been a shift now I&#8217;d say probably over the past, I think 10+ years now of design moving not out of visual. I mean, I think visual of course is still a big part of it, because we all have eyes. But moving into design, and strategy, and business. How it all works together, particularly when you see the rise of SaaS companies or the product based companies. It&#8217;s not so much about, &#8220;How can I express myself as a designer, as a creative?&#8221; It&#8217;s about, how can I use my skills for the product? It feels like that&#8217;s what the push has gone into.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yeah. And I mean, let&#8217;s be clear. The compensation is ridiculous.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yes. I would love to just really explore my craft as an artist, as a model maker, as an industrial designer. But you compare that compensation to what you do within strategy, or even the tech world. Let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s a cool four times more. And it&#8217;s hard not to notice that. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;How do I get into that world?&#8221;</p>
<p>Especially if you&#8217;re, I wouldn&#8217;t say a starving artist. But let&#8217;s just say your net worth, keeping that up. You&#8217;re hustling. You&#8217;re working like a dog. And then you can sit back and work in a corporate job, write the funding, have that apply and fulfill your lifestyle. Give you accessibility of things that were unattainable. Maybe going back to my family and my basis. The numbers that I see, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;That&#8217;s unheard of.&#8221; Nobody&#8217;s making that kind of money in my family. I don&#8217;t care who you are. We don&#8217;t come from that type of background. Plus guess what? Again, it wasn&#8217;t important.</p>
<p>So kind of shifting that mindset where you bring up this as well, Maurice, which is something that I self-reflect of, &#8220;This is not really the Ube that I know.&#8221; For me personally, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, that nicks a little bit out of my thick exterior.&#8221; But at the same time I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, this is interesting on my new platform platform on what I spun off into.&#8221; You&#8217;re seeing me more in the suits and ties in corporate identity, but that wasn&#8217;t my basis. I wasn&#8217;t like that all the time. And guess what? If I had the option, I always want to be that authentic self of what I was in the bay. Because I learned so much.</p>
<p>I learned so much about myself, interacted with people, what it meant to burn bridges, the highs and lows of having your own company, taking risks. It got pretty deep. And that&#8217;s why I never capture my journey as puppy dogs and ice cream. It was rough. And to be honest, it&#8217;s still rough till this day. That journey, I would say it&#8217;s easier, but it&#8217;s different. And the things that I have to think about as an adult and somebody that&#8217;s very seasoned in my career, it&#8217;s just a different landscape of what&#8217;s important. The visibility, things that are also currency to other people. Let&#8217;s just say everything that my makeup is based off of isn&#8217;t really currency within corporate space, which is very interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So what do you do to try and maintain your authentic self?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
It kind of jostles me a little bit. Like, &#8220;Whoa, wow.&#8221; Yeah, I have my predefined journey, but not a lot of people turn to tables that often of, &#8220;Hey Ube, I want to get to know you.&#8221; It&#8217;s more of, &#8220;I want to get to know you, but there&#8217;s some type of value, and we need some trade-offs going forward in order to cultivate this relationship.&#8221;</p>
<p>And this is where it becomes a little complicated because I&#8217;m invested in growing people. But it doesn&#8217;t have to go full circle. But the relationships beyond corporate identity, it&#8217;s always tit for tat. What are you going to do for me? You know? You got to play that bureaucratic landscape of, &#8220;Okay, you do this for me, I&#8217;ll do that. And from there we&#8217;ll grow off each other, and eventually burn bridges and shape shift, and go through all the reorgs, and what have you.&#8221; And essentially you&#8217;re just looking out for the best interests of yourself. So if you go against that, but you&#8217;re living and navigating that landscape, it&#8217;s interesting. And it&#8217;s a social experiment that will never get old.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So let&#8217;s take work out of that. And let&#8217;s take also, I think doing this for other people&#8217;s benefit. How do you try to maintain your authentic self to yourself?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
This is probably a difficult part of the navigation. Because being your authentic self, especially if I&#8217;m in an environment that is not receptive to that. But it&#8217;s definitely throttled. Yes, I&#8217;m personable. Yeah, I&#8217;m authentic. Am I my authentic self? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;ve had these conversations in the past, Maurice. When you have even an uptick of 5%, 10% of bringing your authentic self in who you are, we know what comes from that. I knew my background wasn&#8217;t the best. I knew that it wasn&#8217;t picture perfect. But there are a lot of things that I embrace and still do to this day.</p>
<p>It gets to a point where, how do I really have acceptance? How do I mitigate stereotypes when I&#8217;m interacting with people, and how do I put that forward as well? I want people to see past what you see me on the forefront. If you see the suit, you see the armor, you see whatever monetary objects that are on me. Whatever. But when it comes down to it, that&#8217;s not the person that I am upholding. It&#8217;s my armor, and I&#8217;m very particular about it. But I&#8217;m doing it just for myself and myself only. It&#8217;s not to gain acceptance. It&#8217;s not for other people to gain any type of, how do I say this? Acceptance within their environment. It&#8217;s just hey, how do I navigate my sense of self being myself? But how do I also navigate being myself and going along with the current? How do I blend in? Because I have a hard time within society to blend in. At least the physical forefront would be just how I dress, or even my hair, or even being the ambiguity of ethnicity. People are just very curious human beings. They want to know, and a lot of people cannot bite their tongue.</p>
<p>So if I&#8217;m getting a cup of coffee, they&#8217;re going to be like, &#8220;Oh wow. Hey, cool hair.&#8221; Or I&#8217;ll get some sly come in, &#8220;Hey, have you seen that cartoon character?&#8221; And this is all interactions that you honestly don&#8217;t have time for, but they just come to you? &#8220;How long does it take? How long does it take to get ready in the morning?&#8221; And these are basically party tricks. Yeah, they&#8217;re kind of cool.</p>
<p>But this is what people want to know about me. And it&#8217;s very unfortunate because I&#8217;m a lot more than my personified value. Even just, &#8220;Hey, ask me about what I want to do.&#8221; A lot of people don&#8217;t ask me what I do as a professional. You&#8217;re probably the first person in a while that&#8217;s asked me, &#8220;Hey Ube, what do you do as a professional? What do you do?&#8221; As opposed to having that talk track that I have with the clients, but I feel like a puppet sometimes when I go through that vernacular. I have my bullet points. I know what pretty much makes people&#8217;s eyebrows rise and interest. And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh cool. Awesome.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think you&#8217;ve used some very interesting language here. I don&#8217;t know, this is not turned into a therapy session. I promise. I notice this tension between who you are when you&#8217;re just you, just yourself. Nobody else is around. And the Ube Urban that is presented to the world. You mentioned your dress and your hair as armor. And even when I asked about the authentic self, I was like, &#8220;Take work out of it. Take other people out of it.&#8221; And you brought them right back in.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I noticed that kind of tension between you who are, and that you have to be in order to move forward in this hellscape capitalist society, I guess. Would you say that&#8217;s accurate?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yes, it is. It&#8217;s very accurate. And this basically aligns with my identity both professionally. And when to turn it on, when to turn it off. And there&#8217;s a lot of gray area where it&#8217;s just confusing, or a lot of times you&#8217;re just so saturated to be this person that you aren&#8217;t. But you have to play these cards so frequently when you do shapeshift, or you&#8217;re around different friends, or around different networks. You kind of go into this behavior of, &#8220;Okay, cool. Let me just use these cards real quick.&#8221; It&#8217;s productized, it&#8217;s easy, and it works.</p>
<p>And then when you use that in front of the wrong audience, you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Wait, hold on. What happened?&#8221; So you start to become a little automated yourself. And I&#8217;m not going to lie, it&#8217;s happened to me and it still happens to me. I have my best friends, they have to pull me out of it. They have to check me. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Hey Ube, I really don&#8217;t care about what your last initiative was. I don&#8217;t care how much you sold that work for. I don&#8217;t care what you bought. Can you stop talking about that?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh my God, I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221; And then you basically have to pull your head out of your and just be like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m trying to work on being myself.&#8221; But at the same time, like you&#8217;re saying, you have these tensions. You have these friction points where you&#8217;re playing different personified values, and then you get caught up into being that person.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m an executive leader, I can&#8217;t be the authentic self. That&#8217;s not the currency. But I could be my authentic self around my best friends because that&#8217;s it. But again, you&#8217;re constantly playing different cards. And if you played the wrong card in a different landscape or environment, you might get checked on it. And I typically do with people that are still authentic, and still themselves, and coming back as the grownup Ube, and interfacing with these folks that still embrace that. Yeah. You can definitely guarantee that there there&#8217;s a ton of tension drawing between the lines of bringing full authenticity in your makeup forward, and having that valued. But if it isn&#8217;t valued, those talking points, they just start to be placed in your back pocket. You start to not use them as often. You start to just use basic talk tracks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
May I offer some advice?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yes, absolutely. All the time. Always welcome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think if there&#8217;s any place in this country outside of perhaps San Francisco where you can lean into the various Venn diagram intersections of your identity and use that to your advantage, it&#8217;s here. I mean yes, it&#8217;s the south. I get that it&#8217;s Atlanta. It&#8217;s Georgia I should say. Georgia and Atlanta are two different things. But I feel like if there&#8217;s any place you can make that happen, it would be here outside of San Francisco. Perhaps New York too. I don&#8217;t know. And this is not to say, &#8220;Pick up and move,&#8221; or whatever.</p>
<p>But I would like to see the Ube that leans more into those spots that it sounds like make other people uncomfortable, especially as you&#8217;ve described it. And see how far that gets you. Because I think if anything, with personal branding now, so much is about identity and about the different spaces that you occupy. Whether you are queer, whether you&#8217;re disabled, different race, etc. You can lean into those and find community, and find like-minded people, and opportunities, and things of that nature.</p>
<p>Given where you&#8217;re at now, you are currently free from corporate obligation, which is a fun way of saying you don&#8217;t have a job right now. But given that you&#8217;re outside of that space now, where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing? What do you want the next chapter of your story to be?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s something that I am asking myself during this duration as well. There&#8217;s always topics of shifting into being a mentor, a coach, a leader, an advocate within the space. But that would mean going back into the best and worst practices of my own brand. Let&#8217;s just say I don&#8217;t have the best work ethic when it comes to representing myself, so I need to sometimes steer clear of that.</p>
<p>But from my understanding, I&#8217;m trying to cultivate consistencies in my life. And to be honest, it&#8217;s really hard to answer that question because work. I know it sounds like it&#8217;s priority based on my interactions. Nut on my actual list, it&#8217;s at the bottom of the list. So it&#8217;s hard for me to devote that much time and energy of what the forecasts are. If you asked me a couple moons ago, I&#8217;d be like, &#8220;This is where I want to be in three years. I want to climb this ladder, I want this visibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>But now I&#8217;ve pretty much had my appetite fulfilled in so many different areas, that question of, &#8220;What do you want to do next?&#8221; It becomes much more difficult to process. It&#8217;s almost like grass is greener. What am I revisiting that I&#8217;ve already done to fulfill that void, and how sustainable is that void?</p>
<p>I could go corporate identity, I could do agencies, I could have my own brand. But what are the trade-offs, and do they coincide where my life is now? There&#8217;s a lot of things that come into play rather than, what is the ideal job? &#8220;If you could have any job, what would be your perfect job? It&#8217;s like a behavioral question that you would get from human resources or something.</p>
<p>So coming into that, I still struggle with creating that identity and that appetite for what is to come. To be honest, I&#8217;m seeing what&#8217;s in the market. Because as you know, there&#8217;s new titles, there&#8217;s new formations. And who these new practitioners are and can be, and which ones are the same. Because I&#8217;ve had over 20 different titles, but I do the same type of work. So that&#8217;s also something that&#8217;s very interesting to me as a professional as well. But I know I didn&#8217;t answer your question, Maurice. That&#8217;s all I got as of now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was going to say if you haven&#8217;t thought of what that is because of the time that you&#8217;re at now, give it some thought. Give it some thought. Don&#8217;t think that you have to rush right into slotting into whatever the next position is that you know you could get because of the work that you&#8217;ve done. Really take some time. And sit down with yourself, do the introspection, do the work, and think about where it is you can really be your most optimal self without the armor, without the expectations of other people. Really take some time and think about that.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Onto the next, and searching under different rocks and crevices to hopefully find more talented people to inspire myself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yeah. You&#8217;re not going to find authentic information. But you can get in touch with me either through my website, which would be www.ubeurban.com, basically first and last name. I&#8217;m pretty receptive on all my social channels, but you could also reach out on LinkedIn. Just type in first and last name again, Ube Urban. And drop me a call. Drop me a message if you want to grab some time on my calendar and peel back the layers of the navigation and Ube Urban himself.</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s very difficult to provide that identity forward. Yes, I have that professional and corporate makeup. But you need to have discussions. You need to have the conversation in order to actually understand where my journey is and where it&#8217;s heading.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And hopefully when people listen to this interview, that&#8217;s what they&#8217;ll start to get.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yes. Yes. Thanks again Maurice, for your time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Ube, I just want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I sort of had an idea of where I thought this conversation might go. And certainly as I did my research and I was like, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know all this stuff about Ube,&#8221; and I&#8217;ve met him, and we&#8217;ve talked on panels and stuff. But I will be interested to see what your next move is after you&#8217;ve really like I said&#8230; And this is advising, take it or leave it. But if you take the time to really think about what you want that next move to be like Ube without the armor, etc., I&#8217;d be really interested to see where you go in the future with that.</p>
<p>Because you and I, I would say we&#8217;re probably roughly right around the same age. We&#8217;ve reached this point in our career where we&#8217;ve paid our dues. We&#8217;ve paid our dues, we know our shit. And we&#8217;re at the point where we can start to really carve our own identity and make the path forward with doing what we want to do, and not so much about what the corporate sphere might have in space. Whether that&#8217;s entrepreneurship or what have you. But I feel like the more you lean into that, lean into those uncomfortable parts. I think that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll really start to really grow and shine more. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yes. Yes. Thank you. Thanks, Maurice. Really appreciate it.</p>

<p>If you have aspirations of being an agency owner one day, then you might get some great insight from this week&#8217;s guest, Sean DallasKidd. Sean is the co-founder and chief creative officer of DemonstratexDDW, and he uses his decades of experience to help brands define their story and communicate with their audiences.</p>
<p>Sean told me more about his new role, sharing what it looks like to run an agency from the C-suite and help it stand out from the competition. We also delved into Sean&#8217;s background, where he spoke about attending SCAD, getting into the publishing world, and how his shift to agencies helped prepare him for his current leadership responsibilities. Getting comfortable with being uncomfortable has been the secret to Sean&#8217;s success, and it&#8217;s definitely paid off! (Big thanks to <a href="/george-mccalman/" data-wpel-link="internal">George McCalman</a> for the introduction!)</p>

All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Hello, my name is Sean DallasKidd. I&#8217;m partner, chief creative officer at DemonstratexDDW. I would say what I do is make brands culturally relevant, and that takes place from brand development, naming, brand architecture systems over to go-to-market strategies. So really trying to create programs and experiences that resonate within culture, drive talkability with media and can be shared digitally and socially.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How are things going so far this year for you?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
This is a very interesting year. We&#8217;ve got lots of tensions in the US, globally, and so I think this year has been another year of quick adaption to socioeconomic sort of movement that&#8217;s happening around lots of new technologies that are turning on and a lot of disruption. So it&#8217;s a very interesting year to roll up your sleeves, learn a little bit more, and I&#8217;d say get creative.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything major that you really want to accomplish this year?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s see. This year, I think the main goals for me probably start with AI literacy from a sort of personal and business growth perspective, also want to take care of my people. I think as we&#8217;ve kind of seen on channels like LinkedIn, being able to create a business that can sustain over time, that puts its employees and its culture first, that&#8217;s one of my sort of big goals. And then obviously, working with brand partners that want to do very interesting, fun, provocative work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Any sort of personal goals though for this year?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Personal goals, to see more of the world. I&#8217;ve been historically a big traveler and the other thing that I love is food. So the over the course of the pandemic, have definitely been leaning more into traveling via my mouth and stomach. And so, this year I would like to actually get out into the world and see what&#8217;s happening in different countries and regions in the US.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk more about DemonstratexDDW. As you mentioned, you&#8217;re president and chief creative officer there, pretty recently as of last year, right?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Correct, correct, correct. What&#8217;s really interesting with DemonstratexDDW is last year we announced the acquisition of Deutsch Design Works, DDW, which is a 27-year-old branding agency that was based in Sausalito. And so, what we did was acquire the agency for the brand building capabilities that they had, and we thought it was a great fit because Demonstrate focuses on go-to-market strategies and campaigns and programs, and so this gave us the opportunity to not only bring brands to life and market, but really start with the fundamentals, which you often find missing when you&#8217;re working with brands. So what are some of the cultural artifacts built into the brand DNA, the purpose, how do you find actions, and so we felt as though being able to help set the bar and the tone at the upfront and being able to pull that into a market will do nothing but good things for our brand partners that we work with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does a typical day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Ooh, let&#8217;s see. Phigital, it&#8217;s physical and digital. So Zoom meetings, hybrid meetings, writing some design, and then the most fun part of being a business owner is Excel spreadsheets of things. That&#8217;s one of the sort of growth spaces when you become more of an executive creative person is getting right with the Google Sheets.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, was it a big shift moving from partner to president once this acquisition happened?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
I would say it was different, but it&#8217;s been an accumulation of experiences over time. I think that my history starting in publishing, moving into earned media, moving into advertising has become a brick by brick process. The transition didn&#8217;t or hasn&#8217;t to date been as dramatic of a shift because I have a network to help support and educate me on components and parts I might not be as familiar with on day one. So I would say the transition wasn&#8217;t crazy, not to say it&#8217;s not crazy. You get what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I would imagine whenever there&#8217;s a acquisition or things like that, you&#8217;re bringing more people in, of course, you&#8217;re merging company cultures, so there&#8217;s always going to be, I think, some clashing or things just as that acquisition tries to reach equilibrium.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Exactly. You always have different ways and means, ways of working, different kinds of processes, lead times, you have different billing cycles, all sorts of stuff that you have to work out. I would say the best case scenario in any merger is a mullet. It&#8217;s business in the front and a rock show in the back because you&#8217;re trying to figure out how to get one set of systems to work with another without clashing in any sort of crazy way. But luckily for us, we&#8217;ve been able to make it through that stage and I think we&#8217;re starting to get into stride right now which is great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now you mentioned that part of your typical day still has some design in it. Are you still available to get hands on working with clients and with campaigns?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Yes, yes. I feel as though I&#8217;ve always had, you would say, a problem with people who guard themselves off in the ivory tower, right? And so, one of the things I always tell our employees is that you want to have lived experience before you can recommend a strategy to someone, and in order to stay current, you have to do. So even if a design direction that I might develop doesn&#8217;t get picked, it helps me stay current on tools, timelines, amount of resources, different design trends so that when I&#8217;m talking to brand partners, I&#8217;m using language and referencing things that are happening now and not when I did it back in the day, 5, 10, 15 years ago.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I had an agency owner on here a few years back, I&#8217;m not going to call out who it was, but for folks who listen to the show, they&#8217;ll probably remember when this happened, but this person was mentioning that they have an agency and was talking about how they were the only Black agency owner that they knew and that. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know about any other Black agency owners.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s not true. I&#8217;m pretty sure there&#8217;s others out there because I&#8217;ve had them on the show.&#8221; But have you noticed during your career in advertising many other Black agency owners?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve definitely kept an eye out on it, but I will say it&#8217;s hard when your head&#8217;s down managing the work and the business to take the time to do the proper recon and outreach to folks. It&#8217;s a bit of a balancing of time and energy, but I definitely have seen the spark and the growth in that space. I know a couple of folks myself that have some small studios and then there&#8217;s some folks that I&#8217;ll look out to and see what they&#8217;re doing in the New York area that are really tearing it up which is great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, they&#8217;re out there. It&#8217;s certainly like you said, they&#8217;re at all sizes. Whether it&#8217;s small studios, big agencies, et cetera, we&#8217;re out there, but it&#8217;s about visibility as well too.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Yeah, I would say it&#8217;s visibility, and then there is, I would say, the system of agency and connection. And so, I think that&#8230; What&#8217;s a good way to phrase it? The hurdles for growing an agency to the point to where you get visibility is tricky when you&#8217;re not a part of the club to start. I could be a great designer, but do I have the connections to be considered or backing to be considered for some of these medium size, large term clients is a different story, right?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a procurement process as you start to grow your agency and payment terms that shift, and do you have the financial backing and resources or credit to be able to invest that manpower into going through one of those processes for the chance to win the business, and then can you float the business in a way that can deal with payment terms of a larger client on a bigger scale, right? You might move from payment terms of I&#8217;ll do a project and things get paid out 15, 30 days, 40 days to 90 days to 180 days as you get bigger and bigger clients, and so you see there&#8217;s different hurdles in order to be able to even get a bite at the apple that you have. I think that&#8217;s one of the tensions that you face as a Black agency owner historically which is why I think that&#8217;s one of the reasons why you have a lot less of them with that level of visibility.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s clients out there that are paying net 180?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Yes, there are. There was, forgot what the brand was and I won&#8217;t even mention it, but it was a CPG brand, consumer packaged good brand that got called out on Adweek and in the industry because I think they wanted their payment terms to be a year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, come on. A year?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
A year. And so, when you talk about diversity, equity, inclusivity, you can have a very talented agency, just call it a graphic design branding agency, and you have a staff of five to seven people, you&#8217;re doing really good work, and normally you&#8217;re getting paid in 30 day terms. Now that bigger client might be like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll want to work with you,&#8221; but then they give you a term payment of, well, instead of you getting paid a month later, you&#8217;re going to get paid six months later. How&#8217;s that diversity and equity model going at scale at that point with these small shops? And so, those become some of the bigger systemic issues, I would say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, you&#8217;re right, the balancing act of making sure that your clients and your cash flow is terrorist or at least coming in at a point where it appears to be consistent cash flow, especially when you&#8217;re paying employees, that&#8217;s tough. But net 365, that&#8217;s wild. Wow.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s [inaudible 00:15:31].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you think makes DemonstratexDDW stand out from the competition?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
I would say the way in which we stand out from the competition is we take a culture-forward lens with the work that we do. What we really try to do is drive this term we call talkability amongst target audiences that we&#8217;re looking to drive brand awareness, consideration, or conversion with. We also focus on brand or business objectives, number one. We start there, and as an integrated agency, we do, like I said, brand, naming brand architecture, packaging, but we also do integrated communication. So that&#8217;s paid media, earned media, social, digital content strategy, traditional above the line advertising. And so, what we look at are all the different levers of communication to drive those business objectives and then based off the audiences that they&#8217;re trying to engage with, what&#8217;s true to the brand, and timeliness as well as budget, what&#8217;s the right mix to help drive that messaging home to help spark conversation overall.</p>
<p>That really stems from, again, that background that I&#8217;ve had of being in earned media, being in traditional advertising and being in publishing, and at each step always seeing that for some of these integrated programs or brand initiatives, the PR team is not in step with what the advertising is doing and the advertising team isn&#8217;t in step with what the PR team is doing. As we look at this crazy new communications landscape, it&#8217;s kind of like it&#8217;s better to look at it holistically and then go based off these sets of truths, what is our best route into the market, looking at all the different components and parts we have access to across paid, earned, shared, and owned channels.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, not to give away any trade secrets or anything that you&#8217;ve got cooking at DemonstratexDDW, but what do you think are some of the biggest opportunities in the creative industry right now?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Well, for me, I definitely would say AI is the biggest opportunity. I know people are frightened about it, ChatGPT and everything else that&#8217;s happening, but I feel as though with any new technology there&#8217;s definitely going to be category leaders, new roles that come into the market, and so becoming literate in what AI is and can offer and how you can work with it is the biggest opportunity. Actually, in my mind, Web3 is AI because if you think about being able to become an expert prompter, a creative prompt strategist to work with an AI machine so that it can find information that can then be fact checked to create more nuanced, quickly adaptable copy or design territories for you to explore, I think that&#8217;s a really interesting job opportunity. There&#8217;s some cultural anthropology that you can mix in with it.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a lot there because it helps you tie in not only sort of brand DNA, but it helps pull in to design trends that could be pulled live or recalibrated and personalized for specific audiences. I think it could be a very compelling tool, but at the same time, the literacy is important because you got to know what the trade off is, right? I think we all ran into social as consumers of it, not realizing that the trade off was us and privacy and our data. And so, everyone is excited to use things like ChatGPT right now, but one of the things for me is what&#8217;s the terms and conditions? Are they going to get a piece of it?</p>
<p>You go and say, &#8220;Oh, great, I&#8217;m going do a Super Bowl ad using ChatGPT.&#8221; Will they have some sort of way on the backend to identify that this copy or this concept came from that, and then they want points? So I think we need to really understand what the technology can do and also who&#8217;s making the technology because whoever&#8217;s making the technology is creating a certain lens on where the technology starts to look for information.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now we&#8217;re recording this the Friday before the Super Bowl, and I bet you there&#8217;s going to be a Super Bowl ad that has some kind of ChatGPT, I don&#8217;t know, punchline or something in it. I feel like it&#8217;s got to be in there somewhere.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Oh yeah, yeah. I would definitely say. There are agencies that are losing sleep right now because three weeks ago everyone was hot to trot with ChatGPT and Ryan Reynolds did a ChatGPT ad, and everything they&#8217;ve been working on in the last year just got thrown out the window and they&#8217;re going to do something so that they&#8217;re timely and can make a splash of some kind.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I mean, you know what we won&#8217;t see during the Super Bowl? Crypto ads. I remember those from last year, and boy, have the times changed.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny. To your earlier question of staying in the work, the reason why you have to stay in the work is because you don&#8217;t want to give bad strategic advice to a brand partner. The easy trap for someone my age that got into social at the MySpace and early iteration of it and kind of settled, gave up on Facebook, does Instagram primarily to not stay current, right, to not check out TikTok and BeReal, and some of these sort of crypto based social channels and some of these niche social channels, you fall into the trap of recommending old and then you become irrelevant, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
And so, agency is all around the fight for relevancy, and I think the separator for us is knowing the nuance between relevancy for demo that everyone typically goes after 18 and 34 and nuance around the psychographic drivers and different folks because share of wallet goes from anywhere from a 10-year-old up to octatarian. People have needs, and the nuance comes from understanding what&#8217;s going to be that right audience that you need to tap into. So you have to stay current.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, absolutely. Now we&#8217;ll get more into your approach and your work a little bit later, but for now, let&#8217;s get into your background. You&#8217;re in San Francisco now, but you&#8217;re originally from D.C., is that right?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Correct. Southeast D.C.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me about growing up there.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s say the D.C. today is not the D.C. of the years I grew up. I grew up in &#8217;80s in Reaganomic D.C. It was definitely a lot rougher around the edges in Southeast where I was. But I would say one of the things that always kept me curious and creative, I always loved to draw as a kid and since, and I was also a latchkey kid, so I chose to take advantage of latch keydom, if that&#8217;s a word, to take advantage of all the free museums and zoos and public transportation you had as a minor. I&#8217;d spend my summers going down to the National Mall, going over to the Smithsonian or Museum of Art, Portraiture Gallery, all that kind of stuff, and so that&#8217;s really what sparked and maintained my interest in creativity.</p>
<p>When I went to high school, I was lucky enough to get into an architecture program. So I actually started doing that in 9th, 10th grade, actually drawing plans and really had a great teacher. His name was Mr. Fotos. He was think of angry Santa Claus with a Greek accent. He taught us everything and was just an amazing teacher, and that allowed me to go to SCAD, Savannah College of Art and Design for architecture actually. I think I started on the sophomore year as a freshman just because of my portfolio and what I learned, and then got into graphic design and illustration along the way.</p>
<p>But the lesson he taught me, and I guess this has always been ingrained in me, he said, &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to be a great architect, you need to be able to design from the building down to the spoon.&#8221; And so, that was one of those sorts of thinking of where it&#8217;s not just about the whole, the big idea. It&#8217;s down to the details and the nuance, right? And so, that&#8217;s just been a philosophy that I&#8217;ve carried with me which helps you dig a little bit deeper to kind of understand how people move through spaces, or how people engage with an experience or a design, or how a message needs to be flexible to be able to sit in an internal communications program and be explained so that your workforce is on board, and how it can help inspire creative outputs out in the real world, whether it&#8217;s on the side of a bus or some sort of 4D, 3D billboard, or if it&#8217;s an augmented reality experience. So really being able to be transmedia and understanding does this thing have scale and flexibility.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What made you choose SCAD?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Well, the city, downtown Savannah is beautiful. It&#8217;s hot in the summer, but I would say I loved the architecture there. The teachers are cool, the programs are really interesting, and for me, as you look at the, I would say the standard East Coast go-to design schools, the Pratts, the RISDs there was less&#8230; Well, I&#8217;ll just say, it was a less sense of entitlement and bourgeoisie in Savannah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
I felt like I could actually learn things and experiment versus do things the way the teacher did them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Gotcha.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
I kind of saw a bit of that trap as I was looking at some of the different schools of&#8230; I think for anyone that&#8217;s taking a life drawing class or something like that, you definitely have those teachers that are like, &#8220;This is the way to do it,&#8221; and it happens to be the way that they do it. And so, I definitely wanted a place where it seemed like I could be more collaborative with different departments as well, and so SCAD just really stood out in that way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Gotcha. I gotcha. Yeah, you were in college, I think we were in college right around the same time. You started in like the late &#8217;90s, like &#8217;99?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Yep, yep, yep.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Graduated in &#8217;03?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Yep. [inaudible 00:27:33].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yep. Same here. Same here. Tell me what you remember from that time.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Ooh. Well, when you say that, the first thing that comes to my mind was 9/11, just because I remember that moment very specifically. I was an RA at SCAD and woke up to one of the towers falling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
That was just a trip of a day, and the ripple effects of that are felt today. This is why we take our shoes off at airports, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
So 20-something years later. But beyond that, I would say some of the things that really were interesting to me at the time was the evolution in music. I remember there&#8217;s a funny moment when I was walking around River Street or that sort of downtown area in Savannah, and I saw a bus outside for this band called OutKast, and I went, &#8220;I wonder what they&#8217;re all about.&#8221; Little did I know that the OutKast was coming to us all, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
It&#8217;s the same sort of time when the Gorillaz made their first album which is just a mix of every kind of genre possible with layered animation for this sort of virtual band, and they&#8217;re still making amazing music now. And so, it was just a really, I think, funky time because it was this age, similar to now, of transition, right? So when you&#8217;re a designer, a couple years prior, everyone was using hand tools to do typography and all that sort of stuff, and we were there at that moment when it was like, &#8220;Okay, so we&#8217;re getting into Pork Express and we&#8217;re doing Adobe,&#8221; and you&#8217;re learning these new programs. Now in hindsight, you know those teachers barely knew those programs too because it was so new.</p>
<p>And so, you&#8217;re getting into the age of digital publishing in the middle of this sort of like what&#8217;s happening in the world because everything, America&#8217;s the safe space and now this thing happened, and everyone&#8217;s unified for six months. It was just a wild time. Then you&#8217;ve got this technological boom happening, and then you get sped out into this world where a couple years later, an iPhone pops out. It&#8217;s a very reminiscent, minus the pandemic part, what&#8217;s happening today. It was just chaos.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, you really had to be around during that time to realize the gargantuan amount of technological advancements that have happened from 2000 to now. I mean, you talk about iPhone, but then just a whole bunch of other technologies and stuff, even the way that we do design online. I mean, back then design was slicing up a table in Dreamweaver and posting that on the web. Now it&#8217;s all browser with layouts and flexbox and all that sort of stuff, not to mention other service side technologies and stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, I was in college in &#8217;99. I had started as a computer science major, computer science, computer engineering because I wanted to be a web designer. I had cut my teeth in high school in the computer lab at my mom&#8217;s job because she taught at a college. I cut my teeth reverse engineering websites, and I made something on GeoCities, and my mom was like, &#8220;Why you putting our address on the internet?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;We live in rural Alabama. Nobody knows who we are.&#8221; But I went to school, went to Morehouse, majoring in computer science thinking that was web design, right?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Well, it was. I mean, I remember I had to do HTML coding because I was taking some program classes, and for people who don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s a program called BASIC and Pascal.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
C++. I was taking all those. The internet back in the day was code. ,And then you&#8217;d upload images and like you said, you&#8217;re doing slices and all that, and now you&#8217;ve got&#8230; But what was cool about that is lacking today, it feels like to me, is that there was all this experimentation, right? You&#8217;d have these Easter eggs on the side, you&#8217;re like, &#8220;[inaudible 00:31:50] scroll left or right, up or down. Am I navigating through this weird wormhole?&#8221; Whereas now everything&#8217;s on these sort of modular boxes, and so there&#8217;s shades of vanilla essentially, and then however powerful your imagery is, but people are also picking up the same sort of trends on en masse at this point, which is one of the sort of fears or outputs that might become AI down the line is Marvel movie number 856.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
But I think back then there was a great experimentation and we were all sort of learning and playing around, and I think that was probably part of the happiness people were experiencing originally with sort of the Web3, NFT space, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
It kind of had that same energy. It had some wrinkles to it. It had a little bit of dirt in the fingernails of we&#8217;re figuring it out and we&#8217;re going to make art and it&#8217;s going to be awesome and we&#8217;ve got our own closed loop, and then [inaudible 00:33:00].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I attended a metaverse conference in the metaverse. Was that last year? I think it was last year. It was last year I&#8217;m thinking about it, yeah. I attended a metaverse conference in the metaverse, and one of the sessions this guy was talking about digital real estate, and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, we have this digital world and you can buy these plots of digital land.&#8221; Somebody during the presentation bought a $10,000 plot of land that only exists in the metaverse, and it made me think of, do you remember The Million Dollar Homepage?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The Million Dollar Homepage was basically, it&#8217;s probably still online, to be completely honest, but it&#8217;s basically you bought pixels on this homepage. Say you had a 88 x 31 ad tile or something, you could buy the area of that 88 x 31, and it&#8217;s like a dollar per pixel and put an ad up there. People were just buying spaces and putting up all kinds of stuff on there, and that&#8217;s what it felt like. It&#8217;s like this digital real estate that doesn&#8217;t really exist, but you&#8217;re kind of buying into it for the hopes of it becoming something in the future which I guess is like real real estate.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
It&#8217;s so funny to me, the whole digital real estate now. Whatever it starts to morph into in five, 10 years will be what it is, and everyone will come back to this podcast episode and laugh at me for saying it, but the reason why real estate exists and has value in real life is because we live on one planet. It&#8217;s literally a finite resource, right? This is where we breathe, hopefully, and have food and light and all this sort of other great stuff. And so, there&#8217;s X amount of space for X amount of people, and there are prime pieces on it.</p>
<p>In a virtual world, much like if we didn&#8217;t have to worry about time or eating or breathing, we live in this vastly, huge universe like in the real world. The digital world is the same thing where it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s infinitely large. There&#8217;s, in actuality, no real prime real estate because you can own one square inch and have it feel like a million square inches or you can just go to a different section of virtual town and make your own thing. Yeah, the real estate part is quite interesting in terms of how they attain it or how they attribute an X, Y, Z coordinate to it. It&#8217;s not a place.</p>
<p>Right, right. Yeah, in a way, it just sort of felt like it was kind of just like you&#8217;re buying a plot in a subdivision because it only exists in that particular metaversal world that we happen to be in, because the metaverse is many different worlds. It&#8217;s not, as you&#8217;re sort of saying how earth is one finite resource, the metaverse is a whole bunch of stuff.<br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Yeah, I could literally make my own planet in the metaverse, in my own solar system in the metaverse. So why do I need to buy a 50 pixel by 800 pixel piece of property across the street from Snoop Dogg&#8217;s one place?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. And Sean, he paid $10,000 for it, and the guy was wearing an NFT suit or something, and he kept showing off like, &#8220;I can show off my NFTs on my suit.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;This is giving me a headache. I don&#8217;t even know what to make of this.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
That&#8217;s probably a slam. I think there&#8217;s always what&#8217;s presented on the surface and then what&#8217;s happening on the back end and part [inaudible 00:36:48], &#8220;Hmm, did you really buy that? Was that a plan?&#8221; Like, okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Those early days, in the 2000s, as you mentioned, on the web, it was really sort of experimental with publishing and stuff. Now after you graduated, tell me about your early career because you got into media and publishing afterwards, right?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Correct. Yeah, so I had a couple of gigs prior, but I would say my professional career really kickstarted in the publishing world. I worked for Future Publishing, Ziff Davis, and Maker Media. I started over at Ziff Davis and now Ziff Davis was really about video game magazines. I was working on their PC focused gaming magazine and then started getting really curious. I&#8217;ve always been, I would say, hardworking and curious, sort of always looking to push my edges. And so, I was proactive about reaching out to other publisher or other magazines if they needed help designing pages. And so, I was very proactive and worked with Electronic Gaming Monthly or PlayStation Magazine or Xbox Magazine and all these things just so I can get more experience quicker.</p>
<p>Then I transitioned over to Future, which is like the sort of, they were essentially Coca-Cola and Pepsi as holders, and so they had the reverse version of everything. While I was at Future, I started their custom content division, and so that was working directly with brands to develop branded, independent magazines, websites, apps, podcasts for folks like Best Buy or NVIDIA, brands like Paul Reed Smith Guitars, did a crocheting magazine, all sorts of stuff. And so, that helped do a couple of things of giving me a brief and a business objective for the brands we did partner with, and then gave me the license to concept and develop an entire magazine, for example, that would service those needs and what those sections would be and sort of design language that would go into that, not only that printed piece, but the digital footprint as well.</p>
<p>And so, it was a really great time because at that moment we were making the transition, the death of print was happening, as I said at the time, and so not only were we doing magazines, but it allowed me to do websites, it allowed me to do apps because the iPad had come out. And so, we were looking at how do you translate brand DNA into a digital platform space, which was a really interesting moment that I would call back to the sort of tensions that are happening today. It was really weird because people had this sort of cognitive dissidents between this magazine I&#8217;m holding is the brand. And it&#8217;s like, no, the brand is the brand, what your brand stands for and your tone and how you sort of approach things and it happens to be a magazine, but it can also be a website, it can also be a podcast, it can also be an iPad app or a tablet app.</p>
<p>You can start to see the split of people that didn&#8217;t want to adopt or learn, and then the people who leaned into it, and I&#8217;m always been the one that just leans into the chaos because it never looks as crazy on the inside as it does on the outside, and that&#8217;s where all the opportunity is. And so, that was a really great moment to go and take that experience over to Maker, because instead of working on multiple brands, this was making one brand that had the business, Maker Media, it had the printed magazines, Craft Magazine and Make Magazine. It then had a body of different websites and then it also had Maker Fair.</p>
<p>And so, now you&#8217;re looking at how do you take a brand and have it stretch out into these various forms because they found themselves there and then create order around it and really sort of bring it home so that it could grow and thrive in the midst of the quote, unquote, &#8220;death of print.&#8221; It&#8217;s still around. It&#8217;s still doing very well because I think part of it was learning that your brand, believing and knowing that the brand is bigger than the mass at the end of the day or has the ability to be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, was it kind of a shift to go from working in these publishing companies to going in-house, working with agencies? You also have worked with JWT, worked for FleishmanHillard, now you&#8217;re at DemonstratexDDW. Was it a big shift making that change?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, the days are different. It was interesting. I feel like I had a soft entry, I&#8217;ll call it soft, because before going into fully external agencies, I worked in-house at Discovery Communications. They did Discovery Channel, Learning Channel, Animal Planet, and so I was helping with the Investigation Discovery launch and show launches there as well as Velocity Network, and so that was the agency inside. You had to develop a pitch concept, pitch it to the marketing team or the showrunner and come up with marketing campaigns that way. And so, that was a good segue before going fully agency because FleishmanHillard is one of the big global PR agencies, so was J Walter Thompson which is now Wunderman Thompson, and so one&#8217;s Omnicom, a sort of agency holding company.</p>
<p>I guess I always did this. I went from Pepsi to Coke or Coke to Pepsi, and so went over to J Walter Thompson and did the same thing, but I think the transition at Discovery really helped out because it gave me insight and understanding on what are the different outputs that come in advertising, what the digital lens, what are people looking for in terms of making commercials or campaign programs. It started to really give me the language and became a good test bed for me in that transition.</p>
<p>Fleishman gave me, I would say, my PhD in quickly pivoting your mind. I worked not only nationally but sort of globally as well. And so, I worked on everything from sort of data security to consumer goods to FinTech to healthcare, you name it. And so, I would get briefs that range from internal communications programs, crisis management programs, general awareness programs, and really focused on creative and content strategy while I was there. At nine o&#8217;clock in the morning, you&#8217;re talking about the future of electronic payments in developing countries. In the afternoon, you&#8217;re talking about the future of medicine. And so, your brain has to be able to pivot because you&#8217;re going to be in a room with a bunch of C-suite executives talking about and really having to understand the background information and sort of ways in which culture was moving.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, from this point where you&#8217;re at in your career, what does the future of agencies look like?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
I would say that the future of agency is going to have to be personal. I think that interesting part, and this is why I think AI literacy is so important right now is it gives smaller, medium-sized agencies an opportunity to scale up outputs if done properly, if integrated properly into your workflows. I think that because we&#8217;re going to have so many different digital touchpoints that are super niche, you&#8217;re going to have to get very personal and personalized in your messaging. I think that the physical interaction and experience is going to be highly coveted, and people are going to appreciate that a lot more because no matter how amazing that virtual experience is, people still need, just have a genetic need to engage with other people and smell the same thing, be in the same room in a very real way. That&#8217;s not to say that in 20 years there&#8217;ll be some matrix version of that reality, but until then I do think that people getting together and engaging with each other is going to be super important, but I do think those will be more curated, more selective kinds of engagement points with folks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think there&#8217;s been so much talk about data-driven outcomes and seeing what the data says and all that, but at the end of the day, you&#8217;re still dealing with people. I mean, even with this AI stuff, I see so many videos on TikTok and YouTube about people telling you how to craft the perfect prompts for GPT and all this sort of stuff, and I think what it&#8217;s still boils down to is that at the end of the day humans are still the entry point.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Well, you&#8217;re still going to be the decision-maker at the end of the day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right, right.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
If you are essentially at a 12th grade level and GPTed your way into life and you find yourself there as a 26-year-old, really do the math on that. You started out and you GPTed your way from 18 to 26, the wheels are going to fall out from under you because at a certain point you&#8217;re going to be in a room and you need to be able to answer the questions and defend the solution to someone else, and if you don&#8217;t know your stuff, because you&#8217;ve been essentially the parrot for this fishnet of an answer that your AI gave you, the trust won&#8217;t be there. That&#8217;s what all the access and the ability to repeat opportunity comes from earning, cultivating trust over time, and that&#8217;s a human thing. And so, if you get to the point to where you are pointless, then you won&#8217;t as a person have any need to be in the room with people. And so, I don&#8217;t know if I lost the point on that one, but I do think that&#8217;s a bit of-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, no, I think you&#8217;re spot on.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s a balance.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What have been some of the most important lessons you&#8217;ve learned in your career?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Being comfortable, getting uncomfortable is the most important lesson I&#8217;ve learned in my career. I&#8217;ve touched on it over the course of our conversation, but being proactive when transition happens, jumping into the chaos, because I firmly believe that&#8217;s where the opportunity lies, and when that new messy space opens, if you&#8217;re over there first, you get to make mistakes on a small scale, right? Imagine putting out a bad tweet when Twitter just started or putting up a lame Instagram post when Instagram first started. That&#8217;s the best time to do it. You can learn how the audience interacts on the channel and get feedback and get better. You do not want to be doing that high wire act in the middle of the Super Bowl for the first time.</p>
<p>Getting into that space, understanding the language, understanding the nuance and the flow of energy there gets you smart on it because people will eventually come there because that&#8217;s where all the changes, that&#8217;s where all the new is, that&#8217;s where all sort of cultural influencers are being born and sparking new kinds of innovations. Eventually everyone&#8217;s going to get there. So always being comfortable with getting uncomfortable is hard, it&#8217;s uncomfortable, but I think the reward there is the most fruitful for a long-term career as a creative, not as somebody.</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;ve probably seen this over the years, there&#8217;s lots of people who used to be a designer, used to be a creative, used to be in marketing, and the difference is not just some of the systemic stuff, but it&#8217;s staying relevant, right? In order to stay relevant in today, you need to be smarter than what&#8217;s happening today, which means you need to be ahead of the curve a little bit, and that&#8217;s a hard thing to keep up with. You got to be the Lil Wayne of the industry. He&#8217;s been doing it since he was 12, so he just stays up there. And so, you got to be the Lil Wayne of whatever you&#8217;re doing in life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I still remember Lil Wayne from those CDs in the &#8217;90s, No Limit and everything.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
And Cash Money.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Cash Money.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is it that keeps you motivated and inspired? Because I can imagine this is not an easy thing to sustain, this kind of thing with being comfortable with being uncomfortable because you&#8217;re sort of always kind of jolted out of balance in a way, I would imagine.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
I mean, to be very straightforward with it, family keeps me motivated. I have a kiddo and she is a spark of joy, and so that situation keeps me motivated to keep wanting to do better from just a sort of fundamental lizard brain section of my mind. Creating room and space and opportunity for her and creating, I&#8217;ve seen my dad do that so I can do it and I can one-up him, right? Having that yard stick in front of you I think is a great driver.</p>
<p>Then I would say for me another motivator is just I am curious and I feel like my brain is creatively broken. It&#8217;s like a faucet that doesn&#8217;t turn off. You hear the conversations with people going through these dry periods, and I&#8217;m not trying to toot my own horn or anything there, but it&#8217;s like my brain just does not shut up with things it wants to do or think about or see. I think that comes from living that, trying to have a more balanced life of&#8230; And you ask me the question, what are some of the hobbies and things that you like to do that kind of spark you, those are the sustaining breaths that help keep passion and curiosity going.</p>
<p>And so, when you cultivate or try to cultivate a life where Monday is not a dreadful day, Monday is just Monday, and now the dreadful part of the day is, well, now people are going to expect me to respond to an email because it&#8217;s not the weekend. But at the end of the day, I&#8217;m writing or designing or talking to people or trying a product or trying this or going to an event. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;That&#8217;s dope.&#8221; It&#8217;s a good thing and it just takes effort to stay on the ball, but I think that just comes with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, who are some of the people that have helped you reach this point in your career?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
I would like to think myself for&#8230; No, I was like, I couldn&#8217;t remember that new [inaudible 00:53:25] quote. I&#8217;d like to thank myself for the hard work. But honestly, I think it&#8217;s a bit of that, just you got to know your center and you got to know your truth and you got to play to your strengths and you got to build up your weaknesses. I&#8217;ve been blessed in meeting very kind people that have cracked the door open and given me opportunity. That comes again from the fact that proving or being in that sort of energy state where you are proactively looking to grow. I&#8217;m more willing to open the door to someone that I see that&#8217;s working hard and looking to grow and looking to be challenged than someone that&#8217;s sitting on their laurels. Luckily, the people I&#8217;ve engaged with were willing to open the door.</p>
<p>Then I have a great network of friends and colleagues to be able to bounce ideas off of, hear what they&#8217;re going through, take lessons from that, and make connections and references. You can&#8217;t do everything by yourself. It&#8217;s one of the sort of points that I always teach. I always stress to my daughter, she wants to become the next Hayao Miyazaki. And I go, &#8220;That&#8217;s awesome, and Hayao Miyazaki not only is a great drawer and a writer and all that sort of stuff, but he also has studio space that he has to pay mortgage on and employees, and so he has a CFO and he is got da, da, da, da, da. He is got to work about licensing deals and everything else.&#8221; So it&#8217;s like you got to have a good network as well and make those connections.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Man, on my bucket list, I want to do some shit in space. I really want to do something in space.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
I&#8217;m going to put that energy out on this podcast. If somebody knows someone in any country that&#8217;s doing something in space in the next five years, it would be great. I think that would just be a trip. I don&#8217;t want to go underwater. I don&#8217;t want to go into any of that deep sea stuff, but space would be kind of just like I feel like that would be a mind-altering, crazy thing and inspirational thing to do. Something dealing with logistics. Doesn&#8217;t that sound cool? I&#8217;m working on an interplanetary logistics program, or I&#8217;m like, this new bougie hotel that&#8217;s in low earth orbit, and so I&#8217;ve got to do a promotional campaign or video or collaboration thing. That just sounds dope to me. So that&#8217;s what I want to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I interned with NASA for two years when I was in college. So it&#8217;s funny because we were talking about college and you mentioned 9/11. 9/11 was one of a turning point for me too because the program that I was in, the way they had it set up, it was based off of Ronald E. McNair who was in the Challenger explosion, and so his family put together a foundation, whatever. So I was a McNair scholar at Morehouse, and the part of the NASA thing was that you interned at NASA for two years and then afterwards you basically had your pick of any NASA facility to work for. So I was like, I had done my first one in California, did my second one in Alabama, and I thought I was all set, until 9/11 happened, and then the funding shifted towards the creation of this new department called the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:57:22].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, and they were like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; I remember they called us all into the office and they were like, &#8220;Yeah, the seniors will still be able to go forward to work at NASA facilities,&#8221; and I was a junior at the time, but they were like, &#8220;the rest of y&#8217;all, you&#8217;re on your own.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Oh man.&#8221; I say all of that to say that I think now, certainly 20-plus years in the future from when I graduated, there&#8217;s probably more opportunities for designers to work with NASA and space than there were back then. I think back then it was still pretty, I don&#8217;t want to say confined to academia, but you&#8217;ve got even people on TikTok who are budding astrophysicists that are doing stuff that has to deal with space and everything. I feel like it&#8217;s possible.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Well, yeah, I mean, definitely think it&#8217;s possible. My mom actually used to work for NASA. She&#8217;s a mathematician, and I think the terms they used to use back in the day though for people like my mom was data analysts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Ah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Give them a data analyst title versus a data scientist title, save yourself a hundred thousand dollars, and they&#8217;ll hide those fingers in the back somewhere. I do think that the opportunity today is a lot more open, but the work, it&#8217;ll be curious to see how willing people are to do the work because you always see do the work as the hashtag, but the sort of underlying effort, sustained effort of doing the work is the great equalizer in a lot of ways. You will get tired and then you&#8217;ve got to get that seventh and eighth wind at the end of the day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look at you. Your mom was a hidden figure. Look at that.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Yeah, it was weird. It&#8217;s funny, I&#8217;ve got these old photos and stuff of her on some airplane thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Really?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Well, the thing about D.C. is back when I was there in the &#8217;80s, it&#8217;s like a bunch of little Black ladies that run all the sort of inner operations of the government at a certain point because they were all the secretaries and they were working in, they were the data analyst or this kind of thing, and they were just working in the back.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work, and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
I am so Google-able at this point in time. You can literally type my name in, but you can follow me at kidisgoat, K-I-D is goat, G-O-A-T. You can look at the company, we are demonstrate.com or you can look at ddw.com if you&#8217;re interested in branding work. But that&#8217;s where you can find me. Look me up, I&#8217;m out there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Sean DallasKidd, I want to thank you so, so, so much for coming on the show. I really think that your authenticity and the passion that you have for your work really shines through. I mean, even just from your early days of getting into publishing with the work that you&#8217;re doing now for Demonstrate, I like what you said about having to be in the work so you kind of stay one step ahead. It&#8217;s that sort of thinking that certainly I think is going to take all of us as creatives far, but certainly it&#8217;s been such a boon for your career and for your life, and I&#8217;m really excited to see the Sean DallasKidd project in low earth orbit one day. I think it&#8217;s going to happen.</p>
<p><b>Sean DallasKidd:</b><br>
Thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So thank you so much. Yeah, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>

Luckily, it&#8217;s not too late to reset, break any unhealthy patterns, and get on track so you can live a life rooted in passion and purpose. And guess what? This week&#8217;s guest, Justin Shiels, is just the person to help you make that happen.</p>
<p>We talked about his theme for this year &#8212; intentional growth &#8212; and Justin spoke about the big life change that inspired him to not only take a break, but to write a book to help others experience their own breakthrough.

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Hey there. My name is Justin Shiels and I&#8217;m a creative consultant, a speaker and an author. Honestly, what I love is solving complex problems using the lens of emotional intelligence. And so a lot of my focus is on how to use empathy and design and illustration to create cultural moments.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s the year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Ooh, 2023 is a good year so far. I feel like 2022 for me was my year of the pivot. There were just a lot of changes. I got a book deal, I switched to a new job in marketing, and I feel like through that time of working on the book, finishing the book, writing and illustrating, I changed as a person. And so 2023, I stepped into this new year focused on intentional growth. That&#8217;s kind of my theme of this year. How can I be centered in my vision as a creative professional and continue to grow in a sustainable way?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In what way does that intentional growth look like?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Intentional growth for me is really focusing on delivering incredible content via social media platforms. This was my year of embracing video and not being afraid to show my face on camera. That has always been a little bit of a scary part of my creative process. It&#8217;s been opening myself up to new speaking opportunities, and it&#8217;s been teaching workshops around emotional intelligence and how to reset your life as well as how to be a better creative professional.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so let&#8217;s talk about this book deal that you mentioned. The book&#8217;s coming out later this year, right?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes, that&#8217;s correct. In December 2023, my upcoming title, The Reset Workbook will come out with Spruce Books, which is an imprint of Penguin Random House.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Can you tell us a little bit about it?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, as much as you can. I mean, we want people to buy it, of course, but tell us a bit about it.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
The Reset Workbook is a guided journal that utilizes emotional intelligence to help readers discover their inner magic. It includes some original content created by me, lots of beautiful illustrations and really meaningful questions that help you on your self-reflection journey. I like to say that the book really came from my experience of having a total life reset.</p>
<p>In 2016, I went through a really intense breakup, and that breakup was profound for a number of reasons, but the reason that I think it changed my life is that it opened me up to the idea of going to therapy for the first time, and therapy for me was transformational. Reading books, journaling, creating new habits around how to be a healthier person all came through this experience, this transformational life experience, and I wanted to take the things that I learned along the way in that journey and build it into something that is meaningful and useful for people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So with that in mind, what do you want readers to take away from the book?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
The biggest thing that anyone should take from The Reset Workbook is that you can break free of unhelpful patterns and live with more passion and purpose. I like to think of this as a gateway for people that maybe aren&#8217;t used to journaling regularly, that want to do some internal reflection and some self-discovery and learn more about themselves. And for some people that end up purchasing the book, my hope is that this is your gateway to trying therapy. I know that in my past experience and especially with my family, the idea of going to therapy was controversial, and I&#8217;m trying to normalize the idea that mental health and mental wellness is important specifically in the Black community, in the LGBT community, and it&#8217;s a tool, a useful tool for us to grow and change and develop.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like a lot of conversations around therapy now are, I think they&#8217;re starting to become a lot more commonplace. I hear about it in videos and podcasts, et cetera. It&#8217;s starting to become, I should say, a pretty common talking point from what I hear that folks are like, &#8220;Are you in therapy? Are you going to therapy? You need to go to therapy,&#8221; that kind of thing. So it sounds like your book is going to help really facilitate that. That&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Oh, 100%. I feel like millennials we&#8217;re much more open to doing that deep reflection and understanding how we can grow and change. I still feel like there&#8217;s the opportunity for more people to explore therapy, and I am very thankful to be an advocate in this space, encouraging people to step outside their comfort zones and open themselves up to some new opportunities.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now the book comes out in December. Do you have some things that you&#8217;re doing leading up to that?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes, absolutely. Leading up to the book launch, I&#8217;m hosting a number of workshops and doing speaking engagements with the variety of organizations, and my hope is really to just spread inspirational stories, give encouragement and also to teach people how to make meaningful change in their lives.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about your overall work. You said something earlier about last year kind of being this pivot, and part of that was going into marketing and how this whole process of doing that with the book changed you, and it sounds like one of the outcomes of this was creating your own company, your media company called SoCurious. And you wear a lot of hats in that. You&#8217;re a creative consultant, you&#8217;re a speaker, you&#8217;re an author as you mentioned, you&#8217;re a coach. Tell me more about that transition.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yeah. I think so much of being a creative is learning how to wear many hats. For me, my creative journey started in advertising, and so I started as a graphic designer at an ad agency and was able to work my way up to being a creative director at an ad agency. That was an incredible experience, very, very stressful, very, very intense. But what was beautiful about it was that I learned how to become an incredible storyteller as well as have the capacity to work under intense pressure. It also was useful in learning how to manage teams and how to be an advocate for my employees. I feel like working in advertising was really my first step in learning emotional intelligence. So I transitioned from my position at the ad agency and started a job as a creative director for a tech company.</p>
<p>What was different about this experience was that it was much more of a marketing role, and so my focus instead of just coming up with the creative concepts, I did that as well as ran the ad campaigns or utilized agency partners to run ad campaigns and other freelancers, and it&#8217;s like the culmination of all these skills come together to kind of help me become the person that I am today, someone that loves storytelling, that loves to create, and that also loves marketing. And so I&#8217;m using all of those skills now trying to spread this idea that emotional intelligence matters and that we can reflect and grow and change.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like from the name of the company, curiosity is a big part of the work that you do.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes, 100% curiosity has followed me at every step of my journey. As a kid, I stayed in the library. I love reading books, and I as a child would just sit and read and read about anything that I could. Similarly, I feel like creativity has always been at the heart of the work that I do. So learning to draw as a young person, focusing my attention on learning skills like Photoshop and other animation programs, it&#8217;s all been a part of who I am as a person from the very start.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you mentioned with your time being a creative director in the advertising field, how that taught you certain skills with running a team, et cetera. What are some important lessons you&#8217;ve learned on this leg of your creative journey, creating this inspirational content for curious and thoughtful people?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yeah. I feel like we live in a time where people are overwhelmed by the amount of information that we get in the day, and specifically, we receive so much negative information in our day, primarily from the news, sometimes from our social feeds. It just comes from a variety of ways, and I wanted to focus my energy and my intention on creating positive content that encourages people. My focus with everything that I do is how can I give just a tiny little spark of joy to someone&#8217;s day and encourage them to think about the deeper questions of what it means to be a human being in this world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you&#8217;re currently in Austin, right? Austin, Texas?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes, that&#8217;s correct.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me what it&#8217;s like there for you. Are you tapped into the creative community there?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Now, I&#8217;ll tell you one thing that I am loving about my experience in Austin is that it is a wonderful city that has encouraged me to get outside and do things. I have never been an outdoor person at any point in my life, and I moved here and now I&#8217;m going on hikes and exploring new outdoor terrain in ways that I have never done. It&#8217;s actually pretty incredible. Another really great benefit of living in Austin for me is the people here are genuinely incredible, and I&#8217;ve been able to connect with a lot of like-minded Black creatives primarily that work in tech, but that also are doing their own set of interesting projects. And so being able to cultivate a community in a new city, I&#8217;ve only been here three years, it has been great, and I feel actually pretty proud that I was able to do that, especially with the constraints around living through the kind of strange and unusual times of the past few years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, the pandemic, I feel like really threw a wrench in a lot of people&#8217;s just general social activities, but we&#8217;re starting to get out there and do things again. I haven&#8217;t been to Austin since&#8230; God, when was the last time I was in Austin, Texas? It was for SXSW, I know that. It might have been. Yeah, that was the last time. It was 2015 was the last time. I was supposed to go in 2020. The company that I was working for at the time, we had a presence at SX [South By] and we were going to go, but then Coronavirus.</p>
<p>So then all of that got canceled and we were all waiting to see if it was going to happen. I already had my tickets and everything and then just all got canceled and shut down, so I need to try to make it back. Austin&#8217;s a lot of fun. It&#8217;s a lot of fun, especially during SXSW, but then there&#8217;s just so many folks and it&#8217;s just mad crowded. I think it came back last year. Right? Last year was the first time it was in person for a couple of years.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
It did come back last year. And you are 100% correct. It gets so crowded here in Austin during SXSW. It is packed, but definitely make your way down. You got to come back and enjoy some of this music and food and just some of these outdoor experiences I was telling you about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I need to come during the non-SXSW season. It&#8217;s a nice conference. I mean, I used to go really back in its heyday when it was really something, but now I&#8217;m just like, I&#8217;m old. There&#8217;s too many people. Like y&#8217;all need to. It&#8217;s a lot, but I need to come during the off season. So you&#8217;ve been in Austin for three years, that&#8217;s not where you&#8217;re from originally I would take it.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
No, I&#8217;m actually from Memphis, Tennessee originally. Grew up 901 proud, but I left when I turned 18 to go to college in New Orleans. I went to Loyola University, a Jesuit institution, and I ended up staying in New Orleans after I graduated for 16 years. And so New Orleans is one of those places that just is still very, very near and dear to my heart. I literally just got back from a wonderful one week vacation there where I got to catch up with all of my old friends.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to lie, I miss New Orleans. I miss New Orleans a lot, but I feel like a lot of the significant life changes occurred because I was confident enough to move away. Honestly, I feel like stepping outside of my comfort zone pushed me to become a better creative and encouraged me to push myself in some new and exciting ways.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, taking it back to Memphis for a second, I mean, you grew up there. You went to high school and everything there. Were you really a creative kid into design and illustration back then?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve always been a super creative person for sure. I learned to illustrate very, very young, and as a kid, my mom got us a computer. I think I was in the fourth or fifth grade, and that computer was incredible. I don&#8217;t know if you remember AOL days.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
We got that CD in the mail with AOL, and it opened my mind up because it went from, oh my gosh, my entire world is Memphis to, oh my gosh, my entire world is the world. And so way back then I started an email newsletter before email newsletters were a thing. It was called Iconoclast. That was the very first kind of side hustle project that I had as a little person sending out this monthly email about art. And so creativity, developing content and doing storytelling has been a big part of my life. In high school, my focus was really on visual art. I did a little bit of theater, but I feel like the computer was really their turning point because I loved Photoshop and building little tiny animations during that time period, too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you were a real pioneer back then, sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if I would&#8217;ve thought of myself as a pioneer, but I feel like the ideas around communication and media have always been central to my identity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So like you said, you ended up moving from Memphis, going to New Orleans, went to Loyola, like you said, studied graphic design, but then later after that you went to the University of New Orleans and that&#8217;s where you got your master&#8217;s degree. When you look back at those times, what do you remember the most? What stands out to you?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yeah. What I think is beautiful about the city of New Orleans is there are no barriers of entry. Every single person in this city is one degree of separation from the mayor probably.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Really?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
So if you have an idea, you can start it. There is nothing that will stop you from starting it. During my time in New Orleans, a lot of my core focus was on building brands around culture. So I ran an online magazine called InvadeNOLA for six years. That was a passion project of passion projects, and it kind of came from, there was an article in a local magazine that said that all these invaders had come and they were ruining New Orleans, and I was a transplant to the city that fell in love with the city.</p>
<p>I moved to New Orleans before Katrina. I of course evacuated but came back after Katrina and stayed, chose that place as my new home. And so I felt really passionately about the local culture as well as our capacity as transplants to create positive change. So I focused my content on the millennials living in the city, doing creative projects that were interesting, and I was able to build it into a pretty popular and successful organization, writing regular content, sending out lots of email newsletters and publishing a few printed books and magazine issues.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, look at that. So what&#8217;s you&#8217;re describing with InvadeNOLA&#8230; That&#8217;s what it was called? Invade New Orleans?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it sounds a lot like, and I don&#8217;t know if this even still exists, but do you remember, or does the phrase Not For Tourists sound familiar?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Not For Tourists had something like that in some major cities where they would&#8230; It was almost like a guide to that city in every city, almost like Frommer&#8217;s, which I guess is old school. I don&#8217;t know if they still make those, but they&#8217;re like these city guides, but it&#8217;s written by the people that lived there, the locals, so they can tell you what&#8217;s good, what&#8217;s bad, do this, don&#8217;t do that, that kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes. Actually, the book that I published during that time period was called The Invader&#8217;s Guide to New Orleans, which was a tourist guide for under the radar things to do in the City.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. So you were, again, another pioneer in publishing, email, books, magazines. And just to give a sense of when this is, so people know, this was what, mid 2000s?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes. This would&#8217;ve been, I think I started the publication in 2010.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Actually, it would&#8217;ve been 2009 to 2015-ish. That should be the right timeframe.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. All right. Yeah, no, that&#8217;s thinking of what all else was going along culturally during that time. So after you graduated, you&#8217;re big in this project, Invade was one of them. Another one that you created was called Venture Pop, right?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes. So actually as I decided that I wanted to step away from the event culture, I as the founder of Invade, I ended up having to do so many local events, and a part of it was that I wanted to cover it for the magazine. A part of it was because I had made all these great connections and friends and wanted to support them, but it was actually taxing, right? I was going out almost every single night, and that just was not a sustainable lifestyle, especially because even though I&#8217;m an extrovert, I need a lot of time to recuperate, and my favorite way to recuperate is through my creative practice.</p>
<p>And so I was like, I really want to lean into my creativity more, and it was just the perfect confluence of events. I went to a conference in Texas and ran into a woman that I knew from New Orleans at that conference, and we spent that weekend together going to all these really great speakers and seeing these really incredible workshops. I was so encouraged by that experience that I was like, we need to have this in New Orleans. And so I partnered with two women to start Venture Pop, and we successfully held three live conferences. They ended up being regional conferences that invited a lot of incredible creative talent to the city of New Orleans, and they were fun informational experiences that allowed people to grow in their creative journeys.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like there used to be this conference in Ohio in Cleveland called Weapons of Mass Creation Fest. It sounds like it was similar in scope to that where it&#8217;s not necessarily a design conference, it&#8217;s more like a creative conference, so it&#8217;s people of all kinds of creative stripes coming together and learning from each other and networking and fellowshipping and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes, that is 100% true. While my experience has been in graphic design and web design and then advertising, I think instead of having it focus on any one specific discipline, a big part of our goal with Venture Pop was to create experiences that allowed people to push their creativity to its limits, to learn new skills, to create new things. In many ways, we were kind of a part of that content creator movement that we&#8217;re living in right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In what way?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
I think in many ways we were bolstering the idea that in order to become an incredible creator, you have to find and define your own creative voice and share that message with the world. I feel like that actually encouraged me on my journey of having a public facing persona that spreads positive messages on the internet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve worked for some agencies as well. You alluded earlier that you were a creative director in the advertising industry, so you&#8217;ve worked for FSC Interactive, you worked for Springbox, you worked for Fragment Media Group, and we don&#8217;t have to spend a lot of time talking about them because that was in your past, but when you look back at those experiences, when you think about them, what did they kind of teach you that you really still carry with you to this day?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Through my time working in advertising, I had the opportunity to work with a variety of incredible clients in New Orleans. I actually was fortunate enough to do a rebranding of the City of New Orleans, the New Orleans Tourism Focus campaign where we did a full rebranding of the visual identity as well as creating commercials. I also had the opportunity to run the social channels for Visit New Orleans and here in Austin as a creative director, I worked with really awesome B2B clients, the most notable one, being Amazon Business.</p>
<p>As a full-time creative director, a lot of my focus was on how do you tell a compelling story through advertising and how do you communicate that information effectively? But the value of that experience more than anything is that it really exposed me to emotional intelligence. Naturally, I am kind of a chill guy. I have resting smiley face. I tend to be a little bit of a people pleaser. And so the experience of being a manager of people challenged me to learn about myself and grow. I had to recognize, understand, and manage my own emotions, but then I needed to also do that for other people, and that&#8217;s the heart of emotional intelligence. I really had to focus a lot on building my own self-awareness so that I was prepared for the relationship management that goes into managing a team of people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can imagine just in the advertising industry, having to do all of that on top of working with multiple clients and deadlines and changes, that&#8217;s a lot to pile on.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
It is so much hard work to create consistently under those circumstances, but it also is incredibly profound and awesome. I became a creative director, and this is crazy to say, because I saw the movie Boomerang. Have you seen this movie with Eddie Murphy?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Of course. Of course. Of course. It has been a constant&#8230; I mean, for me, it&#8217;s been a constant inspiration, but there&#8217;s so many people I&#8217;ve had on the show, and I plan to write an article about this one day about the impact of that movie in the Black creative industry. But no, go ahead. Go ahead, go on.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Well, I mean, on rewatching, it&#8217;s incredibly problematic for a number of reasons. But eight-year-old Justin saw Boomerang, and I knew that I wanted to be a creative director before I knew what a creative director actually did for a living. I only knew if I can learn how to do the art for commercials, I can become a leader of teams. And so it put that bug in my ear that it was possible for someone like me, a Black man in America, to be able to lead advertising campaigns for big companies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But of course not to be a Marcus Graham type.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
I am definitely not a Marcus Graham type at all, but it was such an influential movie because it just exposed me to the idea that that was even possible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. How have you seen the creative industry evolve over the years?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
I feel like the biggest thing that has shifted and changed is the way that we disseminate information. I feel like early in my career, it was heavily focused on TV commercials. TV commercials, and print media were at their height when I graduated school in 2007, and then by 2008, the magazine industry was essentially shuddering because of the proliferation of internet media, new blogs, as well as the introduction of social media. So early in my career, I was like, there&#8217;s something special about social media, and I worked to be a part of that early on. So I&#8217;m signing up for all the services, making sure that I&#8217;m regularly posting content, and made that a big part of how I grew InvadeNOLA and how we worked with Venture Pop. I think the biggest change that we&#8217;ve seen over the course of the past few years is that it went from very few voices being able to control the narrative, to now it&#8217;s literally endless voices controlling the narrative.</p>
<p>Now, with that, I feel like there are some interesting challenges that have popped up. And so for example, when you look at how Instagram was five or six years ago versus how Instagram is now, not many people see the content that an individual produces. It&#8217;s just like, you can have, like me, nearly 10,000 followers and you&#8217;ll have a video that only a hundred people actually get to see. That is insane to me. It kind of takes away from the beauty of that platform, but I feel as though there is still this democratization of information, and in many ways it feels like everyone can have a voice and share their message to the world, even if it is being slightly dampened by these kind of changing norms on the platforms.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
First of all, let me step back from what I was about to say. I hate how these different creative fields have been condensed into the term content creator. I hate that so much, but I say all that to say I see so many creators, and by creators I do mean podcasters, folks that make TikTok videos, et cetera, expressly saying that they&#8217;re doing what they&#8217;re doing or that the pitch that they&#8217;re doing for their audience is to appease the algorithm.</p>
<p>If you watch YouTube videos, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Make sure you subscribe and hit the bell to get notifications,&#8221; or if you&#8217;re on TikTok, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Could you please comment? Because I&#8217;ve been shadow banned.&#8221; It absolutely sucks how telecommunications has evolved to the point where we can take a message, broadcast it across the world, and yet we&#8217;re still beholden to these weird algorithmic things to get the message out to people. I mean, I understand it. I just don&#8217;t like it.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yeah. I think at the heart of that is we are always in a consistent battle between humanity and technology. I think as we continue to develop and grow, I&#8217;m obsessed with artificial intelligence right now, partially because I think it has the potential to upend the creative industry in many ways. But the only solace that I have is that people want to connect with people. They don&#8217;t want just information. And so it&#8217;s how can I be a real human being that shares parts of myself with the world as a way to connect with the people in my audience?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What I&#8217;m starting to see now, especially on some of these platforms that people have built, I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily say built content on, but certainly have built a following off of are starting to erode. Facebook ain&#8217;t what it used to be. Twitter for damn sure ain&#8217;t what it used to be. And so now people are having to go back to email, hey, there you go, go back to email or live events or other ways to try to connect with folks, because as you said earlier, there&#8217;s just so much information out there and it&#8217;s hard, I think, for people to try to really, I don&#8217;t know, grasp all of that, but I also think a lot of that information is pushed to us. There&#8217;s certainly information that we go out there and see and obtain on our own, but so much of information&#8230; I don&#8217;t even want to say gathering. A lot of stuff is just pushed to us.</p>
<p>I think I noticed this particularly this year. I mean, it&#8217;s not a new phenomenon, but I&#8217;ve started turning off my phone on Sundays. Saturday night before I go to bed, turn my phone off, I turn it back on Monday morning when I wake up, and that Sunday is so peaceful. I get stuff done, I cook, I catch up on a show. It is so peaceful. But it reminds me of how much information is constantly pushed to you and notifications and Twitter feeds and Instagram feeds, and so much stuff is coming at you in a way where you&#8217;re like, it&#8217;s relentless. You&#8217;re kind of bombarded with it.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes. I feel like so many of us are addicted to doomscrolling, sitting on our couches and just absorbing information, absorbing information, absorbing information. I feel like so many of us actually need opportunities to create, and I tend to believe that everyone is creative. Sometimes that can be a controversial statement because many people are like, oh, I&#8217;m not creative. I work in accounting, or I work in tech and I don&#8217;t know how to be creative. But to me, creativity is using the skills that you have to come up with interesting solutions for problems. You can be creative while cooking or cleaning your home, or you can do it in the traditional forms like writing or illustrating or simply doing tiny doodles on the edges of your notebooks. That creativity is the impulse that I think we need to bolster in order to have a more beautiful world. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m doing the work that I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I imagine you&#8217;re also going to continue to explore that in the book that&#8217;s coming out.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Absolutely. Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
See how I tie that together? See how?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
I feel like so much of why I published The Reset Workbook was around how can we go through these life changes that we&#8217;ve had and come out of the other side with hope and inspiration. I think it&#8217;s really about pushing people to find new inspirations, pushing people to step outside their comfort zone, and really it&#8217;s focused on how can you design a life that you love.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve mentioned though a lot of your journey as a creative and even I think growing up and always being into drawing an illustration how that&#8217;s really shaped your current path. What do you find to be the most rewarding part about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
The most rewarding part of what I do in my career and in my communications online is that I&#8217;m able to connect with real human beings by sharing parts of my story with the world. There is nothing more profound or interesting to me than to say something that feels like is totally niche and just me and have somebody connect with that on a really, really deep level and reach out to me via DM and message me saying, &#8220;Oh my God, you mentioned that you love Christmas movies on the Hallmark Channel because you can fall asleep during them and wake up and still know what was happening.&#8221; I always do that. That&#8217;s why I love them so much.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like that kind of direct connection with people is just so profound and interesting to me. I would say though, the thing that is underscored throughout my career and specifically my persona online is that we are empowered to change our lives as frequently as we want. We can all have resets whenever we see fit. And I really want to underscore that idea that change is possible and it&#8217;s a good thing. It&#8217;s okay to embrace change, it&#8217;s okay to learn new things, and your life doesn&#8217;t have to be in total shambles to kind of need to reevaluate where you are in order to continue to be on a path of joy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of that, how do you stay creative and inspired in your work so you can keep on that path?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
I am incredibly disciplined when it comes to my creativity. I try to either write or draw every single day no matter what. I have been doing this for the majority of my career, and so it started very early on. I would wake up before work and spend one hour of just creating for creativity&#8217;s sake. That has continued for years and years and years. Now that I&#8217;m working for myself, I don&#8217;t have to wake up as early. I can wake up at 7:00 and kind of get going, but the very first thing that I do every day is I journal. While I&#8217;m drinking my coffee, I read a little bit, and then based on what I read, I either write a reflection on what I read or I will create a piece of art related to how I&#8217;m feeling that morning. And that practice has been transformational in that it allows me to come up with new ideas and it serves as kind of the impetus for the content that I ultimately post on my social feeds.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So for people that are listening and they aspire to become creative professionals like you, what you&#8217;re doing, what advice would you give to them?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
If you want to be a creative person, you have to invest in the actual activity of creating. That&#8217;s all. It&#8217;s really that simple. If I see myself as a writer, all I have to do is write and I am a writer. The hard part is you have to figure out how writing fits into your schedule. We all are busy, busier than we&#8217;ve ever been and everything in our life is competing with our creativity. In order to commit to your creativity, you have to be willing to practice. And so that practice should be daily. If you can&#8217;t do daily, it should be every other day. If you can&#8217;t do every other day, it should be once a week. If you can&#8217;t do every week, it should be once a month. But the more that you flex those muscles and commit to practicing, the better you get. A part of getting better in my journey, at least, it&#8217;s being confident enough to share my work. And so you make regularly, you share regularly, and then through the course of that, you become the thing that you say that you&#8217;ve always wanted to be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like it&#8217;s just this continual process of working till you get to that point. I mean, I don&#8217;t want to say fake it till you make it, but you&#8217;re kind of continually pushing yourself forward towards that goal.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, it&#8217;s really a question of outcomes versus inputs. In many ways, when we&#8217;re setting a goal for our life, we always will focus only on the outcome of the goal as opposed to the things that we need to do in order to achieve the goal. And so following that same realm of as a creative professional or as a person that aspires to be, in this case, a visual artist, how do I become a visual artist? Well, the only way that you become a visual artist is by painting every day. When you paint every day, suddenly you are a visual artist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It kind of sounds a little bit like the old, well, it&#8217;s not old, but the whole 10,000 hours thing that sometimes gets kind of tossed around. You have to do something continually to kind of build up to that.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes, yes. I love that concept that if you&#8217;re willing to put 10,000 hours of effort into something, you will become an expert in that. It&#8217;s interesting because I don&#8217;t know that it&#8230; 10,000 hours seems arbitrary of course.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
It&#8217;s sticky. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so popular, but that&#8217;s arbitrary. I think it&#8217;s committing to daily practice, putting it out there regularly, and then through that process, growing and developing and changing. I feel like even over the course of my own career, I have had moments where I was creating things that I liked but I didn&#8217;t love, and I&#8217;m finally in a stage in my creative process where I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wait, the things that I make are pretty dope, and I came up with this myself. It came from my brain specifically.&#8221; That has not always been the case, but I think it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m willing to put in the daily effort to continue to maximize my skillset, find my own voice, and also to just regularly develop new takes on things that I&#8217;ve made before.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
At my core, I am an artist and I am a teacher. Those are the two most important parts of my year of intentional growth, and so my focus is to continue to make great content to come out with a bestselling book, The Reset Workbook coming out in December, 2023. And I want to continue to teach both through workshops and through speaking engagements where I can help people amplify their lives, find joy, find peace, and encourage people to step into building their own version of happy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, your work? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
You can find me online on most platforms at justinmadethat or at Justin Shiels, but the best way to connect is really to visit socurious.co. That&#8217;s socurious.co. From there, you can see many of the articles that I&#8217;ve written and you can sign up for my newsletter that I&#8217;ve been sending out since 2019 called The Weekly Reset. It helps people live a more intentional life, and it kind of pairs my personal philosophy with illustrations that I&#8217;ve created that give you a little bit of a pep talk during the week.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And the man writes some email newsletters. He&#8217;s been doing it since he was a teenager, so you know it&#8217;s good. You know it&#8217;s good. Justin Shiels, I just want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you for just sharing your authenticity. I mean, I can really sense and feel the passion that you have for this behind your work, and I think that certainly in this time that we&#8217;re in, I&#8217;m sort of waving my arms about here, but with all the stuff that&#8217;s going on in the world right now, it&#8217;s good to have some sort of a way to know that while things may feel out of control, at the end of the day, what you can control is how you react to them. So whether that&#8217;s having that life reset or breaking unhealthy patterns, I think it&#8217;s really important to always know that, and I&#8217;m glad that the work that you&#8217;re doing is helping to get that message out to more people. Thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Maurice, thank you so much. I really appreciate this opportunity.</p>

<p>When did you fall in love with design? While some people have always been able to tap into that creative spark, for others it might take some time trying different things until you find your way into design. Such is the case with this week&#8217;s guest, independent brand designer Matese Fields. His explorations have taken him all over the country, and now he&#8217;s living and working in the creative hub of Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>Matese told me a bit about some of his latest projects, and then he shared what inspired him to get into design. He also spoke about how his background in marketing helps him in his current work, and gave some great advice and resources for any budding brand designers out there. Matese has been able to make a living and build a life by following his passions, which is something we can all get inspired by!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
I am Matese Fields, and I am an independent brand and product designer in Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. How has 2023 been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
2023 has been fantastic. I had a pretty rough 2022. Honestly, one of the worst years I&#8217;ve had in a long time. So I think when I came in 2023, I kind of came into this mindset like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not happening again.&#8221; And it hasn&#8217;t. So far it&#8217;s been great. I feel like for the first time in a long time, I&#8217;m kind of firing on all cylinders, so it feels good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, that&#8217;s good. That&#8217;s a good turnaround. I mean, I think 2022 was a rough year for a lot of people. Particularly if you were working in tech, or design, or something because of a bunch of layoffs and stuff. COVID is still around. A lot of people had a rough year. I had a rough year last year too, so I completely a hundred percent understand where you&#8217;re coming from.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I saw on Instagram you just finished up a branding campaign last month. Can you talk to me about that?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Yeah, that was one of the high points of my 2022. I got to work with a company called Black Campaign School. And so I kind of partnered with this group called Three Point Strategies, and helped them reboot what Black Campaign School is. And so they&#8217;ve been around I think since 2016. We kind of came in with the goal of differentiating it from some of that kind of DC vibe. Super political, red, white, and blue theme that they had originally had. So yeah, I came in, worked with them on the branding side of determining what Black Campaign School is, sort of redoing that logo, a lot of their brand identity. And then we built out a lot of stuff for their reboot of the actual physical school, which was really cool. I got to do a lot of physical stuff for the camp, which is located at Haley Farm in Tennessee. It&#8217;s a really cool, historically Black farm in Tennessee. So yeah, it was great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You said red, white, and blue. Was it a political advocacy group or something?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Yeah. So basically the goal of Black Campaign School is to teach people who are really involved with campaigning and that organizing for social justice and stuff like that. It&#8217;s kind of a school to teach them how to use that and take that to politics, and run for office, or boost that up a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting, okay. Yeah, because I was looking through the branding. It&#8217;s only as you mentioned it now that I was like, &#8220;This is political,&#8221; because the branding does not at all scream politics. Which I think is good. I mean, I&#8217;ve worked on a political campaign. So I feel like every campaign from California to Florida uses red, white, and blue in some iteration. So when you said that and you mentioned it, I was like, &#8220;Is that what it is?&#8221; But yeah, and I&#8217;ll put a link to it and everything so people can check out what the brand looks like, but I definitely did not get politics from it.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
That&#8217;s great. We accomplished the goal for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Are you working on any other projects at the moment?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Currently, no. So I kind of knew that January was going to be more of a slow month for me. So a lot of January was me just trying to get my stuff in order. So updating my portfolio. I&#8217;m kind of in the midst of getting my LLC. So doing a lot of work with that. Doing a lot of promoting on social media, just trying to get my work out there.</p>
<p>But I am starting a new project on Monday, which is exciting. It&#8217;s a small little contract gig with Breville, which they make tabletop coffee makers and stuff like that. So that&#8217;ll be fun. And then on another fun side, I started a Euchre club. I&#8217;m not sure if you&#8217;re familiar what Euchre is,</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Spades, right?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Similar to Spades, but not quite. It&#8217;s like a game of tricks, but it has a little different nuanced than Spades. But I&#8217;m from the Midwest originally, so it&#8217;s a big, Midwest thing for us. So I started a club with a group of 14 of my friends. And I was like, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t have that much to do. Why not just kind of act like this is a project?&#8221; So I made a logo for it, got swag made for it, and stuff. So it&#8217;s been kind of a fun thing to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I have not heard Euchre since, and I&#8217;m dating myself here. I haven&#8217;t heard Euchre since Yahoo Games. I think Yahoo Games had Euchre. I think they also had Spades too, but they had Hearts of course, Literati, stuff like that. What drew you to Euchre? Is it a distinctly Midwest game?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
I think it is. It&#8217;s fun when you have a group of a few people. And I feel like every time we&#8217;d be hanging out at somebody&#8217;s house, all my friends in Portland are from the Midwest in some capacity. So it&#8217;s like whenever we&#8217;d hang out, we&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s play Euchre.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so we actually had this party back in end of last year, and it was called the Midwest Fest. My friend put it on. Basically it was a party, and everyone brought casseroles, and everything was themed Midwest. There was corn hole, and there was a bonfire, and everything you do in the country of the Midwest. And so we ended up playing Euchre there, and there was so many people interested. We were like, &#8220;Why not just start a club?&#8221; So yeah, it kind of started from there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting. Urban Dictionary defines Euchre as a four-person trump-based, not the president, trump-based card game primarily played on Midwestern college campuses involving a 24 card deck and many beers. Is that accurate?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
That is insanely accurate. Lot of beers are had. Yes. I started playing in college. That is so accurate.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What inspired you to become a brand designer?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
I honestly never saw this for myself. I think if you would&#8217;ve talked to me five, 10 years ago, I&#8217;d have been like, &#8220;No.&#8221; But I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ve always been creative in a sense. It hasn&#8217;t always been in the design or art sense. But I&#8217;ve always kind of had an eye for creativity.</p>
<p>And so when I first started my career, I was very UX/UI heavy, which I love. But it wasn&#8217;t quite fulfilling me. And so I kind of always knew that eventually there would be more transition to a more creative side of design. And I tried a lot of different things. I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be an illustrator.&#8221; And I started doing that. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m not going to be an illustrator.&#8221; And then I really was into type design for a little bit and I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be a type designer.&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t my time for that either. And so I think just as my career went on, I kind of started forming myself to be more of a brand designer, and then just jumping in and trying to get those opportunities. So yeah, I think that&#8217;s it. There&#8217;s no straightforward answer for it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I think it&#8217;s good that you were able to explore these different facets of design before you landed on something that worked for you. That&#8217;s a good thing.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Definitely. I think my entire life has been try everything you can. That was kind of what my whole college career was. I think that&#8217;s just the way that works best for me it I want to try as much stuff as I can. And then when it sticks, it sticks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. How would you describe your design process, when you get a new project? What goes through your mind as you&#8217;re putting everything together?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
The minute I get a proposal, or an inquiry or email, thoughts are already running my head. My brain is just going at a thousand miles a minute at all times. So when I first get an email, I kind of already am thinking through what could be. So that&#8217;s one part.</p>
<p>I think the biggest part for me when it comes to working on a project, especially independently, is really getting close with the client. So really determining what is right for them. So with that comes a lot of questions. I like to sit down and just dig deep, and know everything that I can about this client, and why this project is happening, and what they want to get out of it, and the origin behind the company, and the name, and everything. So that&#8217;s definitely a big part of the process.</p>
<p>And then I would say, this is something I kind of learned from my time at Work &#038; Co, but I like to show often. I&#8217;m not a huge wire frame or sketch things out type of guy. I like to just get in and get dirty super quick. And with that comes a lot of bad things quite, frankly. But I think part of my process is being really consistent with showing how I&#8217;m getting to the point that I&#8217;m getting to.</p>
<p>So at Work &#038; Co, we should work every day. And it wasn&#8217;t always the greatest work, and sometimes it didn&#8217;t make sense. But it really helps to form that story around how you get to that final product.</p>
<p>I think one part of my process is definitely just showing a lot of work. Even if I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s great or could be tweaked, just showing that process and being super transparent about that. So yeah, that&#8217;s the early stages of the process, definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s a lot of information gathering at first, it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. I want to know everything that I can. And Dropbox Paper is my best friend. I just have things jotted down everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So do you start off digital, or do you start off analog?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Usually digital, honestly. Yeah, I&#8217;ve never been a sketcher or anything like that. So yeah, definitely digitally.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. What do you think are the most important elements of a successful brand design?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
I think honestly, the storytelling forming the story around what the brand is. And that will kind of seep into ultimately, what the look of the brand is going to be. So I&#8217;ve always kind of worked I guess, in between a lot of the strategy sides and design sides. So I think the storytelling is definitely the biggest part of the brand. Just a strong idea of what this brand is. And then that will easily flow into what is the actual part of the visual side of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is it easy to get the client online with that? To let them know that yeah, we are talking about brand. But actually, we&#8217;re going to dive more into what story is being told? Because I feel like sometimes, clients just want to see something. They want to see something visual so they can either accept it or reject it. Most likely reject it, but they kind of want to see something.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Yeah, for sure. I do think it is sometimes a little difficult getting them on board with that. But I think I&#8217;m a big part of, &#8220;This is what I did on X project, and this is how I can work with you to get you to that point.&#8221; And it might start super dry, and you might not see anything for a little bit. But once we nail it down, it&#8217;s going to be really easy to get to that point where the visuals are going to be. And I think that definitely helps with that conversation for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Has there ever been a time where you&#8217;ve kind of started out in that beginning process, and then by the time you got to the finished product, it was something completely different?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m trying to think of a specific time. But I think that honestly, it kind of happened a little bit with the Black Campaign School. We kind of knew what it was that we wanted to do and wanted to accomplish. But I think the vision of the end goal was a lot different or the vision of the visuals at the end were a lot different. We ended in this more regal, dark, purple, really showcasing the people and the what behind Black Campaign School. And I think the original was we wanted to be happy, and flowing, and pastels, and stuff like that. Yeah, I mean I think there&#8217;s been definitely been a lot of times when that&#8217;s happened for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I want to learn more about you and you. You&#8217;ve alluded a bit already since we were talking about Euchre, about your origins in the Midwest. So let&#8217;s go back there. Tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;m originally from Columbus, Ohio. I grew up in the city up through seventh grade. Went to Columbus City Schools. And then when I was in seventh grade, we moved to the country of Columbus. We moved to this little town called Lithopolis, which is 30 minutes south of Columbus. And I went to a really tiny high school called Bloom-Carroll, which was in the middle of a cornfield basically. Went from a middle school of 1,500 kids to a high school of 380. That was a huge change in my life. And then I went there all through high school.</p>
<p>And then after high school, went to a small college called Capital University, which is about five minutes from Ohio State. Small, kind of private liberal arts college. And then was there all throughout college and a couple years after college, and then kind of moved around the Midwest. I lived in Chicago for a little bit. I lived in Detroit for a little bit. And yeah, now I&#8217;m in Portland. Rainy Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Growing up, were you really creative? Were you drawing and sketching a lot, or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
No, I was honestly the complete opposite. I&#8217;ve always been really creative, but it was more in the music form. Art was my least favorite class. Yeah, it&#8217;s really crazy.</p>
<p>But I always kind of had this weird affinity, now that I think about it, for design. I was really meticulous about how my handwriting looked, how my signature looked, and how my notes were organized. So I always had that sense of, I guess design in a sense, but I just didn&#8217;t really know it back then.</p>
<p>I was a big music kid. I started playing violin in elementary school. My parents had me in piano lessons when I was really young. And then when I got to middle school and high school, I switched to playing the clarinet. And I played the bass clarinet all through high school, ended up being really good at it. Had a lot of different musical honors and stuff like that in high school. And then actually went to college for music originally. Back then, I just knew I wanted to be a music teacher. I thought I was going to be this really great musical director, and work in colleges, and universities, and stuff like that. And quickly found out that was not what I wanted to do. But I&#8217;ve been really musical my whole life, but I haven&#8217;t been into art and design my entire life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What turned you off from doing music?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
I love playing music. That was my therapy when I was a kid. I think there was a couple things. When it came to me learning the intricacies, I wasn&#8217;t that interested. I just really wanted to play. I didn&#8217;t really want to do all the music theory, and learning piano, and all that.<br>
So I think that was part of it. I think another part was I was not focused in college at all. Honestly, probably should have taken time off after high school before going to college, but my head just wasn&#8217;t there. It just kind of was like, &#8220;Okay, this is not for you. You can keep playing, but a career in music probably isn&#8217;t the best thing.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I&#8217;m thinking if you were playing bass clarinet, I&#8217;m trying to think what you would&#8230; You almost have to go into a symphony, I guess. When I think of house bands and stuff like that&#8230; I played trombone all through middle school, high school, college throughout my twenties. Every band kind of wants a trombone player, especially if you&#8217;re talking a club or something like that. But yeah, I would guess if you&#8217;re doing bass clarinet, that kind of limits options and venues for you to play, unless you go completely pro or something.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Definitely. And I think it&#8217;s actually probably one of the easier&#8230; If you&#8217;re really good at bass clarinet, I think it&#8217;s one of the easier instruments to get a gig with, because there aren&#8217;t a lot of people that play that instrument. And so I did during college and a little bit after college, I would play in different symphonic bands and stuff.</p>
<p>It was really fun. My piano teacher in college was a bass clarinet major. And so I think she eventually moved out of Ohio. And when she moved she was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to refer you for all these gigs for bass clarinet.&#8221; And so for a while, I did that where I get a call, we have a concert coming up. I&#8217;d go to the concert an hour before, run through all the music one time, and then play the concert. It was so much fun. And that was great. Being a teacher just wasn&#8217;t going to happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So when you were at Capital University, you majored in marketing. Tell me about what your time was like there.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Kind of going back to the idea of me trying everything and seeing if it sticks, that was kind of my entire college career. I originally came in as a music major. Music education major. Did that for I think a year, and half of my sophomore year. And then I was like, &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s not working. But also, I don&#8217;t know what I want to do. And so I did everything.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be an accountant.&#8221; So I was an accounting major for a little while and then I was like, &#8220;I really don&#8217;t like math.&#8221; And then I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to do psychology.&#8221; And then I was like, &#8220;Maybe I want to get into real estate.&#8221; I thought about transferring to Ohio State because they had a real estate program. And then eventually I was just like, &#8220;All right, just do marketing. It&#8217;s easy. I don&#8217;t know what I want to do in marketing, but it was easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so picked up a marketing major, stuck with it. And also like I was saying earlier, I just wasn&#8217;t really focused in college and didn&#8217;t really necessarily care about the schoolwork. But what I did know I enjoyed was working and doing internships.<br>
So once I got that marketing major, I started doing internship after internship. My friends would always make fun of me because they&#8217;re like, &#8220;You&#8217;re onto the next internship.&#8221; And I did, I think 12 in college. All different companies, and just seeing where I fit in at marketing.</p>
<p>And then eventually, I started interning with a company called OhioHealth, which is a healthcare system in Ohio. And I was doing digital marketing there. And the team was basically just me and my boss. So I got to do a lot of different stuff. And for a while, I was really focused on analytics and the web side of things, but on a marketing perspective. So SEO and stuff like that. Yeah.<br>
So then eventually I was there, and this kind of segues of how I got into design. I was working at the internship, been there for probably about a year and a half. And they came to me, my boss came to me and was like, &#8220;Hey, we need this webpage redesign.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Okay. I don&#8217;t really know what that means, but sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so took on that project, and it was really cool. I kind of got the lead up all the strategy behind it and how we are doing copy and stuff like that. And we didn&#8217;t even have design software, so I did wireframes and PowerPoint.<br>
But it was just a really cool process. And then from there I was like, &#8220;Okay, I think this is what I want to do. I really like UX, and the web, and stuff like that.&#8221; So that&#8217;s how I got into design.</p>
<p>But long story short, didn&#8217;t do really well in school. But kind of picked up that marketing major and then found my way through internships rather than school. My goal for school is just get through it. Graduate so your parents are happy. But yeah, just get through it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I think that speaks to what you alluded to earlier with you were always trying a bunch of new things. And honestly, college is the place to do that. College is all about trying new stuff. There&#8217;s all sorts of clubs, and majors, and things like that. So it sounds like that really helped inform all of this, I don&#8217;t want to say trial and error. Because I don&#8217;t like the misconception that just because something maybe didn&#8217;t work out, that you didn&#8217;t learn something from it. So each of these explorations moved you closer to where you ultimately are now.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
For sure. Definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you feel like your marketing knowledge, how does that help you as a designer now?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
I kind of think about this often, because I always joke, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never used my degree.&#8221; But I definitely think it helps with my thought process behind how I approach design. So definitely from that strategy side of things, a lot of stuff we learned in college was around the strategy, and how you get to a point of determining what the [inaudible 00:28:46] is, and building a business plan, and SWOT analysis, and stuff like that. So I think my time at capital in the marketing side of things definitely helps with that aspect of how I approach and think through design. And I&#8217;ve always really been interested in the strategy side of things. And I think it&#8217;s because of that background that I have.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it sounds like it&#8217;s not just about making it look pretty. Of course you want it to look pretty, but you also have the know-how behind like, &#8220;This is what people are going to gravitate towards. This is what it&#8217;s going to be something that catches someone&#8217;s eye.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Yep, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now you were at StockX for almost two years. What do you remember from that time? What did that time there teach you?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Yes, StockX was great. Yeah, it was a really great place to work at for the time I did. When I first started there, I was pretty young in my career. That was my second full-time job that I had. And so it was really cool because the team, when I first started, it was three of us. My boss Jim Renaud, and then Evan Ames who was the senior designer on the team, and then me.</p>
<p>And it was really cool because I think from the moment I got there, they kind of just trusted me to do what I thought was best, which I was kind of looking for at that point in my career. And so yeah, StockX was really great. It was also just a large team. Our creative team, we had in-house photographers, in-house videographers, art directors that are great, still some of my best friends to this day. And so we just got to do a lot of stuff and got to throw a lot of things at the wall and just be like, &#8220;This is what StockX could be.&#8221;</p>
<p>So yeah, it was really cool. It taught me a lot about just how to build up that story around a design. We had a lot of ideas on what we wanted to do and how StockX could be better. But most of the job was proving that to the higher ups. So we had to do a lot of work around, &#8220;Okay, this is how we&#8217;re going to present this to the CMO and this is how we&#8217;re going to break out these projects.&#8221; And so it was really cool, and I think we got a lot accomplished there.</p>
<p>I worked on a team that was in charge of a lot of the front facing parts of StockX. So the homepage, and the product page, and the searching. And that team, I worked with a couple really great project managers, Leah and Lilly. And it was really cool. We just determined the next five years of StockX, and it was really great working together with them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now you also worked for some agencies as well. Earlier, you mentioned Work &#038; Co, which I said this before we recorded, that Work &#038; Co and Revision Path have a interesting relationship. It goes back a few years. I first became acquainted with them in 2018. I met one of their project managers at XOXO. How long have you been in Portland, by the way?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
It&#8217;ll be two years on Sunday actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So you were there I think after XOXO stopped having live events, because they sort of stopped during the pandemic. But XOXO is like this, I guess the best way I could call it is an internet festival. Even saying it like that sounds weird when you think about the internet now. But it&#8217;s makers, and designers, and developers, and artists. The year that I went, Lizzo performed. It&#8217;s a pretty nice event. I hope they bring it back one day because it&#8217;s actually a lot of fun. But that&#8217;s how I first got acquainted with Work &#038; Co, learned about they have all these international offices. They&#8217;ve even done some pro bono work for the show before. They&#8217;ve been a sponsor before.</p>
<p>Not really sure what&#8217;s happening with Work &#038; Co. I know they&#8217;ve got an office here in Atlanta, which they did ask me to head up. And then that vanished in the thin air, but that&#8217;s a whole other story. I&#8217;m curious for you though, you&#8217;ve worked at Work &#038; Co, you&#8217;ve worked at some other agencies. How were those experiences? Because I would imagine that&#8217;s probably different from a place like StockX, which I guess is more of an e-commerce startup in a way.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely way different from StockX. The first agency I worked at was called Truth Labs. It was in Chicago. And that agency also is extremely different from how Work &#038; Co works. That place, we kind of worked in silos. So one person owned a project, and we were kind of the project manager in a sense, and also the designer. It was a really great experience. My boss Tyson there was amazing, taught me a lot stuff.</p>
<p>But Work &#038; Co is very different from any place I&#8217;ve really worked at. Their whole thing is collaboration, which is something that I hadn&#8217;t had a ton of in my career until I got there. So it was really interesting when I got there. I remember when I first started, the first three or four months, I was like, &#8220;I have no clue what I&#8217;m doing.&#8221; My head was in a whirlwind. And I remember I&#8217;d be working on stuff. It&#8217;s a little challenging when you first start because you do share work every day. So you&#8217;re like, &#8220;I want to share the best stuff every day.&#8221; And then you just kind of get in your head, and things never really turn out the way you want them to.</p>
<p>I remember working on a project and my boss Alex was like, &#8220;We need to talk. What is happening?&#8221; And I was just, &#8220;I don&#8217;t really know what&#8217;s happening here. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on,&#8221; blah, blah, blah. And it wasn&#8217;t because of the company, it was just so different. We just had a really long chat and she was just kind of like, &#8220;We&#8217;re not expecting you to be perfect every day. You just got to kind of show up on your own pace. Obviously we want you to do the work. Don&#8217;t feel that pressure to have to be perfect, and everything has to be whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it was just like I really had to change my thought process around design. And I think for me, my brain is always going. And so that kind of translates into how I think about my work, and how it first comes on a paper. It&#8217;s just once again, me throwing things out there, and seeing what sticks. And working at Work &#038; Co, I really had to simplify my thought process to fit into their mold of how they work, which is interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, you got to unpack that interesting now. You got to unpack that a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean Work &#038; Co does fantastic work. Everyone I work there with is so talented and literally every day I&#8217;d be like, &#8220;How are you doing this?&#8221; They work how they work, and that is it. There is no changing their process. You just have to assimilate into that process. And I think that&#8217;s where some of the friction comes from.</p>
<p>It works really well, and they do really great stuff. So I guess in a sense it&#8217;s like, who am I to change that? So I fell into that, and it was great. I did one of the biggest and best projects in my career there for the PGA TOUR. But yeah, it&#8217;s just really different. You just got to fall in and trust the process there. And for me that was hard to do, and I think is what led me to moving towards being independent.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are all agencies like that? I can&#8217;t say all because you haven&#8217;t worked for all agencies, but you&#8217;ve worked for different types of agencies. Is this an agency thing, this opinionated way of working? Or was that just unique to them?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Honestly, I would say it&#8217;s somewhat unique to them. I do think when I was at Truth Labs, there was a lot more flexibility in how we wanted to structure the project. We worked in weekly sprints, but it was kind of up to you to determine what would be in that sprint, and how you would go about it, and how you present it to the client. Whereas Work &#038; Co&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, we&#8217;re meeting every day. You&#8217;re sharing work every day.&#8221; You&#8217;re not sharing work to the client every day, but you&#8217;re sharing work to the overall team every day. Your reviews what the clients are on this day, this day. We are showing these three directions only. The way we&#8217;re presenting them is very structured. I think it&#8217;s fairly unique to them. I&#8217;ve freelanced for a lot of agencies also, and I think I&#8217;ve always had a little bit more flexibility in how to structure things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s very interesting that you said that&#8217;s what pushed you to becoming independent. Sometimes you have to be in a, we&#8217;ll say less than ideal work situation. We&#8217;ll say that. Sometimes, you have to be in that situation to know what you don&#8217;t want.</p>
<p>And this also plays into what you&#8217;ve mentioned earlier with trying new things. This was another new thing that you tried. Wasn&#8217;t necessarily for you. But it&#8217;s again, pushing you closer to the ideal experience that you want to have, which I&#8217;m guessing right now is you being independent.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Definitely. I really enjoy my time at Work &#038; Co, and I think it was definitely necessary for my career. I learned so much in the year and a half I was there. Honestly crazy. The process does work, if you&#8217;re really willing to adapt to that and fall into that. It&#8217;ll work great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s different. Not for you.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
And they are very product heavy too. And while I love product work, I definitely did want to focus more on brand. That was also part of it for sure.</p>

Got you. Speaking of brands, what trends in brand design do you think are going to be important in the coming years? I feel like we have so much with technology, and AI, and machine learning, and all this stuff. That it seems like creativity in a way, is pushing to be automated. So from your perspective, what do you think the future of brand design&#8217;s going to look like?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
It&#8217;s crazy. It&#8217;s hard to keep up with all this stuff. I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m not falling into the automation craze yet. I mean, you&#8217;ve seen the pictures where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;The generated AI photos,&#8221; and everyone has six and seven fingers on a hand. There&#8217;s work to be done to push us out.</p>
<p>I think Gen Z is going to define a lot of what we see in the future. It seems like they&#8217;re kind of running the world right now, with influencing, and TikTok, and all that stuff. So I think a lot of brands are going to have to pivot to fall in line with that. Obviously, it depends on the brand if you&#8217;re doing B2B stuff that it doesn&#8217;t necessarily matter as much. But I think that&#8217;s going to be definitely big. You&#8217;ve already kind of seen it. Somebody was telling me about, they got rid of Sierra Mist and changed it to some brand. I don&#8217;t even remember what the name is, but-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Starry.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Yeah, Starry. To make it more popular for Gen Z. I think that&#8217;s a big thing. I think minimalism. It&#8217;s already kind of coming back, or it&#8217;s already prevalent a lot. But I think minimalism and really being direct with your brand is going to be really big. And I think a lot of that is rooted in typography, which I love. So yeah, I think that&#8217;s going to be big. But yeah, I think as we move forward, it&#8217;s definitely going to be a lot around how you position yourself in how your brand is showing up to the world. And it kind of goes back into the strategy, and the copy, and the brand voice. That&#8217;s going to be really big.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think we&#8217;re going to start seeing less virtual experiences, and more in-person experiences. And when I say that, I mean of course, I&#8217;d say over the past two years or so, companies were starting to dip their toe into the metaverse. And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;We&#8217;re making these virtual campuses and all,&#8221; all this stuff that nobody was going to. Because it costs $300 to get Meta Quest 2 to join this thing, and you don&#8217;t have any legs, and there&#8217;s only 12 people in here. No one was really going for that.</p>
<p>But I saw brands, I know Taco Bell did this. Where they had a Taco Bell room, a hotel room. And you could I guess spend the night in the room, and it would be all decked out in&#8230; It&#8217;s like a 360 brand experience where Taco Bell&#8217;s everywhere. You get Taco Bell room service. All this sort of stuff.</p>
<p>I see that sort of stuff I think coming more and more. I mean I think that kind of plays to social media and brands and influencers because they&#8217;d probably be the ones that would like all that kind of gaudy stuff. But I see brands starting to create more of these in-person things, especially as folks start to get back out into the world more. These past few years, we&#8217;ve all been in the house, on Zoom, on Teams, on Google Meet, etc. Now people want to get out, but they want to still, I think, be able to do it safely. And I think companies will start to figure out maybe how they can have these sorts of 360 type of experiences that people will gravitate towards.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Definitely. I totally agree with that. You&#8217;re definitely seeing it everywhere. I know in Columbus, it&#8217;s been there for a while. But there&#8217;s a brewery BrewDog in Columbus. And they have a hotel like that too. It&#8217;s like you can take a bath in beer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What?!</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Just a bunch of crazy stuff. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s actually true, but I know the hotel room is very geared towards people who are very heavily into brewing, and the process of beer, and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, bath and beer, that doesn&#8217;t sound good. But I see why people would do it for the novelty.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Yeah, who knows. Might be good for your skin or something.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It could be. It could be. What advice would you give to someone who wants to start out in brand design? What would you tell them? Resources or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
I think throw as much as you can out there and just see what happens. I definitely think it&#8217;s easy to get caught up finding inspiration through other brands and media forms. Like Dribbble, or Pinterest, or whatever. But I think a big part of design is getting out into the world, and finding inspiration by things that are off your screen. So I think that&#8217;s definitely a big thing.</p>
<p>I would say read a lot. I have so much to learn from an art history perspective, because I never had that design school education. So I&#8217;ve been really just trying to learn more about that. So definitely, learning more about the roots and the origins. I think those would be my biggest things.</p>
<p>I never really had a dedicated mentor. But I think that finding someone who you can come back to, and who will be honest with you, and really keep it real with you is definitely important as well. And learn typography. I think that&#8217;s huge. Really learn how to use type. It&#8217;s big.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you make time for joy these days?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
I love sports. I play a lot of basketball. I have been getting back into weightlifting, so I&#8217;ve been doing that a lot recently. I&#8217;ve been getting back into playing golf. I used to play with my dad a lot when I was younger. So trying to get back into that. I love reality TV, because it is easy to watch, and you don&#8217;t have to be invested in it. So I watch a lot of reality TV. I&#8217;ve always watched a ton of reality TV.</p>
<p>I have a ton of plants. Really big into plant life, taking care of plants. And I am really big into things. Anyone who knows me knows I just have a bunch of stuff. My mom, when I was a kid, she would always make fun of me. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;You&#8217;re a pack rat. You don&#8217;t throw anything out. You just keep everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so I have a lot of things. I like to go vintage and antique shopping a lot. So I&#8217;m constantly rearranging the house or rearranging my room, and just trying to find ways to use all these things that I have. Yeah, that&#8217;s probably the biggest. Play a lot of video games, play a lot of Euchre. I&#8217;m always busy. I just try to stay busy at all times.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What video games are you playing?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Recently, I just been playing Call of Duty and 2K, which I know is kind of boring. But I grew up, I really loved RPGs and those open world games when I was younger. So sometimes I&#8217;ll fall deep into that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing Horizon Forbidden West a little bit. I&#8217;ve played Uncharted for probably 10 times. It&#8217;s like my favorite game ever. I used to be really big in Assassin&#8217;s Creed, Red Dead Redemption, stuff like that. I&#8217;ve been trying to get back into Last of Us, but that game makes me mad. It frustrates me. I might just have to watch the show and not-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was going to say, I feel like that&#8217;s popular right now because of the show. People are trying to get back into the game.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Yeah. So yeah, I played halfway through and then I was just like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do this anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So earlier you said when you were giving your advice for people that wanted to get into brand design, you said that they should seek motivation in other things. So what are the things that keep you motivated and inspired?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Honestly, it sounds clich√©. But everything, honestly. My mind is always going. I&#8217;m always thinking about something. Whether it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m working on or something that could be. So I&#8217;ll get random inspiration from anything. The other day, I was driving through Portland, and I saw street sign. It sparked something for the Euchre league that I was doing.</p>
<p>So I definitely draw inspiration from being out in the world. But I would say to get more specific, I get a lot of inspiration from music artists and musicians. I&#8217;ve really been into street wear lately. So a lot of different street wear designers. Mainly Joe Freshgoods. He&#8217;s such a huge inspiration to me, mainly because he does whatever he wants. But there&#8217;s always this story behind why he&#8217;s doing something, which I think is super inspirational. He just does great stuff, and it&#8217;s always for the community and for other people.</p>
<p>So he&#8217;s a big inspiration. I would say I get a lot of inspiration from people who just build things. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be design related. But Mike Smith from Smith &#038; Diction, everything he does is incredible. The way he talks about his work is really great. People from Lichen. They&#8217;re a company in New York, and they do a lot of stuff with furniture and physical items. I think their story is super great.</p>
<p>My friend Alex Tan, he started a studio called Mouthwash. I&#8217;ve actually known Alex. We haven&#8217;t talked in a while, but I&#8217;ve known him since middle school. But he&#8217;s doing really great stuff. He&#8217;s always been super&#8230; I remember in college, we went to the same college. We went to the same church in high school. I remember in college we&#8217;d just be talking and everything he&#8217;d say, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to be here. Go do your own thing.&#8221; He&#8217;s just so smart.</p>
<p>So I think he&#8217;s doing really great stuff. Ryan Putnam also. He&#8217;s a really great fine artist. I think his story&#8217;s really cool of how he does things independently, on his own schedule. So yeah, I mean anything and everyone for sure, I would say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Keeping it real Midwest with Joe Freshgoods.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Yeah. For my Chicago Days.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And Black. Well, I guess people know he&#8217;s a Black designer. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s totally evident from the name, but yeah.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Definitely. Like the Lichen, they&#8217;re both Black designers. Definitely pulling inspiration from everything Black too, I would say, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have a dream project that you&#8217;d love to do one day?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Yeah. So I think in the future, I want to do more things. More physical and more designing spaces. That&#8217;s kind of where I see my career going. So I would love to do an exhibit at a museum. I think that would be awesome. Somewhere where I could do digital design, but also design the space and the physical aspects around it too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always had a weird affinity for doing a large wayfinding project. It sounds boring when you say it. But I think there&#8217;s something beautiful in directions, and telling people where to go, and helping people find their way. So sounds weird, but definitely something like that too. That would be really cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That doesn&#8217;t sound weird. I mean, our icon is a wayfinding sign. So it doesn&#8217;t sound weird at all.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
For sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
This is what I think about every day now, I feel like. So part of the reason 2022 was a really rough year is because I felt I had lost myself a little bit. I didn&#8217;t really know.</p>
<p>I guess I put a lot of purpose of my life into my work. So when I got laid off from my job, I was kind of like, &#8220;What do I do now?&#8221; For a while I was like, &#8220;Maybe I shouldn&#8217;t do design.&#8221; I felt like I was just there. There was nothing really pushing me. 2022 was a big year of self-reflection, and what I really want to do. And when I finally took the leap and was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to be independent. We&#8217;re going to make this work.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s when this, &#8220;What is the future going to be?&#8221; Became a little bit more real.</p>
<p>In the future, I see myself doing less design actually. I think the goal is to make design a part-time type of thing, where I can be really specific about projects I want to take on, and just really specific about what I do, and how I do it, and what I want to do.</p>
<p>And then the other half of that being, I have this vision of making a space. And with that, I haven&#8217;t thought of a name. I haven&#8217;t thought of any of that. But combined with my love of people, I just love being around people. I love helping people. I love bringing people together. So there&#8217;s a love for that. There&#8217;s a love for collecting and having things. I do have a lot of things, but everything kind of has a story behind it of why I love it, and why it&#8217;s in my collection. So there&#8217;s the love for people. There&#8217;s a love for things. And then there&#8217;s also a love for education.</p>
<p>And so I didn&#8217;t do well in college, and I think it was just because I didn&#8217;t have meaning behind why I was in school. I was just there, because I felt like it was something I should do, and I was making my parents proud and stuff like that.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s non-traditional ways to learn what you want to do and who you want to be. And specifically in design, I think I was saying before we got on, us as Black people aren&#8217;t really taught that you can be successful in the arts, or in design, even in music, unless you&#8217;re a huge artist. So I think part of that is me teaching Black people that you can make money doing whatever you want, and you can specifically make money, be successful, be fulfilled in design.</p>
<p>So with all that said, I would love to create a space that could one part be my studio, where I&#8217;m doing that part-time design work, and then the other half being a maker space/art gallery/vintage shop/gathering space. And then it&#8217;d all be centered around blackness, and education, and storytelling, and community. It is a lot, but that&#8217;s sort of where my head is at currently.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I think that&#8217;s super aspirational to make a center for all that positive blackness. I don&#8217;t know how it would go in Portland, but I think it&#8217;s a good idea. I think it&#8217;s a good idea to have something like that.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve had the same thought. At first I was like, &#8220;I need to move back to Detroit to do this.&#8221; And I think Detroit would be a great city for something to happen. I was kind of having these ideas when I was in Detroit. But I&#8217;ve been talking to a lot of people in Portland. I think it would actually be something that would be positive for the Black culture in Portland. It&#8217;s very white here. Everyone knows it. And when I first moved here, I was very thrown back. And even to me as someone who was the only Black person in my high school, I was like, &#8220;What is happening?&#8221; And I remember talking to people and being like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m loving it here. I just moved from the Blackest city in America to here.&#8221; Everyone I was talking to, they were like, &#8220;Well, if you move, then it is going to continue being the whitest city.&#8221; So it&#8217;s like I think there&#8217;s a need for that space to be in Portland.</p>
<p>I think Portland&#8217;s a great city. They embrace art, and they embrace design and community. But you go to all these different spaces, and the same person is everything looks the same. The people who own it are the same. That&#8217;s not a slight to anyone, but the music is the same. And so I think it&#8217;s something that could definitely be beneficial for Portland. We&#8217;ll see. I&#8217;m pretty nomadic though. I like to move around, so I&#8217;m like&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean look, another city something like that could do really good in, Atlanta.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
I need to go to Atlanta more honestly. When I first kind of started my career, the first year of my career was also freelancing. And I was doing a project for a company in Atlanta called Liaison Technologies, and they&#8217;re based in Alpharetta. So I would go to Atlanta every so often, but I haven&#8217;t been since probably 2016. So yeah, I would love to go back, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Well just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Yeah. The best place would probably be my Instagram. It&#8217;s @tesecreates. T-E-S-E creates. There, you can find the link to my portfolio. And I post most of my design stuff on there. My website&#8217;s a little bit of a mess right now, but that&#8217;s also tesecreates.com. So yeah, those would probably be the two best ways.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Matese Fields, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I think the one thing that I got from your story that I think people listening should take with them is that it&#8217;s okay to try a lot of different things. I mean, design is a very vast field. It&#8217;s okay to try different things until you find what it is that works for you.</p>
<p>I mean, when I got into design 20 something years ago, there weren&#8217;t that many paths that you could go. And now, I think even with all the different places you can go, people still just funnel into, &#8220;I&#8217;m only going to do UX. I&#8217;m only going to do product.&#8221; And there&#8217;s so much more out there. And I think what your story really illustrates is that it&#8217;s possible to make a living as a designer, and that you just have to try different things until you find what it is that works for you. Which it sounds like you definitely have made happen. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Matese Fields:</b><br>
Yeah, thank you. Thank you for having me. It&#8217;s been great chatting with you for sure.</p>
