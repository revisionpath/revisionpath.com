Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Well, number one, thank you for having me on, Maurice. My name is George McCalman. I am an artist and creative director based in San Francisco. I live part-time in the Caribbean, the country of Grenada. And I run a design studio, which affords me the privilege of doing a lot of creative things at the same time. And I&#8217;m also a fine and commercial artist, and I&#8217;m often the artist of projects that I am designing and am the creative director on. I do a lot of other things, but that&#8217;s it for right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, first off, happy New Year to you.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Happy New Year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;re recording this right near the start of 2023. How have things been going so far?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been great. I&#8217;m in a very different realm than I was even a few weeks ago. I just had a couple weeks of a break from a book tour that I have been on and a press tour in support of my book Illustrated Black History: Honoring the Iconic and the Unseen. And so I&#8217;ve had a little bit of a reprieve, and so for the first time in many months, I have had the opportunity to really synthesize and make sense of the whirlwind that has come from the second half of this year of this book being out and me going out on a book tour and a national book tour. So I&#8217;ve just been really reflective for the last couple of weeks, and so this conversation is really timed well because I&#8217;ve been just thinking a lot about my experience of being a published author and people interacting with this book and having their responses and what I have learned from their response to this book. It&#8217;s been really incredible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I know you&#8217;re currently recording in Grenada. I would imagine having a Caribbean paradise at the finish line of a book tour is a pretty good motivation.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s actually just a reprieve. I start back on the book tour in February. So this is actually not even the midpoint. I&#8217;m going to be on tour for this book most likely another year just because I feel really passionately that this subject matter should be revered every day of the year and not just localized to a month or a period of time. So I am taking the message of that to the streets.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. When you look back at last year, is there anything that you want to try to change for 2023?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yeah. Expansive. I don&#8217;t know that I would use the word change for myself. It&#8217;s expand. I learned a lot and I was involved in all aspects of the making of this book, which is a really unique place to be. Most authors are not involved with all of the backend, the making and the design and the marketing. And so it&#8217;s been a really comprehensive experience too. And if I would say any adjustment, it would just be more, basically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ll make sure that we have a link to the book in the show notes. Yeah, let&#8217;s dive more into it. Tell me about the book. I think the name is self-explanatory, but tell me more about the book, what was your idea behind it, all of that.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
The book came from the word &#8230; The first sentence of the introduction of this book is I had a curiosity, and that is the very simple truth. I was just curious to know more about black pioneers. And I was just coming to a point where I started realizing that there was an artist inside of me, and so I decided to merge these twin curiosities of, I want to test out the parameters of me as an artist after basically not making art since I graduated from college 20 years before. So I&#8217;m a classically trained artist. I&#8217;m a painter and a drafts person and a sculptor and a photographer. But when I went out into the professional landscape of being a magazine art and creative director, I didn&#8217;t think there was any room for me to be a fine artist. And at the time, there just weren&#8217;t people who looked like me in this realm.</p>
<p>And so I knew that would be a hard road, and I decided to go with the convention of working in the corporate world just to establish myself financially and it was an adult decision. But I came to a point a few years ago where I started realizing that there was more that I was interested in. It felt like there was an ocean that I had not touched. And I decided in a flash of inspiration to make this project my first assignment as an artist. And so I researched and wrote and painted a different black history pioneer every day for a month of February, and it just started ballooning. I think that&#8217;s the right word. It started expanding from there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How did you go about researching and selecting the people to feature in the book? Because as I&#8217;ve looked through the book, I have the book actually, you have a wide range of people that you feature.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I really know that the person that I am personally and professionally has really been framed by my time working at magazines because it&#8217;s basically, I got both military and library training at the same time, if that makes sense. There&#8217;s a rigor to when you are working under deadline, you have to really be sharp, you have to have your focus, you have to know what the context is of what you&#8217;re doing. You have to be really communicative with the people around you. And you have to make sure that what you&#8217;re writing is all the time. And so it really trained me to know some of the shortcuts of researching and trusting my instincts around that. And for me, I was interested in people I didn&#8217;t know that much about. Even if I knew their name, even if I knew some of their story, there&#8217;s always more to learn.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the thing that I&#8217;ve learned in my 15 years as a magazine person before I opened my studio, that even when you think you know everything about a public figure, there is always more. And so it was a trust in the information I was learning, but it was also a trust in myself. And so I was always just looking at the periphery, looking at the fringes, asking myself questions. Who is Edna Lewis? What was Gordon Parks thinking as he was moving through the world? I found myself asking intimate questions to myself of the people I was researching. And so I found myself drawn to aspects of their story, and I was always looking for not just their accomplishments, but their personality. So many of our pioneers were always looking through a contemporary lens, but life was just so much harder then.</p>
<p>And so I can&#8217;t imagine what Gordon Parks&#8217; everyday life was. He was always the representative, and there&#8217;s always a burden placed on black people in America that we have to represent our community. And I can&#8217;t imagine what that was like 50 years ago, what that was like 75 years ago, 150 years ago. How much harder it was to be seen as an individual when your community is always being judged against the majority white community. And so it&#8217;s always this push, it&#8217;s always this burden, it&#8217;s always this pressure. But then you look at these accomplishments and so many of these people, publicly anyway, were really graceful. And so you have to develop this superpower when you&#8217;re out in the world. And I found myself thinking, what did these people have to compromise? What did they have to give up? Who did they have to be to be the people that we know and sometimes take for granted?</p>
<p>I was always looking for the hidden messages of who these people actually were, and that just always sparked my interest. It just made me hungry and curious. And even as I was painting them, I found myself drawn to nuances of personality. Gordon Parks was really charming, and so the portrait that I did of him, there&#8217;s a twinkle in his eye. I was looking to bring out the anger and the jokingness and the sadness and the power and the force. I really wanted to capture human personality in these paintings and really individualize them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Aside from just how poetic that is, that is extremely profound of you as an artist to want to approach it in that way. Even as you mentioned that, I&#8217;m thinking of my personal experience, but I&#8217;d say maybe a couple of years ago, this was right around the summer of 2020, I was doing a lot of research looking at old issues of Ebony Magazine and Jet Magazine from the &#8217;50s and the &#8217;60s. And one thing that stuck out to me that I thought was really interesting, I saw an ad for &#8230; It was some kind of alcohol, maybe gin or something like that. But it was Langston Hughes.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Langston Hughes was selling alcohol. And I don&#8217;t know why that broke my brain for a second because in a way you think of, oh, Langston Hughes, Harlem Renaissance, profound poet. Why is he selling alcohol in Ebony Magazine?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes. We don&#8217;t often think of our pioneers as whole people. People who have made mistakes and people who have had different lives and weren&#8217;t always doing the things that we focus and categorize them in terms of their professional accomplishments. And you start seeing people are just flawed. Every human being is flawed. We have complicated relationships with our icons in that we have to place them on a pedestal to basically show ourselves and to show the larger community how great we are. And so we always have to work harder to show these things. And then when you see Langston Hughes out of context, it&#8217;s confusing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It caused me to pause for a minute. Not so much the why behind it, but it made me think &#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I wouldn&#8217;t think of him as a spokesperson for an alcohol company. I&#8217;m thinking of him as the poet. And not even thinking of like, oh, well, what are the circumstances that brought him to do this? Because I&#8217;m not looking at him being in Ebony in that way as a negative, but it just surprised me to go through the pages and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, Langston Hughes is selling gin.&#8221; It was gin or something. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Because Langston Hughes had to pay his bills too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly. Exactly.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Homie had to pay his bills, and so lots of people did lots of different things to survive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What would you say is the most interesting or surprising thing you learned while doing this research? Aside from what you just mentioned, which I said is extremely profound.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Oh gosh. I learned so many things it&#8217;s hard for me to pull out. If anything, it just broadened my fascination with basically how we think of our cultural figures. Back to your point of the kind of artist I was at the beginning of this process that I was looking to render a kind of wholeness of people. I was just always interested in the emotional language of portraiture and even how we as black people render each other is going through a current renaissance because we have not always &#8230; We haven&#8217;t been given the room and encouragement frankly, to render ourselves. And so I knew it was maverick of me to basically not flatten everyone and not render the same style. That would&#8217;ve been easy for me to do, but I knew that that was not the right thing for me to do for this project. I really wanted to make sure that I was showing the complexity of who these people were and I was also trying to show the humanity and make that as important as the historical details. That I was basically equating the emotional parts with the historical facts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you hope people take away from the book? I mean, aside from buying a copy, what do you want people to take away from it?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Well, I honestly think, Maurice, that we&#8217;re super casual about this subject. Not that we don&#8217;t know how important it is, but at the time that I started this project, I realized that there wasn&#8217;t a book like this and that I wanted people to have it because I thought that we all deserved to have something like this, that we deserve to have this resource. Even though we as black people, we carry our history in our bodies and we have a very particular way of an oral history of passing information down to each other that has survived the ravages of time and racism. This book in and of itself, I didn&#8217;t feel comfortable thinking about it until after the book came out and several people have told me that this book is in and of itself a pioneer. Because we just don&#8217;t have this information accessible in this way. That there wasn&#8217;t a book outside of historical, academic and children&#8217;s categorization, that there wasn&#8217;t an accessible book just to buy and share about American black history. And so that&#8217;s what I want people to know, that this is still a rarefied thing. This is not an everyday thing. This is a pretty amazing resource that we now have. And I made this book for myself as much as for anyone else. I wanted a book like this. And so that&#8217;s partially why I did it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I also love that the typography that&#8217;s in the book for the titles as well as on the cover is from a black typographer.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
There are two black typographers in this book. And because I&#8217;m the designer of the book, I was clear that that aspect had to be represented. That I didn&#8217;t just want to talk about it, I wanted to show it. It was more important that people knew that that sensibility &#8230; There&#8217;s this reductive conversation that came up during 2020 again that was like, where are all the black designers? And I was like, &#8220;Screw you all. There are plenty of us around. You just need to stop being lazy and do your research to find them because we&#8217;re all here.&#8221; And I know tons of black designers, and so that&#8217;s not a thing. There should be more of us, certainly. But this idea that somehow everyone just woke up and started looking for us, I was genuine. I was like, &#8220;Fuck you.&#8221; I wanted to know. The two black typographers, one has been in the game for over 30 years, Joshua Darden, and he has a very successful &#8230; Which he sold a number of years ago.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Darden Studio.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Darden Studio. And the other one is a more recent designer and typographer by the name of Trey Shields. A vocal type. And Trey&#8217;s hook, and it was a hook that he has just expanded beautifully, was to honor the civil rights protest signs and digitize them and make them accessible to everyday people. And so the book is filled with typefaces. There&#8217;re three or four typefaces in this book that both Trey and Josh designed.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Yeah, Trey&#8217;s the homie. I&#8217;ve had him on the show before.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
He&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
He&#8217;s amazing. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit and learn more about you. Learn more about your origin story. Are you originally from Grenada? Is that where you grew up?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes. I was born and raised here. The first decade of my life I lived here, and then my mother and I moved to Brooklyn. I grew up in East Flatbush in a West Indian neighborhood. And all my formal education was in New York. I went to Marine Park in Brooklyn and then Midwood High School, which was a medical science high school. Webster attended Midwood High School. That&#8217;s my one celebrity, useless factoid. And then I went to St. John&#8217;s University and graduated and then started working in the publishing field.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you always have an interest in illustration and design growing up?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Always. I was that kid who drew in the margins of every page of every notebook I&#8217;ve ever had in my entire life. And it was just raw. It just came out. I had no formal training until college, but I was just obsessively drawing. And I drew superheroes and I made up characters and it was all very detailed, and I would just create these worlds and I would be lost in them to the eternal frustration of my mother. And it just came from me. It came from me and it came for me. But I had no encouragement into this world, and I didn&#8217;t know enough of it to realize that I could make a career out of being an artist. I saw no road into it. And so it made sense to me to just walk away from it when I graduated from college.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s talk about college. You mentioned going to St. John&#8217;s University. We had another guest on recently, Sharon Burton, who also told me about her time there. Yeah. What was it like for you?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
My college education was a dysmorphic experience. I didn&#8217;t know what I had until it was in the rear view mirror, as is perfect parable of youth. We have no context to know what it is that we&#8217;re learning until life crashes into you when you have something to compare it to. And for me, I had an education that I was constantly frustrated with because it felt that it was out of step with the cool art schools that were in Manhattan. Number one, I was in Queens, which felt so far removed from the center of the art world, which was Manhattan at the time. And so I&#8217;d go into all these galleries in Manhattan, and I had friends who were at Parsons and SBA and Pratt, and it just felt like I was at this Catholic university that had a tiny fine art and graphic design department, and I just felt like my education sucked.</p>
<p>And it wasn&#8217;t until I graduated school and started working, I realized how amazing my education actually was and how unique it was in the landscape of how people are taught fine art and graphic design. And one of the main things that differentiated my education is that I learned philosophy and theology alongside art history, fine art and graphic design. It was one of the most comprehensive educations I could have received. And it took me a few years to realize that I was actually ahead of the curve and I&#8217;m actually really happy that I did not go to a more prototypical fine arts school. I got a fantastic education at St. John&#8217;s.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. How&#8217;s that saying go? Hindsight is 2020?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
It sure is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve heard that personally because I didn&#8217;t even study design. I went to a liberal arts private college. I went to Morehouse. And I initially went there because I wanted to &#8230; And this was late &#8217;90s, early 2000s. Because I wanted to be a web designer. I had started learning HTML in high school. I taught myself HTML in high school and learned Photoshop. I designed my high school&#8217;s yearbook and the paper, and I really wanted to go into it but the scholarships that I got weren&#8217;t for art school. I actually never even applied to an art school. And then I got to Morehouse, majored in computer science. And in my mind I&#8217;m thinking, oh, well, it&#8217;s all the same, right? It&#8217;s all computers and design. It&#8217;s all the same. And I quickly realized after the first semester, it was not. I switched my major to math, which is what I got my degree in. But I know what you mean about looking back at the education and seeing how it served you versus the time that you&#8217;re there and you have this comparison on what your peers are doing, on what others are doing or what you think they&#8217;re doing that you feel like you should be getting at that formative stage.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So after you graduated, you talk about going and becoming an art director. Did you go right into that right after you graduated?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I did. It&#8217;s pretty common now, but it was a little more unconventional back then. This was the mid &#8217;90s. St. John&#8217;s had a internship requirement that your final year of school was spent in the field the entire semester as if you worked. And so the entire semester, I ended up having three options. I remember being going to interview at these three distinctly different locations, and it was kind of a sliding doors. And even then I knew that I was basically deciding my path with these three. One was an ad agency, one was a magazine, and the other was a small boutique design firm. And I remember being confused about which direction I was going to go in. I really did not know. And I walked into the Office of Money magazine, which is where I ended up interning. There was just a vitality. The office was a newsroom and there were people walking around and talking and gossiping and stuff being put up, and I could see layouts, and it just felt alive. It felt like an organism. And in my early 20s, I was just kind of like, yes, I think this is the environment that I need to be in. And I didn&#8217;t know anything about magazine design at that point, but it just felt like I needed to be there. And so I said yes to it, and I think it was one of my first really adult decisions.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s really interesting that senior year you got to have that choice. That&#8217;s something that I know that a lot of students now don&#8217;t get. They don&#8217;t get to see the working world-</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
They really don&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Before they graduate like that.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
They don&#8217;t. Yeah. Because I teach also. I&#8217;m a professor of graphic design. And one of the big issues I have &#8230; And it&#8217;s not an easy problem to solve. I am critical of it while knowing that I don&#8217;t have the answers myself. One of the fallacies of school is that it doesn&#8217;t really prepare you for the real world. It&#8217;s like one of the last bastions of this purity of education. And it often is counter to how the process of the professional world runs. I quickly learned when I started Money Magazine that there was no graphic design class I had that prepared me for how the magazine world worked and how the design process actually worked. I realized how luxurious school is. It&#8217;s a place where you can sit and think and talk and show your work, and there&#8217;s no real disruption. There are no real crises. There&#8217;s nothing for you to solve outside of the assignment that has been given to you that you have months to ponder and to ruminate on.</p>
<p>And so the idea of instinct is just absent in the school diaspora. And so when I teach now, I teach differently than I learned, and I try to infuse as much of a real life sensibility. The other issue with schools is that a lot of people who teach don&#8217;t practice. And so you have a completely different and often very dissonant where the education is rigorous and it is really valid, but it is outside of basically the professional norms of how you would actually solve problems. But then the people who are in the field don&#8217;t have time to teach because they&#8217;re working. And even for me, teaching was a really difficult thing for me to do with the entrenched deadlines of my studio process. And so I understand that it is a very difficult thing to do. I recently took part in a review of students at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard a few weeks ago at the end of the semester in December.</p>
<p>And this was an active conversation that I was one of six jurors, and we were all in different strata of the professional world, and we were really debating and having this conversation about how what best serves the students. If you&#8217;re only learning from people who are not practicing, I&#8217;m sorry, the education is only so valuable. But then if you&#8217;re only learning from people in the field, you don&#8217;t learn what being spacious in your thinking and being intellectual and being academic, you don&#8217;t learn the value of that in the design process also. And so the answer seems to be a balance between the two, but that is not always the case depending on where the school is and at what stage the professors are and where the students are. So it&#8217;s a very complicated metric to figure out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting you say that because I&#8217;ve certainly encountered that even with some &#8230; Honestly, some schools that have interacted with Provision Path in different ways. You name a top design school in this country, they&#8217;ve reached out to me in some capacity about the show. Which is great. They like what the show is about. It&#8217;s filling a gap in their curriculum in some way that they&#8217;re not. But then if it comes down to me lecturing or teaching or something, it always seems to boil down to the fact that I don&#8217;t have a design degree. That they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, but &#8230;&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, stop wasting my time.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Stop wasting my time. And those kind of rules and terms don&#8217;t really serve anyone anymore. I mean, just the landscape has changed and design, because of technology, is just so accessible. And I know lots of brilliant designers who did not go to art school, and I don&#8217;t believe that you need to have a design degree to be brilliant at what you do. There are lots of people who have defied the convention of formal education and produced really entrancing, relevant, resonant work. And to me, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about. And so I don&#8217;t subscribe to this hierarchy of academia. I mean 30 years ago it was used to be exclusive and keep a lot of people out, and that was seen as a value, but I don&#8217;t think it serves anyone right now. Culture has changed and education has changed. And because of technology, everything is just more accessible. And so it&#8217;s really about what you are doing with the technology. It has nothing to do with did you go to school or not? That&#8217;s just such a reductive argument.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I agree. I agree. This actually is making me think of a question that I do want to explore more on the show this year. And since you&#8217;re one of the first guests on this year, I&#8217;ll ask you. I&#8217;m curious what you think about the future of the art and design industry and how it&#8217;s going to be impacted by technology. I think we&#8217;ve seen in at least the past year, maybe two years, talk about web three and NFTs and most recently AI generated art and things like that. How do you think these industries are going to be impacted by tech?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I think it already has been. What we call entrepreneurship is actually just hustlers. That&#8217;s what technology has given us. It&#8217;s given smart hustlers who are pulling and stretching and tweaking and bending the rigidity of so many of our institutions and our disciplines. The word I use a lot is it has expanded the notion of what design is, who it&#8217;s for, who it&#8217;s not for. And technology has brought so many things to people who would not otherwise have them. It just brings an aspect of the world to your doorstep. Technology for me, because I grew up outside of it and I was an adult &#8230; People who were born into technology, that&#8217;s what they know. That&#8217;s the real world. To me, it&#8217;s not the real world. It&#8217;s an aspect of the real world. And so I think of social media as tools.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think of it as real life. I think it&#8217;s a facsimile of real life. And so the language of how I talk about it has given me clarity in that I&#8217;m not confused about its place in my life. I started learning graphic design before we got our computer labs. And so I had two years of playing with typography, playing with a lot of the conventions of what is now basically archivable materials because nobody does it that way anymore. But because I learned design with my hands, that is how I continue to interface with it. I still draw out everything I do first. And that dexterity, frankly, has made me a better designer. I don&#8217;t rely on technology as a starting point for anything that I design. I bring it in to help move the process forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Good answer. I like that. You started talking about tech and that question just popped into my mind to ask you about that. But to go back to your career as an art director, you have a very storied history as an art director for several magazines. You mentioned Money Magazine, but you&#8217;ve also been an art director at Entertainment Weekly, at Mother Jones, at ReadyMade, just to name a few. When you look back at that time being a director for all these magazines, what stands out to you the most?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I can&#8217;t give just a simple answer. I can give a collective answer. Because I learned a lot. I learned a lot of things. And I don&#8217;t think in terms of best or worse because I think life is too complex for that. But what I did learn was agency. The word agency. Meaning that I am not stuck when I don&#8217;t know how to solve a problem. That there are ways and there are many paths to telling a story, and there&#8217;s no one way to do anything. And depending on the context of what you&#8217;re doing, I learned how to be a better communicator. Because when you&#8217;re working with a lot of people who are reliant on you, you learn that you are a cog in a wheel, but that your role, nobody else working with you has that. So everyone is really important to the process at different times.</p>
<p>And so you learn the economy of collaboration. That collaboration can be a really beautiful thing. And that there&#8217;s an excitement when you are working with people who are really good at what they do and that want to tell stories as well as possible. And that telling stories is one of the most unique aspects of being a human being. And that that is basically how we thrive and survive as people. We share information and we share stories with each other. And that&#8217;s where I learned that. I&#8217;m not sure I would answer this question in this way if I hadn&#8217;t worked at magazines. And I utilize magazines also to learn. And I did. I used them for two things within myself. To learn the process of what I was doing. And I moved around a lot.</p>
<p>I never worked at a magazine more than two years because I always wanted to learn what I was doing through a different landscape. There are lots of people that get a job and stay there for decades. I am someone who I learn what I need to learn and then I move on. I have always been that way. And so for me, it was what can I learn about the subject matter? I learned about the financial world, honestly, working in Money Magazine. I learned about the inner workings of celebrity culture, working at Entertainment Weekly. I learned about the wellness world at Health Magazine. I learned about technology working at Wired, working at ReadyMade, working at Afar. I really immerse myself in the subject matter to learn more about how these stories focused on this particular field. What was the combination, what was the metrics, what was the engineering of the subject matter? And so I was always kind of process nerd, if that makes sense. And that&#8217;s what I was always looking for. And with magazines, the process can become repetitive because you&#8217;re doing the same combination of things. And so the first year I was learning about the magazine and the second year I was learning about the subject matter. And then like clockwork, I&#8217;d come to the end of the two years and I&#8217;d move on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, was this sense of agency the inspiration behind you starting your studio?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes. I reached a point where I realized I wasn&#8217;t learning anything more. I wasn&#8217;t learning anything new. And I had all these skills that I wanted to apply in a different way. And it was working at ReadyMade that gave me the inspiration to open up my own studio, which was the second to last corporate magazine job that I had. And ReadyMade was a magazine about do-it-yourself design. It&#8217;s basically recycling. What we now call upcycling. It&#8217;s taking something that is at the end of its road as it&#8217;s being used and refashioning it for something else where it has an entirely new shelf life and you can use those things. And it was really just clever. It was just really clever design solutions. It&#8217;s taking cloths and making a kite out of it, or taking old jeans and turning it into place mats. Just stuff like that that is seen as quaint now, but was really at the vanguard of this recycling movement that is just more every day and more common.</p>
<p>It was recycling before recycling, even in California, was as ubiquitous as it is now. And I got to work with a lot of makers. People who just made things and who were just passionately, quietly &#8230; And not starting businesses, but just people who were making things for their own edification, for their homes. And I was honestly just really inspired. And I was just kind of like, oh, I know a lot of people who are working for themselves. And when I started thinking about it, I would talk to friends and contemporaries and professional acquaintances and everyone said, &#8220;Do it, do it. Do it. When you work for yourself, you will never go back to the corporate world.&#8221; And they were right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are the best types of clients for you to work with?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
It has both changed and remained the same. My interest is in culture. The identity of culture. And so I have coined a phrase just internally in my professional world that I am interested in culture clients. And in the early days it was &#8230; I live in San Francisco, so there are lots of artisans. There are people who are making small batches of things. There are restaurant owners. I was always working with clients who were working for themselves and needed help with the language and the messaging around branding. And so I worked with restaurants and I designed products and chocolates and tea, but I was really kind of more comprehensive. It was less me coming in to just design a package and it was basically working on the whole branding from the logo to the identity to the strategy to the messaging to the website, just the whole thing. And I realized that I was drawing on my editorial background to tell the whole story.</p>
<p>And so it expanded to &#8230; I started working with the tech world and then quickly stopped. Because I realized that they &#8230; I remember having a meeting with Uber. This was like 10 years ago. I was working with TripAdvisor and Uber. And these are big names, big clients at the time. I can tell you, TripAdvisor, I consulted with them for almost two years. They didn&#8217;t know how to assign photography. And so I worked with them comprehensively working with a photo editor to basically get them a library of photographers, come up with a system of rate assignments. Just basically the basics that one of the largest companies in the travel world had no awareness of. With Uber, it was they had been focused on the service for so long and they were starting to atrophy some of their customers because there was no story. There was nothing.</p>
<p>And the people who started Uber did not think that that was important until suddenly it was. And I remember having a meeting with them where I was like, &#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re just taking my ideas. I&#8217;m just here speaking to them.&#8221; And I was like, I don&#8217;t trust this field. I don&#8217;t want to have my intellectual property just ripped off and I&#8217;m not on the inside, so they&#8217;re not going to value what I&#8217;m doing. They&#8217;re going to treat me like a vendor, and I&#8217;m not anyone&#8217;s vendor. And I was really clear about my value to myself. And so I stopped working with the tech world for a few years and really just focused more on the one-on-one. And I worked with larger companies, but it was still where I had direct access to the founders and the CEOs so that I could thread continuity between what I was doing. I didn&#8217;t want to work with any intermediary people, so I had to be conscious of the scale that I was working in just to make sure that the projects didn&#8217;t get away from me. And I was also clear with myself that I wanted to keep my studio small, because I wanted to keep it manageable and basically control and frame the quality of the work that I was doing. I didn&#8217;t want to be embarrassed by anything that I was doing if it got too corporate.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I like that idea of culture clients because yeah, working with tech companies, they will just relegate you to vendor status and-</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
And they will just steal your shit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, they&#8217;ll steal it.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
No compunction about it. And it&#8217;s the people who don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing that want to steal your shit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I know in my instance, when I have worked with tech clients, it felt like &#8230; Or at least I entered into it thinking it would be more of a partnership. We would maybe bounce ideas off of each other or things like this. And in some instances, they just wanted to just cut the check, which I mean, look, I&#8217;ll take your money. I don&#8217;t have a problem with that. But I was really thinking that it would be more based on how the initial conversations went, why you sought me out, et cetera. And then it just ends up not being that. They just want to have it to be a bullet point on a DEI presentation.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
It is rarely that. And this is even before DEI so there was no representative of that. And that was the other reason. That I was often the only black person. And I was like, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want to do this.&#8221; I left publishing because I was tired of being the only black person. And for me, the tech industry has just become the new media publishing industry. I can see the corollaries and a lot of the people, a lot of my contemporaries have gone over and taken our playbook into the tech world. I mean, Apple very much has snapped up a lot of the most prominent magazine editorial art directors in the field in the United States. And so many of their campaigns, I&#8217;m looking and I can see the editorial strata of how these stories are shot and presented. It&#8217;s all going in that direction. And it should, because it&#8217;s the best form of storytelling. Advertising as a medium, as a typical form, I think is not very good at storytelling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, they are not. In addition to the work that you do through your studio, and you alluded to this earlier in the interview, you&#8217;re a columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle. How did that come about?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Well, it came about the year that I started the original 29 day project of Illustrated Black History. I tell you, Maurice, it was just a year where I just lost my mind and just began drawing and painting obsessively, just everything. I was just manic for it. And it was like it had been bottled up and it all just came out. And so that year I took a sabbatical, which means that I stopped taking on work. And when I tell you that I had no money, I mean I had no money. I was just living off of my savings. It was a really reckless thing to do, and I&#8217;m a pretty cautious person. And I knew that it was the right thing because it just came so easily to me. I fired all my clients and just started everything from scratch. And so I gave myself the time to do that, and I was also trying to figure out how to make a living with it.</p>
<p>And so I ended up doing a series. A series of series. And that is also a playbook from my magazine days. You tell a story in multiple images, threading a narrative and a continuity from beginning, middle to end. And so I did several series on my family, on Illustrated Black History, and then I started documenting the visual identity of San Francisco. And I was really fascinated by the human ecosystem of the Bay Area. And I&#8217;d been working on another series about how the tech industry started in the Bay Area and how it could not really have started anywhere else and just all of these threads were coming together. And I had this epiphany one day where I knew that I wanted to do a culture column on the makeup, on the genetic makeup of San Francisco and the Bay Area.</p>
<p>And I had been inspired by a morbid thing. It was when Bill Cunningham, who used to be a columnist for the New York Times, and he was a style photographer and he documented black style in Brooklyn and Harlem, and he equated black style with high fashion, which is something the fashion industry did not do and still does not do, even though they think they do. I was just like, &#8220;Oh, I think this is what I should do.&#8221; And I remember writing a pitch and deciding whether I was going to send it to the New York Times or the San Francisco Chronicle. And because of my magazine background, I outlined everything to myself and I wrote a pro and con list about the San Francisco Chronicle versus the New York Times and how much creative freedom I was going to have. And the whole idea for the column was that I would be writing, illustrating and designing this column, documenting various events that gave you a larger sense of what the Bay Area was all about and what made it unique and special and also frustrating and just all of the things that just brought all the complexities in.</p>
<p>And I sent that to the woman who became my editor, and she wrote back immediately and she said, &#8220;This is brilliant. We&#8217;re going to do this.&#8221; And I remember thinking at the time, &#8220;Holy shit. I didn&#8217;t think she&#8217;d respond this quickly, and now I have to do this on a monthly basis.&#8221; And it was one of the best experiences I&#8217;ve ever had. I would go out to cultural events several nights a week, and I just became this man about town for years. And I would show up as a reporter with my notebook and my pens, and sometimes I would live draw and sometimes I would draw later on and I just drew this column every month and designed it for the style section of the Chronicle, and I did that for years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. When it comes to work between what you do in your studio and what you do for the newspaper, is your approach different for each one?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I work in parallel lines, as I&#8217;m sure my answers are starting to illustrate. I&#8217;m always on the inside and outside of what I do, and I&#8217;m looking at both sides of it at the same time. And I think I developed that skill as a magazine person because there&#8217;s not just the story that you&#8217;re working on, it&#8217;s the process of how the story is being made that is as important as the story that you&#8217;re making. And as a designer, you are at the intersection of words and images, and so you&#8217;re never just looking at one aspect of anything. And it has just expanded my brain, I think, where now I can&#8217;t help but think of everything through this parallel thread of thinking. And so in terms of making this column for years, I knew that I was training myself to do basically all aspects of what I was doing.</p>
<p>I was always an art director, so I would have been the designer of the column, but I would&#8217;ve been working with a writer and working with an illustrator. But in combining all of those skills, I was sharpening my capabilities, but I was also training myself for this kind of repetitive monthly grind where it just became less of a grind. I remember the first year I was just stressed out all the time, and then suddenly it settled and it was not a stress anymore. And the column used to take me several days to do. And towards the end of that initial run, it would take me 24 hours to do the whole thing. And it just became a little more fine tuned. I really was able to pace myself. I knew what I needed to do. I knew what I needed to accomplish. And so you just anticipate what you need and then you do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you say your artistic style has evolved over the years?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
To answer your previous question, I do &#8230; And I&#8217;m answering both at the same time. I think I have developed a way of backing into the style. I often don&#8217;t know what style I&#8217;m going to do when I start something, and this book is evidence of that. I really just feel my way into what I was doing. The original column had a lot of different styles, but I basically invented a newspaper style because I wanted it to be stylized. I had to do things quickly, it had to be out of a economy of time. So I developed a shortcut of illustrating that for the longest time my contemporaries thought was my style. And then when I started working on the book, even close friends were like, &#8220;Oh, this is totally different from what you have been doing with the Chronicle.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I was like, &#8220;Yeah, this book is actually what my work is actually.&#8221; But I&#8217;ve been doing this shorter version of it for a while and it has just become what I&#8217;ve been known for. But the truth is I tend to start from scratch every single time, and I do it in my design world and whether I&#8217;m designing something, whether I am illustrating it, fine art, it is a brand new thing every time I&#8217;m sitting to do it, even if I&#8217;ve done it before. And so I&#8217;m considering all of the layers. I was like, what is best going to serve this story? Is it something that&#8217;s in pencil? Is it something that is in paint? Is it typography? I just think freshly about everything that I&#8217;m doing, and I throw out what has come before. I honor what has come before, but I don&#8217;t get stuck in the nostalgia of what I&#8217;m doing. I will throw everything out and start it up again if I think that that is the right thing to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the people that have really helped motivate and inspire you over the years?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
There are so many hidden figures in my life. The truth is, it&#8217;s not a lot of artists. The artists who inspire my work are not contemporary artists. They&#8217;re people that I grew up admiring. And where I find my inspiration is not really in other people, it&#8217;s in nature. The natural world really provides a lot of my motivation. But in terms of the people who have inspired they&#8217;re close family friends, they&#8217;re people I consider mentors in my life that have just always been many times the last few years where I&#8217;ve just admitted to my internal community, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing. I&#8217;m just literally making this up. And there have been many times, there were many times that first year of launching out as an artist where there wasn&#8217;t a month that went by that I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think this is going to work. I think I need to stop doing this. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to figure out how to make a living. I don&#8217;t think this is working.&#8221;</p>
<p>And no one person would let me do that. Everyone was just like, &#8220;Nope, nope, nope. Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.&#8221; And I&#8217;m grateful for that because that the first year I was absolutely flabbergasted how I was going to make this thing work. And I could see the talent and I could see that there was something there, but how all the pieces fit together in terms of continuity and financial stability, I didn&#8217;t see it. And then I got the column and the column I didn&#8217;t give the context for. I started six months after I started being an artist. And that was the first light bulb where I was like, oh, I think I know how to package this work.</p>
<p>And then I started getting more assignments and then it just picked up from there. And there were many stages of the process where something else would happen and I&#8217;d think, &#8220;Oh, okay, yes, that&#8217;s how this fits in.&#8221; And, &#8220;Oh, right. And then I can do that.&#8221; And then when I got my book deal, I realized that my column had been training me to do this book and that I had certainly designed lots of books, but this was the first time that I was all things and that I&#8217;d been doing a version of that for the last few years. And so I had been prepping myself for this larger project that I think it would&#8217;ve been much harder to do if I had not been doing it. So I just started seeing how all the pieces were fitting together.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you appreciate the most about your life right now?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
That I get to do what I love. I am happy. I am as happy as a pig in shit. I feel really fortunate that I am passionately in love with the creative world that I&#8217;ve given myself. I get to work with all of the things and the skills that I&#8217;ve been given. And there&#8217;s so much I&#8217;ve learned over the years that I get to relearn and apply in a different way. And I&#8217;ve learned that I get bored really easily and I&#8217;m not bored by anything that I do right now, which tells me that I&#8217;m doing the right thing. Learning is an absolute essential part of what I do, and I place myself on the ground floor of everything that I do because I see myself as a student also. And so I remain energized by what I do. I have a genuine love of what I get to do on a daily basis.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing? What kind of projects do you want to work on? Where do you see yourself in the near future?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I have to say I&#8217;m already doing what I see myself doing in another five years. I&#8217;m going to be making a lot of books. I&#8217;m designing a lot of books. I am making a lot of books. My next book is actually on the publishing industry. And I&#8217;m also starting to expand into three-dimensional spaces. I&#8217;m finishing up my first stint as an exhibition designer. I&#8217;m designing a museum show that is premiering in another few weeks in California and it&#8217;s a major show for a major artist by the name of Mike Henderson, as a black artist who is having a renaissance right now and he requested a black designer specifically. And the cultural aspects of design is something I&#8217;m really keyed to and always representing the black perspective so the people know that design is not neutral. I went to school and grew up hearing this fallacy that design is objective and neutral, and I know that it is not.</p>
<p>And so I teach in that way, I design in that way, I educate in that way, I work in that way. And so I just see more three-dimensional spaces. I see designing interiors, I see designing fully comprehensive experiences where you can see the two dimensionality of the design process in terms of type and art on the walls, but also the three dimensional aspect. The mood and the tone and the feeling of what you should be feeling, of what the average person can walk into a space and experience. That is what I&#8217;m going to be doing a lot of in coming days and weeks and years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, your work, the book? Of course, we&#8217;ll put the book in the show notes, but where can people find out more information about you if they want to follow you?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Well, the book itself, the book was published in late September of 2022, so it is everywhere. And the book, I&#8217;m really happy to share, has gone into its second printing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you so much. The response has just been &#8230; It has been a very emotional few months as people &#8230; Because you make a thing as you know as a designer, but then you don&#8217;t really know how people are going to respond to it. And so I have just been amazed and rendered mute many times by the messages that I&#8217;ve received and the responses of the people that I&#8217;ve met out on the tour. And so this book is everywhere. You can get it at any bookstore, anywhere, all over the country. Of course, I always tell people to support their independent bookstores, so if you are buying it, you don&#8217;t have to buy it from the devil, Amazon. There are lots of local bookstores that would love to have your support. And as far as just my social media feed, all of it is the same, whether on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. It is McCalman.co. M-C-C-A-L-M-A-N-C-O, McCalman.co.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, George McCalman, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show for-</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Thank you so much. Thank you, Maurice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. One, for just sharing your story of how you come into art and really studied it and then going on as an art director, but then also the process of the book. And I think to me, what is probably most important about this conversation is how you&#8217;ve taken that flame of creativity and found a way to really expand it out as far as you can into as many different places as possible. Like you&#8217;re teaching, you&#8217;re doing client work, you&#8217;ve got the book, you&#8217;re a columnist, and now I feel like this expansion into 3D space, even as you mentioned, definitely seems like the inevitable next step for where you&#8217;re going. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Your questions were incredibly thoughtful. I&#8217;m really grateful for your interest in talking to me, and thank you. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m going to say. Thank you so much.</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Hey, first, thank you for having me, Maurice. Really been digging the platform since I&#8217;ve been introduced to it. Once again, thank you for having me, man. My name is Chris Charles. I am a photographer, creative director, designer. I just try to bundle it all up into&#8230; As a creative designer or art director.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. How are things going so far? I know it&#8217;s just the start of the new year, but how are things going for you?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, so far so good. I was very intentional about taking some time off leading into the new year, so I can kind of rest a little bit, spend time with family. So, thankful I have been able to get that time in and spend time with the kids and the fam. But yeah, so far so good. It&#8217;s kind of taken me a day or so to still get into the flow again of work, and consistently checking emails and communicating again. But yeah, I&#8217;m ready to get it popping.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I told myself this year that I&#8217;m going to start turning my phone off one day of the week. So I&#8217;ll turn it off Saturday night, turn it back on Monday morning. And I tried that, actually, a few days ago, just so people know we&#8217;re recording this at the top of the year, but I did it over New Years. It was so peaceful. That Sunday was so extremely peaceful. Monday was super productive, and it was so peaceful that I didn&#8217;t remember to turn my phone on until Monday afternoon or evening. And I turned it on, and I mean the flood of notifications. People were like, &#8220;Are you all right? Is everything&#8230;&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m fine. I just turned my phone off for 36 hours.&#8221; It&#8217;s good, the world can wait.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
You are much better than me. So I have measures implemented to where my phone isn&#8217;t as invasive as I know people who have all the alerts on, the lock screen thing. And so what I&#8217;ve done is I turned off notifications on my lock screen, the one that kills the battery. I keep my phone on silent with the exception of a few key numbers; my mom, my partner, my daughter, people who they will need to get to me just in case something happens. Other than that&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know if I can just turn my phone off. I think for me, it&#8217;s easier to just have it readily available so people can reach me in the event that they have an emergency. But kudos to you, man. I don&#8217;t know how you did it, but you did it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s an experiment. I just tried it once. So we&#8217;ll see if it sticks.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I&#8217;d have to send a mass email or text message to everyone to let them know, hey, I&#8217;m out the loop. I&#8217;m not communicating for X amount of time, so don&#8217;t expect a response but in the event of emergency, call this other number. I have to have an emergency contact person in place just for that, but.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I might end up doing that too because certainly I turned my phone back on, and I guess the way that my phone is set up too, I can get text messages on my computer, I can get some notifications, but it just wasn&#8217;t on my phone. And so I still was able to do some things, I just couldn&#8217;t or didn&#8217;t respond back to people right away and stuff. But let&#8217;s just say I&#8217;m paying for that today. I&#8217;m having to do a lot of catch up today.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, a long day of responding to folks, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But that Sunday was so peaceful. I was like, I&#8217;m doing this again. I can&#8217;t stress how no pings or nothing. That whole Sunday, I cooked breakfast, I listened to some jazz, I was chill all Sunday. I&#8217;m like, I want that feeling every week. I&#8217;m going to try to see if I can stick to it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I think you can do it. I think you can do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at last year, what do you want to change bringing into this year? You mentioned taking some time for rest.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m part Jamaican so I don&#8217;t know any other thing than to work all the time. Running my business but also working another job across town, and I just left that job before the new year, just because it just didn&#8217;t make sense commuting that far several times a week. But yeah, I think for me, working smarter not harder for 2023. I think 2022&#8230; And most of my career, I spent a lot of it doing all of the heavy lifting. I&#8217;ve had assistants in the past who helped manage communications and emails and I&#8217;ve worked with tons of young artists who volunteer their time, and some I&#8217;ve actually mentored and was able to get them going with their businesses. But I think it&#8217;s time to build a team. And I think it&#8217;s time to start delegating versus me being the lead communicator, the lead invoice generator and the lead key artist on set and then the key editor. Time is so much more important to me, I&#8217;m realizing, especially now that I have a young baby, six months old.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow. Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you, thank you. His name is Cerulean Amir, and he&#8217;s amazing. But yeah, I think moving into 2023 I definitely want to facilitate me being more present, and the way these knees are set up, doing all the squatting and getting all the angles, I would rather be able to guide that process through other people who are under the umbrella of my business.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hear you.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the goal.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s talk more about your work in your studio, Chris Charles Co., which you&#8217;ve ran now for 15 years, so congratulations on that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me a little bit more about it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So, ultimately, and this kind of plays into the vision for this year and moving forward. I&#8217;ve always kind of been a multidisciplinary artist, I mean with roots in obviously photography, design, music. I produce music as well. I&#8217;ve worked with a few artists and I&#8217;ve always felt that the three words that I&#8217;ve used to encompass my business are style, creativity and soul. And for me, that&#8217;s kind of the type of person when it comes to aesthetic that I always wanted to be. Even when I was a kid, I just wanted to be cool. And that being influenced by music and jazz and seeing how cool those people were.</p>
<p>I always wanted to have whatever business I ran encompass those kind of things. Just like a cool energy, a cool vibe, some fly music going on, some fly art, whatever it is. So yeah, I think my business, while I also focused on trying to strive to be technically proficient, but it was also about creating a vibe or a feeling to the point where whatever I put out in the universe via the internet, it&#8217;s a reflection of those three things, style, creativity and soul. So I&#8217;ve just kind of ran with it and it seems to have helped me find my voice over these years. So that&#8217;s pretty much&#8230; Be it design, photography, music, show-making, those are the things that I&#8217;ve really pushed to have come to the forefront.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So given all of that, what are the best types of clients for you to work with? I know you mentioned musicians, but are there other types of clients that you find you work best with?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Honestly, I work just other artists in general. DJs, musicians, visual artists. I&#8217;ve worked with other photographers doing portraits and collaborating with them, painters and also high-level business people. For some reason, it&#8217;s more like a, wow, this person is amazing. I could learn so much from them, and they hired me to do this work. You know what I mean? So it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s feeding my desire to learn more and have goals based off of what I&#8217;m seeing this person has done, and I&#8217;m actually doing what I love to do while learning. So yeah, I would say anyone in the arts, like I said, high-level business people. I&#8217;ve worked with district court judges, I&#8217;ve worked with mayors, mayoral candidates, city council people, attorneys, high-end real estate folks, and all of these people have great lessons that I can pull from to use at some point in my business. So this is great. I love that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So given that variety, how do you approach creating a new project or working on a new design project? Because I would imagine with each of those types of clients, the setup might be a little different, I&#8217;m guessing.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah. One thing I used to struggle with&#8230; Well, I won&#8217;t say I struggled with it, but one thing I had to really understand was find a way to maintain whatever vision or artistic integrity I had while still fulfilling my clients&#8217; needs. And sometimes those things don&#8217;t always align, and I&#8217;ve had to adapt and adjust in order to facilitate my client being happy and just doing the work. But yeah, I think for me, I just like to assume that people who have hired me, it&#8217;s not like sight unseen. They&#8217;ve seen examples of my work and they&#8217;ve seen&#8230; Or other people who I&#8217;ve worked with and they&#8217;re like, hey, I want that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve had some clients who have no&#8230; Whatever I do, whatever they want was the opposite. So that I think has been a big challenge over the years. But ultimately, it&#8217;s just about adapting and adjusting, interjecting those three things, style, creativity and soul while still keeping whatever format my client wants to maintain their brand and push their image forward. So it&#8217;s a lot of, I&#8217;d say, adjustment. I don&#8217;t want to say shape-shifting, but it&#8217;s more like a, yeah, I can do this, but I can still slide some of these elements that I always kind of hearken to for this person.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like that&#8217;s a common thing with multidisciplinary folks. It&#8217;s like we know that we can do a lot of different things, and sometimes the client is aware of that and sometimes they just want the one thing that they want, but it is a lot of adjusting to try to make sure you&#8217;re fitting in with the scope of the project, their involvement in terms of how things are going. It is a lot of&#8230; It&#8217;s a constant adjustment, I find.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, it is. And I don&#8217;t know, I think by nature, just based off of my travels, even as a child I&#8217;ve always been very adaptable, but I&#8217;ve always tried to stick to a certain thing that, okay, well I&#8217;m going to do this but I&#8217;m going to do it this way. And it kind of made me a rebel. When I say that, I mean I&#8217;ll follow the rules but up to a certain point that I&#8217;m just going to just do it this other way because I think it&#8217;s more efficient. I kind of relate that to working with clients and just adapting. And yeah, I hear what you&#8217;re saying. I know you want the logo with the money, the dollar signs raining and all of that, but maybe we can simplify it a little bit. Here, let me show you this. So I found using examples of other brands within that person&#8217;s market helps kind of dial those things in for me too, so I don&#8217;t have to really have too much conflict.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you handle the business side of everything? Because the work definitely is the creative part. That&#8217;s what you specialize in. But, when it comes to marketing and contracts and finance, how do you balance that with the more creative aspects of your work?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It took me a while to actually find a rhythm with managing all the things outside of the art and creating, but eventually I was able to figure out a way to say, for example, automate my booking process so I don&#8217;t have to have these conversations and these email threads that just lead to dead ends. Usually if someone clicks and books, they&#8217;ve already made their mind that they want book me. So that saved me so much time. I&#8217;d also, say, having an assistant, I had a really great assistant and then she moved on to greater things. But I really learned to appreciate how&#8230; For one, she was really good at what she does, and she actually is based in Atlanta, so she was working virtually. But that type of communication, I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;m a horrible communicator, but sometimes I&#8217;m too busy out working to communicate in a timely manner.</p>
<p>And having someone who that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re doing for me made it so much easier. But other than that, it&#8217;s just kind of trial and error. It&#8217;s like, hey, I&#8217;ve gone through so many phases with trying this invoicing system or trying this business bank account to see that works in payment gateways and figuring out the most seamless, easiest way for a customer to pay a deposit and then book it online without having to have conversation, after conversation, after conversation. So yeah, it&#8217;s been a journey. It&#8217;s definitely been a journey, but I&#8217;ve been able to figure it out just based off of trial and error and kind of doing what works, but also evolving, being open to evolve. There&#8217;s a few things I want to add into the mix this year. Definitely want to get someone to do the actual books and have an accountant, or someone who I can contract to have to do the accounting. Because I&#8217;m pretty much doing it all of that myself as well, so.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now outside of that, being in the arts and being self-employed, that&#8217;s a lot to balance, I think particularly with just the way that our attention economy kind of works. What are some of the biggest challenges that you&#8217;ve had to face staying independent and doing this for as long as you have?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Dealing with the economy. I think managing&#8230; Be sustainable, which is every business during economic downturns, and that&#8217;s another challenge. I&#8217;d say just dealing with the ebb and flow. My business is a cash flow-based business, and most businesses that, but fortunately I don&#8217;t have much overhead, so that makes it a lot easier. I&#8217;m not producing a physical product that requires me to buy inventory and surplus. So that in itself has really helped me manage the challenges of an economic downturn and keeping clients and being able to have clients who just keep coming back. And some of my best clients are those repeat clients. But ultimately also over-saturation. Over-saturation. When I started doing photography professionally, there were just maybe a handful of really, really great photographers in my area who I looked upon for inspiration, and I saw they had things established. They did great work.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now, it&#8217;s like you can just close your eyes and point your finger one direction, and you&#8217;re probably pointing at a photographer. You know what I mean? So staying relevant, being open to new ideas is kind of, like a lot of artists, I think specifically more with musicians and kind of trying to grow their art and their craft while still maintaining that voice that put them on in the first place. So for me, I don&#8217;t want to look at it as competition. However, it is somewhat of a competition. This is a free market. So if I want to be competitive in this market, I have to pay attention to what other people who are 20 years younger than me are doing. And if I have a client and suddenly I see my client shooting with this 20-something year old, I&#8217;m like, oh okay, great. Yay. But also, I&#8217;m like, huh, how&#8217;d that happen? What do I need to do to where I can keep this particular client or clients? So yeah, it&#8217;s a few challenges.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know when I was actively having clients and doing client work, one of the biggest challenges, aside from what you mentioned, is just making sure that they still keep you sort of top of mind with what they do. Because I think, like you said, there&#8217;s over-saturation sometimes in the market and there&#8217;s a number of different people that folks could choose from to do kind of the same work. And so I think it&#8217;s really important also to just have those relationships. The relationship building part is so important with so many other people out there, because the benefit I think that we have, you and I, and probably others of our age group, is being able to build those relationships as opposed to just putting out whatever the newest, hottest, latest, fastest tool or product is that can get the job done.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it&#8217;s about relationships. You mentioned one of the clients you&#8217;ve had has been a mayoral candidate. I did a mayoral race back in 2009. The person didn&#8217;t win, the candidate didn&#8217;t win, but she ended up working then for a nonprofit organization and I had that organization a retainer for five or six years. And then every place that she ended up going, I kind of followed her in some aspect in terms of like, oh yeah, I could do this work, I could do this work. Or just keeping top of mind so they know, oh, well I know someone who could use you. So then that relationship building really comes into play because your name gets mentioned in rooms and other places that you&#8217;re not necessarily available.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Exactly, exactly. And yeah, I think I&#8217;ve definitely been fortunate to have had several of those types of clients where I&#8217;m talking about 10, and you mentioned the foreign exchange. It&#8217;s almost like 10 years we&#8217;ve been working together. And then of course, with Nikolai individually and with Phonte individually, it&#8217;s been like I&#8217;ve been their go-to guy, and I appreciate that. I have some clients who, once again, are in the political scene and some musicians who, there&#8217;s no question they will call me, and I don&#8217;t take that for granted. But also it&#8217;s because we can sit down and kick it after we do a long shoot. We go grab some food, we have a couple of beers, and we kick it for a little while and just decompress and catch up. I value that.</p>
<p>Because to me, that&#8217;s connection. And for me, especially when it comes to doing portrait work and photographing people, it&#8217;s important that I established that rapport, which could potentially lead to a cool relationship and friendship. But I can&#8217;t get a good picture of someone if we&#8217;re doing a session, if we haven&#8217;t had a conversation that kind of face-to-face, and that way we can feel each other out. I can see where I need to go, how I need to handle this particular photo shoot. Yeah, I&#8217;ve been able to, like I said, make some really great, great friends because of that relationship aspect that you mentioned.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I just started back doing some client work through my studio now, and one thing I&#8217;ve been doing is going back through my old contact list of clients. And the first of the year, best time to do it, best time to restart a dormant relationship or a dormant former communication. Just hit them up, Happy New Year, how are things going? This is what I&#8217;m doing. Because people just kind of have that energy at the top of the year to want to do something new, try something new. So it&#8217;s a good time now to make those relationships happen or to try to at least begin to forge them.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Absolutely. Yeah. Just before Christmas, I sent out some tests, newsletters with some things just to see, once again, updating that client list and seeing do I need to remove or add some things and change and seeing the response and looking at the numbers. So yeah, you nailed it, man. Definitely going to be doing the same this year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to get more into your work and some of the clients that you work with. Of course, you mentioned foreign exchange, which we&#8217;ll talk about later, but I want to hear more about your origin story. I know you&#8217;re in North Carolina now. Is that where you&#8217;re from? Is that where you grew up?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
No, I actually grew up in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. ell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Spent my formative years in Brooklyn, but also going back and forth between Brooklyn and Jamaica. We usually go every summer, or every other summer. And Brooklyn is a melting pot of West Indian and Caribbean culture, anyway. So yeah, growing up in New York was such a great experience for me. I think I tell people I grew up, I think in during the best era to grow up, which was the late &#8217;70s going into the &#8217;80s. Because once again, I literally would&#8217;ve had a Irish neighbor across the street. Their neighbor was Italian, who was my first babysitter. We had a Puerto Rican family on the corner. We had the Haitian family right there. You had my family, which was a mixed ethnicity. You had people from Aruba, people from Barbados. It was such a melting pot of culture. So I was exposed to a lot of different languages and a lot of different foods and energies. And thankfully, my parents and I, we traveled.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d get on a plane and go somewhere, go to LA, go to Jamaica, and my dad had family in Pennsylvania, so we&#8217;d be in the mountains. Just being in that type of environment or those types of environments where I&#8217;m surrounded by so many different things, it influenced me and grew up in a very musical household and very artistic household. And I played guitar, took formal guitar lessons for years, and my household was the type of household that always had music playing, be it jazz or reggae music. So my parents loved to dance. We do the New Year&#8217;s Eve party at our Puerto Rican friends&#8217; home, and they&#8217;d be dancing salsa all night. So I just love music and culture. So, I couldn&#8217;t help but be influenced by all of that growing up during that time in New York. So went to high school, did that. Played football in high school, actually. So I wound up going to college initially at a Kentucky Wesley College with a partial scholarship to play football. And that was a disaster because that was my kind of first time away from home.</p>
<p>Being in Kentucky as a New York dude was kind of different for me. I made it through football camp, and I was like yeah, I&#8217;m not feeling this, and I went back home. So I had to regroup, and my parents were looking at me like, okay, so what are we going to do? You can&#8217;t just be laying around here. You know what I mean? You got to do something. So I said, okay. Always loved architecture, always loved art and clean lines and drafting. I took drafting in high school, so I pursued a degree in architectural engineering, the New York Institute of Technology in Farmingdale, it&#8217;s a [inaudible 00:24:32] entity, and that was great. But I also have a military family. All my uncles were in the military. My dad was a Marine, my brother was in the army, and that&#8217;s also something I always knew I wanted to do. I was a boy scout and I loved wearing a uniform. I was one weird kids who just loved putting on a uniform and being fresh. So yeah, I did college and then immediately joined the Army.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So this is, what, &#8217;93, &#8217;94. And wound up getting a job doing surveying, but it was for artillery. So I kind of got hoodwinked. I kind of got made switch with you have engineering background. Yeah, this could be a great job for you. But I&#8217;m sitting next to a [inaudible 00:25:18] blowing up stuff, you know what I mean? But ultimately, it was good. I had a good time, did a couple of overseas tours, and I made sergeant. And so now I had to manage a team, and that kind of taught me leadership and politics when it came to, not just the military, but corporate, I came to find out later.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s where corporate gets it from, so that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Structures, politics of it all. They parallel each other. So anyway, I decided maybe I want to change jobs. So in the military, they have what you can do as reclassifying. So I reclassified as a communication specialist, and more specifically a network switchboard engineer. So like an internet guy, basically. And that was great because it basically helped me transition out of the military eventually with those same skillset sets. And I was able to apply them. But meanwhile, I was also a paratrooper, so I was jumping out of airplanes and went to jump master school. So I was jump master qualified. I was aero [inaudible 00:26:16] qualified.</p>
<p>So I was propelling out of helicopter, jumping out of airplanes, doing all the cool stuff, even though I had these technical jobs, because that was kind of that guy who just wanted to do the hard stuff as much as possible while I still had the young legs. So yeah, eventually 2003, after my last deployment in Iraq&#8230; Well, 2004 is when I began&#8230; I came back, I think April, and put in my paperwork to get out the military because I just felt it was time. My daughter was very young at the time. She&#8217;s 21 now. But I just didn&#8217;t want to be away from her and missing her grow and potentially not being able to see her again, not making it back from the deployment is very real.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Especially right around that time in the early 2000s. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah. 2003, 2004, maybe going in 2005, &#8217;06 was a rough one because the warfare over there with the IEDs&#8230; And it was really bad at one point. And I was there for that when you never knew if you were going to get blown up in a convo at some point. And that hit me. That was real, that was real to me. I said I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m a smart guy, I think I&#8217;ll be able to figure something out, especially with the skillsets that I gained in the military. And that&#8217;s what I did. So I got out of the military in November, 2004, and haven&#8217;t looked back since. I transitioned almost immediately into a corporate IT job.</p>
<p>And that was great. I did that for about five years. And then 2009, the 2008, the bubble burst and the economy tanked, and I wound up getting laid off. So here I am, had a corporate job, great benefits, great pay, and now I got laid off. Never happened to me before. I didn&#8217;t know what that felt like. And it was horrible being called into the operation manager&#8217;s office with all of us who got laid off. It wasn&#8217;t just myself, walking back to your desk and you see all your stuff packed up in a box on the table with a security guy waiting to walk you out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It was embarrassing. You feel powerless, you just feel like, wow, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing? Wound up getting laid off. And I had to really, really sit on it for a minute. And then I realized that was a universe kind of pushing me in the direction of becoming an artist full-time. Now keep in mind, when I was working at this particular company, I became good friends with the art director there, and he knew I was kind of dabbling in photography, and he invited me to drive to Boston to shoot a wedding because I guess he&#8217;d seen some of the work I was doing just for free. And he thought I had an eye. So he took me, and that was the first paid gig I ever had as a photographer shooting that wedding. And that&#8217;s when also the light bulb clicked.</p>
<p>Was kind of already getting over the job, it was very stressful as far as just the IT and networking, dealing with clients, having to take the blame for other people&#8217;s mistakes or whatever. So when he says, hey man, I&#8217;m going to cut you a check for $1500, just drive to Boston in my Audi. I was like, oh shit. Okay, let&#8217;s go. Hey, maybe I can just keep doing this. And then a few months later, I wound up getting laid off. So it was all serendipitous how it happened, even though I wasn&#8217;t seeing that at the time. But it definitely helped guide me into the direction I kind of eventually went. So I took my GI bill and took a little bit of time off. Because I did get a bit of a pension, not a pension, but a severance day. So I was able to survive and pay my bills, but eventually enrolled back into college and wound up getting a degree in graphic design while slowly building my business and getting to know the community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So that was a very big transformative time for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And in hindsight, like you said, it worked out in the end. Something I want to just touch on, you mentioned though that time between, I would say roughly the mid 2000s, 2004 to 2008, 2009, that was such a&#8230; And I can&#8217;t stress this enough for designers that were not around during that time. That was such a wild time in terms of just design, I guess you could lump tech in with it, but particularly web design, graphic design. So many things were changing in that just five-year span that you were lucky if you could stay at the same place for that long because the technology was changing, the browsers were changing, the actual hardware itself was changing, the software was changing. There were so many changes that took place that it would be hard to keep up with everything that&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. And I don&#8217;t know, for me I think what helped me was being in school&#8230; And at the time I was still using Windows, for example, but we had iMac Labs where I was able to kind of&#8230; I was like, oh, this is nice. Okay, cool, cool, cool. But not only the technology, but I guess you said the design language, right? Like I said, I loved architecture, I loved clean lines. I loved a certain minimalist aesthetic. And I started noticing design shifting to that versus heavy drop shadow and beveled fonts. And a lot of overly-designed things that have, and I attribute that to Apple, actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I think Apple&#8217;s brand pretty much influenced the design world when it came to aesthetic and minimalism. Being able to be able to sell something and tell a story as cleanly as simply as possible and maybe using really great imagery overlay with text. So that whole look&#8230; Like when I started seeing that and I realized that that&#8217;s kind of how I love that, that&#8217;s what it was for me. So it made my transition fairly easy. Because I just wanted to stick to that aesthetic. It was just, like you said, learning the technology and learning in Design and Illustrator and all those things. I was pretty good in Photoshop already. But those other Adobe products, they were kicking my butt for a while. But I think I got a handle of them now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember the macro media stuff when it switched over to Adobe. I used Fireworks a lot in one of my old jobs. And then Fireworks pretty much became obsolete. Adobe bought Macromedia and changed a bunch of stuff over. And then I was a web designer at the time. There was the whole switch from table-based layouts to CSS-based layouts. Which then changed the browser because the browser then was less about just display and it became more of a canvas. It became more of somewhere you can create things just on there and not have to transpose. I remember cutting up tables in Dream Weaver and exporting them over and making sure everything was right. But now you could use CSS and you could float things and create divs&#8230;</p>
<p>And it was just such a big shift&#8230; It was a really seismic shift, I think, in design online during that time. And yeah, also the switch from the nineties style of design, especially with tables and things like that because they borrowed a lot from print, to more clean lines. Because it&#8217;s just based on what the browser did, because the browsers then had to catch up. This is after the whole browser wars of the late &#8217;90s and stuff. But browsers became less about, oh, this is just a place you can view a website. It&#8217;s like, no, this is a place where you can build a website. There&#8217;s technologies, there&#8217;s like a stack in the browser where you can make things. It was just such a&#8230; I look back at that time fondly, but also in hindsight, there was a lot going on.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t think&#8230; for me, I wasn&#8217;t aware of it at the time. I was just like, oh, okay. This is cool. Oh, this is&#8230; Okay, cool. This is cool. That&#8217;s cool. I even look at&#8230; I use Photoshop a lot, for example, and I look at Photoshop from back then to now and how much I can do that I really couldn&#8217;t do without having to download a plugin or something. And the same thing with everything in the Adobe Suite. I was using Premiere for a while and I just couldn&#8217;t, didn&#8217;t jive with me. So even now transitioning over to Da Vinci Resolve has been like, my head explodes every time I use it. So it&#8217;s so phenomenal. And it doesn&#8217;t bog down my CPU. I don&#8217;t have to open up a whole nother program to do as much. I can do it all in here. I can do audio the same time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
This is awesome. For 300 bucks, I don&#8217;t have to do a subscription, a yearly subscription. I [inaudible 00:34:48] with it. So I&#8217;m just really thankful for it. I love technology, so I&#8217;m thankful for technology. I&#8217;m kind of a computer nerd. I was as a kid, backtracking real quick, I used to write programs on the old&#8230; Gosh, it wasn&#8217;t an IBM computer. It was a Commodore.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, the Commodore 64?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. Definitely showing our age. Because that one [inaudible 00:35:12]. Yeah, I&#8217;d go to the library and rent and take out these coding books and you&#8217;d spend three hours writing code just to make the colors on the screen. And that was fascinating to me. Just learning syntax. And anyway, so it helped me, even in corporate. When I was working in corporate, I had to&#8230; The company I was working for, it was a proprietary voiceover IP network, one of the first in the country. So I would have to be able to trace a call from London to California, and I could literally look at the numbers on the screen and see the nodes as the signal is&#8230; Well, the communication is traveling and seeing where it breaks. And that always remind me of when I was a kid. Wow, this looks just like when I was programming my Commodore 64. But yeah, I&#8217;m just nerding out a little bit on the tech. But it&#8217;s a great timing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it was. Even visually with&#8230; Flash was just everywhere. Flash was such a huge component of creating experiences online. And now in 2023, really years prior to that, I&#8217;d say probably as early as maybe 2020 or so, Flash is just a distant memory.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
During that transitional phase when I was going to school, I actually gig doing graphic design and marketing for a local recording studio. And I had to do Flash. And I was like, what the hell is this? I&#8217;d never really had much experience with Flash and I thought it was kind of an antiquated technology, even back then. But they insisted on using it for their banner ads and whatever. But me being at that job was also a big turning point for me because of just where I was. And then being around musicians and kind of transitioning into connecting with artists who needed photography and design. You know what I mean? So yeah, that was a good time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s bring it back to your studio, then. So you had that spark to start your studio then after doing that photography gig, you&#8217;ve kept it going now for 15 years, and your client list is extremely impressive. Just some of a few, I&#8217;ll name off here. Moleskine, which are the notebooks, the Italian leather notebooks, Apple Music, Spike Lee. And of course, musicians, The Foreign Exchange. They&#8217;re one of my absolute favorite groups. I&#8217;ve been a fan since Connected. I&#8217;ve been such a fan. This is complete fanboy moment at this point. How did you get involved with them?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of a funny story. So back in late 2009, I was kind of slowly making a name for myself as a photographer. I&#8217;m a music nerd, and I was dating someone at the time, time who knew Phonte.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Actually, I think they dated years before she and I met. But anyway I was also on&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if you remember the Okayplayer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, I remember them.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I was on Okayplayer, and I go into the, what do they call it, the rooms or whatever, the chat rooms, I guess, and just nerd out on music. And at the time that&#8217;s pretty much how the product exchange met on Okayplayer. And they recorded their whole album by just sending tracks and vocals across the ocean, because Nicolay was in the Netherlands at the time, living there. So anyway, so it was cool being able to connect with these artists like Little Brother and Questlove, and kind of just being involved in conversations and casts happen about music. And the person I was dating at the time would randomly post my photography into the forums. Like hey, my boyfriend did this picture, blah, blah, blah. And apparently Phonte was paying attention. So one winter, like I said, I think late 2009, we went to a gig.</p>
<p>It was a Red Bull event, and it was a battle of the bands featuring The Foreign Exchange and a punk rock band. And it was brilliant because what they had to do was play each other&#8217;s music and interpreted however they saw fit based off of the genre. Right? So it was cool hearing The Foreign Exchange&#8217;s band, which was amazing, playing these compositions that the punk rock band made. And then vice versa, you know what I mean? Really good time. Of course, I brought my camera, took some really cool photos of the bands. And then as we were leaving, I hear someone calling me and it&#8217;s Phonte. He and I had never met, but he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey man, you Chris Charles? I saw you coming you up here. We got a new album coming out, man.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Word? Okay. Hit me up, man.&#8221; And that was it. That was the beginning of that relationship. I just loved the process. So I worked with almost all the artists under the, not just The Foreign Exchange, but their record label.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So Median when he was on the label, just finished working with, well last year, last summer. BeMyFiasco, who is Phonte&#8217;s prot√©g√©, musically. And yeah, pretty much have done every project after Leave It All Behind.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So did all the photography, the design. Think the first one was Love in Flying Colors. That was the one. And yeah, did all the pre-flight, the layout, the photography, excuse me, and then yeah, all the way up to their last one. So it&#8217;s been a great journey with those guys. And we just did a photo shoot a few months ago, actually. Because they have some things that they&#8217;re going to be doing here. So it was good reconnecting with those guys again. But yeah, it was just, once again, those types of circumstances that the relationship building aspect of it is what&#8217;s important. And we&#8217;ve always had a great relationship. Really great guys. So yeah, those guys are cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m trying to think how I first found out&#8230; I think I found out about Foreign Exchange either through&#8230; It was one or two ways. One, there&#8217;s a music store here in Atlanta called Moods Music.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, I know it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, Darryl.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a hot spot, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s the spot. That&#8217;s the spot. I&#8217;m gatekeeping a little bit now that I&#8217;ve told the whole world on the podcast, but that&#8217;s the spot though. That&#8217;s the hot music spot in Atlanta. But I either found out about them. It was either through there or through this website that a couple of friends of mine founded called SoulBounce. I can&#8217;t remember if it was through one of the two. It was one of those two that I remember first hearing about it, because like I said, I&#8217;ve been listening. I&#8217;ve been a fan since Connected. Leave It All Behind, still gets rotation in this house to this day. &#8220;House of Cards,&#8221; oh my god, love that group. And even all the other stuff that Phonte did. I know Phonte and Zo! did this &#8217;80s cover album. That was really good.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It was Percy Miracle, and I forget the other name. But yeah, Phonte had the Jerry Curl wig on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, they did Stepping Out. They did Africa from Toto. Yeah. That was&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Those guys are so talented, man. Even now with&#8230; What&#8217;s that show? I know Zo! and Phonte been writing a lot for this new kind of musical skit comedy show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, is it Sherman&#8217;s Showcase?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Sherman&#8217;s Showcase, yes. And then of course, I designed the Eric Robeson Phonte record, Tigallerro. I did Phonte&#8217;s last single. Any visuals that came out pretty much revolving around the phone exchange or Nicolay&#8217;s or Phonte individual projects, I also had the privilege of working on. So, such a good time, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, man. I think of all that. You mentioned Eric Roberson and now I&#8217;m thinking of all the soul music that was also just kind of in and around during that time. That was such a&#8230; When I think on that time, that was late 2000s early 2010s. That was such, for me, that was just such a pivotal time. I think I was just turning 30 right around then, too. I was like, oh man. Such good music. And that&#8217;s so cool that you were just a part of all of that. And you get to work on it all. Do all that stuff.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It&#8217;s still surreal. It&#8217;s still surreal. Whenever I see&#8230; When President Obama had one of their songs on his yearly playlist, I&#8217;m like, what? I&#8217;m looking at a photograph and design I did and now President Obama saw that, word? I mean, that&#8217;s cool. It&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Can you give me a sneak peek on whether or not they have a new album coming out?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I&#8217;m sworn to secrecy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. All right.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s just say we did a&#8230;.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You mentioned a photo shoot, I thought I would ask.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m sorry, that&#8217;s all I can say. But yeah, stay tuned, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;re talking about Foreign Exchange and Phonte too, but Nicolay is super talented as producer. I have some of his solo albums, too. One of them&#8230; I forget what it&#8217;s called. Something with Shibuya in it, I&#8217;m not remembering&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, no. The City Lights. City Lights Volume II. Oh man. That&#8217;s one of my favorite, favorite just chill out albums. One of the songs on there is&#8230; I forget the&#8230; I have to go back and remember the name. Because I know the song when I hear it, I can&#8217;t necessarily think of the name of it, but it&#8217;s like some song. I don&#8217;t know. I call it my getting home from the club song. When you get home super late and the sun&#8217;s about to Rise, it&#8217;s like that kind of song.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I forget the name of it. But they&#8217;re all super talented. That whole clique is super talented</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
And super nice. Whenever I get to catch up with Nicolay. The guy&#8217;s really, really smart. He has a degree in musicology. He&#8217;s not just like self-taught. He&#8217;s really formally trained, but also humble and tall. The guy&#8217;s like seven feet tall. He&#8217;s like about six foot seven. He&#8217;s huge. But just the nicest guy. Same thing with City of Lights Volume too. Those guys are always gracious whenever we connect. What&#8217;s another one I did? Not the Shibuya one. I did the next one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Soweto.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yes. I did the graphics for that one as well, as well for [inaudible 00:45:08].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve been lucky, man. I&#8217;ve been lucky.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you do to stay motivated and productive with your work?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Just constantly evolving, actually, as far as what I do. For me, sometimes it&#8217;s just if I&#8217;m editing photos, I run into a creative block with where to go with a certain edit. I&#8217;ll put it down and I&#8217;ll step away and indulge in another media, be it a short film or looking at some art books that I have. But I know for me, staying inspired revolved around kind of exploring the balance between what&#8217;s in my head and what I see that catches my eye out in the world. And also music. A lot of my photography and design, I feel it&#8217;s so connected to musical energy. And at least to me, I always like to think of a song whenever I present a certain edit or if I do a print.</p>
<p>So for me, sometimes I&#8217;ll be inspired by music, or if I&#8217;m producing music and coming up with a theme and a rhythm, and I&#8217;ll start to see colors and I&#8217;ll start to say, oh, okay, maybe I think that&#8217;s rare. Then I go back to the edit and it&#8217;s like yeah, I add that touch of red to it. So, it varies. But mostly I&#8217;d say music and using contrasting mediums to kind of offset each other. So if I&#8217;m doing design, I&#8217;ll stop and do some photography or look at photography. If I&#8217;m doing photography, I&#8217;ll listen to music. It&#8217;s weird. I kind of traverse these different medium when I need inspiration from something else, from another place. So yeah, that&#8217;s one of the ways I use medium.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you say your artistic style has evolved over the years?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
When I first started doing photography, especially when I was in design school, I was implementing design elements within my photography a lot. And it was just how I saw things. I would do a portrait and find a creative way to add text to it or add texture to it using overlays. I think as I&#8217;ve evolved as an artist, I think my style has&#8230; It&#8217;s gotten a lot simpler. So I&#8217;ve simplified it. I&#8217;ve been able to deconstruct it in a way that there might be some texture, or I&#8217;ll just use a textured backdrop or a textured setting, versus actually adding the texture in post.</p>
<p>But also just kind of continuing to try to master fighting in the technical aspects of photography. And then getting into filmmaking and learning that technology and learning how to edit and just being a one-stop shop. Because I just love all those mediums, so why not learn how to do them? And then eventually that became another aspect of my business. So I think expanding, going from this photography, to design and photography, to dabbling in web design. And then, oh, short films, and then doing promo spots for clients and doing commercials for schools and things of that nature. So yeah, learning new technology is pretty much how I think I&#8217;ll be evolved over the years, specifically</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Overall, is there a piece of art or a specific project or something that you&#8217;ve done that you&#8217;re particularly proud of? Like the crown jewel in your portfolio, or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
There are a couple, actually. I think most recently I got commissioned by a really amazing local candle making company, Black-owned, to design a signature candle to be distributed through the NBA, the NBA 75th Anniversary candle series. And they gave me full autonomy to design it within the specs of the candle. And with that, I was given access to seeing what the candle kind of smelled like, and taking hints from the notes of the candle and then implementing that into the design. That to me was very exciting, very exciting. And for that to be connected to the NBA was just mind-blowing. I&#8217;d say another one is probably the Spike Lee project that between&#8230; It was joint project between Spike Lee and Moleskine where they were doing these cheap, got-to-have-it books, Moleskine books. So that&#8217;s where that connection happened.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh!</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I was able to connect with Spike Lee and his team and come up with a&#8230; I had to shoot a short film of a local artist, a Black woman artist who embodied the whole image, the vibe of Nola Darling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nola Darling, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It was cool because Spike Lee, huge inspiration for me. One of my favorite movies is near all of them, but I say from an aesthetic standpoint, [inaudible 00:49:37] blues, the way he used colors and contrasting colors to point out personality differences, and music and jazz. I think another fun time was shooting Martin Lawrence and his daughters&#8217; graduation party. And that was interesting and totally random. One of actually, it so happened that his daughter, her hairdresser was my client. They needed a photographer. And she graduated from Duke University. And I&#8217;ll never forget this, this was Mother&#8217;s Day a few years ago. And I remember going to brunch with my mom and then having to leave and drive to Duke University to their private banquet thing, golf club. And I&#8217;m looking at Martin Lawrence and his family. Oh, and Emmett Smith. Because they&#8217;re all connected. Emmett Smith, who&#8217;s one of my favorite running backs of all times for the NFL is Martin&#8217;s ex-wife&#8217;s new husband.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m looking at Martin Lawrence and his family, the kids, Emmett Smith, and I&#8217;m just there to take pictures and you&#8217;re paying me to do this. Are you kidding me? It&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s living the dream. So yeah, I&#8217;ve had some really amazing&#8230; Gosh, I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s times like these, and I&#8217;m thankful for you to these great questions because it really makes me think about&#8230; For one, if there was any time where I didn&#8217;t, or if any people didn&#8217;t respect the craft of image-making, be it photography or design, and the times that I&#8217;ve doubted it as well. Like oh yeah, people don&#8217;t take this stuff seriously. But then one day I&#8217;m in Venice Italy, because I was commissioned to be there by a client. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s like, wow, I said that but I&#8217;m actually overseas right now, and my whole job is to just be cool and take fly pictures. So yeah, I&#8217;ve had a few instances of really amazing experiences and being in rooms and work and opportunities. So yeah, I have a few, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying, I just can&#8217;t pick one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think once again, all of that really speaks to the power of relationships.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It really speaks to being able to know who, not just know who certain people are, but to maintain those relationships enough where people are advocates or sponsors for you in places where you&#8217;re not available. Especially with what you just mentioned with shooting Martin Lawrence&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s graduation, like you said her hairdresser is one of your clients, and so that&#8217;s how that all happened. They could have picked any photographer. Martin&#8217;s a celebrity. They could have picked any photographer.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
What&#8217;s so funny about that, she just called me randomly and she was like, &#8220;Hey, I got a gig for you. Just say yes.&#8221; I was like, what? She wouldn&#8217;t tell me who it was until the day before. She was like, oh, by the way, this is the Lawrence family and Smith family. Like, &#8220;Lawrence who?&#8221; [inaudible 00:52:29] I was like, oh, okay. Yeah. Relationships, knowing people and doing good work in this treating well manner.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And the Spike Lee Moleskine, I have the Spike Lee Moleskine. It&#8217;s still in the plastic. I refuse to open it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Oh, nice. Yeah, that&#8217;s definitely a collectors&#8217; item. Definitely a collectors&#8217; item.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve had a few people on the show that have done work with Spike, either presently or in the past and stuff. It&#8217;s amazing how he pulls in other Black designers to work on his projects, whether it&#8217;s like Art Sims doing projects, whether it&#8217;s you on this notebook project. I think most recently he did some work with this black typographer I had on the show, Tre Seals for his book, like design the font for the book and everything. Spike is really good about pulling in other Black creatives into his work, which I really appreciate that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
And I honestly believe, I think it should be like that. It&#8217;s always great to see and I always appreciate it. But how else are we going to continue to spread and learn about each other&#8217;s talents without actually giving each other shots and [inaudible 00:53:34] opportunities?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I love to see it. Love to see it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice do you have for aspiring creative directors or artists out there, particularly those that want to be self-employed like you are and be able to kind of forge their own path?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;d say do your homework. And when I say that it&#8217;s great to go out with passion and present it, but you have to have a plan. And that could be, do you want to be a generalist? This could be applied to a couple of different mediums, of course. But yeah, do I want to be a specialist? Do I want to be a generalist? I&#8217;ve gone back and forth between that as well. For me, it&#8217;s about also diversifying, right? I don&#8217;t just solely rely on photography or I don&#8217;t just solely rely on consulting or design, or filmmaking. It&#8217;s about building a brand based on those three words. Like I said, style, creativity, and soul. And thinking about how you want your clients to feel when they work with you and after they&#8217;re done working with you, and will that make them want to work with you again? So it&#8217;s like a lot of soft skill stuff. I mean, of course, being technically skilled and talented, those are all great things, but if people don&#8217;t like you, you&#8217;re not going to go very far.</p>
<p>So I think learning how to maintain or establish and maintain relationships with people who align with the vision that you want to sell your artwork to, present your work to, and being able to manage that and navigate that and be in spaces and present yourself well, I think that&#8217;s really important. And then also, of course, the more technical stuff about managing business, establishing an LLC, your contracts, delivering, over-delivering at times, under-promising versus the vice versa. Because people will call you out. You said we were going to get 30 pictures, you only delivered 29. It&#8217;s like, oh, okay. Gotcha. But if I say I&#8217;m delivering 15 and I deliver 30, guess what? Now I&#8217;m a rockstar. And a lot of creatives take that for granted. And I also understand that there&#8217;s time and money involved with creating and running a business. So be mindful of that. Don&#8217;t kill yourself. Rest. Take your time to step away from it and reevaluate, reassess, learn, and then ask for mentorship from people who are already doing it that are in the game.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing, like future stuff or continuation of what you&#8217;re currently on? Where do you see yourself?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, ultimately five years&#8230; It&#8217;s funny because I&#8217;ve been actually writing out my tenure plan. And in the next five years, couple things. I definitely want to have a new physical space to run a shop and have a team, a dedicated team on payroll to where I can manage and be lead creative or a principal for projects that are being done by people that are working for me. But also, I have a really big passion for veterans&#8217; affairs. So I&#8217;ve been researching ways that I can somehow participate in helping veterans, be it they&#8217;re transitioning or trying to find their way out in the workforce. Or if they&#8217;re trying to start a business, there are so many benefits out there available to veterans who they don&#8217;t know they&#8217;re there and they&#8217;re just out here flapping and trying to work, but also might have some disabilities or issues that their workplace or workplaces are required to accommodate. So yeah, that&#8217;s a huge passion of mine honestly, in helping veterans, especially veterans of color, transition and live good lives after having lived through some really potentially horrible situations because of war. But yeah, having a shop and helping veterans.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Sure. So my main website is chrischarles.co. That&#8217;s chrischarles.co, not dot-com. The person who owns that domain name refuses to give it up, so I&#8217;m stuck with the dot-co and that&#8217;s no problem. That&#8217;s fine. So that has pretty much leads you to all of the other work that I do. I have a separate photography website, which you can also find once you go to chrischarles.co. But for people who are specifically interested in photography, it&#8217;s my full name, christophercharlesphotography.com. I have a Facebook business page, it&#8217;s Chris Charles Photo. My Instagram handle is the_chrischarles, so the, underscore symbol, Chris Charles. Those are the main places to find me. I&#8217;m there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Sounds good. Well Chris Charles, I want to thank you so much for coming on this show. I think certainly everything that you have talked about speaks to two key things that I think folks should kind of take in mind, particularly as we go into the new year. One is about being adaptable, and the second is about building relationships. I think everything that you&#8217;ve described about your career to date has been a testament to both of those abilities, and you&#8217;ve been able to craft and use both of those to be able to build a career for yourself, build a life for yourself, and continue to do great work out there in the community. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Thank you so much for having me, man. This is really fun. Enjoyed talking with you, Maurice. And yeah, anything you need from me, just let me know.</p>

<p>Gus Granger has been a staple in the Dallas design community for over 20 years. Not only that, his design work has reached international acclaim, earning honors from Adobe, AIGA, Communication Arts, and many other groups. But perhaps Gus&#8217;s biggest honor is his tireless advocacy work helping eliminate barriers for Black designers and empowering them for success in the world.</p>
<p>We caught up and talked about his recent career shift back to entrepreneurship, and he shared what he&#8217;s learned through that transition and how he brings those insights to his current work. Gus also gave some great advice for any designers looking to strike out on their own, spoke a bit about the current state of the design community from his perspective, and discussed some of the moments of joy in his career.</p>
<p>Hopefully this interview inspires you to find a way to help lift others up as you grow!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Hey, my name&#8217;s Gus Granger, I&#8217;m a designer, by that, I&#8217;m an epigraphic design roots, going brand identity messaging, positioning, web, print, really everything that a brand needs to show up and be seen and memorable in the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, we&#8217;re recording this kind of right before the year ends, so I&#8217;m curious to get a sense from you, what was 2022 for you?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Yeah, 2022 was a rollercoaster ride, I think we&#8217;ve got, with all things, the personal side is, which is kind of most prominent in having three kids and career changes going on, I&#8217;ve got a daughter that just started college this fall and that was exciting, which means she graduated from high school in the spring and that was exciting. And I had the amazing experience of joining a partnership team at VSA Partners based out of Chicago, which was a dream job of mine when I worked there as a designer in the early 2000s, and I wrapped up my tenure there this summer, wanting to get closer to my design roots and being more hands on, so that was a big change in the summer and getting back to working as Gus Granger design again and just getting into the trenches with clients and designing and having these in-depth conversations and just being able to walk that journey with my clients while doing the work has been really exciting and something that I&#8217;ve missed.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That is a lot. Well, congratulations definitely on your daughter going to college.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, it&#8217;s wild, the first few weeks was really difficult and my mom said, she&#8217;s like, &#8220;The first month is the hardest,&#8221; and I was like, I wonder what she&#8217;s doing now, and da da da, but she&#8217;s doing great, she comes home for the holidays pretty soon.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Is she far from Dallas where you&#8217;re at?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Oh, as far as possible, I&#8217;m in Dallas and she&#8217;s in upstate New York at Syracuse University.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Yes. She&#8217;s a double major in political science and photography and I think is just tapping into her creative side as well as wanting to change the world and change the systems and make the society better and learning the building blocks of tools and how to make that happen from the inside, so that&#8217;s exciting to see her grow in that regard as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s awesome, that&#8217;s really awesome to hear. So you mentioned with VSA this kind of was a full circle moment for you in a way, you started there many years ago as a designer and then now going back and being a partner, what was that experience like for you?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Oh, it was amazing, going back to&#8230; I&#8217;m having to embrace my kind of elder statesman&#8217;s status, which is terrible, but for one, going through design school in the mid 90s VSA partners was a dream, I think the were shops at that point was in VSA and Pentagram, which really kind of helped set my kind of goals for what I wanted to do in the profession, and when I ultimately ended up working there as a senior designer, we came across some of the just most talented and really interesting projects that I&#8217;d come across in my career at that point, and it was from there that I went off into the wilderness and started my own agency and drew that for me, working by myself on an extra bedroom to a 50 person studio on the 30th floor of building down here in downtown Dallas to selling it to a client and then going in-house and leaving that.</p>
<p>It was definitely an exciting bookend, kind of not just from having worked there before, but also looking up to the work that that studio was doing in just groundbreaking, just design, in depth understanding of clients and delivering business value while just doing just stunning work, getting to go back and join the leadership team there as they kind of enter this new digital era that everyone is getting their bearings with was really a great opportunity and honor and something that I enjoyed a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now you&#8217;re working for yourself as a consultant, has it been kind of a big shift going&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, I guess maybe this is another kind of full circle thing, going back to working for yourself, has it been a bit of a shift?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Oh, for sure, I think that, as I mentioned, going from running a large agency, starting it from scratch, and I always say, every time your team doubles in size, it&#8217;s a different job, so when you go from one person to two person, you&#8217;re like, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, this is completely different from two to four, from four to eight, from eight to 16, I was doing that for about 15 years and it kind of felt like the math isn&#8217;t right here, but it kind of felt like six or seven jobs, working at six or seven different places, but during the last few chapters, so much of my time was focused on just running a business and being so distant from the work that I really, certainly wasn&#8217;t designing, there were times that I may have been wearing an executive creative director hat, but it was more just business operations and payroll and HR and cashflow management and sales and all the things that were not what I was passionate about in the first place, it&#8217;s an essential part of running a large business.</p>
<p>You just missed what you were passionate about in the first place, ultimately, that&#8217;s what led me to we transitioning the agency to in-house situation through that acquisition to our client, Cyxtera, at the time, that was a brand new gigantic global technology company, data center, cybersecurity that had been a client of ours that we&#8217;d been part of naming, building their brand identity from scratch, and that they had been growing so large as a client, just sat down with the CMO and it was like, let&#8217;s look at how this could look if we just took our team and kind of became your in-house group, and then all of us are dedicated, and ultimately, that&#8217;s what we did, and that allowed me to get back to being more hands-on and with the same group of amazing people that I had in the 70kft days, but we were kind of on the other side of the client curtain.</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s fascinating there is that there&#8217;s so many different problem solving challenges that you can confront as a designer, as an art director, as a creative director, as a product architect that would not necessarily be sent to an agency and I&#8217;d never been in-house before, and it&#8217;s just a very different and fascinating ecosystem when you&#8217;re working directly with sales teams, when you&#8217;re working directly with product teams, and the pace of work is very different, the way that you manage work is very different because there aren&#8217;t, &#8220;Budgets,&#8221; for your hours and your team&#8217;s time, and you&#8217;ve got to find different ways to manage capacity and how much time should something take, but it also opens up opportunities to, we&#8217;re designing wayfinding systems for least 60 data centers around the world, to graphics for interior sales displays, to events, to video work that just the sheer volume and depth in the brand experience was really, really, really exciting.</p>
<p>But seeing how our clients would have to socialize that and sell that work and get the information gathered, that all of those things that we missed out on that we weren&#8217;t necessarily as exposed to being on the agency side, just giving a much deeper appreciation for our clients that sometimes we can have fun kind of teasing our clients and being difficult, make the logos bigger, blah, blah, blah, we can&#8217;t get them to sign off on something, yeah, I still have my agency chip on my shoulder of that regard, but it&#8217;s much more empathy, I&#8217;d say doing the two years there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, back when we had you on the show in 2015, the firm that you&#8217;re talking about is 70kft, and I mean, I think it&#8217;s important to&#8230; a couple of things that you mentioned I think are important, first, the thing about every time you kind of double your staff, it&#8217;s a different job, that is so true, it does distance you from the work a bit, and the more that you have to be the CEO running the business, it takes so much time away from actually being hands-on with the work, sometimes you can do it, I mean, depending on the type of business that you have, you&#8217;re able to do it, but it does get a lot harder because you just have to be aware and present about so many other things that have nothing to do with the projects at all that you&#8217;re working on.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Absolutely, and I don&#8217;t say that to scare people off from starting or growing their own design firm or agencies, and there&#8217;s certainly ways that I could have grown the agency differently to keep myself closer to the work in leading it, I think at the time, there was just enough fatigue and wanting to do something different that when that opportunity came up with Cyxtera, it was like, look, here&#8217;s a way for me to continue doing the type of work that I love doing even more of it and being more hands-on, keeping my team together, and then happened to also be a client that we adored and we&#8217;d had done a lot of work with over the years when he was in different companies.</p>
<p>And so there was a lot of just trust and alignment for the business value of great design and what it looks like to advocate for that within groups in a large growing organization, and so that made that change a lot more attractive, so I say all of that, the attractiveness of that moment was like, you know what? This is more interesting than trying to go through a wholesale reset of how I have organized in bringing in different leadership to handle the types of aspects of the job that I didn&#8217;t enjoy so that I could be more hands on, it was just like, you know what? Let&#8217;s go this way because this looks like fun and something fresh and new and it was, and I&#8217;m glad we did it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Because I mean, at the end of the day, you&#8217;re running a business, so especially if you&#8217;re a designer that maybe came up through design school or if you don&#8217;t have that kind of business acumen, you&#8217;re either sort of learning it on the job as the company grows or you have to find some way to, like you said, supplement that with bringing on folks that do know the business end so you can build and scale things out hopefully in a healthy way, and I think certainly you grew 70kft, like you said, the 50 people, I mean, that&#8217;s a testament to not just the work that you&#8217;ve put in on the brand, but also the people and the team that you built around it.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Oh, a hundred percent. I forget who said this first, it actually may have been one of my first bosses through VSA, I think it was Dana Arnette, it talked about so much of growing a great team, it&#8217;s about curating talent, and that my philosophy through this was just trying to find and attract the best and most talented people possible, and then just finding opportunities for them to do their thing and get folks to work well together, and that was the most fun part of that, in creating an environment where they can find just joy in working with each other and pushing each other and finding new and inventive ways to sell our clients&#8217; story, and we had a whole mix of things that we were very much leaned into business to business technology, but we are also working with a lot of startups and some retail work.</p>
<p>And we also reserved a percentage of our time for non-profit work, which ended up being a lot of work for the Dallas Holocaust Museum, which kind of helped us satisfy this more mission-centric priority for the agency, it was from the leadership standpoint on my side and wanting to make sure that we&#8217;re putting our skills to use to benefit society, and that&#8217;s something I still try to do with my own time, but that it&#8217;s like there&#8217;s so much that we are creating that&#8217;s just fleeting, make a website and it might be live for a year or less, the client gets acquired and the identity that you just love just gets wiped away, and then what&#8217;s left? What impact did you make on the world? You helped someone sell a business and that&#8217;s great, you put three more dollars in their pocket.</p>
<p>But I think what we have unique superpowers in capturing people&#8217;s imagination and attention and persuasion through our gifts as artists, as creators, as communicators, and too often those skills are not put to work for the most important communication challenges that are holding the world back today, whether it&#8217;s just racism, just bias in general, climate change, we can just go right on down the list, and that for us to isolate our gifts for corporate interests is a tragedy, and notably, but we&#8217;ve got to eat, we got kids to put through college sometimes, there&#8217;s a whole number of things, and finding the right balance of that is key, but yeah, that&#8217;s part of my soapbox.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, I mean, I feel like that&#8217;s been a growing awareness of the industry over the, I don&#8217;t know, I want to say at least over the past three years, but I would even go back as far as maybe &#8217;15, 2016, you&#8217;ve started to see this sort of unfold in different ways, I would say definitely in the 2016 to 2018, 2019, it was more about, I think, civic design and making sure that people were using their skills towards maybe improving government services and understanding the election process and voting and all that sort of stuff, and then certainly with 2020 and a lot of the protests that happened around the murder of George Floyd, then you started to see a more active presence around social justice issues, and I think it&#8217;s definitely going to increase as more, I hate to say, just as more bad shit happens in the world.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s kind of the reality of it, is like as more things happen, we, as designers, are tasked to come up with more solutions that are not just product focused, in a way, it almost feels, almost, I&#8217;ll say, it almost feels a little dismissive to just focus on product as a designer almost, I mean, I think there&#8217;s utility in it, certainly even as you mentioned with doing stuff with Cyxtera, doing things around cybersecurity and things that&#8217;s important, that feeds into product. But I think of the designers of 2011 versus the designers of now, and how the focus back then was so much on product and UX and interfaces and all that sort of stuff, and now it&#8217;s about how do we use our skills to solve the problems that are facing our society and our planet?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s definitely a different mindset today, and I think I totally agree that sadly, something has to really go wrong to get people to wake up or enough people to wake up because even you mentioned things like government services and election design, I got involved with that going back in 2000, there&#8217;s an organization, I was part of AIGA Design for Democracy that came out of the problems around ballot design in Florida in the election between Al Gore and George Bush, that&#8217;s an effort which continues today around how to make sure election systems are better designed to protect the integrity of the vote, and there were many people that were rallying to the cause back then, but there&#8217;s the problems that we can be attacking with our skills are ever present, yeah, it&#8217;s a matter of we could also wear ourselves out trying to do everything, so you have to, I think, in my mind like, all right, pick your space, I&#8217;m like, where can I be the most effective and make a biggest impact?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What is a typical day look like for you now? What does the Gus Granger workday look like?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Gus Granger workday, you know what? I think these days I&#8217;m so much more guarded with for my health, my mental health, and that I talk about joy and wanting to be in a good space, and I&#8217;m like, even though I&#8217;m working from home, I&#8217;m like, I start each day&#8230; I&#8217;ll go to one of my favorite breakfast spots and it&#8217;s my commute and I have carefully curated and found the best chocolate croissant places in the Dallas metroplex area, I will rotate through those locations and I need to start a chocolate croissant blog, but that&#8217;s a whole other podcast, but I say all that, that that&#8217;s my happy spot, and I just know that I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m listening to comedy podcast, I&#8217;m not going to wake up in the morning and to start listening to the grim news of the day because I need to start the day in a positive space.</p>
<p>But from there and I get back and start work back in my pandemic inspired office, which didn&#8217;t exist back in early 2020, but now I&#8217;m so much more comfortable and cozy there, but I&#8217;m working with having a number of different conversations around projects that&#8217;ll come to fruition months from now, working with clients that I&#8217;m in the middle of right now, and it&#8217;s a mix, some of these things are in a design phase and we&#8217;re going through looking at identity explorations or design system explorations, others are in a brand strategy phase, and we might be doing interviews with subject matter experts and other internal contacts to really start figuring out the right ways to differentiate the brand and looking at how to start the conversation in the right place and to elevate the right values and principles that are going to help define that brand at its best because we try to do that before we even start designing anything, before we start writing anything.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ll go through that brand strategy and messaging phase with amazing copywriters that I&#8217;ve been working with for years and we lay that foundation, and so I&#8217;m in different stages of that work. And I&#8217;m about to start a web project next week but what&#8217;s great is that there&#8217;s just enough of it that it&#8217;s not a 9:00 to 5:00 type thing, I can go and have a leisurely breakfast and go and walk four miles and come back and I can start my day at 10:00 and if I feel tired, I can take a nap and wake back up and do some of those things and the next day it&#8217;ll be completely different, that&#8217;s the great part of being the home-based consultant, at least at this moment, talk to me a month from now and you might get a more frazzled version of me, but hopefully I&#8217;m able to keep that at bay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s always, I think, an ebb and a flow with entrepreneurship, some days are going to be better than others, some months, some years, it just sort of ends up happening that way, but it sounds like you found a deliberate way to put joy just into your everyday work life in general.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Yeah. And it&#8217;s a lesson that I&#8217;ve taken I think from the more intense days of my myself in the kft experience where they were&#8230; I think from my standpoint, I&#8217;m like, I could go through just joyless months and just trying to hold teams together and dealing with all kinds of just different operational headaches, HR headaches, team conflicts, and when you&#8217;ve got dozens of people working for you, not everybody gets along, and there are times when that the job becomes camp counselor and couples therapists, and it&#8217;s not just for its own sake or it&#8217;s like, look, I&#8217;ve got to get these folks to work together so that we can get this project completed so we can build it on Monday, that&#8217;s an intense part of the experience, and that&#8217;s definitely not something they teach you or even allude to in design school and in talking a bit earlier it was like there&#8217;s so much that gets into&#8230; they&#8217;re designers that are ready to start working for themselves as soon as they know how to design, whether they&#8217;re coming out of a four year program or if they&#8217;re self-taught.</p>
<p>And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Now, I&#8217;m going to start working for myself,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, I am so regularly trying to steer them clear from that, and be like, &#8220;Please don&#8217;t, for your own sanity,&#8221; but there&#8217;s so much that needs to be learned at that point from other people, and go and find a creative director, art director, somebody that&#8217;s going to take you under their wing, whether you can work for them directly or they&#8217;re going to mentor you, that you are going to just make a ton of mistakes, find ways to solve problems that you never even thought of, that you got to kind of go through that for years to really learn how to design at your best, and then once you figure that out, you start working for yourself, it may start being familiar when it&#8217;s just you or when you start collaborating, but it will start growing to a point where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, this is why people go to business school.&#8221;</p>
<p>And you start realizing, all right, do I start reading more business books and all these other things or start hiring for skills that I may not have? Because when you&#8217;ve got a dozen people and you&#8217;re dealing with at least negotiation, and that&#8217;s a different animal these days, because I mean, with remote and hybrid work, it&#8217;s a very different atmosphere than when I was growing my agency, but I think those days I&#8217;m like, you kind of had to have an office in order for a client to take you seriously, and that that&#8217;s like, all right, we&#8217;re looking at commercial real estate, downtown Dallas, seven year lease, but how do I grow? How do I contract? Is that even possible? And looking at business insurance and all kinds of&#8230; it&#8217;s again, stuff that you wouldn&#8217;t even get into at design school, but you may find great relationships from other designers, which I did, that had run studios, to be able to pick their brain and to figure out what things that they did and who did they seek out for consulting.</p>
<p>And you start finding consultants that just specialize in working with design firm principles or marketing firm principles, and that&#8217;s such an important resource that I feel like just gets overlooked a lot, whether we look at our design conferences and our design groups, we&#8217;re talking about how we can be better problem solvers, be better designers, better collaborators, and that&#8217;s all essential and that&#8217;s central to what it is that we do, I think we&#8217;re kind of a naturally entrepreneurial group of folks and want to create our own thing, we enjoy the independence or the autonomy, but the other aspect of it is there&#8217;s a lot that you need to learn that we don&#8217;t talk about enough in design circles that I&#8217;d love to see change in the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m laughing only because as you mentioned that I&#8217;m thinking how back when I had my studio, particularly I think in the first four or five years about trying to have an address was so important and to let people know, oh yes, we are a real business, and I remember, I think I got some little tiny office space because I&#8217;m in Atlanta, it was important for me to have an address that was like, &#8220;Peach Tree Street,&#8221; so people know, oh, he&#8217;s official, and I had some little tiny office, I think I got it through Regis probably, the real estate company, got it through Regis, some little tiny office in Midtown that I never went to, but I just wanted to have the address so people knew like, oh, this is official, in the grand scheme of things, did it make a difference? Absolutely not, but in a way sort of like you mentioned, it would&#8217;ve been good to have had some knowledge to know maybe I don&#8217;t have to have this, maybe I don&#8217;t have to waste money trying to do this to prove it to customers I&#8217;m never going to get.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Well, I don&#8217;t know, man, I&#8217;m like, it&#8217;s kind of tough to prove a negative because you think of-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s true-</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
How many folks reached out to you because you had an address during those days where it&#8217;s like, oh, this isn&#8217;t in a PO box or somewhere in the suburbs, but just by seeing that you were there on a Peach Street, no one&#8217;s going to call you and be like, &#8220;I saw that you had an address, let&#8217;s talk about the [inaudible 00:28:58].&#8221; I think it&#8217;s definitely one of those things where I&#8217;m like, I think when I had moved from&#8230; I&#8217;d been working in South Bend, Indiana for some time, my wife was running marketing and PR for Whirlpool Corporation, which was based near there, we were about to have our third kid and we wanted to move closer to friends and family, and we came back to Dallas and the agency was growing at that point and I was like, I&#8217;m going to go ahead and get a space in, I think at that point it was like West End in Dallas, it&#8217;s a historic district, pretty creative space, and I just knew that the clients that I was wanting to work with were going to want to come to an office and see me and see the space.</p>
<p>And frankly, and I think at that point where I was also just thinking about just as a black designer period, that I&#8217;m like, if I&#8217;m constantly trying to meet clients in a Starbucks when I&#8217;m trying to get them to pay me a hundred grand for a website that what we&#8217;re talking about in the 2010s, I think that was a tougher ask at least in the circles that I was moving in then to get where when they could come and be in our conference room and I can bring my director of development to the table, to bring the account manager, to bring the designer and the copywriters and we can put stuff up on the screen.</p>
<p>All of that can happen through Zoom today, but as far as that confidence building, just having an address is one step, I think there&#8217;s absolutely types of work that you need to at that point, I&#8217;m not sure kind of what the equivalent would be if those barriers were just erased, but you just needed to have a space for the types of clients that we were working with, just that they could see and come and realize this is the real shop.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think certainly in the earlier days, I started my business in 2008, some clients or potential clients, they really sort of frowned on, oh, you&#8217;re just doing this from home now everyone works from home, but certainly back then, I felt there was a much stronger bias, especially to try to get larger clients and larger budgets, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not giving you this money if you&#8217;re doing this at home,&#8221; they want, it&#8217;s almost like a social proof of business in some kind of way.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Yeah, no, totally.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, you&#8217;ve been a design leader and a business leader for over 20 years now, and you&#8217;ve already kind of shared some thoughts about what you&#8217;d like to see from designers, but what are your thoughts on just the design community today? How do you see things?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny, as I keep looking at, whether it&#8217;s LinkedIn and different discussions that are going on at conferences and events, it&#8217;s like what we mean by design today is different than what we meant by design 10 years ago or even 20 years ago, and that I&#8217;ve come to realize, I&#8217;m like, all right, I&#8217;m kind of a brand and marketing designer where in a way that I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily have carried that label, because even then I&#8217;m like, I will rewind back, I&#8217;m a graphic designer at my core, and I think I even mentioned that early on, and people are like, &#8220;Oh well that&#8217;s an old sounding term,&#8221; but we always have these labels, whether commercial artists, graphic artists, graphic designer, web designer, but in starting at the foundation of graphic designers, the way I was educated and being hyper passionate about conceptual thinking, typography, composition, understanding audience, adventure, discovery, being inventive and creating surprising and effective work, that in my experience design was kind of medium agnostic.</p>
<p>And so I&#8217;ve always had an allergy of, are you a graphic designer or are you a web designer? I&#8217;m like, stop, it&#8217;s all graphic design in my worldview, and I understand there are people that look at them very differently, but I feel like if you&#8217;ve got a masterful command of typography and you can understand a medium, that the world of creating a elegant website can be very similar process to creating an amazing book, but you need to understand what you&#8217;re working with, you need to understand your materials, you need to understand the people who need to collaborate in order to make that happen, not to say that web development&#8217;s the same as working with the printing press, but there are certain rules that you need to know how a book is going to function, what type of experience someone expects when they pick up a hardcover book versus a paperback book to be able to navigate that content elegantly.</p>
<p>And I think if those same muscles are put to place, the digital experience is the same, so I think things have become even more fragmented today, and that there&#8217;s&#8230; because we will say design and what will mean is UX design, which may not involve visual design at all, or just UI design using a component library, which is not the same thing as kind of the more commercial artist view of creating something from scratch that may be a step earlier in the process to be like, who is the person that&#8217;s actually creating that component library and deciding how that brand is going to show up in the product experience, and what is its relationship with the overall brand as a whole? Is there relationship between how the brand shows up in marketing and how it shows up in product?</p>
<p>But those that are kind of working with a preset component library that may be less involved with aesthetic decisions and more about flow and kind of using existing building blocks to create compelling experiences, it&#8217;s a different process entirely than staring at a blank page in the screen and be like, here&#8217;s brand X and here&#8217;s what they&#8217;re trying to solve for in the world, what should it look like? I&#8217;ve come through my view of design, my background of design, the version of design which gets me excited is the blank page, or perhaps it&#8217;s the existing page which is messed up and the client that comes in is like, &#8220;Help me make sense of this or make it better.&#8221;<br>
But there&#8217;s a lot of design work that&#8217;s out there that I hesitate to say it because it almost seems like it would be controversial, it seems to be less creative, which I don&#8217;t understand as much, but which is not to say that it&#8217;s not a matter of problem-solving because I would have debates with one of my creative directors about design as art or not, and we can go back and forth until we&#8217;re blue in the face like, what do we mean by arts? And I&#8217;m like, look, we&#8217;re in a profession and our roots as commercial artists, and that the whole notion of us creating experiences that people want to engage with, that they feel connected with in a way which is an emotional type of experience, whether it&#8217;s bringing them joy or they&#8217;re attracted to it or it&#8217;s bringing them calm peace.</p>
<p>The skills that we bring to the table there are the same innate gifts, in my view and experience, that are at the core of an artist, and whenever I would review portfolios, I&#8217;m like, what can I see in this person&#8217;s aesthetic gifts? I&#8217;m like, how innate are they able to create compelling compositions? And it&#8217;s not just to be like, all right, I&#8217;m just going to go ahead and decide that this app needs to look like a Salvador Dolly thing because this is what inspires me today. But one of my favorite architects today is Zaha Hadid and just Google her work, it&#8217;s insane, these buildings are beautiful and arresting and shocking and very functional, but there&#8217;s a very different thing, you can&#8217;t tell me that there&#8217;s not artistry, or at least the way that I&#8217;m defining art and the way that team or that architect, she&#8217;s no longer with us, viewed designing spaces for her clients.</p>
<p>You can say the same thing to be like, all right, if she&#8217;s going to create a post office as opposed to someone&#8217;s like, &#8220;Look post office, look like a gray box, we&#8217;re going to put some tracked out Futura on the side, it&#8217;s going to be one story, it&#8217;s going to do this and it&#8217;s going to do the job,&#8221; those buildings are going to look completely different, but the cultural impact, the emotional experience of people going into Zaha Hadid post office is night and day to the gray box, and it&#8217;s like that&#8217;s the view of design that I hunger for, I don&#8217;t see as present in the digital space today. I think accessibility and user experience is definitely benefiting it from a bunch of artists anarchists going out there just creating a bunch of chaos, which was exemplified in the flash era, but there was a lot more beauty and discovery, I think, happening in the digital space that was there again, but it&#8217;s a whole other rant.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, I completely agree, in terms of the kind of less creative, and I see what you mean about it could be controversial by saying that, but correct me if I&#8217;m wrong here, but I feel like when you say that it&#8217;s sort of like, I don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s less kind of verve, there&#8217;s not that sort of spirit or enthusiasm, you mentioned Zaha Hadid, I&#8217;m thinking also of, and this is probably a bit of a stretch in terms of an analogy, but look at things like AI generated arts and how yes, you can input the right functions or whatever and it spits something out that looks good, but it doesn&#8217;t have that human nuance to it, it doesn&#8217;t have that sort of certain je ne sais quoi that would make it really, I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily even say attractive, because these things do look good, but it just doesn&#8217;t have that something, I&#8217;m not sure what the word for it is, but I know what you mean, I think, when you say that.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Yeah, well, or even in the instance of the AI generated art, I&#8217;ve seen some of it, which does have that je ne sais quoi, but it&#8217;s getting the prompt of to be influenced by a human being that created that, it&#8217;s still leveraging human ingenuity, it&#8217;s like a collage, a seamless collage, and that I can just go in there and be like, I want to see the Zaha Hadid Tesla truck, and then it&#8217;ll just spit out and be it&#8217;ll be this amazing thing and that okay, but I&#8217;m like, it&#8217;s still going to have this aesthetic and it&#8217;s going to also be inspired by what seems to be a proto fascist, anyway, I can start getting into it, Elon Musk read, we&#8217;ll back away from the Tesla discussion, technology monsters person.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was just trying to maybe extrapolate a little bit on what you were sort of saying, I won&#8217;t say the lack of creativity, but I see what you mean about it possibly being less creative because it&#8217;s about, I don&#8217;t know, the output is just different, you&#8217;ve said before that creating great design is easiest when it&#8217;s infused with joy, so maybe that joy is not necessarily in the final product in the same way that it would be if a human did it, I know that there&#8217;s a lot of conversation around AI generated art, chat GPT and all these sorts of technologies that are mimicking what humans have created by hand, but it&#8217;s a really interesting time for seeing where technology can take design, but back to what I said before about what you mentioned with joy, have there been moments in your design career that have been particularly joyful?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Oh, absolutely, absolutely, and I think there are times that I look fondly at the times when we&#8217;ve got just a group of us and we&#8217;re just trying to, it may be my developers and writers and designers and we&#8217;re just at our magnet wall and we&#8217;ve just got layouts up and we&#8217;re just trying to figure out how to solve a particular problem and that there&#8217;s the joy part of it, and it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t mean to just to make it simple, be like, well, just somebody tell a joke and that work is going to get better, there&#8217;s the ability to have fun with people and to challenge each other is all that comes from a foundation of trust and that we&#8217;ve got good relationships with people, that we can now start to critique the work and riff off of each other and cut to the chase and be like, &#8220;You know what? This sucks and here&#8217;s why.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that we can kind of laugh about it like, &#8220;Yeah, yeah, I was trying to do this,&#8221; and da da, or, &#8220;This is amazing and it would be even better if we did this,&#8221; that there&#8217;s this kind of lens of bringing more candor to a conversation when you have a trusted group of collaborators where you can push and play and make it so people aren&#8217;t afraid to bring new ideas to the table because nothing is personal and it can be fun, and coming up, I hadn&#8217;t seen this replicated, nor I didn&#8217;t never really embraced it, but in one of my early jobs before I started my agency was at a studio called Group Barnet here in Dallas, and there was a brainstorm room and there was an entire shelf that was just full of hats, bunch of just silly stupid hats like biking hats and clown hats and policeman hats, ship captain hats.</p>
<p>There weren&#8217;t chairs in there, they were all beanbag chairs, right? And so people would need to sit on these beanbag chairs and oftentimes people would go and put on these silly hats, and it was a culture at the agency of it was family-like, and it was fun, but it was definitely served a business purpose and that it was seeding creativity and openness and not taking each other too seriously, and I think it also just kind of keeps you grounded when you&#8217;ve got a stupid clown hat on your head when you&#8217;re saying, &#8220;What if we did it this way?&#8221; So that&#8217;s the utility of it, and otherwise when we&#8217;re just kind of the opposite and we&#8217;re defensive or protective and we&#8217;re not sharing our work and we just kind of work in isolation and just present something when we feel like it&#8217;s perfect and honed and may not be as open to feedback, it&#8217;s just much more difficult to great work that way, in my mind.</p>
<p>And the opposite, it&#8217;s when you&#8217;re wanting to pursue experimentation that I want to be able to just go over to developers and be like, &#8220;What if we did this way?&#8221; And when the page loaded, all these images just exploded and here&#8217;s why and here&#8217;s why it would make sense, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;That&#8217;s impossible,&#8221; to be like, &#8220;Well, look, here&#8217;s a link which did it,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Ugh, that&#8217;s ridiculous, that can&#8217;t happen,&#8221; and they come back 10 minutes and then they figured it out, that&#8217;s the kind of stuff that has happened throughout whether my VSA days from the 70kft days to being at Cyxtera, that that&#8217;s the type of atmosphere that I find the most fun and interesting work kind of came out of it.</p>
<p>Just as a closing thought, and we bring that same energy to whether we&#8217;re working on an identity system for a juice bar or helping clients sell cloud computing, to we&#8217;re doing exhibition design for bringing boosting awareness of genocide, which it&#8217;s not to say we&#8217;re not taking it seriously, but this whole notion of building an atmosphere of trust and experimentation so that the team that you&#8217;ve surrounded yourself with, which are hopefully people that are there as your cheerleaders, can be there during critiques or while you&#8217;re working to push and cheer you on, so that&#8217;s that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Something else that you do is you maintain an active presence in social justice efforts through a variety of nonprofits, and you&#8217;ve mentioned that you&#8217;ve focused on eliminating barriers for marginalized designers in the profession and empowering them for success, now, you&#8217;ve kind of spoken a little bit on both of these things earlier, but did you have any sort of more thoughts around either of those?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Yeah, and I think that&#8217;s important, and I continue to do work locally with the Dallas Holocaust and Human Rights Museum, which is, I think that was a large relationship that we had in the 70kft days, and we were doing all of their exhibition design and worked on naming and identity work back then, but now I&#8217;m working with them on their marketing committee and on their new facility, and they&#8217;re doing important work here in north Texas to mentoring, whether working with the Adobe Design Circle and helping the scholarships for marginalized designers and mentoring the scholarship designees, other mentoring programs and on continuing relationships with mentees, as I tell all my mentees over the years and I was like, look, you&#8217;ve got me for life if you want me, because I think that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m like, I get the most satisfaction, out of seeing their careers just sore.</p>
<p>But I think when something more tactical and urgent is happening locally that might have gotten involved with political candidates and protest movements, and as I mentioned earlier, it&#8217;s like, look, how can we bring our skills to the table to make sure things are effective? And we kind of worked with a bunch of folks and the local resistance movement back in 2016 to oust the problematic congressman and was bringing my design skills to bear there in a way that made sense, I think we just have to find whatever&#8217;s possible, and I think in as well as within professional associations and mentioned, whether it&#8217;s online groups, whether I try to stay present with black design groups as well, which each had a bit in the past about AIGA and other groups that there&#8217;s just in the design profession period, it&#8217;s important for us to push.</p>
<p>And I try to do that where I think it&#8217;s important that we&#8217;re taking our talents and putting them to use, I&#8217;m like, yes, could I sit down and do a phone bank for my local congressman? Sure, am I going to be more effective by bringing my skills as a designer? Probably, and that I&#8217;m like, what unique skills are you blessed with in this life? What&#8217;s your highest and best use to make that particular cause come to fruition? And so to that part, whether you&#8217;re helping movements, that&#8217;s key, whether you&#8217;re helping talented designers to navigate early career challenges, pitfalls, advice, and I get such satisfaction out of that, and that&#8217;s a high level summary of the stuff that I&#8217;ve been up to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s something that you&#8217;ve let go of that once meant the world to you?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
We&#8217;ve talked a bit about it, but I think it was that agency, I talked a bit about the importance of mental health and how I prioritize starting my day with a ritual that&#8217;s going to kind of make sure that I&#8217;m in a good mood, that starting and growing my own agency was my dream job, that was my dream going back to college, and I did that and I grew it and I was very proud of it, and in the last chapters, I think from there was just enough things that just caught me off guard, clients that let you down, betrayals from people you thought you could trust, that it became such a burden and a drag that I was like, I&#8217;m not happy, and when you look around at all, even looking around at dozens of folks and I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m the only person at this place that cannot quit their job.</p>
<p>Anyone else here can give their two weeks notice except for me, and it&#8217;s definitely the first world problem, right? I&#8217;m like, oh, you&#8217;ve got your own design agency and you&#8217;re sad, that was very much the reality and I realized it was something that in that moment I needed to let go of and I&#8217;m glad I did, and that it&#8217;s definitely something where it&#8217;s a lot of trust where a lot of people can get into, did all this success happen by chance? If I give it up or I&#8217;m going to be able to do it again? It gives you a lot of a key moment of just self-analysis of like, all right, it&#8217;s a giant leap of faith, if I take this change, is this next chapter going to be as rewarding and successful for me? And if I have to do it all over again, can I?</p>
<p>For me, it became important to do that, and that I found a way to make a change with how my team was doing work and to protect their jobs was important for me because I think there had been enough just challenges in the years prior to that that we&#8217;d gone through just things of having a business of that size and going through just firings and layoffs and things where it&#8217;s like business ebbs and flows, it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s just a different animal entirely and it just ate me up and I didn&#8217;t want to go, I just didn&#8217;t want to do anymore, and so letting that go that was probably the answer to that question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does success look like now at this stage of your career?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
I&#8217;m still trying to figure that out, I&#8217;m quite happy working for myself again, there&#8217;s conversations kind of going with really interesting companies that have reached out to me about roles that are a surprisingly compelling fit for my background and passions that I would never have imagined before. But I look at it all, I&#8217;m like, what? One, I&#8217;m like, is it going to bring me joy?</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s key for that joy is knowing that I&#8217;m making some kind of positive impact, that I have space to make a positive impact on the world, that I have the ability to make a positive impact on my family and keep kids in college, one&#8217;s there, I&#8217;ve got two more on the way, to continue to be a good dad and to be a good husband and just to prepare for just a well-balanced life where we can just travel and spend time with friends and family and do what I love. Somewhere in the middle of that is a definition of it, but that&#8217;s very much what I&#8217;m trying to figure out because I spent most of my career focused on that agency, either preparing to start it and grow it from college, and then having done that, I don&#8217;t have that north star anymore, so I&#8217;m trying to figure that out and that&#8217;s kind of exciting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I have to say there is a certain, I don&#8217;t know, exhilaration to not knowing what&#8217;s coming next in a way, there&#8217;s certainly, don&#8217;t get me wrong, stability&#8217;s great, the lore of having a stable paycheck and knowing where the work is coming from is good, but there&#8217;s just something really freeing and exhilarating about just not really knowing what&#8217;s coming up on the horizon, but I don&#8217;t know, to me it&#8217;s very empowering, so I get where you&#8217;re coming from there.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
To that end, where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work would you like to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
In my dream, I was just having a great conversation with this black-owned real estate developer in Portland, and she&#8217;s doing amazing work, and she just started this firm that is just focused on mission-based projects and affordable housing for the black community, and that is their whole focus, and I&#8217;m like, maybe something like that ends up being the goal, and I&#8217;ve mentioned all those things that I would want to have be part of that, but I&#8217;m like, that is kind of the fantasy, right? And that knowing that every aspect of my work life is helping improve society and the black community would be amazing, and if it ends up being a percentage or a portion of my time that&#8217;s going into that, that could be the case too, I think if I can unlock away to kind of have that be the main thing, that would be the fantasy, but in the meantime, I know I&#8217;m going to be heads down working hard, putting these kids through college and hopefully I having some fun along the way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up, where can our audience find out more information about you and your work and everything? Where can they follow you online?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
GusGranger.com, that is G-U-S-G-R-A-N-G-E-R.com, and that&#8217;s also my handle on the socials, so you can find me on Instagram, we&#8217;ll see if I&#8217;ll continue to be on Twitter, but it&#8217;s the same handle across the board, so you can find me, I&#8217;m pretty easy, if you find another Granger, it might be my dad, but he&#8217;s pretty cool if you want to talk to him.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Gus Granger, thank you so much for coming back on the show, of course, you&#8217;ve been on the show before, but I know we didn&#8217;t talk a lot about kind of, and it was something that we purposely wanted to avoid talking about, but that&#8217;s how we first met, you know what I&#8217;m talking about, I&#8217;m not going to mention it, but-</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I just want to say thank you for being just such a positive influence and role model and mentor and everything, just the work that you&#8217;re doing across design and business, of course, is impressive, but even more so that you&#8217;re really about giving back to the community is something that I certainly look to and I hope a lot of other designers emulate throughout their career, so thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Well, Maurice, thank you, and I hope you keep this in here, but I want to thank you in the same regard for all the work that you&#8217;re doing, and I know I&#8217;ve been talking to you about this for a while, I&#8217;m like, this podcast is so essential, and I think back to that designer that was in design school that I&#8217;m like, I went through four years and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d been exposed to another black designer other than myself and maybe two others that were in my design program, but the whole notion of being able to be sent a link which has in-depth interviews with now hundreds of black designers, that is amazing, and I&#8217;m so glad that your work has been recognized, whether it&#8217;s with the Steven Heller Award by the Smithsonian, it is impressive and it&#8217;s well deserved and just kudos and I can&#8217;t wait to see what&#8217;s going to come next. Keep doing it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, thank you, thank you so much, thank you.</p>

<p>All it takes is a spark to set off a blaze of creativity, and no one knows that better than our first guest of the year, visual artist Sharon Burton. As a creative coach, her specialty lies in helping people reclaim their creative lives, which I think is a fantastic way to start off 2023.</p>
<p>Sharon talked about her coaching practice <a href="https://www.sparkyourcreative.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Spark Your Creative</a>, described the different courses and services she offers, and spoke on how using joy as resilience is a key part of her work. Sharon also talked about growing up in Philly, working in public health, and shared how her time in Atlanta opened her eyes to her true calling. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a creative spark, then I hope this conversation with Sharon helps you begin this year on the right track! </p>

How has 2022 been for you?</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting, I&#8217;ve been talking to a few people about that. I think overall, 2022 has been one of the most positive years in the last few years with the pandemic and all that&#8217;s been going on. I think this has been a year that I&#8217;ve been able to really enjoy who I am as a creative person. I&#8217;ve been a part of all of those three things, I&#8217;ve had some positive things that have happened. I&#8217;ve been able to get into some exhibitions back to back, which is not always easy. I had my poetry as being&#8230; was selected to be in a chatbook that includes other poets in this DC, Maryland, Virginia area. So that&#8217;s going to be published soon. I&#8217;ve made tremendous headway in a book that I&#8217;m writing, which we can talk about later. So there&#8217;s been a lot of things that have happened.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s been a year where I was able to focus a little bit more on some things, and I did a lot of spiritual work on abundance early part of the year. And though it didn&#8217;t show up everywhere I wanted it to show up, it did show up, so I can&#8217;t be mad. I have to give things to the universe for allowing me to be able to share my gifts in so many different ways, whether it&#8217;s coaching, whether it&#8217;s doing my own stuff, I&#8217;ve been very, very blessed to have some good things happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s amazing. Were there any particular lessons that you learned this past year? Are there ways that you feel like you&#8217;ve grown and improved?</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
One of the biggest things that I&#8217;ve been really focusing on this year is boundaries, because as a creative person, you can find yourself saying yes to a lot of things and wearing yourself out. So being able to set healthy boundaries is probably one of the biggest lessons I&#8217;ve learned this year. I think the other thing is not to&#8230; I don&#8217;t know how to say this, but sometimes you may not feel you&#8217;re getting support for what you do, and to lay back and say, okay, understanding that those that will support you will support you regardless, and those who won&#8217;t won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>And not taking anything seriously, that&#8217;s the other thing. Giving people grace, because one of the major things I think of this time in our nation&#8217;s history and where we are going into 2023 is giving a lot of grace to people. Folks have really just been through it with this whole pandemic, and there&#8217;s a lot of grieving, a lot of grieving, whether it&#8217;s grieving our past way of life, whether it&#8217;s people that have passed through COVID or other things, but I notice people are really dealing with grief and grieving. And I think if you&#8217;re not really grounded as to who you are as a person, this is a tricky time. And sometimes we can get impatient with folks, but if we give people some grace knowing that people are doing the best they can with what they know, I think that&#8217;s the most important thing. So that was the second lesson.</p>
<p>I like this question. No, because I was sitting there thinking the other day, &#8220;Okay, what were some of the major things that I&#8217;ve learned?&#8221; And then I think the third thing is, never too late. Sometimes we think that&#8230; And I work with a lot of people who are interested in engaging their creativity or going back to something that they did creatively when they were younger. I work with a lot of people at middle age. And letting people know that, hey, it doesn&#8217;t matter how long it&#8217;s taken you to get to a certain point, as long as you&#8217;re making strides to that.</p>
<p>Those three things, boundaries, exercising healthy boundaries, exercising grace with people because we&#8217;re reemerging and we&#8217;re trying to get our footing, trying to get back, I think. And I think a lot of people think it&#8217;s just going to be right back to what they used to do and how they did things. And a lot of people, I don&#8217;t think, really realized that this is a new normal, it&#8217;s not&#8230; What you knew and how life was at 2018 is not what it&#8217;s like now. And if you&#8217;re striving for that, you&#8217;re going to be disappointed, but if you&#8217;re open to new opportunities or new ways of doing things, it will be a better situation for you.<br>
But I think also being patient and showing grace to those like our friends and people that we know that are having difficulty and may not realize it, may not realize that they&#8217;re kind of trying to navigate a new world. And that means misunderstandings, that means emotional outbursts, that means a lot of things that&#8230; Maybe we didn&#8217;t know Uncle Joe was that way, he seems so emotional now. And just sort of understanding that Uncle Joe is doing the best he can navigating.</p>
<p>So those, and then the third thing was, yes, it&#8217;s never too late. Yes, it&#8217;s never too late. A lot of things that I felt was too late or I felt I was behind on, I was able to move forward with this year. And I think that people need to know that we can&#8217;t beat ourselves up over what may not have happened at a time that we felt it should have happened. I think we have to trust the universe that those things happen at the time that they&#8217;re supposed to happen. So that&#8217;s how I feel about that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about your coaching business, which is called Spark Your Creative. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Well, Spark Your Creative is about working with people primarily at midlife, those who are over 40, who want to either engage or reclaim their creative life. For example, if you gave up a lot of your creative life because you got married and had kids, or you were kind of shuttled into a different career choice. Those of your listeners that may be in my age group that came up in the &#8217;80s, let&#8217;s say, I graduated from high school in the late &#8217;80s and went to college in the late &#8217;80s, so during that time period, unless you came from a family that was extremely creative, we were not encouraged to go to art school or to engage in these artistic kinds of endeavors that the millennials and Generation Z is being encouraged to do. Now it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh yeah, do it. Do this, do what you want to do.&#8221; But in those days, our parents were about, &#8220;You need to make money.&#8221;</p>
<p>And their viewpoint&#8230; And nothing wrong with that, but that&#8217;s just how it was at that time, it was the starving artist stereotype. &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to make money. You need to go into business.&#8221; And so it was all about business, engineering, healthcare, law, those kinds of activities was really big at that time. And so just like everyone else, I along with a lot of people I know did what we went to school to do to become employable. So that&#8217;s what we did.</p>
<p>And so what I found as I went along is a lot of people were like me that just sort of got derailed from some of their more creative kinds of goals or interests. And I am there to help people kind of develop the confidence and say, &#8220;Okay, it&#8217;s cool. You can do this. You can do this.&#8221; And help them come up with a plan to help them get back on the road to doing whatever it is that they&#8217;re interested in doing creatively. So that might be if they were doing art like visual art, if they were playing an instrument and was interested in going back to that, if they are interested in writing and writing a novel, maybe he&#8217;s always wanted to write a novel, those kinds of things. So it&#8217;s mostly cultural creatives, but I&#8217;m willing to work and have worked with people that, for example, wanted to start a podcast or wanted to put together a portfolio of their creative work. So it can go beyond just coaching and helping them unblock, it can go into some administrative things. That&#8217;s what Spark Your Creative is designed to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does a typical day look like for you, because it sounds like with doing that kind of work, you&#8217;re probably really involved with your clients on a regular basis?</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
It depends on the client, and it depends on what&#8217;s going on. If I&#8217;m working on&#8230; For example, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re familiar with The Artist&#8217;s Way by Julia Cameron.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve done several of a course in that book. So sometimes it looks like making sure that people understand what the assignments are and giving them information such as the whole thing with morning pages, writing three long hand pages every morning. Some people, for example, they don&#8217;t know what to write, they&#8217;re just stuck. So it might be providing private portal information and support resources for some of those students or clients or whatever you want to call participants in that course. It might look like sending an email following up on a client session. It might look like doing a call with someone via Zoom or meeting them. And I guess I&#8217;m getting back to meeting in person, so meeting them and talking with them about their creative goals and where they are. It might look like engaging people on social media. It might look like making sure that I get my newsletter out in time. It might look like doing a workshop or promoting a workshop. It&#8217;s all kinds of things, it depends on the day and what&#8217;s going on. So that&#8217;s pretty much it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve mentioned the book that you&#8217;re working on. Are there any sort of other specific projects you&#8217;re doing through Spark Your Creative like workshops or things like that?</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Yes. I&#8217;m getting ready to do another Artist&#8217;s Way course, but I&#8217;m going to call it Artist&#8217;s Way Light, because that&#8217;s 12 pages, and that&#8217;s a long time to be in a course. So I&#8217;m going to cut that in half. And I do that with Delray Artisan. So that will most likely be virtual so we can allow for people from different parts of the country to participate. And looking to start that around March of this year. I think the other thing that I will be doing is creating a workshop or a course around my book, which will probably be launched maybe late spring or the fall. We&#8217;re going to see how things go with the book.</p>
<p>And one of the other things I do, I&#8217;m a Yoga Nidra guide, and so I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re familiar with Yoga Nidra, but it&#8217;s basically a meditation style of yoga where you&#8217;re not moving, you&#8217;re just still, and you listen to a person kind of lead you through several levels of consciousness. And it&#8217;s a great tool for people who are creative and need a way to unblock. And so I plan to do more of those. I was doing them around the full moon&#8230; Or not the full moon, the new moon each month, so I may be doing that again or might be doing it more around the solstices. So we&#8217;ll see how that goes. So those are just a few of the things I&#8217;m going to be doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you also have a podcast too, you&#8217;re doing a lot.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Yes, I have a podcast, and that&#8217;s the Spark Your Creative podcast. And the one thing I love about that podcast is that it gives me an opportunity to talk to creatives in real time about a variety of different subjects regarding creativity. And I&#8217;ve done some series&#8217; dealing with everything from creating during uncertain times, particularly in the midst of the pandemic and the social upheaval and trying to help creative stay focused. Filling The Well is one that I did that is focusing on self-care for yourself and staying mentally and physically and emotionally healthy so you can create. But then I also interview people on a variety of different topics that are of interest to creatives, whether it&#8217;s creative anxiety, whether it&#8217;s working with essential oils, whether it&#8217;s working in a creative community, just a variety of different things.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s one of my favorite aspects of my business, and it&#8217;s a wonderful way to outreach to people on topics that they may not hear otherwise. There&#8217;s a lot of, of course, creative podcasts out there, but I like to think that I do it kind of unique. And I try to engage and invite guests that are in the age group of my target population, so they see themselves or hear themselves talking about these different issues.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, that sounds great. I&#8217;ll make sure that we include a link to the podcast in the show notes so people can get a chance to check it out.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, when you&#8217;re starting on a project, and it sounds like there&#8217;s a lot of projects that you&#8217;re working on, what does your creative process look like?</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
That&#8217;s interesting. I think it really depends on what it is and what&#8217;s driving me and inspiring me at the moment. For my business, a lot of my inspiration comes from the input I get from clients and people that engage in my workshops. So if they talk about something or share a source of frustration or something that they need help with, that helps me to create programs, workshops, the book, that I can provide them as a way of support. And so once I get the idea, it&#8217;s just sort of mapping it out, talking to people. What would be engaging to you, what format, and then go with that. And that might be a podcast, it might be a blog, it might be a workshop, so it depends. And most likely, there&#8217;s probably at least two out of the three that I do. It could end up being a podcast and a blog or a workshop and a podcast or some variation of the three.</p>
<p>So once I get the ideal going, I just map it out and let it flow. Sometimes it can be really quick, like if I do blog topics, I just knock it out in an hour or so. If it&#8217;s a podcast idea, that would take longer because I&#8217;m usually looking for someone that could really be engaging or has a perspective that I think that would be of interest to people, so they would be able to listen and find that person interesting. And by the way, with podcasts, I don&#8217;t do famous people. I mean, if I do, I have interviewed a few popular people in the creativity field, but for the most part, I just try to do everyday people because I want my audience to know that it&#8217;s not about popular people who have resources and all this other stuff that can do these things. I want people that sound like them. &#8220;I&#8217;m balancing taking care of my grandma or my mother and getting these kids into college and&#8230;&#8221; Those kinds of people.</p>
<p>So yes, there are some people that appear on there that if you&#8217;re in the creativity field, but for the most part, my audience is not necessarily following those people. They may not even know who they are. I know them, but they&#8217;re not impressed by that they&#8217;re impressed with the topic. And the podcast that I have with regular people just sharing their truth is the ones I get feedback on the most, so yeah.</p>
<p>Now, as far as my own creative practice with my art, I decided to focus on looking at the &#8217;40s, the &#8217;50s and the &#8217;60s, which wasn&#8217;t that long ago. But those were crazy and very dark. And it could be very dark times with the exception of the &#8217;60s with civil rights really coming into view and things moving and changing. But particularly the &#8217;40s and the &#8217;50s because, and even earlier, because there was so much going on, there was lynchings that were still happening, there was a lot of violence, a lot of miscarrying of justice. And I wanted to find photos where people were smiling, where people were showing joy because it was a reminder to me that despite what I feel is crazy town right now, these people, my ancestors, your ancestors, our relatives, people still found a way to find joy through those dark times. And if they could give us an example about how they used joy as resilience, as a way of resilience, that could kind of inform us.</p>
<p>So I started the series called Joy and Resilience, and it&#8217;s been a blessing because those works have been placed in a lot of different exhibitions. And I&#8217;m still working on it, I&#8217;m still creating work as part of that series. And so when I think of my creative process, the social unrest, all of that, because that was new to your generation and mine, we didn&#8217;t experience all that. I was born in the &#8217;60s, so I wasn&#8217;t conscious when a lot of things were going on. It&#8217;s been my way also of feeling some sort of kinship with my ancestors and with others saying that, &#8220;Okay, we&#8217;ll survive this. We&#8217;ll survive this.&#8221; So that inspired my creative process, and that inspired the photographs that I chose and the kinds of images I wanted to convey with that art.</p>
<p>Poetry has been a little different. It seems like relationships kind of got to that. It was my way of dealing with relationships that went sideways or relationships that I was enjoying. It just seems like whoever I&#8217;m dating&#8230; And not everybody, but certain people I&#8217;ve dated have been the muse for me to share my thoughts in writing. Out of all of the different creative processes, that&#8217;s been the most spontaneous. That&#8217;s like you get on the subway or the metro here, and I take my phone, something will come in my head and I&#8217;ll just write it all out. That&#8217;s how it comes to me for the poetry. So that&#8217;s funny because that has a whole different muse, that has a whole different process, where the others have a little bit more, I don&#8217;t know, research or contemplation to it, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, that makes sense. I mean, I think it&#8217;s really interesting that your different creative practices kind of have these different, I don&#8217;t know, sources of inspiration, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Yeah, and ways of showing up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
But I think it&#8217;s cool, and that makes things so interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s kind of learn more about your origin story. I mean, you&#8217;ve kind of alluded a bit to it just now earlier, but tell me about where you grew up, where you&#8217;re originally from.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Well, I was born in the Philadelphia, but I was raised primarily in Upstate New York, near Syracuse, New York.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Know anything about that part of the country or that part of the state? Which is what they call Central New York, Central Upstate New York. So I went to school and graduated from high school and all that up there. My parents were very encouraging to me with art. I think that your parents have great things and not so great things, but one of the great things about my parents were they created a atmosphere for me to be a creative being. And so I really give them props for that because I hear a lot of people talk about where their parents didn&#8217;t seem to encourage them to create at all, but that was not the case in my household.</p>
<p>And then I went to college in Virginia at St. Paul&#8217;s, and that was sort of the point where I kind of got derailed from the whole art thing. Even though they encouraged that, it was not something&#8230; It was more or less, at least with my dad anyway, that if you&#8217;re going to do college and if I&#8217;m going to pay for it, art thing is nice, but maybe you take that up later. I think you should consider a major that you&#8217;re going to make some money and be able to live. And so I ended up going and getting a business degree in marketing. And then I worked for a while after that. When I was in college, I didn&#8217;t do any art stuff at all. No art. A lot of my peers did not know I was an artist until really in the last 10 years, they didn&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Yeah, because of Facebook. They didn&#8217;t know. And a lot of people were shocked about it because I didn&#8217;t do it while I was there. It just&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I think about that sometimes. But anyway, I went to work in the public sector. That was not planned. I was planning to work in the corporate and private sector, but I had opportunities in the public sector, so I did that. Primarily in public health, which was very different than my major. But I had a love of that, particularly social marketing, which was the term before social media, but social marketing. And you probably know a lot about that anyway, about the types of campaigns and stuff that focus on behavior change.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
And so I really liked that. And so after I lived in Richmond, Virginia, for a few years and then decided to get my master&#8217;s, I went to Clark-Atlanta, and I got a job down there too. So I was working and going to school. And I really liked the public sector, so I got my master&#8217;s in public administration there. But that&#8217;s when the whole art thing started coming back. I was working, had graduated and started working for a major government agency down there. And every time&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re based in Atlanta or know Atlanta really well, but at that time they had Atlanta School of the Arts there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
And every time I would come downtown, I lived in the burbs, but when I would come downtown to go somewhere or whatever on 75 South, and right there where 75 and 85 merges, if you&#8217;re coming from the north, if you look on your right, you would&#8217;ve saw the school title. It&#8217;s now Savannah School of Art or part of that. And I used to be like&#8230; I started getting these little&#8230; Kind of little taps in my head, I guess. I don&#8217;t know. It was just like this little voice would say, &#8220;Okay, you need to sign up for some classes over there.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;What?&#8221; And it would always happen.</p>
<p>And it got to the point I wouldn&#8217;t even look at the school, because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do this.&#8221; And at that time, I was in my early 30s, so I was like&#8230; Now it&#8217;s nothing, but at that age I felt like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to be the oldest one in the classroom, and what makes me think I&#8217;m an artist? And maybe that was just in my head? How can you call yourself an artist? You haven&#8217;t done this stuff in&#8230; You&#8217;re not an artist, you&#8217;re just going to make a fool out of yourself.&#8221; And it kept me from doing it.</p>
<p>But on a dare, a very good friend of mine at the time when I was&#8230; I think it was the summer before I started working at the agency or before. Anyway, we were working together on a project, and she kind of dared me to volunteer for the National Black Arts Festival. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re familiar with that, but-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. And that year, it was interesting because it was a lot of stuff going on. I had been working so hard, I didn&#8217;t even realize that that was part of the culture down there. And somehow she brought that to my attention, and I was like, &#8220;Okay, cool.&#8221; We signed up, and I became a docent for one of the exhibitions. Actually, it was a doll exhibition, which was interesting because my sister ended up a taking up creating dolls, which was&#8230; Now that I think of it, that was so wild how that happened. But I also went to&#8230; Clark-Atlanta has a gallery.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm, on Park Street</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Yes. And went there, and they were talking about the exhibition that was there. At the time, it was To Preserve a Legacy, which was artwork from a number of historically black colleges and universities from across the country. I mean, it was just a jaw dropping&#8230; For me, it just changed everything. That&#8217;s all I could say. I learned so much about the art and about these different colleges&#8217; collections. I went through the little docent training over there at Clark-Atlanta and the stuff that they were saying, and they&#8217;re talking about these pieces and these artists. And I went to lectures at Spelman that they had that summer with different artists. I mean, it just blew my mind.</p>
<p>And there was something that was lit inside of me. The following year or two, I ended up moving up here to take a job in Washington DC, and within two years, I think, two or three years, I started taking art classes. One starting off at the Smithsonian and then some of the local art centers in this area, and started showing my work. But yeah, Atlanta was it for me. That whole thing was just&#8230; It was just unexpected. Every time I think about it, a smile comes on my face because I was like&#8230; It was just so much fun, and we were around all these different people, and I was learning so much, and it was just sort of like, &#8220;Wow, all this is going on.&#8221; But that&#8217;s how it happened.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. So as you&#8217;re mentioning all of this, I mean, I live in Atlanta, I live near the AUC, so I know about Spelman, I know about Clark, I know about the church over on Park Street where Clark-Atlanta&#8217;s art department is, even the National Black Arts Festival. I don&#8217;t know if&#8230; Does the name Leatrice Ellzy, does that sound familiar to you?</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
She was the executive director. I think she still is the executive director. She was there for a while, at least when I was working with the National Black Arts Festival. I don&#8217;t know if&#8230; It doesn&#8217;t sound like she might have been affiliated with them yet, but I am familiar with the National Black Arts Festival. It still takes place here. I think it still does. But yeah, it&#8217;s so interesting how Atlanta, I guess, I don&#8217;t know, sparked your creativity in a way. You were looking at, seeing the Atlanta College of Art, and then you&#8217;re getting inspired by Spelman and by Clark. I really love to hear that, because I think when people think of HBCUs, they don&#8217;t necessarily think of design and art and creativity and-</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; it sounds like for you it was kind of the opposite, you really kind of got inspired by that.</p>

Well, it&#8217;s interesting because art and creativity apparently was very much a part of a lot of these schools. And it&#8217;s kind of interesting because when I was working with that particular program and learning so much about these different HBCUs and how they had really thriving art programs and there was a few renowned African American artists that were working at these schools, I was like, &#8220;Wow, this is some serious stuff.&#8221; And it&#8217;s not something that, as you said, that&#8217;s really talked that much about, and that was the magic to Preserve a Legacy, that particular exhibition. And I still have the catalog from that show and the poster. And matter of fact, when you first enter my home, that&#8217;s the first thing you see, is that poster.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
And it just sort of gives me a sense of what I&#8217;m doing and why I&#8217;m doing it. And I will also dare say, it&#8217;s interesting, though my college was not represented in that exhibition, art was very much a part of that years ago. Matter of fact, weekend before last, some sorority sisters and I, we all pledged together, we kind of did a reunion weekend. And one of the things that we did was went by a program office that&#8217;s affiliated with the college. The college has closed, but they still are working on a number of different projects down there. And they just reopened a portion of St. Paul&#8217;s. And we went to visit, and it was interesting, there was these old yearbooks that they had around. And you had a chance to read through them. There were some from my era, and I was like, &#8220;Ooh, I guess we&#8217;re archival now.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there was some older ones. And there was also some photographs and information about an artist in residence that was at St. Paul&#8217;s, and how this artist was working with the students on a lot of art projects and everything. And I said, &#8220;Wow, this is something&#8230; Art has always been a part of African American culture and a part of the academic or academia.&#8221; And it&#8217;s something that I think, as you said, we don&#8217;t talk about it that much. I think the last time I did see something was&#8230; I was in New Orleans. One of the Historically Black Colleges there had the work of their students at one of the museums downtown. And I thought that was really cool to see that.</p>
<p>And I can&#8217;t remember which school or which museum, but it was good to see that. So I think that&#8217;s something, as you said, I would really like to see. There&#8217;s a lot of emphasis on HBCUs right now, and I really would like to see somebody really revitalize that particular exhibition, maybe put a different twist to it, maybe include a more contemporary artist than what they had in the traveling show back then, because there&#8217;s a lot of younger artists that are in different generations that I think should be showcased, and to let people know that, hey, a lot of art and culture is based at HBCUs. So I think that that&#8217;s definitely something to think about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think that would be fantastic, definitely.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
I would love it. Oh gosh, I would love it, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, you got inspired in Atlanta, you moved up to the DMV, what kind of made you decide to strike out on your own with starting Spark Your Creative?</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Well, prior to once I got here, I was involved in another entrepreneurial effort. That one, it actually had two&#8230; Well, the first iteration was Authentic Art Consulting, and then it was Artinista Art Advisory. And both of them were focused more on&#8230; Well, the first one was focused more on working with artists and art locations to put together curated art shows of emerging artists in the DC area. So I was doing a lot of art exhibitions and collaborating with different people on creative activities and showcasing visual art and visual artists in this area. And then I decided I wanted to focus more on the collector, making sure that art education for the collector. So I started the Artinista Art Advisory primarily was to focus on women who wanted to add art to their portfolios as a way of investment.</p>
<p>And so I did those, and then I became&#8230; I guess the word disenchanted with the art world. Well, it&#8217;s funny, I had hurt my back. These things start with weird&#8230; I hurt my back in 2015, and I found myself basically flat on my back trying to heal. And something just told me, &#8220;This is not for me.&#8221; The art world is a little&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re involved with fine art world where you are or know how that world works, but it&#8217;s very&#8230; It can be glamorous, but it can be very cold, and it can be a little cutting too if you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing. And I became disenchanted with some of that vibe. And I felt I wanted to continue to work in the field, but I just didn&#8217;t feel like I wanted to do exhibitions anymore or interface with museum people and galleries and&#8230; Yeah, I just didn&#8217;t want to do it anymore.</p>
<p>And it was wearing me down, and I didn&#8217;t think my personality fit that. I&#8217;m more of a touchy-feely girl. I wasn&#8217;t hardcore. I was really into the artists and what their vision was and not necessarily, well, you got to sell this stuff and blah, blah. It just wasn&#8217;t working. And a few things had happened, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think this&#8230;&#8221; And so, I really had been toying with the fact of creativity coaching. And I&#8217;ve known about it, but I just didn&#8217;t&#8230; and kind of looked at it, but never followed through. And so I decided to do it because I was like&#8230; A lot of artists were talking to me about how to do things, and I felt that worked more with my personality than working on that side. So I became certified and started working kind of doing workshops and stuff in that rein, that area, and just enjoyed talking to artists and just enjoyed that whole process. And so it worked out well for me.</p>
<p>And I think that&#8217;s something to say too, when it comes back to it&#8217;s never too late or whatever, if you got to pivot, pivot. I think sometimes people get&#8230; And it was hard because people knew me in one area. Some people were a little resistant to deal with this other area. So rebranding yourself can be tough, but my thing is, do it, do if you need to do it. And I probably will rebrand again. One of the things that I&#8217;m really interested in outside of really dealing with artists and working with them is also working with regular folks and lay folks to deal with some of the stuff that&#8217;s going on where people need a way to express themselves, whether it&#8217;s grief, whether it&#8217;s whatever. And so that&#8217;s probably a new direction that I&#8217;ll be going on in some way in the next two years as well. There&#8217;s always something going on with Sharon Burton. She&#8217;s always thinking about something.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m glad you mentioned this part about pivoting. We had someone on the show a couple of episodes ago, Nikita Pope, who was also talking about the power of pivoting and knowing when you have the opportunity to do so and just going kind of forward with it. I think it takes a lot of confidence to be able to do that. And I think we&#8217;re releasing this episode at the start of the year. It seems like you have a boundless supply of creative confidence, just from what you&#8217;ve talked about so far. For people out there that are listen, what advice would you give them to build their confidence up and help engage their creativity?</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
I think one of the things that I try to make sure people understand, that we&#8217;re all creative. And that might sound trite and all that, but it&#8217;s really true. We all have creativity inside us, it&#8217;s whether or not we want to engage that. So my thing is, acknowledge that you are creative no matter what. Even if you can&#8217;t draw a straight line or play an instrument, or, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do&#8230; Get rid of all that, because you are creative. For example, I know people that are great with their makeup. I mean, this is a weird situation, but this is an example. People are artistic with&#8230; Women that put eyeshadow on and eyeliner and all that. You know that&#8217;s a form of artwork?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a form of adornment. And so if you can make your eyes and shade those colors and make everything pop and sing and whatever with your face, you can do art. And people don&#8217;t even think about it, but it shows up in different ways. So the first thing is, acknowledge that you&#8217;re creative. The second thing is, just like they talk about in business, and I&#8217;m not saying art has to be a business, but also think about this, what is your why? A lot of people are saying that now, &#8220;What is your why? Why are you doing this?&#8221; Well, what is it, what is your why? why Are you thinking about doing something creative? Is it just a stress reliever? Is it that, &#8220;Oh, I want to show my work in a gallery, or I want to recite poetry at these spoken word things.&#8221; Or is just, &#8220;I just want to share it with my family?&#8221; Be clear on what your why is.</p>
<p>And I say that because some people, when it comes to creative kinds of endeavors, you automatically find yourself comparing yourself to other people. And when you compare yourself to other people, that tells me that you&#8217;re lost on what your why is. Because if you&#8217;re doing this for you or you&#8217;re doing this to fulfill a dream that you have, it&#8217;s not about all these other people. But if you find yourself getting frustrated because, oh, she just posted that on Instagram and that&#8217;s way better than mine, and I ain&#8217;t going to show that, was that your why?</p>
<p>Were you going to be competing against these people, or do you saw yourself that? Or were you saying, &#8220;I want to share my art with the world. I want to make people happy.&#8221; If you&#8217;re not clear on your why, you can get derailed very easily. And yes, there&#8217;s always going to be somebody better than you, whether it&#8217;s music, poetry, dance, you name it, graphic design. There&#8217;s always going to be somebody better than you. But is that your goal to do this? Is it for joy? Is it because you want to exercise creative freedom or whatever? Be clear on that because that&#8217;s going to be your North Star when things don&#8217;t go so well.</p>
<p>And then I think the other thing is to find a community or a group of people that are doing what you&#8217;re interested in doing, and get involved with them. That could be an art group, it could be a music group, it could be a poetry group. And make sure that they&#8217;re supportive of you. You don&#8217;t want something that&#8217;s like people are just way advanced and you&#8217;re coming in as a beginner, but you want a group that maybe takes people at different levels that provide workshops and professional development and support for you. That&#8217;s something that I really recommend. I wish I could have done that a little earlier than what I did.</p>
<p>I think the other thing is just to go ahead and try and just find ways to carve out time in your schedule, whether it&#8217;s daily or weekly, to get it done. Now, a lot of people say, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t have time.&#8221; Yeah, you do have time. You have time when you&#8217;re scrolling your social media, you have time when you&#8217;re doing all these other things. It&#8217;s putting it on your calendar and making it a priority just like anything else in finding ways to do that. So those are my tips.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Those are some good tips. I like that. I think it is important to kind of really&#8230; It&#8217;s funny you say, &#8220;What is your why?&#8221; I know in business, I think they call that your USP, your unique selling proposition or something like that. But finding out the why behind why you&#8217;re doing what you want to do is important, because that really is going to fuel you when perhaps it&#8217;s not taking off in the way that you want to. Maybe it&#8217;s not becoming an instant success or you&#8217;re not instantly getting some sort of a claim for it, but if you have an underlying reason and a passion behind why you&#8217;re doing it, that&#8217;s what will fuel you.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Definitely. And again, instead of&#8230; Because it&#8217;s just when you don&#8217;t have a why, you get derailed. One person says something about your art, and then you ain&#8217;t doing it no more. &#8220;I&#8217;m not an art&#8230;&#8221; You have to be clear on what your why is and let that be your guide. And a note on that, we have critics and we have people that provide healthy advice. And you&#8217;re going to get judged putting your stuff out there, whether it&#8217;s poetry, writing, music, if you&#8217;re into performance, you&#8217;re putting yourself out there, and it takes a certain amount of bravery to do it. I have gotten to the point I don&#8217;t care what people think.</p>
<p>And I guess maybe I&#8217;ve also developed a style that has improved over time. But what gets me is that when I get into a juried show, that means somebody has picked my work and they think it&#8217;s good enough to be a part of this show. And that, to me, is important. Whether it sells or not doesn&#8217;t matter to me. My thing, it&#8217;s being shown. I am contributing to the world with my art. Someone sees it, and that&#8217;s important to me. If I sell it, that&#8217;s just a piece of cake, that&#8217;s icing on the cake. But if I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t let it bother me because eventually I do sell it, or I give it as a gift, or it ends up being donated somewhere. It gets a home. I&#8217;m also lucky that I don&#8217;t rely on my art to live. Maybe I would be a little different if that was the case, but I&#8217;m blessed to be able to create, I&#8217;m blessed to be able to take a theme and interpret that and put that out there for people. That&#8217;s good for me.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s my why. My why is about providing beauty, about sharing my gift to the world. Whether you see it as a gift or not, I don&#8217;t care. But it&#8217;s taken me a while. Because I used to feel some kind of way about my art, but I also know I&#8217;ve improved. And that&#8217;s the other thing too, if you feel that you&#8217;re not at the level you want to be, you can always take classes in anything. And now it&#8217;s even&#8230; So if you don&#8217;t find something near you, you can take something virtually. It&#8217;s not like it used to be where&#8230; Well, nobody&#8217;s doing violin lessons in this area. Well, get online, see if somebody&#8217;s doing it on Zoom or something. There&#8217;s a lot of more opportunities than there used to be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, absolutely. You mentioned earlier that you&#8217;re in the process of writing a book. Is the book going to be about this kind of thing, about inspiring people to pursue their creative dreams?</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Most definitely. This is a book of affirmations and creativity tips for creatives at midlife. And it actually deals with a lot of common things that creatives deal with, whether it&#8217;s dealing with certain blocks, naysayers, people that talk about them or they&#8217;re not encouraging of their creative life. And then it has affirmations. And I also encourage you to create your own affirmation. So it&#8217;s not just, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m just going to use the affirmation that she puts in there.&#8221; No, I have some journaling exercises where I ask you, &#8220;Take a look at, okay, if it was a naysayer, where did you hear that before? Who was the first person that said something crazy about your art or your creative endeavor?&#8221; And then one thing that people don&#8217;t pay attention to, let&#8217;s say on Facebook or something like that, people post things and there&#8217;s always somebody that says something positive about what you post, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
But we don&#8217;t pay attention to that. We don&#8217;t, we get caught up in this person over here that says something negative. And so my thing is, go on your page, go on wherever you are, and last time&#8230; Even if you emailed it to somebody and they said something, let&#8217;s write down what those folks said, because those are the people that are in your corner, and those are the people that are talking to you in a positive way and encouraging you. And those are the types of messages you need to hear. So that&#8217;s an example of that. And then I challenge people to write their own affirmations based on those messages that they can see and they can put up in their studio or whatever, and wherever in the house that reminds them that they are worthy and that they are a creative and what they&#8217;re doing is positive and good. So that&#8217;s what the book is about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you appreciate the most about your life right now? I mean, I feel like you&#8217;re kind of in this renaissance period almost with all these creative things that you&#8217;re working on.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a very good question, Maurice. I think I&#8217;m at a place where I can show up the way that I want to. It&#8217;s taken me a long time to do that. When I was in my 20s and 30s, I was not comfortable showing up as a poet or as an artist. I didn&#8217;t even think I was really an artist. I just thought, &#8220;Well, that must have been something I like to do, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m an artist.&#8221; Yeah, no, I was an artist. I am an artist. I like the fact that I can do poetry, I can do art, two things that I truly love. And even writing, this has been probably&#8230; Writing this book has been probably one of my most challenging things I&#8217;ve ever done. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever written a book, but it is no joke, really.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s not. I&#8217;m working on my book now, actually.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s no joke.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
It is no joke, okay. And procrastination and all this stuff that goes&#8230; I probably go through now, maybe because this is new, this is where my creative confidence is not as strong maybe as it is in those other areas, but it&#8217;s also new and it&#8217;s also different. But I think the thing I do like now, if something, not that I&#8217;m wishing anything to happen, nor am I bringing that energy in, but if something were to happen to me, I think I can say I am at a point in my life where I&#8217;m not afraid of my self-expression, whether people like it or not. And I think to get here, it took a long time because it took a lot of courage, it took a lot of work on myself and self-awareness, period, to be able to express myself in two ways that I love.</p>
<p>Even though I did visual art first, I did write a lot as a teenager. As a pre-teen and teenager, I wrote a lot of&#8230; They were actually song lyrics. They were music in my head, and I would just write the words to them. But poetry, that&#8217;s what it is really. And so I was doing both since I was very young. And to return to it and to return to it and the way that I&#8217;ve had, which is beyond my expectation or my dreams, to me, is awesome. It is just awesome to be in exhibitions, to have my poetry in a chatbook with some other poets that I admire and have that published, without me contributing any money. Hello. All of that. It&#8217;s magic. It&#8217;s just beautiful to me. I feel really humbled that the universe has allowed me to do that.</p>
<p>And a lot of people, they get my age and they&#8217;ve never done any of those things. And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to let people know that you can do that. I&#8217;m nothing special, except that I had the time and a little bit of the resources to make some things happen. And some things I just fell into. Like the poetry book, I fell into that group. I didn&#8217;t even know when I joined them. I didn&#8217;t know they were trying to put together a book. I just was in there and nobody said nothing. We just talked, and next thing I know, they said, &#8220;All right, we&#8217;re going to get the book together.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What book?&#8221; So I think sometimes you&#8217;re just in the right place at the right time with the right people. And it&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m not trying to be at Art Basel in Miami or at the art fairs in New York. If that happened, that&#8217;s beautiful, but that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m doing all this for. I&#8217;m doing it for me. It&#8217;s doing it to share my love to the world. And to be able to do that in two things I love, oh, not many people can say that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
I&#8217;m blowing my own mind right now talking about it Because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t even thought about that question/&#8221; Well, that&#8217;s serious. That&#8217;s a serious question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, to that-</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
A lot of people can&#8217;t say anything about that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, to that end, where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing? What sort of new work do you want to be doing, that kind of thing?</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Well, I think what I&#8217;d like to do is, of course, continue with both the poetry and the visual art. With my business, I&#8217;d like to expand that to be more therapeutic for people because we&#8217;ve just gone through so much right now. And no matter who you are, what your color is or your background, we all have survived a very major upheaval in time. Sometimes, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s enough support for people. There&#8217;s not enough therapy, and some people aren&#8217;t comfortable with traditional kinds of things. And I think I want to be in a position to help people work through their self, to open themselves to self-expression in a different way.</p>
<p>I have a very good friend of mine who&#8217;s been through a lot. I feel he has problems expressing himself and processing a lot that has happened to him. And I think if he were to do something creative, I think he would find a way to express himself and lift that load without feeling too vulnerable. And I think a lot of people are like that. Some people are in denial that they&#8217;re not happy or that they&#8217;re not able to&#8230;</p>
<p>I know another friend who&#8217;s&#8230; She&#8217;s very stoic and kind of comes off as if, well, these things happen and blah, blah blah. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;But you just lost your mother, and we&#8217;re going through COOVID, and all this other stuff.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like she acts like she didn&#8217;t lose her mom or any&#8230; I mean, she&#8217;s upset about it, but you can tell she just pushes and pushes, but she&#8217;s not expressing herself, she&#8217;s not letting it out. And that causes conflict with people. And people will say, &#8220;Well, so-and-so is a B and blah, blah, blah.&#8221; Well, they may not really be that way, they&#8217;re just not expressing themselves about the grief and the hurt and the trauma that they&#8217;ve experienced over here. And they may be using you as a punching bag because that&#8217;s the only thing that they can do. That&#8217;s the only thing they feel comfortable doing.</p>
<p>So I think a lot of people could use art in a way because when you express yourselves artistically, sometimes, yeah, you&#8217;re vulnerable, but it&#8217;s a different kind of vulnerability than you saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m drowning over here. I need help.&#8221; You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
I think particularly my generation, we don&#8217;t do a lot to take care of our mental health, as we should. I think we&#8217;re learning to from the younger generation and getting a clue, but I think men and women need a lot of help. They need to work through their grief, they need to work through their anger. And a lot has happened, even before COVID and all that. But I always tell people, COVID brought out everybody&#8217;s inner child, and whatever you were dealing with as a child, COVID came right on out when people were told, &#8220;You stay in, and wear a mask, and stay six feet away from people.&#8221; People fought it, they fought that.</p>
<p>And then those that didn&#8217;t fight it, now that we&#8217;re coming out of it, it&#8217;s coming back, the pent up stuff. And if you&#8217;re not aware of what was going on with you as a kid&#8230; I&#8217;m not a therapist or anything, so please. But we have to be aware of ourselves, we have to be aware of our triggers are. And I think that art is one way that you can get it out without harming other people. It&#8217;s a good way. So I see myself doing more on a little more therapeutic side. I really want to do expressive art and work with people on that. I think that that&#8217;s needed, and I think that&#8217;s going to be needed for some time now, so yeah.</p>

All right, sounds good. Well, Sharon Burton, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I can not think of a better way to start off the year with having someone that has such a wellspring of creativity to share with people. Hearing your confidence about your creativity, I think it certainly is inspiring me. I hope it inspires other people out there as well to really get out there and start to do their own thing as well this year. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Oh, no problem. This has been one of my favorite podcast interviews, actually. You had me thinking, so I do appreciate that. And I look forward to hearing from some of your listeners about their thoughts about their own creativity and how they express themselves. I think it&#8217;s an important thing.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re wrapping up 2022 by sitting down with the immensely talented Shakeil Greeley. I love that his portfolio consists of all kinds of creative projects, including fine art and writing. Who says design has to be all about visuals?</p>
<p>Shakeil and I started off talking about his work as an art director at Splice, as well as his new role at Spring Health. He also talked about growing up between Portland and Philly, studying at the University of Pennsylvania&#8217;s Visual Studies program, and then landing at GQ doing digital art direction and editorial strategy. Shakeil also spoke about the <a href="https://imaginaryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Imaginary School</a> and the <a href="https://www.aroko.coop/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">&Agrave;r&ograve;ko Cooperative</a> (formerly Design to Divest), and shared how both projects are important to him in terms of community building.</p>
<p>There are so many opportunities to use design to make the world a better place, and I&#8217;m glad that there are designers like Shakeil Greeley who are using their skills to make that happen.</p>
<p>From all of us here at Revision Path, thank you for all your support this year. Next year marks our 10th anniversary, so stick around for what&#8217;s coming up in 2023!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Hey there. My name is Shakeil Greeley. I am a creative director and designer based in Brooklyn, New York. And I use design, strategy, and art to create more equitable, open, and imaginative worlds.</p>
<p>So in my day job, I&#8217;m an art director at a music company called Splice. Although I&#8217;m soon to be moving on to a new role as creative director of a mental healthcare company. In addition to that, I&#8217;m on the leadership teams of two organizations in particular. √Är√≤ko Cooperative, which is a Black owned design cooperative. And The Imaginary School, which is an online learning community and platform.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, that&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
It is. I stay very busy, and that&#8217;s not including any of the freelance work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, how was 2022 for you?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
2022 was frankly not the best year. I think it was a lot of time to just kind of process a lot of things that had gone on. Obviously, 2020 was very hectic for many reasons, as was 2021. And I think 2022, I definitely felt a lot of the emotional burnout from just the large existential events that were happening in the pandemic, and racial uprisings, and geopolitical developments, and such.</p>
<p>But also from just working a lot over the last 10 years basically. I&#8217;m one of those people who always has multiple side projects running and I think I&#8217;ve probably had three or four large side projects running at all times since I was a junior in college. And I think that really caught up to me after a while coming into this year. So it&#8217;s been a year of just rest, and reflection, and de-stressing, and unplugging that has definitely been productive. But I&#8217;m really looking forward to the things that are going to come in the next year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of that, is there anything from this year that you want to carry over into the next year?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I think one of the biggest things is my work with √Är√≤ko, because that has been an ongoing project for a number of years now, and we&#8217;re really getting to a spot where I think going into next year we&#8217;re going to be able to have folks working on that project for the first time. So all of the work we&#8217;ve been doing to kind of reposition because we were formally known as Design to Divest. So coming up with a mew name, new brand direction, and new strategy, all of that work has been really fruitful. And I&#8217;m really excited for that stuff to carry on into the new year, in particular in my kind of design practice and work practice.</p>
<p>But on a more personal note, I think just continuing to be reflective and really take time for myself. Those are two things that I&#8217;m really prioritizing the next year to not overwhelm myself with work, and just maintain a nice steady output while giving myself plenty of time to just relax and enjoy the fruits of my labor a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I heard that from a lot of people this year that I&#8217;ve had on the show that this year has kind of been a bit of almost a rebuilding year in some ways. And I think it&#8217;s because 2020 for a lot of us was just very hectic, aside from the racial reckoning, and the protest, and things that happened during the year. But just the pandemic on top of that with also not being able to travel and congregate and stuff. 2020 was really stressful for a lot of people. 2021, I think we were trying to emerge from it. And now this year, especially with boosters and with mandates becoming lax and things of that nature, we&#8217;re just trying to get back to some semblance of normalcy. Which I think for a lot of people this year that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s been. It&#8217;s been about trying to find ways to move forward when take the lessons that we&#8217;ve learned from the past couple of years on how to live in a more equitable kind of holistic sort of way.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Definitely. Yeah, I definitely feel that. So much has happened, and even heard in a couple of your recent interviews folks talking about the influx of things like clients, and new projects, and all of that after 2020. I know even on our end, we&#8217;re really having time to take stock and be like, &#8220;Okay, what are the kind of clients we actually really want to be taking on, and what are the kind of principles we want to be adhering to when we accept new projects?&#8221; And even for my own personal work I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Okay, I have limited time. I have limited energy, and I have a very specific set of goals I&#8217;m looking to accomplish in the world. What are the actual side projects I should be working on and doing at any given time?&#8221; And the conclusion has been maybe only one instead of the suite that I had been operating with previously.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now I know you mentioned that you are about to leave Splice. But you&#8217;ve served there as art director roughly for about what the past four years or so now. Talk to me about your work there.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So Splice has been a really interesting journey. I joined in February of 2019 and worked primarily on all their editorial and content marketing channels. So that includes the Splice blog, that includes Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, Reels. I also assist on things like video thumbnails and video ideas, and also focus onto things like content planning and content strategy. In addition to that, obviously there&#8217;s a whole art direction side. So that includes doing art direction for brand photo shoots where we are going to go cast 10 musicians from around New York City and shoot them in their own spaces and places, to shooting more kind of advertising focused shoots with sets, and set designers, and things that are a little more formalized.</p>
<p>So my work has really spanned a lot of different stuff in my time at Splice. I even was interviewing artists at one point for the blog, and I&#8217;ve worked with the product team on implementing stuff on the marketplace. So it&#8217;s a wide range of projects. And I think the core thing that&#8217;s interesting that ties it all together is Splice for those who don&#8217;t know is a music technology company. And Splice&#8217;s core offering is a marketplace of samples. So we&#8217;re really a creator-forward and creator-first company, which makes it fun as a creator myself to make work for people who have a creative eye, and have things like taste and know what they think is cool, and what they&#8217;re interested in. And might be working on their own album covers, or music videos, or social media strategies for themselves. So yeah, it&#8217;s been a really interesting journey and I&#8217;m excited to talk more about some of the individual specific pieces.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean it sounds like you were doing a lot outside of Art direction. I mean it sounds like it&#8217;s art direction, it&#8217;s creative strategy, it&#8217;s content strategy. It&#8217;s kind of a lot wrapped up under one title.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Definitely. And I think that&#8217;s part of the startup lifestyle. There&#8217;s always more to be done. And I think that also is tied into our team structure across both the creative organization, but also the content marketing team I&#8217;ve been working with. Where everyone&#8217;s very collaborative and very open to new ideas, which kind of led all of us to flex onto different stuff. So I worked with content strategists who were also making beats and were writers. And I&#8217;ve worked with writers who come up with their own content ideas and whole video franchises and things of that nature. So a lot of things going on, and a small amount of people working on them across the organization. But a really creative team, which is fun always.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me more about the team. What did that look like? You mentioned content strategist doing a lot also.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So the way our team is set up is my creative director, Meg V√°zquez is at the head of the brand organization. And then there&#8217;s kind of a flat structure that sits underneath her. So I am art direction. So that includes all content marketing basically, as well as these larger special projects. We have three designers on the team who all have their own areas of expertise, one of whom focuses on motion graphics and kind of brand design. One of them is a really strong brand owner and ensures that the Splice brand across services from employee merchandise to landing pages all feel consistent. And then there&#8217;s a designer who focuses primarily on growth marketing, and in addition to that we also have a copywriter.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s kind of a core creative team. In addition to that, there are two folks who work primarily on video. And then our sister team is the content marketing team in a lot of ways, where we work really closely with folks who do social media strategy for things like Twitter and TikTok. We have some folks who are really specific into one person runs the blog and is the editor energy for the blog. Someone is really specialized in music education and looking at how we can create different curriculums for people to learn music. I think it&#8217;s about eight or so people on each of those teams. And we support initiatives from across the rest of the organization as many content marketing and creative groups do. So we&#8217;ll take in work from things that we obviously generate on our own in our own editorial initiatives. But we also work with other teams around the company to tell the public and tell Splice users about new features, new pack releases, and just new projects that we&#8217;re working on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the most challenging part about working at Splice?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
This is an interesting question. Because I think there&#8217;s two things that are challenging. One of them is a palindrome almost if you will, of a challenge. But I think the first one is just that it is a startup still, and Splice is still figuring out just where it&#8217;s going to go and what it&#8217;s going to be in the future. And that&#8217;s always something that can be difficult for any organization, especially in the creative side. Because you&#8217;re having to deal with new projects coming up, or things getting deprioritized, or new initiatives getting spun up, and potential for wider company directions to change. So just being really adaptable. That&#8217;s been a challenge that I think I&#8217;ve personally grown from, and I know several people that have also really grown from that as well. But it&#8217;s never easy to have to change what you&#8217;re working on and change your focus with that level of frequency.</p>
<p>And I think the other thing that&#8217;s challenging about Splice but is also I think my favorite part about working at Splice is it&#8217;s a music company first and foremost, and people tend to be very passionate about music. And so naturally, we have a lot of people on staff who are super passionate about music making. Whether they are avid listeners or concept goers, or musicians themselves. And that means you have a lot of buy-in from folks and a lot of personal attachment to the work. And that&#8217;s great, but it can also cause friction at times when people are so personally invested in the work that they&#8217;re doing. So it&#8217;s a challenge, but I think it&#8217;s one that when we can unlock, it and when we can solve it, and when we can really work together in cool ways, it&#8217;s a huge benefit and makes working there really pleasurable. But it&#8217;s kind of a push and pull always there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I have to say, even as you&#8217;re describing it being the startup and then also being something that is really for music lovers and people who love music because it&#8217;s a music company, I would love something like that. I would love to work at a place that&#8217;s passionate about music, but then it&#8217;s also tech oriented, and design oriented. How big is Splice actually? Rough count.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I think somewhere between 200 and 250 if I&#8217;m not mistaken right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, that&#8217;s not too bad. I&#8217;ve mostly worked at startups that have been in that 50 to 60 person range, and that&#8217;s when stuff really starts getting really thorny. Because the old stalwarts that have been there like yourself that have been there for multiple years, and then you&#8217;ve got newer hires that expect a culture that&#8217;s another way. And you&#8217;re trying to do all this together in this kind of fast-paced environment. So for me, it sounds like something I&#8217;d be interested in, but that&#8217;s because I really like music. I was a musician myself for a lot of years. But especially during the past few years we&#8217;ve had, I could see how that could take its toll.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
And I think like I said, it&#8217;s a great problem to have where you have people who are really passionate about the work. But again, I think that that super deep level of passion and emotional investment when tied together with the trappings of a startup and things shifting. And priorities being not in flux all the time, but they do change naturally. I think it can just be a little difficult to make sure that everyone&#8217;s on the same page about where we&#8217;re all going.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s a challenge. But I think if you&#8217;re kind of ready to accept that ambiguity and really be open to flexing and taking on all these different things that you can really learn from and grow from, it&#8217;s an environment that I know I&#8217;ve learned and gained a lot from.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say has been the most rewarding part of working there?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I&#8217;m a real fan of my creative director, Meg V√°zquez. We worked together at GQ as well. And being able to work under her and really see what a good creative director looks like in action has been such a pleasure and an honor. And I think all the lessons I&#8217;ve learned from her and just how to manage a team, and empower people, and solve problems, and ensure creative integrity and all these things are a lot of lessons I know I&#8217;m going to be taking with me for the rest of my career. That&#8217;s been a real pleasure to work with her. And then also it just extends into the rest of the people that I&#8217;ve been able to work with. I think the people at Splice have just been such a pleasure, and we&#8217;ve been able to do some really cool stuff.</p>
<p>One of my close colleagues who&#8217;s a content strategist, his name&#8217;s Ken Herman, he&#8217;s Japanese American. Important context because we were both basically the leads on all social media at the time in 2020. Him being the strategist, me being the designer. And obviously, Splice is a music company. But we are also an American music company, which means that if you&#8217;re reading between the lines, we are a Black music company, whether the staffing reflects that or not. We are a music company that primarily prophets in Black created genres.</p>
<p>So Ken and I were like, &#8220;I think we need to make this a little clearer for everyone here and particular for all of our audience.&#8221; And not that our audience was pushing back on that idea a lot, but we really wanted to make it clear where Splice stood on these issues, and make it clear that we understood the responsibility we had.</p>
<p>So we got to come together and work on a series called As Told By that actually went and became Webby nominated. It was just a small social franchise where we took a specific social issue, whether it was something like the Iran-Contra scandal, or Rockefeller Laws, and went through and found a bunch of textual evidence of all kinds of hip hop artists kind of talking about these issues in their music. And really making an effort to not just&#8230; I think there&#8217;s a misconception for a lot of probably non-Black folks, but Black folks as well around what &#8216;conscious&#8217; rap can be. And folks like Jim Jones talk about the Rockefeller laws. It&#8217;s not just bound by those kind of genre constraints.</p>
<p>So having someone in my team that was super down to work on a project like that, and just do it together, and collaborate on the story, and the design. That kind of working environment I think is a great example of why I love working at Splice and love the people at Splice so much. Just really passionate, really intelligent, and really just down to collaborate and get into the weeds and work really closely together on stuff that they may not know front to back, but are really down to learn and figure it out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds really dope. Actually taking a look at the series now. You covered stuff like the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, the crack epidemic, the Rockefeller drug laws, United States of America versus Billie Holiday, assassination of Fred Hampton, the Iran-Contra affair, the war on drugs. And it&#8217;s all through the lyrics of musicians. Yeah, this is really cool. I have to check this out. This is really cool.</p>
<p>So I want to learn more about your background. I mean, of course we&#8217;re hearing about the creative work, and we&#8217;ll get into what you&#8217;re doing with √Är√≤ko Cooperative and The Imaginary School. But let&#8217;s start with your origin story.</p>
<p>On your website you mentioned that you&#8217;re born in Seattle, but you said you grew up between Portland and Philly, which feels like two wide ends of a spectrum in terms of culture. Portland, Oregon, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah, so I think a lot of my upbringing is a key theme being between different cultures. Because I&#8217;m biracial. My dad, he&#8217;s a white guy from the Pacific Northwest. And my mom grew up in Jamaica until she was about 18.</p>
<p>So they met in the Pacific Northwest and moved to Seattle. So I was born there, lived there for a couple of years. And then we moved to Portland, Oregon and lived a couple of years there. They split up, and then my mom moved to Philadelphia where my grandfather was living with his second wife and a lot of her family. So even over there, that&#8217;s Black Jamaicans, but also Black American side. And then I would spend basically my school time in Philadelphia. And then any vacation time, I would go spend with my dad in Portland. And it&#8217;s two really different places to be sure. Philadelphia, one of the Blackest big cities in America. And Portland, one of the whitest big cities in America.</p>
<p>I just learned a lot. I&#8217;m one of those kids who&#8217;s been drawing my whole life. I&#8217;ve always been interested in art. I think when I first realized that jobs were a thing you had to have, I either wanted to make comic books, or test video games. And I think making comic books or graphic design, not really that different. But those have always been interested of mine.</p>
<p>So I learned a lot from A, being around both really family at the end of the day because my grandmother on my mom&#8217;s side, she&#8217;s a prolific quilter. I&#8217;ve learned a lot about just color and pattern from her. My grandma on my dad&#8217;s side, she is just a broad crafts woman. She loves to do collage, and watercolors, and all this stuff. But neither of them ever did any of this professionally, just purely as hobbies.</p>
<p>And my mom, she&#8217;s a doctor. She&#8217;s an anesthesiologist. And she never really did any of this stuff but has always been really interested in clothing, and home d√©cor, and design. And then my dad is kind of an IT worker. He does all kinds of different IT stuff, but he is also a very passionate DJ. And I think my first kind of real introduction to design was meeting one of my dad&#8217;s friends who was making his mixtape cover art. And he was like, &#8220;Yeah, this is the designer who&#8217;s making my mixtape cover art.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I got introduced to the field really young, but didn&#8217;t really think it was something I would do full-time until much, much later. I spent a lot of time just as any kid does in my age group watching things like Toonami. Part of my upbringing in Portland actually was going to a Japanese magnet school, which is another really key piece of my story. So half the day was taught in English, and half the day was taught in Japanese. And this was right around the big Japan and anime boom of the &#8217;90s. So it was like kids in my second grade class were coming to school with Pokemon cards, and no one had ever seen them before. And the next year, Pokemon, the cartoon went up on WB. And obviously the rest is history.</p>
<p>So Japanese culture and video games, anime, things like that entered into my lexicon really early, and have been a really big source of inspiration since then. So my whole upbringing has just been a real hodgepodge mix of getting introduced to Japanese culture really early, being super interested in mixtape culture, dance hall culture, hip hop culture from a really young age, especially for my dad. And just holding records, and meeting his friends who made flyers, and helping him burn CDs, and things of that nature.</p>
<p>And then I think especially as I went to high school, I really got more into English, and drama, and history, and just writing more so. And I think that whole side of me that&#8217;s more analytical, and research focused, and all about communication merged with my early interests in Japanese culture, and dance hall culture, and all of these things to lead me into at least my adult design career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, that&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
A lot of pieces.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The Japanese magnet school in particular really interests me. I mean one, because you&#8217;re learning about just a different culture. Both language and the Japanese culture. But then to get it at such a young age, especially at the time when in America, Japanese animation was really starting to pop off. Wow, that must have been a wild time as a kid to be a part of that.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
It was really interesting. And the older I get and the more I look back on it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wow.&#8221; It was a public school too. And that&#8217;s a common thing in Portland. There&#8217;s a lot of magnet schools. Looking back on it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Geez, what an insanely foundational and formative experience that was.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because I had lots of friends who had older brothers who were into hacking, and modding their PCs, and importing game consoles, and all of these things that I think are super mainstream now. But I didn&#8217;t really understand at the time just how lucky I was to kind of get a front row seat to a lot of this stuff, right as it was coming out because people were going to Japan with their families for the holidays, and bringing stuff back. It was fascinating. It was a very fascinating experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So it sounds like overall growing up you really were exposed to a lot of creative things. And then eventually you went to the University of Pennsylvania, and you studied there as part of their visual studies program. Tell me about that time. What was your time like there?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So I got to thank my mom for even finding that program in the first place, because I was really kind of torn between how do I do creative stuff and make money. I think the eternal question of any kid whose parents don&#8217;t know what the design industry is. And I didn&#8217;t either at the time. So I was really debating do I do marketing and just do a business program, or do I go to an ad school or advertising school? Or do I go to just a full-on art school and do that? And my mom found this program, which is an amazing program that is basically a hybrid between several different disciplines. Those disciplines being biology, and psychology of sight, and seeing. So how do your rods and cones work? How do images get processed in the brain? These really foundational, biological things are practice.</p>
<p>Our practice, so obviously taking practical art classes like draft design, or painting, or sculpture, things of that nature. And then psychology and philosophy. So really looking at the thinking behind perception, and vision, and the real kind of heady stuff.</p>
<p>And you kind of choose one to focus in. So you take a majority of your classes in a specific area. I focused in fine art practice, specifically design. And then you just get this really interesting and well-rounded experience I think for an academic experience in particular, where you&#8217;re getting to learn a lot of different things that are all tightly related to each other, but are very different formally. I think each person, if you were to just focus on one of those things, that&#8217;s a whole field in and of itself. But we were having a really interesting time learning about the anatomy of your eye, and then having to go into a fine arts class and actually figure out a way to translate that into something visual. Or taking a historical image, and creating a sculpture that reflects the character of the image, as well as communicates the initial meaning.</p>
<p>So it was a really interesting education. And especially as someone who didn&#8217;t take any formal art classes in high school or anything like that, it was pretty wild to be dropped into the real deep end of design, and design theory, and all of these things right as I started school. But it provided me, especially someone with a lot of different interests and someone who is pretty flexible I think, a ton of freedom to just do what I wanted to do and learn about things that I wanted to do.</p>
<p>And I was basically able to do two thesis projects at the end of my time there, just from the fact that I was able to come to the program early. I finished my requirements early. I got a good sense of the things I was interested in, and got to take some graduate classes in my final semester. So it was a really, really great time. Academically. So yeah, very interesting program that I recommend to anyone who&#8217;s really interested in the whole ecosystem of visual image making as a whole entity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now, does Penn still have that program?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
It does, yeah. I believe the head of the program, his name is Ian Verstegen. He was my senior thesis advisor. So shout out to you, Ian.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean that sounds like a really great program. Especially like you said, you have all these different interests. And visual studies may sort of help you find a way to channel that into something.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. And I think the key thing it really taught me was to never make something without thinking about it first. Especially when it comes to design in particular. And always kind of have a thought of what you want something to do or what it needs to accomplish, or the response you wanted to elicit in someone, before you go into actually making the thing. That was a big thing I learned from that program.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you graduated from there in 2015. And one of your first jobs out of college, you were working for GQ Magazine. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So just sung the praises of this program. But it sounds complicated. And two prospective people who wanted to hire, they also I think thought it was complicated, because I could not find a job for a pretty long time. But I was really lucky enough to find this opportunity at GQ Magazine.</p>
<p>So if this was about seven months after I graduated, and I found this opportunity. And it was a web producer job. So it&#8217;s not a design title, not a designer, not a creative anything. It was just kind of a go between for all things within the website. At that time I was still living at home. I was doing some light freelance work, but I was like, &#8220;No, I want to move to New York. I want to get my career started. I&#8217;m going to go and take this job, and I&#8217;m going to go meet the art director first day, and tell them that I want to be a designer, and we&#8217;ll see how it goes from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I was at GQ for three years, three years total. And in that three years, I had four different titles. So I started as web producer, then became a visual designer. Then I was a visual editor. Then I was an art director and manager. And I worked on a bunch of different stuff while I was there. So in my first year, I was hand transcribing stories from old magazines so they could be published on the website. And helping my boss, who was the editor of the website, do her expenses, and keep track of contracts for writers that were doing regular columns and things like that. And I just kind of kept my head down and just kept working on these things, and kept bothering people to give me more stuff to do. So eventually, I started making some small illustrations for e-commerce stories, and then able to do some more big illustrations.</p>
<p>And I think a big moment for me when I was in that first year is I got to make a piece of art for the editor and the chief&#8230; The editor&#8217;s letter? Yeah, the editor&#8217;s letter. And it was about, I think this was in 2016. So it was in the throes of the election and all this stuff.</p>
<p>And it was a piece about Barack Obama, and I just cut together a found image of his bust that I think had maybe been 3D printed by the Smithsonian or something, and Abe Lincoln&#8217;s statue. And that piece went super viral. Definitely the copy was great, but I do think the image had a lot to do with it. And that was kind of a turning point where people really started like, &#8220;This kid knows what he is doing. He knows how to make a brief. He knows how to think through the stuff. We could use him on the design side.&#8221;</p>
<p>So after that, I kind of really started pushing into more of the design world. Eventually they were able to make some space for me over there. And then I spent the latter half of my time at GQ working on Snapchat Discover, which for again, those who don&#8217;t know is, I mean I think it still is active. But it was a bit huge initiative that Snapchat was doing to kind of partner with a lot of legacy publications, and just making moving animated magazines for a younger audience. So I did that for two years, partly as an editor as part of a team. And then I took over the team in my third year.</p>
<p>And in addition to doing a lot of design, illustration, content planning, content strategy, I also got to do a lot of writing at GQ, which is I think pretty unique for a lot of designers. So I had the first interview with Daniel Kaluuya after Out came out with any major publication. And that was a big moment, that was really one I&#8217;m really proud of. And I got to interview a number of musicians like Christian Scott, and [inaudible 00:34:40] and Lil Tracy, and all these people. So it was a really wild ride to be at such a large legacy publication at a time when the money was visibly drying up day by day. So I think it worked for me in the fact that there was not enough staff around, where I was able to just grab stuff and people would just be happy to have someone do it, no matter what their title was. So it really worked out for me in that way. But it was a really interesting time just crashing into that world and having no background in fashion or New York media, and just getting the whole wave washing over me.</p>
<p>But I learned a ton there, met a lot of really interesting people. And really, I think especially going back to my kind of academic background, I taught myself a lot of design stuff even while I was in school. And GQ was the time when I really learned what type design and type setting really meant, and how to really apply that stuff. So I kind of cut my teeth both in the world of multitasking and doing a lot of different stuff at once, but also really getting those hard design skills that I had been lacking in my academic education and self-taught practice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you get a chance to work on any video while you were there?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I did, yeah. I did a number of video projects. I did some design for an Issa Rae video when she was on the Man of the Year issue. And some other stuff with Travis Scott, Kylie Jenner. And I got to do both creating graphics for videos, as well as producing and interviewing people for video too. So I got a whole spectrum of experience in that area.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s some Conde Nast video Style Bible, but all of the videos that I watched out of GQ, Vanity Fair, etc., are so well done. It&#8217;s some of the really good video content. I&#8217;d say even now in this kind of, I don&#8217;t know, short video age when people look at Reels, and TikTok, and stuff like that. GQ is doing some of the best long form, and when I say long form, I&#8217;m thinking, I don&#8217;t know what. 10 minutes or more I guess. But they&#8217;re doing some of the best long form video content out there. It&#8217;s really good stuff.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
And I think actually two of the dudes who I worked with when I was there years ago I think are still there pushing a lot of that stuff forward. So they do some really awesome stuff. And it was a real pleasure to both be able to collaborate with that team, and also just watch them and see how they work. And I think that was something I really just did a lot of at GQ was just watching people, and just seeing how all these people move through the world, and did their work, and how people would just stroll into places they owned it, and were always going to think that they could get access to a certain person or anything. And that was really inspiring to me. I was like, &#8220;Oh wow, I guess I can just go do stuff. If I have GQ in my email, people will just answer my emails back. So I should just try to take advantage of that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I imagine that helps a lot.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. I still get emails to this day of people asking me to feature their X artist in GQ. But yeah, those days are behind me now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now along with what you just talked about with Splice, with GQ, and everything. You&#8217;re on the leadership teams of two organizations, √Är√≤ko Cooperative and The Imaginary School. Let&#8217;s talk about the √Är√≤ko Cooperative first. Because we&#8217;ve talked about it on the show before. As you mentioned earlier, it used to be known as Design to Divest. And we&#8217;ve had some folks on the show from Design to Divest. We had Michael Collette, we had Azeez, we had Zariah. What was behind the decision to change its name?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m actually super excited to talk about this because Design to Divest was this really impromptu gathering when we really came together initially. [inaudible 00:38:46] who was kind of the seed planter who put up the first Instagram post, even when we all came together for the first time, they were like, &#8220;We could change the name and maybe the logo could look different.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know. I just wanted to get people together. And I think that name and that group made sense for a while. And I think we retained a lot of the folks who kind of joined really early. And that felt good to kind of keep the momentum going.</p>
<p>But especially going into this year as we&#8217;re coming I guess&#8230; Yeah, we&#8217;re over two years old now. We had really started to gel a smaller, specific, dedicated team of folks that was just this core group of eight who had been consistently coming to stuff. The steering committee had had as many as 30 members at certain points.</p>
<p>So after a while and really working together week over week, we kind of gelled down this specific group. And once we kind of landed on that core group, we really started to ask ourselves, what do we actually want to do together? And what do we want to do here? And that led us to thinking about questions of what is the right name? Is Design to Divest, a project within our kind of wider umbrella of things that we like to do? We determined that it was.</p>
<p>So basically where we landed was Design to Divest is the first large scale project completed by √Är√≤ko Cooperative. And √Är√≤ko Cooperative is going to be kind of an umbrella organization for a variety of different initiatives that we&#8217;re going to be doing moving forward. So Design to Divest being one of them. And that sits within our core offerings of things like zines, or merchandise, and publishing. We are also going to be doing some consulting work. So we actually just completed our first client project very recently. So there&#8217;ll be case studies about that probably up on our website by the time this interview is up.</p>
<p>And then we&#8217;re going to be doubling down on a lot of community initiatives. So we&#8217;re going to be doing quarterly events that are for Black designers specifically, that are free. We&#8217;ll probably be doing some more open events for the wider design community that&#8217;ll be paid for. And then we have a Discord server, which is kind of just a little bit more impromptu place for Black designers to congregate.</p>
<p>So we really just took stock of all that stuff and determined let&#8217;s put Design to Divest in its own box that allows all of the work that&#8217;s been done by people who are not active in the group anymore to be really properly archived, and separated, and celebrated. And then gives this new kind of smaller group full license to create what we want this thing to be for ourselves, and really just not be bound by any historical things, or previous projects, or any of that.</p>
<p>And just really go from the ground up, working together to come up with a new name, and new brand, and new direction, and all of that together. So it was really just a chance to celebrate some old work and give ourselves a fresh start looking into the years to come for the rest of the cooperative.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Sounds like it was a massive change than just the name. It really sort of changed a lot with just even the purpose. I mean, not so much the purpose behind why you came together. But how do you keep the group moving forward? What are the new goals and things of that nature? Are there other things that have changed over the years now that you&#8217;ve been doing this?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. I think the biggest honor of my design career so far to build this group with these folks. And we&#8217;ve gone through all kinds of changes, whether it&#8217;s going from using Zoom for our meetings and Slack, to moving to Discord, and using that as a primary surface for all meetings, and events, and planning, and all that stuff. To getting a better sense of what our actual deliverables and our offerings. The offerings we want to actually put out for our clients, and determining that maybe we want to do X thing and this thing, but maybe not this thing even, if we have the capacity and capability to do it.</p>
<p>And I think the biggest change too is we&#8217;ve all gotten paid this year for the first time. That&#8217;s a big change. We&#8217;ve been doing it for free for two years, and we were able to get some clients, and get some funds raised. Everyone was able to get a check this year I think. I&#8217;m excited to see my own tax return from the work that we completed this year.</p>
<p>And I think another big change too has just been getting a lot closer to each other as a group, to where we feel really good about just moving forward on new projects without having to have everyone touching everything at the same time. I think that&#8217;s been a big learning development for us is that we have a really wide set of skills in our core group of now nine. And we can divide and thrive. We don&#8217;t need to have eight people on a certain project. We can just have two people on a project, and they&#8217;re going to run it great. And that means three people over here can go and do something else.</p>
<p>So that process of just figuring out our working norms, and how do we operate as a non-hierarchical design entity, and just really figuring out how we can make this thing sustainable for the long term in a way that feels really good has been a series of ongoing changes for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now let&#8217;s talk about The Imaginary School. The Imaginary School on the website is described as, &#8220;An eye on our present, past, and future.&#8221; Where did the idea to start that come from?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So The Imaginary School I think, at least for me in my own practice. √Är√≤ko is kind of the group activity that I really spent a lot of my time with. And it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re going to be doing consulting and making new projects and all this stuff. And Imaginary School is kind of my personal just personal passion project, which is really about education.</p>
<p>So the actual idea of The Imaginary School started back in college with a couple of my friends who were all a bunch of creative folks as well, and we just kind of came up with the name as an umbrella for any collaborations we were going to do amongst ourselves. And we put out one project, and didn&#8217;t really put out any other formal projects after that. We all continued to stay friends, and we&#8217;ve all worked on different projects and stuff together. But nothing really formalized.</p>
<p>And I really wanted to take that, and revive it, and bring some life back to it in the form of more open collaboration with people all over the world, and different interests, and people that we didn&#8217;t have personal connections to.</p>
<p>So in 2019 actually, I spent a lot of time thinking about what the new iteration of this thing could be. And that was spurned by some conversations I had with another friend who was in grad school and who was continuously being like, &#8220;Hey Shak, you got to read this PDF of Saidiya Hartman,&#8221; who I&#8217;d never heard of at the time. I was like, &#8220;Oh yeah, that&#8217;d be great.&#8221; And then, Hey Shak, you got to check out this great PDF by Fred Moten, and you got to check out this from da, da, da, da.&#8221; And after a while I was like, &#8220;You know Isaac, is there a way we can just share this knowledge more widely? Because there&#8217;s so many of these things that are becoming really foundational to my thinking and design process, and I never would&#8217;ve learned about them had you not shared that PDF with me.&#8221; And we were like, &#8220;Yeah, I think we could figure something out.&#8221;</p>
<p>So we really took the idea of The Imaginary School of that open collaboration, and wanted to figure out a way to just open source it basically and make it accessible to everyone. And also something that other people could replicate.</p>
<p>So right now, it is a two-part kind of operation. We have an arena page, which just houses all kinds of resources from across the internet in fields as disparate as video games, to the environment, to Palestine, to parenting and sexuality and relationships. We just have a ton of different information that&#8217;s just kind of crowdsourced and crowd collected. And then there&#8217;s a Discord server which is attached to it where someone can go and find someone to chat about with if they have questions about a particular topic or they found something really interesting and just are looking for someone to chat to.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s this two-pronged approach. And it&#8217;s pretty chill, for lack of a better word. I don&#8217;t spend a ton of time trying to curate stuff and push for engagement on it. I just really want it to be something that&#8217;s easy for people to get into and use as they please. But that&#8217;s an ongoing project for me. And I&#8217;m always looking for new ways to grow it and activate it. So I&#8217;ll be doing probably more of that into the new year as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I see on the website you have some of these discussions that you mentioned. Does doing The Imaginary School and √Är√≤ko Cooperative, do they share similar goals? Do you see there being some overlap between those two?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Definitely. I think any project that I work on ideally shares some goals. And I think in those two projects, just that idea of having a more open and equitable kind of design world is a big one for me. I mean, the most popular channel of our Imaginary School channels is one that is specifically decentering whiteness in design.</p>
<p>So I think there&#8217;s a lot of overlap in the goals of those two projects. I think √Är√≤ko is a bit doing it a bit more active way, whereas Imaginary School is more passive and just trying to get people information so they can reach conclusions and do their projects on their own. But definitely a lot of overlap in the long-term goals of both of those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In recent years, what would you say the biggest lesson is that you&#8217;ve learned about yourself?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I think the biggest lesson I have learned about myself in recent years is that I do not have the energy that I thought I had, is the biggest one. I think even when I was younger and would work all day, and commute, and then come home and work for five or six hours at night into the wee hours of the morning on freelance projects or side stuff, I think I was kidding myself that I could keep that going for as long as I did.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s really the biggest thing is that for me to do my best work and especially do my best work with other people, I need time to unplug, and de-stress, and just not think about design or any of the large issues that are constantly weighing on my head. I need time to just decompress and really give myself time to recover in between really digging into these projects.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think the older we get, our energy levels in some ways kind of naturally wane. But I definitely get what you mean about that, it&#8217;s more about what you put your energy towards, I think also.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think when you&#8217;re younger, there&#8217;s a lot of stuff that you try to do all the things because you have the time, and the capacity, and the space to do all of that. And then as you get older, you just become just more intentional about what it is that you actually want to put your energy towards, what you want to put your name on. That sort of thing, what you want to be affiliated with. It&#8217;s less about doing all the things, and more about trying to do the right things for you.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yep. I completely agree. And as someone who had a traditional education in a lot of ways but didn&#8217;t have a traditional design education, I spent a lot of my twenties&#8230; I turn 30 next year. I spent a lot of my twenties just saying yes to anything I could get my hands on, because I felt like I needed to prove my skills. And also I wanted to develop my skills. And that got very old after a while, especially when you&#8217;re still dealing with commitments that are maybe multiple years old or something like this from when you were younger and a different person.</p>
<p>So yeah, definitely something as I move on is going to be just probably saying no to almost everything. And really allowing myself to just focus on the things that I think are going to make the most impact for myself and for the world. So √Är√≤ko and Imaginary School are two big ones.</p>
<p>I also would love to have a little time to just do stuff for fun. Again, I think I spent a lot of my last 10 years of my design career doing projects for people and with people and always serving as that creative liaison, or designer, or creative director or whatever. But it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve done something that was just for me. And I&#8217;d love to get back to the ideas I had when I was a kid of making a comic book. So hopefully that&#8217;s the next actual personal project I do I complete in some indeterminable amount of time, maybe in the next five years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me about the comic book. Because that&#8217;s an idea that I&#8217;ve had for a very long time. I&#8217;ve always wanted to do some type of a comic book, or a graphic novel, or something. I&#8217;ve sort of done print design at different times throughout my career. But I&#8217;d say roughly within the past year and a half or so, I actually started working with printers. Because I was working at a company, and we made a print magazine. So I got to really see behind the scenes with paper types and all that stuff.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s a lot less expensive than I thought it was. I think at the time that I was doing it also, there was just this massive paper shortage. Because I would think with masks and with just all the other stuff happening with the pandemic and things like that, everything was in a shortage. There were supply chain issues and stuff. But it&#8217;s actually a lot cheaper to print say 100 copies of a comic book if you just want to test it out. Lot cheaper than you think, or a lot cheaper than I thought at least. I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not a lot of money at all. I could do that.&#8221; I just now need to write it, maybe find somebody to draw it color, and get all that sort of stuff</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I mentioned earlier I&#8217;m hugely influenced by video games, manga, anime, all that stuff. So this also ties into my last thing about taking more time and rest and all that. I&#8217;ve just been trying to a lot more time just playing video games and reading comic books over the last couple years. Because basically in the end of 2019, I was just so burned out and just had totally ran myself dry. And I realized, &#8220;When was the last time I just played a video game for two hours?&#8221; And it had been basically since my senior year of college. So I was like, &#8220;All right, let me take some more time to do these fun things.&#8221; And so I&#8217;ve been reading a lot more comic books and all that.</p>
<p>And the idea I have, and I&#8217;m happy to share this with you right now, is basically make it a traditional kind of battle anime style, where everyone has a superpower, and they fight a big villain, and there&#8217;s big fight scenes and all that stuff. But have it all be based around a community organization that helps their local community by day, and fights the US government&#8217;s secret agents by night. And all of that happens in their dreams. So it&#8217;s all kind of about astral projection. I think it allows for a lot of fun ideas to roam free. With the core idea of this is a group that&#8217;s been fighting the government for years, and this government agency has been suppressing social unrest in people&#8217;s dreams for hundreds of years or something like that. So that&#8217;s the loose idea that I&#8217;m working with, and I really do want to put it to paper sometime soon, because I think it&#8217;s certainly something I would be really happy to read at the very least.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I like that. I like that a lot. That&#8217;s a really good idea. Who are some of the mentors, or colleagues, or people that have helped you get to this point in your career?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I think there&#8217;s one person in particular who is absolutely the most influential. And I mentioned her already, but Meg V√°zquez. She&#8217;s just been so huge for me, I think, and really getting that serious design education. So she&#8217;s my boss at GQ. So we worked together at GQ for two years. We&#8217;ve worked together at Splice for almost four years. And Meg was a part of the Hillary for America design team. So she cut her teeth on all that stuff. And she&#8217;s just been a huge figure for me in just in terms of just getting to know design better, and knowing how to operate, and how to just do design in a professional setting. So really, really could not have done it without her.</p>
<p>And then in addition to her, Charles Hall is another one who&#8217;s really important for me in terms of my creative growth and expression. And he was a TA of mine at Penn in the graduate seminar I mentioned early in our interview. And he&#8217;s an amazing designer, creative director in his own write. He wrote Michael Jordan&#8217;s retirement letter, and just has an amazing way with words and communication. And we&#8217;ve worked on a couple projects together. And he&#8217;s taught me a ton about the industry, and really pushed me as a designer to I think embrace my experiences a lot, and really lean on the things that I know better than other people. So those folks are super crucial.</p>
<p>But I also have to give a really big shout out to just my whole √Är√≤ko Cooperative team. I&#8217;ve learned so much from working with those people. And it&#8217;s hard to put into words I think the amount of knowledge we&#8217;ve been able to build just amongst ourselves in the last couple years. And I think I&#8217;ve learned as much from that group in two and a half years than I have in my four years of Ivy League education. So those folks are all really foundational for me, and I could not have gotten to where I am or done any of this stuff where I&#8217;m at now without the help of the Meg, Charles, and my √Är√≤ko squad.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you want to change in 2023?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
In 2023, I want to just be really deliberate and intentional with how I&#8217;m spending my time. I want to be spending my time when I have to be working and making money, doing something that is directly making people&#8217;s lives better. So I&#8217;m excited about joining this mental health company to do that.</p>
<p>And then also in my time out of the office, I want to make sure that anytime I&#8217;m spending doing additional work, it&#8217;s stuff that&#8217;s really important to me and really is serving me in the world. And then just having plenty of time to just relax. So really just making sure that I&#8217;m not spreading myself too thin. In fact, doing the opposite and giving myself a lot of time to just learn, and read, and mess with this comic book, and just chill out a little bit. I think I&#8217;ve earned it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to still be doing? What kind of new work do you want to do? Anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. I think in the next five years, I would ideally be working full-time for myself or in collaboration with some of the folks I&#8217;ve mentioned before. I&#8217;m really excited about this new gig, and I have no idea where that&#8217;s going to take me. But I really have the long term goal of being able to run my my own studio, either by myself or in collaboration with other folks. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m really hoping for is getting the chance to just do that, and have a lot more freedom to go and just build the things that I think the world needs to have out in the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything, your projects you mentioned? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So the best place to find me is just at my website. It&#8217;s shakeil.com. S-H-A-K-E-I-L.com. You&#8217;re going to find everything there. I&#8217;m really active on Arena, so if you&#8217;re looking for a little bit more of a social atmosphere, you can find me at Arena/shakeilgreeley. And then for √Är√≤ko, you can find us at aroko.coop. So A-R-O-K-O.coop. And that&#8217;s a great place to go and get a full sense of what we&#8217;re working on. We have a really large project, which is our design manifesto that&#8217;ll be coming out probably by the time this interview airs. So definitely go check that out. You&#8217;re going to get some really interesting stuff, I&#8217;ll tell you that much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well Shakeil Greeley, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I feel like this interview was a great way to kind of close out the year. One, I think just to hear about the great things that you&#8217;re doing around something that we&#8217;ve mentioned on the show over the past two years, which is Design to Divest, that&#8217;s now the √Är√≤ko Cooperative. But seeing how you are working with something like that and then taking that to move forward into a bigger, grander future, I think that&#8217;s something that we all of course want to see, but something that we all need as well. And I&#8217;m just glad you were able to come on the show, and share your story. And I&#8217;m really excited to see what you do next. So thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Thank you so much for having me, Maurice. It&#8217;s been such a pleasure and a real honor to be on the show. It&#8217;s an amazing way for me to close my ear up.</p>
