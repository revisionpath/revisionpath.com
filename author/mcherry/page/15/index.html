Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p><i>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</i> is one of the most anticipated movies of the year, and that&#8217;s not just because it&#8217;s a sequel to one of the highest-grossing movies of all time. After the tragic and sudden passing of megastar Chadwick Boseman, Ryan Coogler and the cast and crew of this film came together and put it all on the line to deliver a cinematic tribute truly fit for a king.</p>
<p>In this bonus episode of Revision Path, I sit down again with Regin&eacute; Gilbert, Jordan Green, and Paul Webb to dive deep into the symbolism, visuals, and music behind <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em>. Warning: we spoil the entire movie in this episode, so if you haven&#8217;t watched the film yet, you might want to do that before listening. </p>
<p><em>Yibambe!</em></p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, I am so excited to have all of you back again for this conversation around Black Panther, Wakanda Forever. The first conversation that we had was literally historic. You can go listen to it in the Smithsonian&#8217;s Permanent Archives. But before we really jump into this, I want everyone to introduce themselves. Starting off with Regin√©.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Hello, everyone. I&#8217;m Regin√© Gilbert. I&#8217;m an industry assistant professor at New York University, and I am living in Brooklyn.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Jordan.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah. Hey, my name&#8217;s Jordan Green. I&#8217;m out here in Seattle, Washington. I work for Boeing in the virtual airplane program as a UX designer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And Paul.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
I am Paul Webb, a designer developer. I just like making stuff currently residing in Cupertino, California.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you all know me by this point, but if not, I&#8217;m Maurice Cherry. I&#8217;m the founder and host of Revision Path. So let&#8217;s talk about this movie. And I would say to anyone listening by this point, we are spoiling the whole movie. So if you have not seen the movie yet, you may want to see it before you listen to this episode. If you haven&#8217;t seen it and you still want to listen, it&#8217;s totally up to you. But we&#8217;re spoiling the entire movie. So let&#8217;s go ahead and jump into the plot. And I want to give a rundown of the plot, and I want us to go over it before we really get into the deeper meanings and symbolism and things that we all experience in the movie. But let&#8217;s start off with where the movie starts. It takes place, I think it jumps right into the big elephant in the room, which is the death of T&#8217;Challa.</p>
<p>One thing I thought that was interesting is how both of the Black Panther movies begin with the death. The first movie begins with the death of T&#8217;Challa&#8217;s father, King T&#8217;Chaka. And then now we&#8217;re sort of thrust into what almost seems like an emergency room-type situation with Shuri drastically trying to synthesize something to save her brother T&#8217;Challa who passes away. So the movie already knows that the viewing public know that T&#8217;Challa is dead. And, of course, the actor who played him, Chadwick Boseman, has also passed. And so we go right into it. What did you all think about that?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Tears were shed, right?</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Tears were shed in the theater. And what I felt from that moment was that it was a moment of silence for all of us.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
I really appreciate that Ryan Coogler and the whole cast really captured the chaoticness of the death, just how sudden it feels, how gut-wrenching it feels, how heartbreaking it feels, right? The whole opening scene was so masterly done. And I think for me, I think that&#8217;s the best way you could handle an actor, especially an actor who was really carrying the film, really carrying that franchise. That was his deal. I think facing it head-on and just the powerlessness that all of the characters feel and then having that just be around the meta moment of the powerlessness that everyone felt around Chadwick Boseman&#8217;s colon cancer. It was just, I&#8217;m getting choked up just thinking about it right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I think the fact that they, I mean, even worked that sort of into the film to say that. I mean, we hear this I think a bit later on from Nakia about how she knew, but he didn&#8217;t tell anybody, which of course also alludes to something we find out near the end of the movie, which we&#8217;ll get to in a bit. But very much similar to in real life, where only the people that were really the closest to Chadwick knew of his illness.</p>
<p>And so it takes place, I think if people have watched this movie, they probably, I&#8217;m sure have watched Avengers End Game and all that stuff. Shuri was affected by the blip. She ended up coming back five years later. So the beginning of the movie is a little bit, I&#8217;m not really sure where it takes place in the whole MCU timeline, but it thrusts us right into this, I guess, franticness of Shuri trying to save to T&#8217;Challa. And then of course you have the ensuing funeral procession afterwards, with all the whites and them going through the sort of main thoroughfare in Wakanda, and then it flashes to one year later. So I think it&#8217;s interesting that the film doesn&#8217;t try to sit in that for too long. It gets right to what we all know, and then it&#8217;s now, here&#8217;s sort of the rest of the story.</p>
<p>So it picks up a year later. And what we know, I think certainly from the end of the first Black Panther, is that Wakanda is now open to the world in that not so much in a travel or trade or commerce sense, but it&#8217;s existence is now a known entity in the world. And so it&#8217;s interesting how geopolitics is a big factor in the entire movie. It opens up, well, Wakanda has been under pressure to share their resources with the rest of the world. And it&#8217;s sort through this address that Ramonda gives in this really striking purple regal outfit at the United Nations that she gives this address. And we learn about these sort of outside factors that have been trying to usurp Wakanda&#8217;s natural resources. That&#8217;s where we end up, of course, hearing the Dora Milaje again, we get introduced to Aneka, who&#8217;s played by Michaela Cole, and there&#8217;s almost like a target on Wakanda&#8217;s back in a way because of its resources.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
That was one of my favorite scenes. She was just like, you all are trying to comfort us. Well, we don&#8217;t protect by bringing for fear of weaponry, we protected for fear of you. Talking to all the colonizers in the room. I was like, oh, sheesh. And then made the mercenaries who tried to hijack one of their facilities do the perp walk into the UN, man, France was looking like, and then she spoke in French to that woman, like, well.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Yeah. And that&#8217;s one of the things, when we think about the design of this and all the things in this movie being done by design, one of the things that I think is really important about this film is language and the fact that language was used in a way that someone&#8217;s mother tongue was used with them. So when they brought those soldiers in to that room, she didn&#8217;t say in English, she spoke in French to the French woman. And throughout the movie we saw the transition of language so many times. And I think that&#8217;s an important piece, that&#8217;s by design throughout the movie.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m getting excited because I&#8217;m just like, there were so many great things that were done in that scene. The fact that it&#8217;s Coogler&#8217;s vision, but the fact that the two countries that were pressuring Wakanda to share vibranium was France and the United States. The fact that France deployed its own troops locally to the Wakanda Embassy as an act of war was such a beautiful master stroke of reflecting world politics. And it was just the, I know Maurice, you&#8217;re doing the recount, but the fact that we end up going to Haiti later.</p>
<p>And so you have this really interesting and really beautiful way that Ryan Coogler is like, this is&#8230; The whole movie is just like, we&#8217;re going to make you sad, and also imperialism is the real enemy. And so the whole movie is this call, really literally a call in response of these are the world pressures, pressuring this African nation to share the resources and not really talking about France and the United States and Britain, really, were exploiting the hell out of Africa and they really didn&#8217;t touch on the Dutch or anything like that. But that was really great. The fact that they used, I don&#8217;t know if anybody else picked up on this, but the fact that they used different colors to symbolize which language was being spoken at what time.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love that.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Yeah, I love that, too.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
It was just so beautiful and it was just such a beautiful transition for you to know and just a really wonderful way to tell the audience, oh, now in case you don&#8217;t know, they&#8217;re speaking Talokanil, right? In case you don&#8217;t know, they&#8217;re speaking Wakandan, and the heroes were in yellow and blue, and then the white was for all of the colonizer places. It was just such a beautiful, beautiful master stroke because they did that with Spanish and English, and it was wonderful. I just thought that was such a nice touch.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I really love the way that language was so fluid throughout the entire movie. And this sort of effortless switch between, like you said, English and there&#8217;s French, there&#8217;s Spanish, there&#8217;s Wakandan, what was it? The Talokan language that they were speaking. All of that just seamlessly going between different environments and different cultures and different sorts of parts of the movie. Since we&#8217;re talking about Talokan, that&#8217;s sort of what we get to right after this scene is the CIA is trying to extract vibranium from the source and then they basically come across or they&#8217;re ambushed by these Talokan warriors.</p>
<p>And what I thought was interesting, and I don&#8217;t know if any of you all caught this, but the sort of siren song that Talokan did that sort of took over everyone to the point where they&#8217;re walking and jumping into the sea, which is, I guess, sort of an allusion to Greek mythology of the siren. They have the same sort of almost birdlike chirping thing that they&#8217;re doing, but it&#8217;s luring people into the sea. They end up taking over this aircraft carrier almost and killing almost everyone and really sending the message that don&#8217;t fuck with us, essentially.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. No, that was the appearance of the Talokan. Just first of all, I don&#8217;t know how everybody else feels, but I have so much love for Ryan Coogler. One, because he is clearly, for me as someone from San Francisco, he is clearly from Oakland. He&#8217;s clearly from the Bay, and the way that he had the regalia of all of the Meso American folks, and I think it&#8217;s Mayan, but I don&#8217;t want to step out of turn, but people have been using Mayan and Aztec interchangeably. And I know that&#8217;s a faux pas, but I think it&#8217;s Mayan that he based all the regalia off of. And that is what all of the folks who are in Talokan are wearing, right? They&#8217;re wearing these indigenous outfits that are very true, and I love the fact that they&#8217;re wearing these beautiful crowns of feathers and things like that.</p>
<p>I remember seeing folks, dancers in the Bay wear those things. And so it&#8217;s beautiful to see that represented that kind of indigeneity. And then to have both the Talokan and Wakanda connected through vibranium and have that be the thing that sort connects these two indigenous cultures that were able to protect themselves from outside forces of invaders through literally something from outside of the planet, giving them sort powers to protect themselves from colonization. That, I mean, I just thought that was such a beautiful tie into both ways, and just having that be the thread was just wonderful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The thing with, and we&#8217;ll get of course later to Namor and the Talokan and all of that, but I do get that, I think it was mostly Mayan, but I remember Shuri mentioning it as Meso American. So I think it&#8217;s mostly Mayan because the initial of point where they went down to the Talokan was the Yucatan Peninsula, which is Mayan. Even that sort of steep pyramid, terrorist pyramid that you saw in the background with Nakia, that&#8217;s clearly Mayan. But I feel like there&#8217;s also maybe some Aztec elements in it. There&#8217;s like some elements. I mean, that&#8217;s all sort of Central America, central Mexico, South America. I feel like it&#8217;s a good mix of that. But it is, I feel, probably mostly Mayan.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting that when Namor is giving his backstory, and this is a little bit later in the film, when he&#8217;s explaining this to Shuri, how he ends up coming to the surface and sees all the Spanish conquistadors, the Spanish conquistadors wiped out, the Incons wiped out the Aztecs. I think there&#8217;s still millions of surviving descendants of the Mayan civilization. So they didn&#8217;t completely wipe them out. But I do like that they managed to show that portion of history as part of all of this.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
And how he got his name in that moment, too. My enemies just like this dying terrible person just said, I&#8217;m born of no love. I&#8217;ll take it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Namor.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. It&#8217;s no longer Namor, they&#8217;re like, oh, you all are going to know your R when you say that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Sin amor is where it ended up coming from. Yeah. And it&#8217;s interesting. I mean, that sort of plays on something that the MCU has been, I feel like they&#8217;ve been doing in this phase where the names are coming from, the people themselves aren&#8217;t coming up with the names. The names are almost bestowed upon them. Even when we get to the point in the movie, and this is right after the attack when Namor ends up confronting Ramonda and Shuri, right before Ramonda is about to tell T&#8217;Challa&#8217;s secret, which again we find out at the end of the movie, but right as Ramonda I feel like is about to tell that they meet Namor, and Namor is like, my people call me Kukulkan, but my enemies call me Namor. I thought that was dope. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah. Oh, man.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
I mean, first of all, those feathers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Talk about it.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
It just coming out and just seeing those feathers. And to me, something I noticed that I really don&#8217;t ever pay attention to was the lighting all throughout the movie. There was something about the way that folks were lit that made you really draw your attention to them, which I don&#8217;t really notice in other films, but I really noticed the light and how the light would hit people on the side of the face, or the light would hit through the costumes, or the light would focus in on certain aspects of things that made you pay attention to that thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, it was beautifully shot. I really liked the way that they did lighting underwater. Building on your point, the scene where Angela Bassett is underneath the water. I have never seen Angela Bassett so beautifully lit before, and that was just like, whoa, okay, well, I&#8217;m not sure if the technology is getting better, if people got better access to knowing how to shoot different light, just different folks with different skin tones. But yeah, Regin√© when you&#8217;re talking about the way that they lit the folks from Talokan was they were always shot. It almost looked like they were almost always this ethereal underwater. Yeah, so that&#8217;s so wonderful.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
I mean, shout out to all the visual artists that worked on this film.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
I mean, because I like to stay after and look to see all the credits and I&#8217;m like, look at all those visual artists that worked on this film.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s so funny you mentioned that I was in the theater and I&#8217;m looking at the credits and I guess, because I&#8217;ve been doing this show for this long, I&#8217;m recognizing names. I&#8217;m like, wait a minute, that&#8217;s Nicholas Smith, he&#8217;s an illustrator. I know him. Wait, this is Handel Eugene, who I&#8217;ve had on the show before, who&#8217;s done work for other Marvel movies. I&#8217;m like, this is so dope.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah, speaking of the end credits. I&#8217;m so glad they got Ruth Carter front end center because she put her foot in it again.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Can we just talk about Angela Bassett, every outfit that Angela Bassett wore was, I mean, I&#8217;m thinking about that silver, it was like a silver-gray outfit that had her one shoulder out, the purple, the adornments, all the adornment pieces that were added to the dresses. And I mean, we haven&#8217;t even started in on Shuri&#8217;s. Amazing. And that was in partnership. Ruth Carter did partnership with Adidas, I believe, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Adidas.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Yeah, can we talk about that? I don&#8217;t know, Maurice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m mean, yeah, I want get this-</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
I was like, isn&#8217;t Regin√© the fashion expert on the panel? Come on</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yes. We will get to all of that. So since you talked about Shuri, to get back to the plot. So we&#8217;re at the point now where Namor has confronted Ramonda and Shuri and has set up this almost secondary conflict of the movie, which is find the scientists that was responsible for that machine that the Talokan destroyed that could detect vibranium and kill them. If they don&#8217;t kill the scientists, then Talokan is going to invade Wakanda.</p>
<p>And so Shuri and Okoye have to, they use Everett Ross to sort find out who the scientist is. They meet the scientists at MIT, it Riri Williams who, of course, I&#8217;m sure later, I think she&#8217;s going to have a Disney+ series next year, I believe, probably.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. And so we get introduced to Riri Williams.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Ironheart, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who was this&#8230; Well, they don&#8217;t call her Ironheart in the film, but yeah, it is Ironheart from the comic books. So we meet Riri, who is also this technological genius, young black woman, younger than Shuri, actually. And so then it sort of takes place with this chase because the FBI has closed in on them. And then there&#8217;s like this epic chase scene throughout Boston and it ends up with both Shuri and Riri being captured by the Talokan, and Okoye ends up getting defeated. What did you all think about that part of the movie? That part really, to me, set things off in terms of where is the plot going to go from here?</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Well, my favorite part was the banter between Okoye and Riri. And Riri said, she had a ashy head and they were going back and forth, and she was like, &#8220;Get out of my room.&#8221; And then she just brought out the spear, and she was like, &#8220;Oh, hell, you brought in a spear into my door room.&#8221; She was just freaking, that looks so realistic. And it was hilarious at the same time. I was just like, this is hilarious.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
What did she call her small, small girl?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes, that&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
She called her small, small girl, which was just like, whoa, okay. And then her facial expression afterward as Riri is holding a heater, as if, what are you going to do with that heater?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Yeah. It was just like, I just sliced your Bluetooth speaker. You just threw at me. Come on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Yeah, come on.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
I mean, so that whole scene, I mean, I&#8217;m cracking up at the whole thing. Because the lead up to that where Shuri&#8217;s in the lab. So after T&#8217;Challa dies, Shuri just buries herself in the work, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s one of those things that it&#8217;s like I saw myself reflected a lot in that moment, particularly when we&#8217;re talking about how do you deal with death? How do you deal with losing someone so close to you? And Shuri is, for me, it was just such an interesting thing because Shuri in the comics is so smart. She&#8217;s literally one of the smartest people on the face of the planet. And in the MCU, she was like, even when she was looking at Vision, when they brought her in to look at Vision and the other Avengers movies, it was clear Shuri was like, this is the most ghetto thing I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got this man up here stuck together with duct tape and bubble gum, you all couldn&#8217;t have at least called me. That&#8217;s how she is to Tony Stark. And so it is like, how does it feel when there was nothing you can do? Literally, you&#8217;re one of the smartest people in the world. You&#8217;re a genius. You could have figured it out if given enough time, and you couldn&#8217;t. So she just throws herself into work and she abandons all of her duties because she has to be the queen.</p>
<p>And of course, Ramonda steps up as Queen mother. And she&#8217;s like, okay, well, my baby is grieving. We&#8217;re all grieving, but someone&#8217;s got to lead this country and someone&#8217;s got to protect us and we&#8217;re a monarchy, so I&#8217;m going to do the damn thing. And that play-off of it. And all three of the women, Okoye, Shuri, and Ramonda, all of them in this dance of, a delicate dance, of maintaining Wakanda. And it was just such a brilliant moment. And then to have Okoye be like, &#8220;We got to get her out of this lab.&#8221; And to have Ramonda be like, &#8220;You better bring my baby back.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And she doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
And she doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And she doesn&#8217;t. The scene after that, if that&#8217;s not for your consideration for an Academy Award, I don&#8217;t know what Marvel Studios is just thinking because Angela Bassett-</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Yes, that made my heart hurt.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; put her whole foot into that scene, &#8220;Have I not suffered enough?&#8221; And then strips Okoye of her rank as general of the Dora Milaje. And I think that&#8217;s an interesting set piece in the movie, not just for the reasons of, it&#8217;s almost like denatures one of the characters. Okoye in the first film is, of course, ever present as the general of the Dora Milaje. But it also indicates something that I think audiences may have muddied about the Black Panther, from the first movie, which is that the Black Panther being the protector of Wakanda, and the person being the ruler of Wakanda does not necessarily have to be the same person.</p>
<p>It happened to be that case with T&#8217;Chaka, T&#8217;Challa&#8217;s father. And it was the case with T&#8217;Challa. And of course, since we&#8217;re spoiling, it ends up being of Shuri later in the film. But it&#8217;s at this point where who is going to protect Wakanda, if the general of the Dora Milaje, who at this point is the, I almost would say the next in line in terms of protector of Wakanda, can&#8217;t even protect the soon-to-be queen of the nation, then what&#8217;s next? What&#8217;s left? That was such a great pivotal point in the movie.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah, God. I mean, the thing about the, sorry, I want to circle back to the ashy head because it keeps being on my mind just having Okoye asking Shuri being like, &#8220;Is it the matching the right skin tone?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
And then Fenty got a plug in the movie.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yes, Fenty 440 or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Yeah, something like that.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s right. And just all of these ways in which black women have to be in consideration of how they&#8217;re appearing out of the world and just having that be naturally just part of these characters lives. You can tell that it was-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You can tell it was written by a Black man or a Black people, and you can tell that the Black women got to add in as well. Right? This is an experience that we would have. Also, I love the looks that they have for a Okoye and Shuri out in the world. And calling MIT a Wakandan primary school.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
That made me feel primitive, bro. Does that mean My high school was a preschool?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I think also what&#8217;s interesting&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
I am D-U-M-B, just dumb.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;d say an interesting presentation fashion wise is in the first movie when Okoye, when they&#8217;re in South Korea, Okoye has to wear the certain dress and this wig. And you can tell this time I guess because now Wakanda&#8217;s open to the world, she just has on a blazer over whatever her Dora Milaje-esque sort of like body suit is. I thought was really interesting.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
What about the bridge scene? We haven&#8217;t talked about that. When they&#8217;re on the bridge. Right before they get taken.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
I was holding my breath. I was like just, &#8220;Get up, get up, get up.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
I was just like, it&#8217;s hard for me to watch that scene because you kind of don&#8217;t know who to root for, right? Because the general of Talokan is doing the damn thing.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Attuma.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Tuma. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Attuma. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Attuma. Yeah. Yeah, Attuma. I was just&#8230; On a real, for me, Attuma being&#8230; That was the first person you see that&#8217;s heavy set and bare chested in any Marvel movie that I&#8217;ve ever seen. Hollywood heavy set, dude is still stocky. Still sturdy. It was just, I was really&#8230; They were trying to present them as a villain, but the more and more you learn about why they&#8217;re doing what they&#8217;re doing, you can&#8217;t see them as a villain. They&#8217;re literally just trying to protect their people. So I was just like&#8230; And at the same time, I was like, &#8220;Y&#8217;all going to tell me Okoye can&#8217;t kick this dude&#8217;s butt?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
When he kicked her spear to her as if to say, &#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s keep going.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And interestingly, him and Okoye are kind of peers in a way. They&#8217;re both sort of the main warriors of their individual cultures. So them going head to head was really sort a clash of peers in a way.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
And plus when they meet later, it&#8217;s like she sees him and goes, &#8220;Warrior.&#8221; And they have that mutual respect like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like you but I&#8217;m coming for you. But I kind of respect you a lot because you&#8217;re my equal.&#8221; They finally found that equal so I found that very pleasant to watch.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
And Namora is the one with the feathers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. She has these almost like lioness kind of feathers, like lion fish kind of feathers for her sort of headdress I guess is what you would call it. Yeah. Beautiful.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah. I really wanted them to&#8230; I know we only had so much time and two hours and 40 minutes is not enough time to get everything. But if there was one thing I guess I really wish we saw was more of Namora. I wish we understood more of her and her motivations, but it is what it is. And I&#8217;m not mad at it, but it was just she was equally a powerful woman. And I think that if we could do something else, it&#8217;s seeing Indigenous women of all different backgrounds being powerful and being complex characters. That would be the next thing that I would want to see is that because it would&#8217;ve been even cooler if Namora was the one going up against Okoye. But I&#8217;m not sure what they got in store for her in the MCU.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
And that was another place where language, the Gria was translating for Shuri to say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t kill her, take me.&#8221; And they obliged. So it&#8217;s this, I think throughout the movie we were like, &#8220;Do we hate them? Do we like them? Are we rooting for them? Who?&#8221; It was for me a back and forth, like I feel for you, but I don&#8217;t want to because I don&#8217;t like what you did. It was a back and forth.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so here we kind of see the&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Their whole world is beautiful too. Just built on the same base stone and creating this architectural marvel, bringing the sun to his people, that line and just seeing that palace, I don&#8217;t even know what you would call that. Some underwater architectural marvel, that gave me chills and I was just like, &#8220;Ah, I like him.&#8221; Damn.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So at this part in the movie, we sort of see this split, what you&#8217;re talking about is when they end up taking Shuri and Riri down to Talokan and then Shuri gets to see Namora&#8217;s kingdom for her own eyes. And I&#8217;m pretty sure by seeing that, she saw in that protector role the same thing that she saw in her brother. I see that you&#8217;re someone that is trying to protect your civilization, protect your people. And then on the other end you see Ramonda who is just concerned about getting Shuri back. And so Ramonda ends up going to Haiti. I&#8217;m glad they called it Haiti and didn&#8217;t just say Haiti. So Ramonda goes to Haiti, meets up with Nakia and asks her to retrieve Shuri, which ends up happening kind of&#8230; It happens at an interesting time because you start to feel, at least from Shuri&#8217;s standpoint down in Talokan, that they&#8217;re starting to come to some sort of understanding and agreement. And in this case, Wakanda sort of forces the hand of the Talokan by basically rescuing Shuri and Riri and kind of bringing them back to the surface world.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
And killing some people in the process. That part right there was just like, &#8220;Ah, if only you didn&#8217;t do that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
See. Okay. Here&#8217;s the thing though, y&#8217;all couldn&#8217;t let Shuri call Ramonda and just let her know she all right? You know what I mean? That&#8217;s my thing. Y&#8217;all got all this advanced technology and y&#8217;all can&#8217;t just send a text message? You know what I&#8217;m saying? How you going to steal a Black woman&#8217;s child?</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Yeah, because she has the Kimoyo bead earrings.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Right? She got the Kimoyo bead earrings down there, they got the sun underwater. You telling me y&#8217;all didn&#8217;t have no way of communicating? Okay. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
I mean they had a conch shell, but you got to blow into it and throw it in the ocean.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
You couldn&#8217;t send a SOS through the conch shell or something? That&#8217;s not a plot hole for me. It&#8217;s more like I don&#8217;t know if anybody&#8217;s hand was forced because Namor up here kind of forgetting basic etiquette. You know what I&#8217;m saying? Oh yeah, we got the princess. She&#8217;s doing a diplomatic tour of our country. She&#8217;ll come back, don&#8217;t trip. But you show up at somebody&#8217;s house, threaten them and then all of a sudden they baby go missing. And they know that they in your hood. Oh yeah, we going to send somebody. If there was one big mistake, that was it for me. It was like y&#8217;all just been communicating more. If y&#8217;all had just been establishing some communication and trying to do some trust. But Namor is arrogant. In the comics, he&#8217;s just the most arrogant son of a person you&#8217;ve ever met. Right?</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Well, when you put it like that, he has been alive since what, 1471. Yeah, he should&#8217;ve known.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
He should know better.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Yeah, he definitely knew. But maybe he just has not gone out that much in centuries. I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Okay. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
And the cave where they were holding them was so beautiful to me. I thought what? Again, going back to the lighting and setting a mood, that seemed like a very&#8230; Although they were being held captive, it was still a welcoming place. And again, there&#8217;s this duality throughout the film of like, do we want it? They shouldn&#8217;t really be there, but it&#8217;s okay. And then getting to go and see the city, obviously after putting on a&#8230; Well, I mean&#8230; Yeah, after getting the&#8230; You got to put on the suit, otherwise your bones will break because of all the pressure from the water. So yeah. That cave was just so beautiful.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah, it was really beautiful. Also, I think one thing that was really clear to me was the humanity of your enemy is still in consideration. Right? Which is something that we don&#8217;t really see in a lot of other non&#8230; For me, this was a lot. I saw a lot of threads of Indigeneity. I saw a lot of threads of the basic humanity of a person is still considered. You&#8217;re our prisoner, but we&#8217;re not going to torture you. We&#8217;re going to make sure you get some&#8230; Are you hungry? Have you eaten?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, and also there&#8217;s a mutual respect. The Talokan brings Shuri a garment befitting of royalty. She&#8217;s not in any sort of prisoner garb or anything. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;We see you. We see you. We know who you are. We know what this is.&#8221; The Talokan&#8217;s are treating Shuri and I guess Riri by proxy with a level of respect and humanity that quite frankly you don&#8217;t see on the surface world towards Black people.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Or toward really any Indigenous person. I would make the argument that if we&#8217;re sort really looking at this with a little bit of a political lens, I don&#8217;t know if Shuri was captured by France or Russia or any of those nations that have been colonizing nations. If we would be seeing this kind of treatment, especially Black women, especially other women of color and Riri being kept alive and safe and whole. And that whole scene where they bring her Shuri, the dress and Riri was like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t put that on because what happens in these white films when you put that dress on.&#8221; And not having that happen to Shuri, not having Talokan try to&#8230; Or sorry. Namor try to force himself on her, try to marry her, anything like that. But just being like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to treat you an equal. And I&#8217;m going to show you&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He even gives her that bracelet from his mother, which ends up becoming an important part throughout, near the end of the film.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
As soon as that happened, I was like, &#8220;Wait, what did he say that bracelet was made with?&#8221; Okay, so this is how we&#8217;re going to get the Black Panther back. I knew it. I was just like, &#8220;Ooh, I can&#8217;t wait for this part.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So Nakia helps Shuri and Riri escape and then Namor and the Talokan&#8217;s completely retaliate against Wakanda. And I like that they did it in this almost river market type of setting. Because that&#8217;s not something that we really saw in the first movie. We saw these sort of grand, almost drone shot overhead vistas. Of course, you saw the main royal courtroom and Shuri&#8217;s lab and such, but you didn&#8217;t really get to see that much on the ground. And so the Talokan&#8217;s attack Wakanda, Ramonda is killed trying to save Riri or she&#8217;s drowned by trying to save Riri, the part you mentioned with her in the water.</p>
<p>And then Namor kind of gives this ultimatum. Basically he&#8217;s going to come back in a week and completely wipe Wakanda off the map and the Wakandan&#8217;s have to retreat to the Jabari land for safety. And that part of the movie, I mean this of course is really setting up whatever the next main conflict is. But it also thrusts Shuri right back into this grief cycle almost. Not to say that she really got over the death of her brother, but then a year later to lose her mother too. Oh my God.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Being in the movie theater with folks when Ramonda died was, again, it was like the air was taken out of the room. Are you serious? Is this real? More tears are shed because one, Angela Bassett acted&#8230; I mean award winning no matter if she gets an award or not. In my book, she gets an award. But this is the matriarch. This is a person that we&#8217;ve seen fight for their family and go through hardship, lost their son, did everything that they could to get their daughter back, gets their daughter back and then dies. And now the daughter is left holding the bag. What? And being so young still and being consumed with revenge and vengeance.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
And grief.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So at that moment, she basically retreats back to the lab. Of course, she has the bracelet from Namor&#8217;s mother. And like Paul said uses that to kind of synthetically end up reconstructing the heart shape herb. And so reconstructs the herb, 3D prints the herb, which I thought was pretty dope. 3D prints the herb, distills it into a tincture and then Shuri ends up drinking it so she can go to the ancestral plane. Because I think one, of course, is to try to seek knowledge about what&#8217;s the next step. Because I have no one at this point, no one else in my family is alive. And maybe the intention when she drank it was that she thought she would see her brother or she thought she would maybe see her mother. But then she takes it and end up seeing Killmonger.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Hey, little cuzo.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In the ancestral plane. I was like, yo, no way.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
That was such good scene too. Because that confirmed to everybody that he&#8217;s dead.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
But yes, that one. But I really think about her being under the water, which water was a common theme, but being in the water, coming out of the water dry. Right? And seeing, again, the beautiful colors of the astral plane and then turning around and seeing, knowing someone&#8217;s in the chair and saying, &#8220;Mother.&#8221; And then walking closer and then seeing it&#8217;s not. That was so powerful.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
So what was interesting about that, and I&#8217;m not sure if anybody else picked up on this, but in Black Panther one, when T&#8217;Challa takes it, he sees T&#8217;Chaka, who was the last Black Panther before. So when Shuri takes it, she sees the last Black Panther. Which was in N&#8217;Jadaka, right? So I was like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s how that&#8217;s going to get around showing Chadwick Boseman.&#8221; Because he wasn&#8217;t the last Black Panther before he died.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
That makes sense. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
So in terms of lineage. Yeah, in terms of lineage. And I was like, that&#8217;s such a master stroke. The whole movie is genius, but that is such a beautiful little detail. And then there&#8217;s this overlay of Killmonger is set for revenge and that&#8217;s where Shuri is going and all that stuff. But of course, Ramonda wouldn&#8217;t be part of one of the people. Because the ceremony is that you get to talk to the Black Panthers that will give you guidance. Right? Ramonda was never a Black Panther. And Shuri doesn&#8217;t know that because Shuri&#8217;s actually&#8230; There&#8217;s no priest of the Black Panthers guiding her through that journey.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Zuri passed in the first movie, right? Chancellor person.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
And then the other Black Panther priests who come in later in the film toward the end, they&#8217;re nowhere to be found. So it&#8217;s Nakia who knows how to do the grinding ritual part of it, which is beautiful too. To have these three highly intelligent, highly skilled Black women making a way where there is no way. That&#8217;s a beautiful moment. But also there&#8217;s this layer underneath that of Shuri being like, &#8220;Oh, fuck tradition. I&#8217;m doing this so I can get my revenge.&#8221; And that is actually what Killmonger was doing too. That is these beautiful little parallels that are set up throughout the entire movie that are just so rich. I love that whole feat. That was so good. Oh man. So good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So Shuri comes out of the ancestral plane, sort of fueled, I guess in a way of revenge from having spoken with Killmonger. And then she realizes, oh, she has the strength of the Black Panther. So she becomes the next Black Panther. And it&#8217;s interesting because she talks with&#8230; I think she talked with M&#8217;Baku after that, I want to say. And M&#8217;Baku was almost kind of giving her, you would think would be contradictory advice. The Jabari tribe being more kind of shunning technology and things like that. M&#8217;Baku almost giving her advice for peace. And instead Shuri wants vengeance and orders this immediate counter attack on Namor and the Talokan. Of course, Okoye is no longer the general of the Dora Milaje. Now, it&#8217;s Ayo who&#8217;s the general. And then Shuri gets the New Armor, the midnight angel armor that she had been making. Gives it to Okoye and then Okoye recruits Aneka to join her. So then the Wakandan&#8217;s all set out on this big ass ship to try to set a trap for Namor, to try to lure everyone to the surface. And it&#8217;s a huge epic battle.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny because you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, the Wakandan&#8217;s got it.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh no, the Talokan&#8217;s got it.&#8221; It really sort of goes back and forth. It&#8217;s interesting how when she talks with Riri, how of they get the idea of how to weaken Namor by just exposing him to heat, to dry him out. So there&#8217;s this whole interesting elemental symbolism cycle, which I do want to talk about, between earth, fire, air, and water that goes throughout the film. And so then it comes to near the end of the movie, both the Black Panther Shuri and Namor are fighting on this desert beach. You think that Shuri is about to kill him. And then she gets all these flashbacks and I guess messages from the ancestors and spares his life. And then they make an alliance. Namor accepts that, the battle ends. And so Riri ends up going back to Boston.</p>
<p>And the movie kind of mostly ends off, I would say, at that point. Of course there&#8217;s this mid credit scene which happens afterwards where Shuri goes to Haiti to finally do the ritual that she was about to do with Ramonda at the top of the movie, which was burning the funeral robes, the funeral ceremonial robes. And she does so on the beach, is finally able to grieve. And then Nakia is joined by a young boy who is her son, Toussaint. I think it says Toussaint in the movie, but Toussaint. And Toussaint tells Shuri like, &#8220;Toussaint my Haitian name. My Wakandan name is T&#8217;Challa.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like in this moment Shuri&#8217;s like not only do I now have family, family that I didn&#8217;t even know that I had, but now this young boy very well could be the next Black Panther, which I thought was a super clever way to recast in the future whomever the Black Panther will be.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Prince T&#8217;Challa. He&#8217;s Prince T&#8217;Challa.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Prince T&#8217;Challa. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Opens the door for future films with the same name. Brilliant.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Brilliant.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Brilliant story work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I stayed till after the credits hoping there would be another scene and it just said, &#8220;Black Panther will return.&#8221; I&#8217;m glad they just left it open like that. They just said Black Panther will return. That&#8217;s it. I don&#8217;t know what an after credit scene could have done outside of that because once I saw that part with Toussaint and them on the beach, my jaw was on the floor. I was like, &#8220;What?&#8221; That was so brilliant.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
More tears were shed.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
More tears were shed. Well, that last scene of her sitting on the beach, and again it was almost like the beginning of the film and the end of the film were the same. And it was a tribute to Chadwick who Ryan Coogler beyond loved.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah, loved, loved.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Loved, loved. Like this isn&#8217;t just, &#8220;Oh, good working with you.&#8221; This was true love. And to me, this was the biggest love letter he could give.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
I am so glad they did not do some 3D deep fake model of Chadwick to have him act in depth. I&#8217;m so glad they didn&#8217;t do that.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Oh my God. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No Star Wars force ghost or something.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
No Tupac hologram thing. No. I was very happy. I was very happy about that too.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah, it feels disrespectful to do something like that. Yeah. And it felt disrespectful when they did that with Tupac, to be quite honest with you. Anyway. We talking about Black Panther, I&#8217;m going away from&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So yeah, that&#8217;s the movie. I mean we spent a good bit of time going over the whole plot of everything, but then the movie actually was much longer than the first one and there was so much introduced. I remember seeing this interview where Ruth Carter said that nine new superheroes were introduced in this movie. And I was really like, &#8220;Namora, Attuma, Riri.&#8221; There were a lot of people that were sort of introduced. And so it was a lot to cram into one film. But I think it did a great job overall. And granted, this episode is not about dissecting really the plot of the movie. We&#8217;re here to talk about design, which we will get into right now. So let&#8217;s start with the fashion. I think the most striking thing for me is&#8230; Well, I mean there&#8217;s so many striking things, but the one that stands out to me, because we just talked about it, was Shuri as Black Panther in her Black Panther suit.</p>
<p>It had been intimated, I think through earlier interviews and such that Shuri was going to be the Black Panther. And you could tell, of course, there&#8217;s like the dots around the eyes that were very similar to the same ones that Shuri had in both the first and the second movie. I like how her suit was kind of this mix of black and gold, like Killmonger&#8217;s suit was gold, T&#8217;Challa&#8217;s suit was black. And so hers was kind of a mixture of two, I guess with that gold sort of symbolizing the sort of revenge or vengeful parts that she probably shares with Killmonger at this present time.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
But there was the scene where she was going for the&#8230; Looking at the face mask of her brother and then she moved forward to her own. It was a passing of the&#8230; Not a passing of the torch, but in ways, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m honoring you and I have my own.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah. And the comic Shuri does become the Black Panther at a time. And also she ends up having her own role and she doesn&#8217;t have any sort of code name, but she does become the keeper of the Wakandan history, the oral history. And when we&#8217;re talking about fashion, in the comic, she has these beautiful long, they almost look like elephant tusk earrings and she&#8217;s wearing them in the funeral procession for that. And so I thought that was a nice touch to sort of harken almost, if you&#8217;re a comics fan, like foreshadowing you know Shuri is going to have this role, this very prominent role. And so it was really cool to see the Black Panther suit. I really liked how it was like gold inlaid and having the speckles of white throughout it. So it really is Shuri&#8217;s instead of a recreation of Killmonger&#8217;s.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Regin√©, our resident fashion expert&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Our resident fashion expert here. What did you think of how the costumes and everything were in the movie?</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
I love all of them. I think that Ruth Carter and team did such a brilliant job of taking, not only the influences from the African culture, but influences from the Mesoamerica, from the Mayan cultures and really blending those and bringing those together. I thought the opening scene where they&#8217;re in the all white, which is traditionally in a lot of cultures, white is worn for funerals, and typically not in the West, people wear black, and so acknowledging that, I think was so important, and again, the colors, the scenes of the folks who are walking in the streets of Wakanda, everything is so colorful and bright, all their clothing. There was one person who was just wearing this really nice sweater, dressed in heels. I remember just seeing little pieces of everybody and the blue, I don&#8217;t know, striking colors of blue and the reds, again, the colors were popping throughout the movie.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You definitely had the color white as kind of this symbolizing thread, I feel like, throughout the film. Of course, with the funeral procession, I think Shuri, in a later scene, you see her in this white dress, I think this is after she becomes a black panther. Riri is wearing white at one point in the lab. So you do see whites used in a lot of places, but more so where I think it was really tied to T&#8217;Challa, tied to Chadwick, I felt like white kind of represented him throughout the movie and the ways that we saw it being presented.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
And I want every outfit Shuri had on in that movie. Every one, every single one was, when they went to the MIT campus, that jumpsuit was, I wanted it.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
No, that was a fire jumpsuit. I was [inaudible 01:00:24] called and I am picking up, give me five of those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s very, it&#8217;s tech wear. It&#8217;s this really nice kind of fitted jumpsuit that of course she was saying it, I can blend in with the students, but I would even say her hair, I mean you to talk about just Shuri&#8217;s hair journey, in the first movie, her hair is always presented in this very, almost regal, braided up do&#8217;s and things of that nature, and then with the second movie, it&#8217;s more, I guess, relaxed in a way. She has just these front curls at the top of her head. It&#8217;s very almost casual in a way, I guess, growing into her womanhood, because she&#8217;s what, a teenager, supposedly a teenager in the first movie? I think she&#8217;s probably what, maybe 21, 22 in Wakanda Forever.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
I think she&#8217;s mid twenties in this film.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Also, I&#8217;m just thinking about the blip too, because there&#8217;s like a five year gap&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s why I was saying that, yeah. I think she&#8217;s mid twenties, but as they say, black people age in plateaus. There&#8217;s not a linear.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve never heard that, but I love it. I&#8217;m going to keep using that moving forward.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah. So I do think that. I&#8217;m still stuck on Okoye&#8217;s outfits, to be quite honest with you, because they really put her in some very, very sharp looking suits, and I&#8217;m of a good looking suit on anybody, and they just really made it work. It&#8217;s just great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then further pushing that sartorial point, even when you look at the Talokan, you look at Namora and the people of Talokan, I feel like there&#8217;s so much that had to have gone into making sure that they got a lot of those elements as closely as they could culturally write. You&#8217;ll notice they&#8217;re not really wearing fabric, of course, as they&#8217;re underwater, but then the neck pieces are shells and coral and thinking about how they might have used vibranium to create what it is that they have and what they wear in their civilization. They obviously have to have things that allow for great mobility underwater. Even the face mask kind of thing that has water in it, I thought was pretty cool.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Yeah, I did know notice that&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Beautiful design.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
&#8230; every time the Talokan were just moving around underwater, the things they were carrying were always in a mesh bag, which made a lot of sense as I was watching it, but I was just like, &#8220;Huh, I guess if I lived underwater, I was just doing groceries or whatever, I would want something that could just move freely with me.&#8221; And it was just a weird out of body thought I had while watching that, and then I was just like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to live in the water.&#8221; But that&#8217;s neither here nor there. Hannah Beachler&#8217;s production bible for the first Black Panther had to have been massive. So for this one, I still wish we could get a hold of it, but it&#8217;s still probably going to be top secret until maybe a decade from now, but I&#8217;m just so inspired by all the visuals that come out of that, and all the research that goes into just everything, because it is a lot. It has to be to make this film look and feel as great as it does.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yes. Was Hannah Beachler part of this one as well?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
She was. She was production designer for this. Shout out to her for that, and if you all want to listen to her episode, it&#8217;s episode 300 of Revision Path, you can listen to that on the website, but yeah, she was a production designer for this film too.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And as I found out later, came up with the Wakandan like glyph language that we also see throughout the film.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Oh wow, so also a typographer. Okay.<br>
 Also a typographer. Brilliant, brilliant, just killing it. I like with Namor and with Attuma and with Namora, how you started to see all these traditional sea elements as part of, just part what they were wearing. Namora was wearing pearls. He was wearing pearls in his necklace and in his kind of neck piece, and then Namor had these sort of big fish fins with her headdress as well as her kind of neck piece. Attuma, I think, had a sharks jaw on the top of his thing, that spread out. It was interesting to see how they utilized those as part of their armature, which really solidified them as being these underwater dwellers, as part of this underwater civilization.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Namor&#8217;s throne also looked like it was a mouth of a shark, and I was just like, &#8220;Oh, this guy&#8217;s badass.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Even his headdress, that big, huge circular headdress, majestic.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
And again, him coming down into the throne, that scene, where they&#8217;re about to&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
&#8230; go battle. So him coming down and again, just the lighting, the whole scene of coming down and then sitting&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Fire.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
&#8230; was just beautiful.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
I love that. That whole speech was so good too, because what was great about it is he said, &#8220;I made a mistake. This is my bad, but now we got to go to war. So we doing this?&#8221; And everybody was like, &#8220;Yeah, let&#8217;s go.&#8221; How often do you see leaders be like, &#8220;Yo, actually I know I&#8217;m charged with protecting you and I made a mistake, so forgive me.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Yeah, that never happens.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Right? Just all of these little bits were just so good.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
And another scene I&#8217;m thinking about from a fashion perspective was when they&#8217;re on the ship, and they&#8217;re about to start fighting, and the Dora Milaje start running to jump off that boat, and all you see are these red suits, right?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Flying in the air and you&#8217;re like, where are they? Are they jumping in the water? You didn&#8217;t really know until they got caught and you could see them, and to me, that scene, and again, going back to the colors and the outfits and seeing the blueness of the bodies, in contrast with that red, it was an amazing scene to watch. It really was.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
I really loved, and I&#8217;m not sure whose idea this was, and if anybody that was working on the Black Panther want to just reach out and come on the podcast and just let us know. That&#8217;d be great.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Oh please.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
But I&#8217;m not sure whose idea it was to make the Talokan people appear brown underwater, and blue when they&#8217;re on the surface. That was such a brilliant touch. I&#8217;m going to go see it again today, but the fact that there are these deep, rich stills, sort of these deep rich browns of the indigenous folks of Mesoamerica underwater, they can be how you remember them underwater or how we would remember them underwater, but when they come up to the surface, they&#8217;re changed into this blueness. That was dope, dope, dope, dope, dope. I loved that so much. It was my favorite bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think they did a really great job. I talked about this earlier of showing, if we look at Wakanda, for example, just the architecture of Wakanda, how they really show more of what you would see on the regular, just surface level of being in the country, I would say, because I don&#8217;t think they really talked about any specific cities in Wakanda. They just sort of talked about Wakanda as a country, but I think it was near the end of the movie. It was the first time that I saw a car driving on a road, in Wakanda. This happens near the end of the movie where you see these Wakandan, the best I&#8217;d call them are like lakefront houses, they&#8217;re on stilts, right? But you see a car driving on a road, I was like, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen anyone driving in Wakanda. What the Wakanda traffic rules look like?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know. But you didn&#8217;t see stuff like that. But I thought that even showing the sort of marketplace where that fight took place and you started, you saw the bridges, you saw kind of the towering skyscrapers and buildings, but then on the ground it still feels and looks very, the best I could describe it is African, in that it still felt like it was very of the earth, even with all these technological advances, but then you see this other part out near this sort of lake house, honestly, that could have been Hilton Head in South Carolina. That could have been the Keys in Florida. It just looked and maybe it was, just in terms of actual physical setting, but I like how it showed you these different aspects of Wakanda. It didn&#8217;t give you what I think people would stereotypically think of as &#8220;Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
I did see that&#8217;s in the beginning of the movie when they were flying into Wakanda, in the lower right of the screen, there was a subway. There were, that a train car coming in. I was just like, &#8220;Huh, okay, that&#8217;s cool.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
That was there, in the first one too, the subways.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah. They had to transport the vibranium from the Great Mound.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Oh right.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah. And it&#8217;s interesting with Wakanda, because again, I would love to see, if someone wants to come in and set me straight, just let me know, but I would love to see the production bible because there&#8217;s this whole movement of what&#8217;s called solar punk versus cyber punk, which is dystopian and the world is just going to end up the matrix. Solar punk, and they&#8217;ve been doing this in the comics too with Wakanda, is the integration of technology with the natural environment from the earth, and so that is a lot of what they have with Wakanda, right, is just this very sort, bright, hopeful future of it, and then you see that mirrored in the technology in Talokan actually, when it&#8217;s like, we&#8217;re going to be working with our environment instead of being distinct from it. I loved all of those productions to look at, those set pieces and things like that. I would pay so much to just spend time on that set. Just look at it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. When you said solar punk, that did really capture, I think especially in Wakanda, that kind of hopefulness of what the future could look like, not what the future necessarily is, and I would say in some way with Namor bringing the sun to his people in that sort of way, is probably an allusion to that as well, we did see there was some, I guess, primitiveness in Talokan City where you saw children playing and things of that nature, but it also was still very technological. So it&#8217;s almost like an underwater Wakanda, or maybe Wakanda is an over-world Talokan, but there&#8217;s definitely similarities that are going on there, as above, so below, that sort of duality.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
That&#8217;s what I felt. There were a lot of parallels between the two, in essence, countries, that they used what they had and made the most of it.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah. I feel I know how to put this, but I feel like there&#8217;s this way that we, in Western mindsets, we kind of look at things as primitive and things like that, but I&#8217;m also, if it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it. You know what I mean? There are designs that haven&#8217;t changed for millennia. I think about just other places in the world that ,are older than the Western world, that use designs that have just been passed down over generations and generations, and you can&#8217;t build a better mouse trap. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, no, go ahead. Go ahead, I want to say something after that.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Oh, okay. Yeah, and just sometimes I think what&#8217;s sort of cool and radical about both Wakanda and Talokan, is they&#8217;re using indigenous technologies as equally as they&#8217;re using what we would consider Western or modern technologies, and it&#8217;s cool to see those designs held in the same regard, and that&#8217;s kind of the whole thing about what I really loved about this movie. It was the ways in which we&#8217;ve learned about native or indigenous folks, is that they were lower in technology and backwards and things like that, or primitive or things like that. And it&#8217;s just like, &#8220;No, actually they were actually fairly advanced and they don&#8217;t need to have all of these different design languages of the west to still be considered advanced.&#8221; I really, really loved that about all of the little pieces that I kept seeing throughout the movie.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, go ahead. Go ahead, Regin√©, go ahead.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
I was thinking about what we see a lot of in the movie, and we saw this in the last movie too, was a lot of gesture based things, right? Hand tracking gesture based things, which right now in 2022, we&#8217;re seeing that a little bit in VR and a little bit in AR too, but this movie takes it to another level. I mean, when Ramonda raises her hands and you see all these&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
&#8230; you see all the planes, I don&#8217;t know what you call them planes, but the planes come up and she&#8217;s in control of everything with her hands. It isn&#8217;t a control board and all of that stuff. So I think, again, looking at things from the lens that&#8217;s been applied to this, is a futurist lens for the folks of Wakanda and their technology, and I think it will influence what people end up making in our real world.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah, I hope so. I&#8217;m still waiting for kimoyo beads.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Listen man.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
We&#8217;re all waiting for those.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Please. I have so many notes on those. They continue to be dope. You can take them off and have them as earrings, they can be flying bugs, they can be defibrillators.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Are you serious.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Well, all right. Well you know?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
No, no, no.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
With my kimoyo beads.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, you were supposed to be on that from the last movie. What&#8217;s going on?</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
You had four years. What&#8217;s happening with those?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are you okay, Paul? Is this an intervention?</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
No, man. So I was thinking about this again last night. I was like, &#8220;Okay, they&#8217;re all magnetic. How do they work together?&#8221; There was something else, I was like, &#8220;Okay, they must use Piezoelectric properties and all this stuff.&#8221; And then I was thinking about, &#8220;Cerbo Motors, accelerometers. How can we manufacture them to be as tiny to fit in these things? How would they connect to each other? Oh, well maybe the magnetic connection between them that keeps them together could also provide electricity towards in them.&#8221; Then I was like, &#8220;How would they be a defibrillator now?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Okay, maybe if they can detect being on a body, that&#8217;s when they&#8217;ll do something or whatever. And then you present to them and then it would just release all the electricity stored in each and every one.&#8221; There&#8217;s so much that you can extrapolate on all this, which is why we need Hannah Beachler&#8217;s production bible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Miss Beachler.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Please, just like, I will pay her. I don&#8217;t know, I just want all her notes on that, and another thing that bothered me about the film was, &#8220;How did the CIA bug them?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Can you bug kimoyo beads?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve been thinking about that the entire&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
I was like, &#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve been thinking about that the entire time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Really?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve been thinking about that the entire time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Maybe that&#8217;ll be revealed in a future Disney Plus thing, because I get what you&#8217;re saying. What was her name in the film? Val Allegra de Fontaine who, who had her debut in the Falcon and the Winter Soldier, which was the Disney Plus series from last year, is reintroduced in this film, not only as the director of the CIA, but also Everett Ross&#8217;s wife, I kind of felt that was, maybe again, that&#8217;ll be explained in another movie, felt a little throw away to me, felt like we got to put some other white people in here, so we got to tie it in some way to Disney Plus. But it kind of felt a little, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if you can really get one up on the Wakanda like that?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Yeah, I was just like, &#8220;Come on bro.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
I&#8217;m glad that the only plot magic that happened, that is the United States is somehow able to bug what a content technology like that, because everything else feels, we&#8217;re talking about people flying through the air and we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, that makes sense, that makes sense&#8221;, but how you going to bug kimoyo beads?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I wasn&#8217;t sure about that.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
I can see how someone could become a muted by his mother drinking some fancy stuff, but I mean, come on, let&#8217;s be real, technologically speaking.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I want to touch on something that Jordan, you said earlier around solar punk, which I think was an interesting, I guess, treatise throughout the film. Solar punk is sort of this vision of a future that embodies what humanity can achieve, but I think another key element of solar punk is, sustainability. It&#8217;s a point where humanity sees itself as a part of nature, which is what the Wakandans have done by using vibranium to build their civilization. It&#8217;s what the Talokan have used to build their civilization, and so you have these other cultures, Western cultures that are like, &#8220;Yeah, we want some of that too. You need to share with us&#8221;, when we all know it&#8217;s not about sharing, &#8220;We want to take it for ourselves. So you have nothing. We want to strip it from you so we can have it.&#8221; And I think it&#8217;s interesting when you think about that saying move fast and break things, how that is completely antithetical to solar punk ,moving fast and breaking things is pretty much just new school manifest destiny. We want to take what you have and make it our own thing.</p>
<p>So what I think is interesting, which with both Namor and Shuri, even at some points, mulling over this idea of an alliance, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Look, we have more in common than you think with the rest of these people. The rest of these people just want to take, take, take.&#8221; Namor has seen it firsthand with the conquistadors. Shuri definitely has seen it with now the outside world wanting to take what Wakanda has, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. That sort of thing, I thought was a really interesting tie between both of these civilizations that I would love to see how that plays out in future films, because at the end of the film, they do come to an alliance, but I would love to see how that plays out.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah, I would love to see how that plays out. I&#8217;m also just thinking about, in a lot of activist movements, and especially in things like restorative justice, and things that are actively crediting like indigenous folks and actively crediting, unlike the United States who, our constitution is based on the indigenous people that our countries came in contact with, and we just janked it. We just ripped it off and tried to copy off the homework and all that stuff, but here, there&#8217;s this really great thing that&#8217;s happening where there is this, the thing that really made my heart sore about this movie is there&#8217;s this undercurrent, really truly of indigeneity, and indigeneity and working together and really thinking about the ways that we approach each other is very, very important, and even the main conflict for both of them happens, because these outside white Western forces are like, &#8220;We want this rare mineral and we&#8217;re going to use a young, a brilliant young black woman&#8217;s invention that she didn&#8217;t even [inaudible 01:23:45] to use.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did it to prove her professor wrong, and the professor who, we don&#8217;t know what he looks like, but he might get a little palm colored, sold it to the United States government from MIT, right? And so there&#8217;s this young black, and that the whole conflict is black women protecting this young, brilliant black woman from consequences of being brilliant, and people misusing her brilliance. You could definitely have that interpretation of the movie.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
She was definitely exploited.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
She was exploited, and so you have, the whole conflict comes from the fact that these white nations want to take something that is sacred to both of these cultures, and that they have sacred rights and sacred engagement with, and it was like, I loved that whole thing. I love solar punk because solar punk draws a lot from indigeneity and indigenous ways of knowing, and so does Afro futurism. All of these threads, I highly recommend people read a lot of, I highly recommend people read, period, but I highly recommend that people so long been dreaming, which is like post-colonial science fiction or reading the bones, sorry, what&#8217;s it called? Dark matter, Reading the Bones, which has also done some black Afro futurism stuff, because you&#8217;ll start to see these seeds and threads that connect black people and indigenous people together, around the ways in which we&#8217;re relearning how we approached each other and how we had our humanity preserved.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s slower, it&#8217;s not as action packed. It&#8217;s not as exciting for Western audiences, because we&#8217;ve been primed for war. But I do want to imagine what it would&#8217;ve been like. That&#8217;s kind of why I&#8217;m upset with Namor, showing up on somebody&#8217;s beach, and I&#8217;ll pass it off, because he was a kid and nobody taught him the ways to do that, but you don&#8217;t show up to somebody&#8217;s house, not bring, oh, but he did bring a gift, he brought the vibranium thing, nevermind, he brought a gift, but you know, don&#8217;t show up threatening people, but it looked like, to me, I could have really interpreted this film as two indigenous nations, trying to fight off the effects of imperialism, and getting messed up along the way. Sorry, I saw it once and I was like, &#8220;I got a whole art, a couple of articles in a book in me, I guess about this. This is beautiful TV, it&#8217;s a wonderful show, it&#8217;s a wonderful movie. I loved everything that Ryan Kugler put into it, hannah Beecher put into it.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Everything that Ryan Coogler put into it Hannah Beachler put into it that Ruth Carter put into it. They did it.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Yeah. And it&#8217;s so layered from a political perspective, from a social perspective, from a historical perspective. There are so many different layers to it that to me, just all equal brilliance. I thought that this was a very well written script with knowing.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
That this script was written in grief.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
And it shows to me. It shows to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it does. But it was written in grief, but also with all of these layers. And it&#8217;s done with such care. I said this before, about this nature of the elements being symbolized throughout the movie, like fire, water, earth, air. It&#8217;s interesting. One, with the Talokan being this underwater civilization, but also most of Wakandan&#8217;s major ceremonies take place around water, at the Warrior Falls. When that&#8217;s happening, for example, to determine who&#8217;s going to be the next Black Panther, Killmonger&#8217;s quote at the end of the movie about being in the ocean. So water clearly plays this sort of pivotal role about, it&#8217;s a symbol of life. It&#8217;s a symbol of change, of flexibility. Just how all the Wakandan&#8217;s are saying that death is never the end.</p>
<p>So water is kind of this rebirth and reincarnation. Namor is born underwater. So I found there&#8217;s that interesting symbolism. Then there&#8217;s the opposite of that, which is fire, which is destruction. The Heart-shaped Herb was burned up. The final battle happens of a hot desert with things on fire.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Vengeance, destruction.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Namor is ultimately sort of defeated by fire. And you can even channel that into the rage that Shuri feels when she goes to the ancestral plane and she&#8217;s talking to Killmonger. She&#8217;s like surrounded by fire that happens to be in water, but she&#8217;s surrounded by fire.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
And she wanted to make the world burn.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Make the world burn. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
And he said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s do it together.&#8221; Right, earlier in the film he said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s do it together.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
So yeah, no, please continue. I want to hear air and earth.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I mean I think with Earth, certainly Earth is, we think of Mother Earth, the foundation, the symbol of fertility, the Heart-shaped Herb of course comes from the earth. So does the same herb that I guess Talokan has. That comes from the earth. But also the earth is something that we all share. All of us, all of our cultures share the earth. We share this planet. We share in its resources. And so you think of Earth as the symbol of humanity. Yes. We&#8217;re all fighting for resources. I think that&#8217;s said at one point in the movie about fighting over resources.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yes. It is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you have-</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah, Namor is saying it to Shuri. It&#8217;s like, this is why they&#8217;re coming after us, this sacred resource.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then air is used a lot I think. Well, I mean of course name Namor can fly, but a lot of the music around the Talokan-</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
And Riri.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And Riri, but a lot of the music around like the Talokan and Namor and everything is air instruments. It&#8217;s flutes.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s conch shell that&#8217;s used as a trumpet, it&#8217;s ocarinas, there&#8217;s all these sort of airy, wind elements that symbolize the Talokan. And then of course the Kukulkan with the feathered serpents. That whole siren song you sing into the air, et cetera. There&#8217;s all these interesting, just sort of symbolic things around elements that are things that we all share on this planet that I feel really were woven very deftly throughout the film.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Even honestly, even the hand symbol, and this doesn&#8217;t necessarily apply to the elemental sort of thing I was talking about, but Wakandan&#8217;s have the crossed storm salute and it&#8217;s sort of close to the chest, an X almost. And then the Talokan have this open palm symbol. One palm is opened up towards the earth and then one is towards the person. And that&#8217;s actually represented in Mesoamerican art and things.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So they&#8217;ve got their own symbol that is open.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s an O almost.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
I had no idea.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you have X&#8217;s with Wakanda, which is keeping things close to themselves. You have O which of course could symbolize openness, but also symbolize the planet earth that we all live on. That is mostly water.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s a greeting. It&#8217;s a greeting and it&#8217;s receiving. Right. So there&#8217;s this thing around, I&#8217;m here. I receive. It was so good. That was such a good bit of design right there, where the ways in which we greet each other-</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
The literal Yin and Yang.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah. The reciprocity, the mirroring of the two worlds, Wakanda being on land Talokan being under the surface. What we haven&#8217;t really touched on is the writing that was done for Talokan. So we&#8217;ve talked about Hannah Beachler doing the symbology and the type for Wakanda, but I want know who did it for Talokan. Because they&#8217;re really drawing from Mesoamerican art with that stuff. It&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I wonder if that was part of, I mean she had to have had a hand in it, I&#8217;m sure. But even those intricate drawings that Namor was doing on the wall and that&#8217;s history. At one point, I think near the end they show the clash of the panther and the serpent, which is Wakanda and Talokan.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah. Wow. I missed that bit.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah. Oh man.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Again, this is something that I don&#8217;t know, for me, I need to see this movie multiple times because there are so many little things that happen in the film that each time I watch it, I see something new.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m going to go see it tonight. I&#8217;m kind of wish it was streaming because if you&#8217;re going to wreck me this, I&#8217;d like to be the comfort of my own home where the food is a little free or it&#8217;s already bought, so I can eat my feelings a little bit more.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Yeah. The first time I saw the movie, the woman next to me was very emotional. [inaudible 01:34:20].<br>
I was like, what are we in for here?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean huge props to Ryan Coogler and the entire cast for not just persevering through obviously a gut wrenching loss to their entire casting crew, but then to also pull out this amazing story with all these lush, symbolic elements out of that. I mean, I think that is something which hopefully as creatives all of us we can really be inspired by.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah it was inspiring.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
They turned their pain into art.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. They really did.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
They really did.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The last thing I want to touch on is the music. I don&#8217;t know if you all have had a chance to listen to either the soundtrack or the score. Of course with the soundtrack. There was the Rihanna song &#8220;Lift Me Up&#8221;, which came out I think maybe about a week or two prior to the movie&#8217;s premiere, which was her return to music. Shout out to Riri-</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Shout out to Riri.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s also interesting. Rihanna&#8217;s called Riri, there&#8217;s a Riri in the movie, anyway, but&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
She&#8217;s named after Rihanna.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh she is?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
She&#8217;s named after Rihanna.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. That I didn&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
The character, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I didn&#8217;t know that. Rihanna also has a second song in the movie, which was just added. It was just added to the soundtrack, I think Friday, the day the movie came out. She has a song, I think it takes place near the end of the movie called Born Again. So it&#8217;s another sort of ballad piece. But if you haven&#8217;t listened to the soundtrack or the score, go check them out. They&#8217;re both on streaming services now. But even both of those pieces are just these rich cultural tapestries. There&#8217;s English, there&#8217;s Spanish, there&#8217;s Zulu on there, there&#8217;s the South African Xhosa language on there. There&#8217;s a poem near the end that&#8217;s this indigenous Mayan language that&#8217;s being spoken. And of course when you hear it, it will take you back to the movie because the soundtrack is what&#8217;s used for the vocal music and then the score is what&#8217;s used for the instrumental music.</p>
<p>So you&#8217;ll hear a lot of these elements from it. But I just heard about how much research went into putting together the score and making sure that it wasn&#8217;t just, I don&#8217;t want to say one note, but I think from the first movie, what the first movie did was really bring a lot more Afro beat artists into American mainstream.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean after the first movie, of course we know about TEMS, we know about Mooski, Burna Boy, Rotimi, Beyonce had a whole Lion King soundtrack. It&#8217;s very prevalent now to have Afro beats as part of mainstream music in a way. And it&#8217;s interesting how with this soundtrack, you can really hear the different cultures that he&#8217;s trying to pull from in order to make these individual soundscapes. I think this happens maybe kind of near the end of the movie where you hear the flutes and the flutes are kind of symbolic of the Talokan going to war almost.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s this really beautiful song, I think it&#8217;s on the soundtrack, not the score, but I think it&#8217;s called, I don&#8217;t know the name of it, I&#8217;m not going to try to say it. I&#8217;ll link both the soundtrack and the score in the show notes. But it&#8217;s like this underwater where, it&#8217;s the music that&#8217;s playing when Namor takes Shuri through the city. This really beautiful, almost like, synths and harps kind of thing going on.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a beautiful soundtrack. It&#8217;s a beautiful score. There&#8217;s parts of it that I was, when I listened to the soundtrack, for example, there&#8217;s this one song called &#8220;No Digas Mi Nombre&#8221;, which means &#8220;do not say my name&#8221;, which I attributed it to Namor. And it is very much a traditional kind of Mexican song. It&#8217;s a Mexican Mariachi song. Wasn&#8217;t used in the movie. I didn&#8217;t hear it in the movie. Maybe it was used somewhere, but I didn&#8217;t hear it. But when I heard the soundtrack I was like, where are they going to put this in the movie? Because it&#8217;s so thematically different from everything else. I mean E-40 is on the soundtrack. Stormzy is on the soundtrack, of course Rihanna is on the soundtrack. So you have all these-</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Did you say E-40?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, shout out to the Bay.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Ryan Coogler is from Oakland, y&#8217;all/</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But it is, I mean both the score&#8230; I remember from the first movie how I was saying that I felt like, I think I said the score to me felt more like T&#8217;Challa and the soundtrack felt like Killmonger. I didn&#8217;t really feel like any specific characterization from either the score or the soundtrack. But I do think they both did a good job of symbolizing, you know you hear the term World Music thrown around a lot. And normally when I think World Music, I think of, I don&#8217;t know, something you&#8217;d hear at a massage parlor or something, like some pan flutes or some stuff like that. But this really felt like a mixing of Africa and Mesoamerica as well as the U.S. Just kind of all mixed together in this huge just, I don&#8217;t know, musical gumbo in a way. Both the soundtrack and the score are really great. I hope people get a chance to listen to them.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah, touching on that, I know that Ludwig, whose last name I can&#8217;t really pronounce very well&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
G√∂ransson.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
G√∂ransson. Who did the soundtrack for this one and for the first Black Panther movie. It was, I really appreciate that he was very clear, I had to stretch myself a lot. And it&#8217;s really cool to see &#8220;World Music&#8221;, which is really just folk music of different people being incorporated into orchestral music, which is often used for scores and often used to&#8230; Orchestral music is often very, very white or that&#8217;s its perception. And so to see them bringing in African instruments, Mesoamerican instruments and using them to give dignity and render dignity to the scenes that use indigenous folks and African folks, it was, it&#8217;s wonderful. Yeah, I hadn&#8217;t listened to the score yet, so thank you for saying that, because I&#8217;m going to go check that out now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. G√∂ransson had said about the soundtrack, he said, &#8220;If we use the song in the film, we wanted it to be the entire song and to be connected to the story thematically. We wanted to move the audience from grief to celebration. When you listen to the soundtrack, you can close your eyes and relive the experience of the movie, that was the intention.&#8221; Which I&#8230; mission accomplished.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
I agree, because I felt sad listening to it and then I didn&#8217;t, right. Because I was like, is there going to be an upbeat song? if you listen to the music, you&#8217;ll be taken on a journey. In the movie you&#8217;re taken on a journey and it&#8217;s life&#8217;s journey. Life&#8217;s journey is bittersweet. We have these ups and these downs, these deaths and these rebirths. And that&#8217;s what this movie is.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
We rise and we fall.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
We rise and we fall.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
We&#8217;re just ordinary people out here in Wakanda. I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like I said from the first movie, I had said that I want to get the director&#8217;s cut and see what&#8217;s been cut from the movie and everything. And I say that because of two songs on the soundtrack. Tracks 18 and 19, when G√∂ransson said that he wanted to move from grief to celebration. I don&#8217;t know if there were that many celebratory moments in the film. It was definitely a meditation on grief and how you persevere through that. But the last two songs on the soundtrack, and this is, well really it&#8217;s, I guess the next to last two songs on the soundtrack since they added Track 20, which was the second Rihanna ballad. But &#8220;No Digas Mi Nombre&#8221;, like I said, it is very much a Mexican Mariachi, you might hear that at a quincea√±era, kind of song. And then Track 19 is called &#8220;Mi Pueblo&#8221; by Guadalupe de Jesus Chan Poot.</p>
<p>And when you listen to it, it is a poem. I want to know what the translation is because they don&#8217;t list the translation. But if you listen to it, you hear waves crashing and then you just hear this woman reciting this poem, which has been done in this traditional Mayan tongue. I don&#8217;t know what it means. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s something that they meant to put in the movie and they cut it out. I want to know what it is because I got to the end and I was like, what is this? And when I watched the movie, I was listening for those two distinct pieces of music and did not hear them. So I&#8217;m like, what was cut that had these things in them? I&#8217;m just mad curious about what those things were, considering I know how much love and care and craft was put into the soundtrack. Why they ain&#8217;t the movie? What happened?</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
I mean, things get cut. That&#8217;s why, I think things get cut. And then sometimes, I mean the movie was long. And so what is really going to, I think shout out to story editors because they really bring things together and in amazing ways. But I hope one day, Maurice, you get your answer because then you could tell us. I&#8217;m very curious too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Listen Hannah, if you&#8217;re listening, put out the production bible. We want to know. We want to hear it.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Please.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Please. What I got to do. Do we ever get a director&#8217;s cut of Black Panther one? Because I&#8217;m like, did that drop?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We have to look into that.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t remember.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I the DVD, but I don&#8217;t remember.</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
But I have the Blu-Ray.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Me too.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Oh, you have the DVD, I should get the DVD and Blu-Ray.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We got to check that out.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Final thoughts about Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. I asked this question at the end of the first time we did this for the first Black Panther movie. And I want to ask it again for this one. The question really being, what do you hope comes out of this?</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
My hope-</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
I have a couple things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh no, Regin√© go for it.</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
Oh, I was going to, my hope is that we get to hear more indigenous stories, because I feel that we are, so much of history has been forgotten, hidden on purpose. There are so many things that we don&#8217;t know about these cultures and we&#8217;re getting a glimpse. And even though this doesn&#8217;t exactly align with the comics, this is exposing us to a culture that we were not familiar with, a majority of us. A lot of people don&#8217;t know about Mesoamerica or anything about the cultures or the, people are made out to be savages and all these things that are not actually accurate. You know who the savages really are. And so my hope is that we get to hear more of the stories that we haven&#8217;t in the past.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okoye said, &#8220;A colonizer in chains.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Regin√© Gilbert:</b><br>
That was a great-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That was a great line. Paul, what about you?</p>
<p><b>Paul Webb:</b><br>
Oh man, I forgot about that. Oh, that was damn good. I was like, yes. What would I like to see? Obviously another film, please. These things take time, so they got to take all the time they need. We already mentioned we would love to see the production Bible. Definitely. Yeah. I think tagging on to what Regin√© said, yeah, just more stories. I would like to have more information about Namor&#8217;s background and people in his city or country more, just more of that because man, those visuals, I feel like 40% of the movie was just underwater and I would like to see more of that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Jordan?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Green:</b><br>
I actually want to kind of come in right in between Regin√© and Paul, I would love for Marvel, I kind of like how DC has been doing with their Earth Prime comics. I would love for Marvel to release an MCU line of comic books that were written by indigenous people with black people. And they&#8217;re kind of doing that with Wakanda Forever. But I do think that Talokan, not being Atlantis, but being Talokan and really being citied in Mesoamerica, that in and of itself is brilliant. And I know that the MCU under Kevin Feige has been really expanding the stories to be super diverse.</p>
<p>And you don&#8217;t see that reflected in the comics as much and you don&#8217;t see that reflected in the current lore of the comics, so I would love to see those stories and I would love for folks to really get curious about Mesoamerica art, art of the Pacifics in general and just getting curious about the stories that are hidden from us and are locked away in academia and not really accessible. Not really accessible anywhere outside of that. And really taking them again and making them their own. Yeah, I think the greatest thing about this film is this. It shows what happens when stories that come from people from the diaspora are given the proper care and treatment and budget to tell their stories the way that they want to be told. And so I hope that that is what continues to happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And for me, I feel like I&#8217;m piggybacking on everyone&#8217;s points here, but I definitely want to see Marvel tell more of these types of stories that really dig into different cultures of the world. I think for so long, particularly from the inception of Marvel comics, what we&#8217;ve been shown has been through a white lens. We get Greek mythology, we get Norse mythology. And I feel like I just know this from honestly playing the Shin Megami Tensei persona games. There are so many other world mythologies out there with amazing characters and stories and how it all sort of ties into the thing with that I think is very interesting in the movie, because we talked about the fluidity of language. All of these myths were created by humans to understand the world around them, which means that in a very primitive way, we all kind of experienced the same feelings.</p>
<p>We may call it different things. We may have different representations for them, but they all boil down to the same core feelings of loss, love, regret, anger, vengeance, et cetera. I want to see Marvel tap into that more throughout continued works throughout the MCU. And I hope that that encourages other people to do the same thing with their storytelling. Be more creative, be more experimental, be more hopeful. We talked about how this movie is really sort of a meditation on grief, but then we also flipped it to talk about how it has these solar punk hopeful elements to show us a future where we are one with the world and humanity. And we do that to try to become better people in general. So that&#8217;s what I hope really comes out of this is that it becomes sort of a clarion call similar to the first movie, but in a different way, for people to just get more creative.</p>

<p>While the World Wide Web has evolved tremendously over the past couple of decades, it can still feel like we are fighting an uphill battle when it comes to accessibility, even though this push for accessibility has existed since the first set of guidelines created by the W3C in 1999. Making the Web more accessible is a benefit to everyone, and Tiffany Stewart is working hard to make sure that happens.</p>
<p>Our conversation began with a discussion on her work at Thomson Reuters, and she shared how she got into design systems and accessibility. Tiffany also talked about moving to the U.S. from Jamaica as a teenager, attending college in Mississippi, and spoke on what prompted her to shift her focus from engineering to UX. Thank goodness we have future-thinking designers like Tiffany Stewart to ensure that we have a Web that we can all use!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Hi, my name is Tiffany Stewart. I&#8217;m a senior UX designer specializing in digital systems with a focus on accessibility. And yeah, that&#8217;s me. Very much a blurb and just really passionate about accessibility and UX.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s the year been going for you so far? How&#8217;s 2022?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Oh my gosh, 2022 has been a blast and then some. I bought a house.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Right. I am officially now a homeowner and I am in the process of building out my office. So I went and bought the IKEA cabinets and I attached them to the wall and I&#8217;m painting and I&#8217;m sanding and breaking out the miter saw. That is my life at the moment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a huge accomplishment. Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Thank you. It was a lot. The process was a lot because I think it was right before the interest rates went up, so it was just like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, I have to hustle and get this house before everything just goes to pop.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, that&#8217;s such a big accomplishment already for the year. Is there anything else that you still want to try to accomplish before 2023?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I have so many, but I think for the immediate goal for me is to see this Black Panther movie that&#8217;s coming out this year, the second one, the Black Panther. And then on my professional work and getting my design system up and running to a point where it&#8217;s doing what it needs to do and folks are able to use it in a meaningful way. So yeah, those are my big ones for the end of the year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Let&#8217;s tap into a little bit about the work that you do. You mentioned you&#8217;re a senior UX designer and you&#8217;re working at Thomson Reuters. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I think they initially hired me as a contractor to work on one of their products as a regular UX product designer. And then once they heard about my previous work on a design system prior, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll just move you over to the design system side so we can get that up and running and you can help facilitate that process.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Okay, cool.&#8221; And so I shifted into that particular space. Design system tends to be more, because I think not many people know what design system designers do. It&#8217;s more of a space where you&#8217;re looking at applying concepts across the board holistically for several products and several teams and spaces. So my day to day is really thinking about, &#8220;Okay, how do I apply the concept of warning across a design system so that all of the products are consistently representing warning in a way that&#8217;s meaningful and consistent?&#8221;</p>
<p>So my day to day is that, making decisions about what our colors are going to be and how they&#8217;re going to be expressed and just setting all of that up so that the designers can build their products relatively quickly because all of these decisions are already made for them. So they can already just bring those into play. And then working closely with the accessibility team, which I&#8217;m very excited, the first time I&#8217;ve actually ever had one. Usually, it&#8217;s just me doing it by myself. But we do have a dedicated accessibility team at TR and they&#8217;re amazing to work with and we just make sure that the DS is accessible as possible, that our products are accessible as possible. So that&#8217;s my day-to-day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me more about that accessibility. I&#8217;m curious, what does that look like at a news organization like Thomson Reuters?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
A lot of it is making sure that we are meeting WCAG requirements. We&#8217;re making sure that within the code itself, everything is labeled with the correct ARIA labels, that the DOM is in the correct order, so that when you are tapping through with your headings, everything gets represented semantically type of thing. Making sure that people who are using screen readers are able to get their news in a way that is accessible and meaningful to them. Because I think most people when they think of accessibility, they think, &#8220;Oh, I just have to match the color contrast ratio of 3:1 or whatever it is at the time.&#8221; But no, it&#8217;s actually making sure that the code works, that someone who is a purely keyboard user can tab through, everything makes sense when they tab through, they can read things, whether they are blind or otherwise situationally disabled.</p>
<p>And so we meet with the accessibility team regularly. My particular specialist that we work with is Yvonne, hey Yvonne. And then I think on the other side is Fariel. So we meet with them regularly. There&#8217;s a whole team of them, they&#8217;re amazing. We reach out, we ask questions, we pair and make sure that the code matches as well as the Figma files match so that all of our products in theory, leave the board fully accessible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like that&#8217;s a lot to do from day to day. What does your regular everyday job look like?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
It is a lot of pairing. So I will pair with devs, I will pair with like I said, Yvonne on accessibility. And then it&#8217;s also a lot of research to make sure that we are meeting the use cases that are given to us by the various teams that we work with. And then figuring out those solutions for how do we solve their problem, but make it agnostic to a design system because it can&#8217;t be really specific. The teams are usually responsible for the more specific work that they do in terms of the workflow for their particular product. But from the DS side, it&#8217;s more of a super relatively agnostic approach to how can I apply, what does a header look like in an agnostic way that everybody can just pull from the DS and use. Modify here and there. But for the most part, this is generally what a header should look like and where things should go and it is accessible because we&#8217;ve already sorted out that when you tab through, it&#8217;s going to go through here, here, here and here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And just to be clear, a design system would be different from say a brand guide or something because it seems like because you&#8217;re applying this across several different products, there&#8217;s just going to be different, like you said, situations or use cases where you may not be able to apply it directly, but maybe some elements of it. Am I getting that right?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yeah, that sounds about reasonable. Now brand does sort of inform a lot of the things because we can set those colors and that typography and some of the spacing as set colors within the system. And then if you are that brand and you are on the brand team, we at least have those in the system so that you can pull them if you need to. Those decisions are already made. So your H1 is in whatever font with whatever spacing that&#8217;s already set in the base token work. So whenever the engineers go to code it, they don&#8217;t have to worry about it. That H1 is always going to be that H1.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Got you. What&#8217;s probably the most difficult part about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Probably convincing other designers that accessibility is the thing. That is probably the hardest thing. Now, I will say that my coworkers and my teammates at TR, we&#8217;re all very passionate about accessibility, so it&#8217;s not so much a problem there per se. But I&#8217;ve worked with other designers before or other strategists or other brand folks who are just&#8230; It is pulling teeth to get them to do the bare minimum of a contrast check on a color or a button or trying to understand that there are people&#8230; Is there a focus state that&#8217;s set? What happens if you try to tab through? Because a lot of sites will break. I think in my example at the State of Black design talk, I was just trying to buy a book from a website, but just using my keyboard and it completely failed. And so I wasn&#8217;t able to check out.</p>
<p>So in my mind, if we&#8217;re making a use case for it, which I don&#8217;t generally like applying to accessibility, but if you do need to make a use case or a business use case for it, you&#8217;re preventing people from buying your product by not making it as accessible as possible. It&#8217;s easy to throw away accessibility, I think because people as a very general rule, and I mean very generic here, seem to be willing to ignore people with disabilities or having a disability in general. You hear all these stories nowadays of airlines who are completely throwing away people&#8217;s wheelchairs or people not allowing the dog for the blind user in this space because of whatever. There&#8217;s a level of disposability there that I personally don&#8217;t enjoy and I don&#8217;t like seeing it. And more so too, if you&#8217;re looking at the numbers in the U.S., a good majority of the people who have disabilities do tend to be Black and brown people. So then I&#8217;m doubly more so like, &#8220;Oh no, no, no, we have to get into this.&#8221; We absolutely have to get into this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And accessibility is one of those things that has definitely increased in importance over the years. Not just because more and more people have gotten on the web, but there are now more and more ways of experiencing the web that is not just through a standard computer monitor. There&#8217;s laptops, there&#8217;s smartphones, there&#8217;s smart watches, there&#8217;s probably a toaster out there that can get online. There&#8217;s all these different ways now to access information on the web. And granted those use cases are important, but also just as you mentioned, just differently abled people will have different sorts of things like vision requirements for high contrast or colors or even the alt text that you put on images is I think almost remedial accessibility and that&#8217;s still something a lot of people hem and haw over.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Oh my gosh, they will fight you down. They will absolutely fight you down. Or they&#8217;ll produce this interface that has no contrast whatsoever. And so you&#8217;re just guessing at this point as to what is happening on that page? I don&#8217;t know. Because I think the new thing now is everything is light and bright, so there&#8217;s no borders on anything and everything just fades into the next one. And it&#8217;s very pretty aesthetically, I will give it that, but unfortunately it&#8217;s not really usable by everyone. And I think often people forget that by and large, when you make something that is accessible, that is usable by everyone, everyone benefits. Everyone benefits there. Like the grab bar in the bathroom, I am not disabled. However, the amount of times that I have slipped on the conditioner and that grab bar saved my life. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
And it can look cute too. So yeah, it&#8217;s just accessibility works literally for everyone, so why not just do it?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. And accessibility also makes sure that as many people as possible can experience what it is that you&#8217;re putting on the web.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember back in the day, we&#8217;re talking this is early 2000s, maybe even before that, when websites would have those badges that are, this site is best viewed an Internet Explorer 6 on a desktop that&#8217;s 1024 X 768. It was almost like a bouncer at the door telling you, you have to be this old to get in or something.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, no, it&#8217;s a matter too, because I think what people don&#8217;t include in accessibility when they are thinking about the digital part of it too, is that they don&#8217;t include access. Not everybody has access to the best monitor, not everybody has access to the fastest processor and not everybody has access to a credit card. When we make everything credit card only for the longest time, I think before a Venmo and a PayPal came into the play, it was just the people that don&#8217;t have a credit card or don&#8217;t have that level of financial literacy don&#8217;t deserve to buy things. What are we saying when we don&#8217;t include that as part of the conversation around access and accessibility?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I would say one thing that is also, I think made accessibility more important is the increase of multimedia on the web.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;re recording a podcast. This podcast will have transcripts for accessibility.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
A transcript? Yes, thank you.</p>

And things like that.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;re starting to see it be more and more commonplace now that the media that we consume is not just what we read, it&#8217;s also what we hear, what we see. Even smart speakers and devices, you have to talk to them in a certain way in order to get back what you need. All of that is a factor of accessibility.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yeah, no. I think they just released a study maybe day before yesterday that Netflix was saying that the good majority of their users that have subtitles turned on are not blind or deaf.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s some shows I would watch with subtitles. I used to watch Scandal with subtitles just so I can make sure I can catch everything.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes, I keep mine on. Yeah, I know because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happening.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Another thing that it&#8217;s good for, and this is not so much accessibility, but if you&#8217;re watching foreign language programs, to have subtitles in a different language. For me, it can help with learning a bit of the language because you know what they&#8217;re trying to say and what you hear, your mind connects those things together. But even with accessibility, there&#8217;s bad captions out there.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Oh my gosh, I live for those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a whole thing.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I need to make a website that&#8217;s just bad captions. Because they&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Pop music playing enthusiastically.&#8221; And you&#8217;re like, &#8220;What, where did that caption come from?&#8221; The descriptions are great, I love it. Yeah, yeah. No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
But I&#8217;m just glad that they&#8217;re there at this point because like I said, people don&#8217;t think about those things a lot of times.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And we&#8217;re talking about now accessibility in a largely, I don&#8217;t want to say 2D context. You might see where I&#8217;m going here, but there&#8217;s been all this talk about Web3 and the metaverse, and you want to talk about inaccessibility? It&#8217;s inaccessible even for the average person because, it&#8217;s not only about what you can hear or see, but just to get it&#8230; And maybe this is a tangent of accessibility, but you have to be watching on a certain device that costs a certain amount of money and you&#8217;ve got to have a high speed internet connection. There are other barriers that I think people might not look at as accessibility that does factor into accessible web experiences.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Absolutely. I talk about it all the time. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;So let&#8217;s talk about the actual experience part of this. How am I meant to experience this when I don&#8217;t have access to any of these things?&#8221; Maybe your point is to gatekeep, I don&#8217;t know, maybe. Because that&#8217;s usually the argument that will come up too, is that like, &#8220;Oh, well those people are not my target demographic.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Run me by again, what exactly is your target demographic?&#8221; Because every demographic has someone who may or may not be disabled. So I&#8217;m not really sure why. Again, it just plays back the disposability of people with disabilities. So it&#8217;s stressful to me. I get annoyed all the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit. Let&#8217;s learn more about you, about your origin story. I can tell you&#8217;re very passionate about UX and about accessibility, but I&#8217;d like to get a sense of where that came from. So just to start off, where&#8217;d you grow up?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
So I am originally from Jamaica. I moved here when I was about maybe 14, 15. Don&#8217;t ask me about the numbers. It was a long time ago. And then moved here. And the immigrant family story, my options were either engineer, doctor, MBA. My career choices were very narrow based on that particular set of criteria, which to be fair, I gave my mom her engineering degree so I could be left alone. Right? But everyone in my family is either a physician or a NASA scientist in my cousin&#8217;s part. So we&#8217;re all pretty diverse in terms of our applications to STEAM and STEM work.</p>
<p>I was actually going to be a surgeon at one point. I was attending NYU as a bio major to do that. But I think working with my mom in terms of listening to her talk about medicine as it&#8217;s in medical practice as it functions today in the U.S. and really hearing the stories about how people with disabilities or even older people are treated in the hospital system. I was like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t sit back and not say anything about it.&#8221; So I think I got a lot of it from going to work with my mom and seeing how people were being treated within the medical space. And even being handed their prescriptions and they couldn&#8217;t read it or they had to fill out online forms and they didn&#8217;t know how. And I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever tried to fill out online form via a hospital, but it&#8217;s usually a very bad process. Nothing is readable, any of those things. Don&#8217;t even ask them about a language option for you.</p>
<p>So going through all of that and watching my mom do it and then getting into the digital space and then understanding and linking the two was probably what drove most of my passion for accessibility.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
From what it sounds like, just based on life experience, that you had this early desire to get into this, but then you also just said, I gave my mom her engineering degree. I want to talk a little bit about that. You went to undergrad, you went to the University of Mississippi and majored in electrical engineering. Did you have an interest in it or were you just like, &#8220;This is what I need to do to get my family off my back?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
No, no, no, no. I did. I really, really did. So back, oh my gosh, my mom is going to be so mad. So I dropped out of NYU, to which my mother was livid and that&#8217;s fair. But then I dropped out of NYU because the company that I worked for at the time had given me a promotion and wanted to send me out to California to train their engineers on a particular ticketing system that we were using for our IT program. And so while I was out there, I ended up switching jobs and then my job was basically what they call a client support specialist is what they called it. And I was basically a liaison between the engineering department, project management and the sales people and customers in order to get them moved into their co-location space, set up their routers, all of that extraneous good stuff.</p>
<p>This was back before when we were doing network address translations and you had to do a letter of justification in order to get IPs because they thought that the IPs were going to run out. It was a whole thing. It was pre 2000, so pre Y2K, they were very concerned about these things. So I did that. But then the Dotcom Bubble essentially burst. And so a lot of us in Silicon Valley got let go. And so I came back and I was like, &#8220;Okay mom, I&#8217;m ready.&#8221; So because of that work that I did with that ISP, I determined that I wanted to build computers because I thought that was fun. So I did electrical engineering specializing in computer engineering. So in theory, I could build you a badass circuit. So yeah, that&#8217;s how that happened.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But you had the interest in it though. That&#8217;s the important part, right?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I am of a person who I like to take things apart and tinker. I like to work with my hands. Like I said, I&#8217;m building the shelves in my office. So miter saw, table saw, planar, let&#8217;s go. And I&#8217;ve always been that person. And then I&#8217;m also an only child, my mom&#8217;s only child. So she was very much of this is broken, you need to figure out how to fix it because I have to go to work. So I was like, &#8220;Well, got to figure it out.&#8221; But I&#8217;ve always had an interest in it and it was fine. I enjoy taking things apart. I&#8217;m a very curious person by nature. So I&#8217;m always fascinated about how things work, how things are put together. And you&#8217;ll see, you see me use the phrase all the time, &#8220;Oh my God, that&#8217;s fascinating.&#8221; Because I&#8217;m generally, I am that person.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, no, I understand. I went to college and I majored in math&#8230; Well, no, let me roll that back.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes, math major.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I first majored in computer science, computer engineering because this was turn of the century, like &#8217;99, 2000. Started college in &#8217;99 and I had been already dipping my toe into web design with Tripod and Angel Fire, GeoCities, reverse engineering view source websites and stuff like that. And I thought, &#8220;Oh, if I become a computer engineer, I can design a website,&#8221; because I didn&#8217;t know. I had not heard of what a web designer was or if that was a thing. And I that first semester, I was taking courses in I think it was intro to computer programming, learning C++. And I was like, &#8220;This is not HTML. What is this? How do I make a website with this?&#8221; And I&#8217;m going to my advisor and telling him what I want to do. And my advisor, Dr. Jones, he was like, &#8220;If you want to do this internet stuff, that&#8217;s just a fad. If you want to get into that, this isn&#8217;t going to last. That&#8217;s not what we do here.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Oh no. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He&#8217;s like, &#8220;We don&#8217;t do that here.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
But I will say they are teaching you the backend part of it. So they just completely tossed you over for the front end. But they gave you the backend part.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, but again, this was-</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
You had that Java stuff too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah. And this was &#8217;99. Our lab had Sun Microsystems and SGI Machines and stuff like that. So this was still very, very early in the web/internet days. And he was like, &#8220;We don&#8217;t do that here. We&#8217;ll teach you assembly, we&#8217;ll teach you C++, but if you want to do this web design thing, you might want to change your major.&#8221; And so the next semester, I changed my major to math. And then that&#8217;s just what I ended up getting my degree in. I like math, but people are always surprised with me being a designer that I have a math degree. I would imagine people are probably surprised you as a designer have an electrical engineering degree. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;How does that work?&#8221; For me, math teaches me how to think. Yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes, that&#8217;s what I was going to say. I think for engineering, it teaches you how to identify a problem and think about the steps needed to solve the problem. So engineering for me teaches you how to think about problem solving, which as a UX designer, that is pretty much all that we do is problem solve. How do we get the checkout flow to work in such a way that they actually finish checking out? What are those steps? And if there&#8217;s an error, what happens? So going through all of those steps and iterating on that process by testing every time. It&#8217;s very much an engineering mindset, I think.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And I know with math, the thing I think that struck me at one point learning math in college was that, &#8220;Oh, there are some equations that have either no solution or infinitely many solutions.&#8221; And that blew my mind at the time because I was like, &#8220;Wait a minute, I&#8217;ve been taking algebra and trig and calc and all these things.&#8221; They resolve to something. And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, there are often going to sometimes be equations that don&#8217;t make sense, that are not going to have a solution or they&#8217;re going to have an infinite amount of solutions.&#8221; And so when I say it teaches you how to think, at least for me, it teaches me how to take something I may not know and process it and break it down. The steps of writing a mathematical proof to me are the same steps to writing a research paper, the same steps to writing a proposal for a client or a statement of work. It&#8217;s the same logical flow of take these elements, prove this thing, therefore this, all of that.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I used to love those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I look back at some-</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I was that weird kid in class who loves doing the geometric proofs. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to show you that this is a right angle. Let me break it down right quick.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I looked back at some of my old stuff. I found my thesis from, god, 20 years ago. I found my thesis recently that I wrote in college on sigma algebra and measure theoretic entropy with the existence of Lie groups. I have no idea what any of those things mean now. But I&#8217;m looking back at it and it&#8217;s just symbols and letters. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I used to really know this. I don&#8217;t know it now.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes. Listen, I stopped because with electrical engineering, especially at Ole Miss, they were like, &#8220;We can&#8217;t let you do a math minor. You&#8217;d have to double major do EE and math.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Listen, after differential equations, I&#8217;m good.&#8221; It was differential, discreet, all of that. And I think after those classes is when you start getting into the theoretical math where they just don&#8217;t use numbers at all. It&#8217;s just theory and proving that this process works.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
My last year and a half because I majored in pure math and my last year and a half, it was differential equations, it was topology. And my teachers, great teachers, but absolute sadists. They would be like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to give this test and not everybody is going to pass this test.&#8221; Or they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Well, these last two questions are only for my top students.&#8221; And there will be infinitely just wild stuff like, &#8220;What in the world? When am I ever going to use this?&#8221; I&#8217;ve never had to use anything with differential equations, ever. I love it though. The thing is, I went into math because I love it. I love to do the problems and solving and all that sort of stuff, which is a lot about what design is. It&#8217;s about solving problems, different kind of problems, but you&#8217;re still solving problems. And math teaches you those steps and ways to think and consider in a way that&#8230; I didn&#8217;t go to design school, so I don&#8217;t know, but I feel like it teaches you that logical way of thinking through something that perhaps design school may not.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yeah. Because I think for me at least, it felt like design school was more about the psychology of things. So understanding color theory and understanding that different colors make people feel a different way than other colors do. So it&#8217;s more so about how these things make you feel more so than anything else. And so it was the engineering part that taught me the problem solving and then the design part that taught me the aesthetic piece. Is that the word?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, the aesthetic piece. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
The aesthetic piece Of it, and how things make you feel.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I totally get that. Yeah. Because for example, if you put red text on a blue background, yes, that&#8217;s going to be really jarring.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I will fight you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They won&#8217;t go together. But then mathematically, I know it&#8217;s because of the frequency of the color red against the color blue causes your eyes to do this weird jump shift. It&#8217;s really tiring to read that. So I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s why it doesn&#8217;t make sense.&#8221; I&#8217;ll always be trying to think of the reason behind the feeling instead of just going with the feeling, which I don&#8217;t know, maybe if I went to design school, I&#8217;d have more of that, &#8220;Oh yes, these colors, they mesh. I get it.&#8221; As supposed to being like, &#8220;Well, this makes sense because of some other reason.&#8221; But you end up going and majoring in design after you got your degree from Ole Miss, you went to Mississippi State and you majored in graphic design. Why did you make that switch?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Well, because I wanted to be an animator. Funnily enough, I think they had not updated their website at the time. So Mississippi State was like, &#8220;Oh, we have an animation program.&#8221; Because I really wanted to do graphic design for film or design for film. And so I was like, &#8220;Oh, I can combine my problem solving with design if I become an animator and do that.&#8221; That was a thought process in my mind. I don&#8217;t know why. So on their website, they hadn&#8217;t updated it. And so I enrolled and got in and I was super excited and they were like, &#8220;Oh, we no longer have that program. All we have for you is graphic design, good luck.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Huh? Okay. Well let&#8217;s try it and we&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>
<p>But then I think at the time, maybe it was more so print focused than anything else. So I could tell you all the things about the GSM of paper. We did watercolor photography, all of those things. One of my favorite classes was 3D design. And so that&#8217;s when I spent most of my time in the wood shop. The instructor at the time, I think he was a famous furniture designer, but he was teaching us how to build things by sketching it out, thinking about from a 3D space perspective, how something would look and then we would have to build it, build it, build it. So did some sculptural work. It was great. Oh my gosh, that design program at Mississippi State, I loved it. It was great.</p>
<p>And then they also allowed me to pair with video game designers they had. And so I was doing design work for that too. So it was a good time. Even though it wasn&#8217;t necessarily an animation program, I learned a lot from the graphic design program at State. I will say that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds like a lot of fun, actually.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Oh my gosh, it was so much fun. And I&#8217;m still friends with a lot of people there. And the people that left that school went on to do amazing things. I think Tim is out here designing the graphics for Roku. Let&#8217;s see, there&#8217;s another young lady, She went on to work at Gensler as an architect. So the class is good. The classes are really, really good. And some of the students that came out of there based on the teachers that we had at the time were just amazing, amazing folks to work with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you feel like your background in engineering helped you out in any way when you were majoring in design?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes and no. It helped me figure out how to approach thinking about what I was going to do if I needed to put together a logo per se. I knew, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, this is the result that I wanted. What are the steps to get there?&#8221; So in that sense, the planning of how to do it was helpful. However, engineering is very much, I like things to be symmetrical. There&#8217;s always those projects that we had to do that were you had to make something asymmetrical. And I did not enjoy that because my brain just refused. And I think that just came from the engineering side. It was like, &#8220;No, it has to either be in order or it has to be on a scale of some sort that I can understand like 2, 4, 6, 8,&#8221; that type of thing. I can&#8217;t have you jumping around all over the place in the design. It makes my brain not work well.</p>
<p>So it does both. And more so now with the digital side of things. Like I said, it mainly applies to the problem solving part of it where I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, okay, if we want to get this result. How do we apply that concept in a way that scales on a DS?&#8221; And I can do that through my engineering thinking, coupled with my design thinking.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So once you graduated from Mississippi State, you&#8217;ve got your design degree, you&#8217;ve got your engineering degree. Did you go right into UX design after that?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
No. I actually got a job at a church. It was one of those big churches, biggest churches in Austin, Texas. And I basically was doing everything. So I was doing all of their print work, so designed magazines, all of their photography. So I was a photographer. And then I was also responsible for building and maintaining their website. So it was a full on, you&#8217;re the only person here, you have to do everything type of moment. And I learned a lot from that job for sure. Yeah, printmaking and printing things is no joke. Web work is no joke. Because I think at the time they only had access to, what is it, WordPress? So that was the medium that I was working with. And WordPress has its own caveats. So putting all of that together and making sure everything got out on time every Sunday, I learned a lot. I learned a lot.</p>
<p>What I remember the most is we had to print magazines because the rector at the time wanted us to put out a monthly magazine where we interviewed various people from the church. We had to take pictures of everything and there was whole thing. So I was like a Vogue Magazine editor with the big old board where you put things up and your articles are there, and you pick what pictures and you basically art direct that whole entire process. But then after that was done, assembling them in this giant InDesign file and then sending that to the printer because we had a dedicated printer room. And figuring out how the printer worked, troubleshooting all of that, and then actually printing it, trimming the edges, cutting it, mailing it. I actually ended up sleeping at the office doing a magazine run. It was a good time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was a good time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You were truly a webmaster.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Doing all of that. I especially tip my hat to you about the magazine thing. The last gig that I worked at, we put together a quarterly magazine and that was a lot just to try to get it out the door, hopefully every three months. I can&#8217;t imagine every month. How big was the magazine?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
It wasn&#8217;t very big. It was a very&#8230; I want to say how many sheets as I&#8217;m looking through my paper. Maybe like 24, 32.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. That&#8217;s still a lot though-</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
So it wasn&#8217;t too bad.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
To try to pull together every month.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Listen, my main thing was because people would submit photos and the photos that they would submit, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;This cannot be printed. It&#8217;s entirely too small.&#8221; So then I&#8217;d have to schedule a photo shoot and run out there and retake all the photos and then run back. But the church had money, so we did what we had to do. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
It was a good time. Like I said, I learned a lot because it was literally only me. So I was responsible for all of it. From the rooter to the tooter, as they say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
As they say.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yeah, as they say, the rooter to the tooter. And so it was just picking the font, understanding how the typography was going to be laid out in an enticing way on the cover page. Figuring out how the table of content should be displayed, what was the concept and theme for the magazine. And then making sure that we got all the articles and everybody returned their corrections on time. And then making sure that we had the correct paper in stock and making sure that the printer didn&#8217;t jam. And then after all of that, running it through the cycle of getting it mailed out to the individual households that were part of the membership was a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That alone is a job. The fact that you were doing that on top of web stuff, on top of graphic stuff. My hat goes off to you because I&#8217;ve had those positions before where you&#8217;re doing all the things because you&#8217;re the only person that can do all the things.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yeah. It makes you indispensable to a point, but you get serious burnout after a while because it was one thing after another. And I think a few minutes later or a few months after the choir director left and the choir director was responsible for printing the Sunday brochures. So after he left, guess who was responsible for printing the Sunday brochures?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That was you.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Mm-hmm, yep. I was at that job all the time, actually slept there. And one would not think that of like, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re just a graphic designer at a church.&#8221; No, no friend.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
No, no friend.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve done church work before. Because sometimes what will happen, and I don&#8217;t know if this happened maybe in your case, but sometimes what will happen is that your obligation to your job ends up getting wrapped up in some level of religiosity where it&#8217;s not just the work that you&#8217;re doing for the church, but you&#8217;re doing the work for God.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
None of that, fortunately that was not. They were very nice. I want to say the church was Episcopalian. And I just was like, &#8220;Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm. This is great. I&#8217;m very happy for everyone involved. Yes, exactly that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel like maybe if it had been, for lack of a better word, a Black church, that might have changed. Because I feel like there&#8217;s a level of guilt, I find.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Guilt? Yeah, that&#8217;s what I was going to say.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I know, I&#8217;m trying. How do I say this nicely? But there&#8217;s a level of guilt that only Black churches because-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hear you.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Because they&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Oh well, your grand mama Marlene.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh no. So now I have to do this flyer.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I empathize with that a 100%. Oh my God. Okay, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Especially if your parents or family members or members of the church too. It&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Yeah, no, I&#8217;m absolutely going to just have to make this flyer and make Miss Martha look good.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So after your work at the church is when you got more into, I would say digital design. You worked as a product designer and then a UX designer, which is what you&#8217;re doing now. Was it a big shift to go from doing all the things at the church to now just focusing on product or focusing on UX?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Honestly, no. And I think that&#8217;s because the church in its way of making me do everything, prepared me for the slightly, and I do mean slightly, slightly less work of being a product or UX designer because I&#8217;m only focused on one thing at that point. I&#8217;m not focused on doing everything. So it was a breath of fresh air because I was like, &#8220;Oh, okay, I can just focus on the digital. I don&#8217;t have to worry about the magazine and whatever and whatever, whatever. I can just do the digital.&#8221; And then it also helped that I worked for a luxury travel agency. So I was just staring at beautiful pictures of hotels all day long and being like, &#8220;I will go there some day. Absolutely.&#8221; But yeah, no, it wasn&#8217;t too bad at all.</p>
<p>I think a lot of my experience with my work in print actually helped with my work at digital because they actually also did print magazines, but I was responsible for the digital version of it. So since I already knew how to do all of that work from the church, it was like, &#8220;Oh no, no, this is good. This is great. I can do this.&#8221; And I think the engineering team had already set up a pretty decent templating system. So at that point it was basically just making sure that all of the digital stuff was set up in a way that I could just very quickly upload it to the web what I needed it to, whenever they needed to release a digital article. And on my side, it wasn&#8217;t a set thing. So we only had released maybe one or two articles a week. And so it was just basically sourcing photos and making sure that all of the digital stuff was set up on there.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until they decided to end the print half or move the print half and mainly focus on digital in terms of booking flights and booking hotels. Then that&#8217;s when it was like, &#8220;Okay, so now we&#8217;ve shifted to the user experience side of things.&#8221; Because before, it was a lot of really just allowing consumers to just read articles based on our recommendations for things. And so it was very narrow in that sense. And then when it came time to book things, then it became, &#8220;Okay, so how does our booking thing work? How does search work? What is the experience if someone were to try to book a flight?&#8221; Is it that it goes to the travel agent or can they book directly? And what did the steps look like for that?</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s where it shifted is that that last piece of the UX of completing a full entire process to get that booked result versus I&#8217;m just serving you up an article on the best restaurant in LA type of thing. Does that make sense?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, that makes sense. And I think for people that are listening, I feel like at least nowadays, UX and product tend to get conflated in a way. There may be subbed out one thing for another. So I&#8217;m glad that you were pointing out what the differences are between those two.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
They do both carry an aspect of user experience in the very basic sense of how is a user meant to experience reading an article on restaurants versus how is a user meant to experience a checkout flow for booking a flight? So they do share that in that regard. You could use them interchangeably, I don&#8217;t think anybody would be mad. However, I do have friends who are product designers and I think they call them industrial designers now. I remember they&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m applying for a position for a product designer.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Ooh, that&#8217;s not what you think it is, friend.&#8221; So it also depends on what the company defines a product designer or a UX designer as well in the job description. And so a lot of my industrial designer friends were like, &#8220;This is lame, we&#8217;re the product designers, not you guys.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
So, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What gives you purpose to keep doing the work that you do?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
So I follow several people on Twitter who are in the disability activism space. And while I don&#8217;t comment per se, them sharing their experiences fuels me to make the web better. The internet is not going anywhere as far as I know. I would love it if they made it a utility, but I digress. And so I want everyone to have an equitable experience on the web. I want for, or I would like to be able to help that further along, whether it&#8217;s being passionate about making sure that there&#8217;s a contrast and the code is right and whatever.</p>
<p>But I want the web to be as equitable as possible. Because a lot of times when folks don&#8217;t have access to these things, people&#8217;s lives are in danger. No one talks about that side of it. But if all of a sudden you&#8217;re saying access to government grants and access to COVID vaccinations can only be achieved by going to a website, how many people are you cutting out with that one decision alone? Especially if the web is not accessible enough to accommodate everybody. And so following these women and their work in that space really fuels me to make sure that I champion it on my end as best as I can.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you work to stay your authentic self throughout your career? certainly I think when people hear this interview, they get that you&#8217;ve got a bubbly personality and working in tech and then working in design and working in tech in news. I would imagine you encounter a lot of different types of folks, we&#8217;ll just put it that way. But how have you worked to stay your authentic self?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Antionette told me to, I think you&#8217;ve interviewed Antionette Carroll?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, I&#8217;ve had her on the show. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes. Yes, yes, yes. So she used to come hang out at the house whenever she would come in for South by Southwest and we would have these long conversations about the work that she was doing in design equity. And she&#8217;s amazing and she&#8217;s also another inspiration. But Antionette was like, &#8220;Listen, you have to be authentic in your work all the time. You just have to be.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Okay, yes ma&#8217;am.&#8221; I just did what she said. I trust her and she&#8217;s an amazing human. And I do find that it is helpful because people then know what they&#8217;re getting from you. And I do tell people in front. I remember teasing my poor boss. I was like, &#8220;Are you sure you want to hire me? Because you were getting this mouth along with the hire, so I need you to be okay with that.&#8221; And he was like, &#8220;No, no, it&#8217;s fine. Please, by all means, bring your authentic self to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so I appreciate that about my bosses at my company. They&#8217;re very much supportive of that. And I have not run into a situation, because sometimes they&#8217;ll say that and they don&#8217;t mean that. But I have not run into that thus far here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m very grateful for that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Very grateful for that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
#AntionetteTaughtMe.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Listen, that could be a series in and of itself. My goodness, I miss her so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is the best piece of advice that you would give to somebody that wants to follow in your footsteps? They&#8217;ve heard your story, they want to be like you, they want to be where you&#8217;re at, at that level. What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Stay curious. Be curious about everything. How everything works, how people feel about things. Be observant. Watch people, watch how things function. You would be surprised what you can learn just by looking at a thing and being like, &#8220;So what was that meant for?&#8221; We always used to joke that there&#8217;s these products out there that the designers built them for one way and then the users use them in a completely different way and you&#8217;re just like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not what that was meant for.&#8221; But even that is some semblance of feedback. So just observing and being curious and watching and learning. Stay learning. Stay curious and stay learning. Never stop learning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
To that end, where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I feel like at the moment, my big thing is I&#8217;m planning on having my mom come live with me. So learning more about accessibility in terms of interior design and home design and making sure that everything is set up for her to live comfortably if she chooses to come live with me. So just furthering my experience in accessibility, but just applying it to different things and seeing what that looks like. And then whatever I learned, share it with everybody who asks or didn&#8217;t ask. Y&#8217;all gon&#8217; get this accessibility on today, as I say, often.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I tend to keep a low profile, but I am on LinkedIn. You can find me there. I am on Instagram, but I don&#8217;t post often. I am a lurker, as it were, one of those things. Those are my two spots that I&#8217;m usually-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s the Instagram name?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Elemango.design. It&#8217;s from an old graphic design project that I did for my senior year at university.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
But yeah, elemango.design. Elephants and mangoes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I thought that what it might be.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
My two favorite things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounded like that&#8217;s what it might be elephants and mangoes.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Elephants and mangoes. My two favorite things. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Awesome. Well, Tiffany Stewart, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Thank you for sharing your story. It sounds like you&#8217;re someone that is just passionately curious about a lot of things and you had the opportunity to be able to really go into a lot of places with your career. Engineering degree, then doing design and then doing all these other things. It sounds like you&#8217;re someone that is always trying to keep on the pulse of what&#8217;s next. And I think of course, with accessibility being such an important topic to our world right now, I feel like we&#8217;ll be hearing and seeing a lot more from you in the future. So thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Thank you. So lovely to do this. This is a lot of fun. So yeah, no, I appreciate it very much. Thank you.</p>

<p>We all know there are several ways to achieve success as a creative, but sometimes it takes inspiration from others to set you on the right path. That&#8217;s definitely the case with the multitalented TTK. His work as an art director, painter, designer and illustrator have taken him far, and now he can add another title to his roster &#8212; filmmaker!</p>
<p>Our conversation began with a quick year-end check-in, and then TTK talked about <a href="https://www.justlikeme-havas.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">&#8220;Just Like Me&#8221;</a>, a short documentary he created with Havas to educate and inspire the next generation of Black creatives. TTK also shared more details of his life story, including growing up in Florida, serving in the Navy for 10 years after going to art school, and more. Hopefully TTK&#8217;s story and documentary can help inspire you to rise to greater heights!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
My name is TTK. What I do, I&#8217;m an artist, I&#8217;m a designer. Currently, I work in advertising. I&#8217;m a director, I&#8217;m a painter. I wear a few hats.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has the year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
The year&#8217;s been good for me so far, man, the year&#8217;s been very, very good. How I measure if the year is doing good, I measure if I&#8217;m doing something this year that I didn&#8217;t do the previous year or if I accomplished something this year that I didn&#8217;t in the previous year, that determines for me whether it&#8217;s good or not. We&#8217;re going into the fourth quarter right now, so the accomplishments and what I&#8217;ve accomplished so far in this year, I&#8217;m really proud of myself. I took a few punches, but that&#8217;s life right there. I hop back up and take it on the chin and take it as a lesson learned. But all in all, this year&#8217;s good for me. It&#8217;s been going great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything in particular that you still want to try to do before the year ends?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Paint more. A friend of mine jokes and it says once I learned how to do digital work, it made me lazy with painting. And I don&#8217;t want to admit it, but he is right because painting is a process. Well, everything is a process, but whenever you&#8217;re painting, you got to wait for the paint to dry, come back to it and work into it some more, then work into it some more. It takes much longer.</p>
<p>And you would think with me being traditionally trained before I even learn how to do anything in Photoshop or any software, I was doing this first years before I knew how to use any software. You would think I would be conditioned for it. But learning how to work in digital just made me just work faster and have less patience maybe because working in the industry, working the agency, working the companies, I&#8217;m on a timeline where I got to turn this stuff around fast. It can be very competitive, whereas with painting, this can take&#8230; Because I&#8217;m so meticulous with the details and everything when I&#8217;m painting, it can take anywhere from weeks to a month. Depends on how much time. Well, I try not to take breaks in between, but I wind up doing that. Anyway.</p>
<p>All that to say I just want to paint more, knock out more pieces. Because I got a solo show coming out in 2023, a solo art show. It&#8217;s the first solo show that I&#8217;ve done in, oh my god, probably 12 or 13 years with all original pieces, so I&#8217;m on the clock right now. It&#8217;s next year in the spring, but time catches up real quick so I got to start really cranking out pieces. Teah, all that to say I want to paint more.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I find when visual creators, particularly when they get further along in their career, they often want to go back to some sort of physical, tangible way of creating. Like you said, doing it digitally does make you faster, but there&#8217;s a craft in the visual art that gets lost I think sometimes when you&#8217;re relying too much on digital tools.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. People will ask me, &#8220;Can I get this? Can I commission you for this piece?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Truthfully, it&#8217;ll be probably easier for you on your budget to commission me to do something digitally.&#8221; Because paintings, it takes a while. Well, for me it takes a while because there&#8217;s a certain level of quality that I want to put out. And there&#8217;s no command Z to go back when I make a mistake or it doesn&#8217;t come out the way I want it to look. I got to wait for it to dry and then I got to go back and rework it, or I&#8217;m mixing these colors, and the tubes of paint ain&#8217;t cheap. You know what I&#8217;m saying? You can buy the cheap stuff, but you going to get cheap results. It really adds up. But all in all, this is always my first love right here. And I always go back to that.</p>
<p>I was just working on this piece that I&#8217;m currently working on. I&#8217;ve been working on it about two months now. I just think working in it, I forget about how I used to feel painting before I was doing anything digitally. How I would just put a album on, put a CD on, put a record on, just rock out for hours on. And I miss that feeling of seclusion and just painting.</p>
<p>I was watching something, one of those shows that come on Sunday, one of the Sunday weekly news shows or whatever, but they were talking about&#8230; This is a few months back. They were talking about George Bush, how he put out a book, maybe it was last year. It was a book about people across the nation or people in this community or something like that. But it was his paintings and these people. And it was like, we don&#8217;t really rock with George Bush. You know what I&#8217;m saying? We don&#8217;t rock with George Bush, but his paintings weren&#8217;t bad. You know what I&#8217;m saying? Man, this dude actually isn&#8217;t that bad. He was on his ranch just painting or whatever and everything. I was like, I never would&#8217;ve guessed that from this guy. But I&#8217;m like, man, I would love that life just to be in a loft somewhere just, I don&#8217;t know, in the middle of nowhere, just painting. I don&#8217;t know, man. One day, one day. I&#8217;m going to speak into existence.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think you&#8217;ll get there. You&#8217;ll get there, absolutely. Let&#8217;s talk about your day job, what you do. You&#8217;re a senior art director at Havas, which is ad and PR company. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah, so I&#8217;ve been at Havas for about three years now. It&#8217;s been good, you know what I&#8217;m saying? A lot of opportunities have come from me being there. What I do, I work on clients. The main client that I&#8217;ve worked on since I&#8217;ve been there is Michelin and doing stuff for Michelin social. And I got a chance to kind of be&#8230; Not kind of be, I got a chance to be very creative with their brand. I worked on stuff for Mike&#8217;s Hard Lemonade, worked on a few other projects, but&#8230; My mind is blank right now, but Michelin is probably the main one that comes to mind because I&#8217;ve been on the brand pretty much 80% of the time I&#8217;ve been there.</p>
<p>One thing I can say about working on stuff for Michelin is that I&#8217;m blessed it. Everything I touch, I&#8217;ve been able to add my own personal touch or flare to it that they probably wouldn&#8217;t have done, whereas I push the limits where I can bring my personality and my style of creativity to a brand like that that has so much rich history and it&#8217;s been doing something a certain way for so long. But I&#8217;ve been able to bring my look and feel to it and explain to them why this works. And they&#8217;ve been open and they&#8217;ve been receptive to it. Sometimes we get pushback, of course, that&#8217;s just how it goes. But for the most part, I think with me working on the brand for so long, I know the do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts and know where I can push it and where I can&#8217;t. But the areas where I can push it, I really try to flex and really do something where if someone&#8217;s scrolling, if they&#8217;re scrolling on their phone or whatever and they see this graphic like, &#8220;Oh, this is pretty dope right here,&#8221; it would make me as a consumer want to check out more about this product right here. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now, you started there in October of 2019, which it feels like&#8230; With this pandemic, that feels like a lifetime ago. But how did the pandemic change up how you work?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny you say that because I was doing&#8230; Right now I worked out of the Chicago office. And prior to me working out of the Chicago office, I was in New York, I was in Brooklyn. I was doing freelance work for them, and then they gave me a full-time&#8230; offered me a full-time role. And I was like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m already doing freelance for you guys out here and I&#8217;m delivering what you&#8217;re asking me for. Can I just stay out here in New York?&#8221; It was like, &#8220;Yeah, we want to have you in the office.&#8221;</p>
<p>I move cross country, and then a couple months later everybody&#8217;s working from home. You know what I&#8217;m saying? My partner, Chevon, she was working remote as well at the time for a nonprofit, and she had been telling me, yo, everybody in her nonprofit is all over the country. You know what I&#8217;m saying? Working. You&#8217;re doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Working from home thing, it definitely&#8230; I always say as messed up as the pandemic has been and COVID and all of that, it was a big reset to show some of these jobs that we do the way we do them is outdated. And this is just my opinion. And going into office every day, five days a week, sometimes six, and sitting there for eight, 10 hours just to say that you&#8217;re here, we can do the work everywhere. You look at people on&#8230; What&#8217;s the site? Fiverr. You know what I&#8217;m saying? You don&#8217;t know where these people are at, but they&#8217;re still delivering stuff for you or whatever. And that&#8217;s what this pandemic showed. In my opinion, what it showed is thankfully the type of work that we do, the digital creative stuff, we can do it from anywhere. It definitely opened up my eyes and everything because I feel like I was&#8230; Like a lot of us, we were programmed to just come and to go into the office, just sit there and just look watching the clock waiting for 5:30, 6:30 to come, paying $15 for lunch every day, all of that right there.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind working remotely at all, man. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I don&#8217;t mind it, truthfully. I know me personally, I can be extrovert, I can be reclusive as well. When I&#8217;m creating, sometimes I just like to be alone. We can collaborate, but I like to be alone. I&#8217;m able to execute the way I really want to execute and execute my best way sometimes when I&#8217;m alone. I don&#8217;t mind working remote. I actually love it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s a typical day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I juggle a few things, man. It depends on the workload sometimes, man. A lot of times, like when I was working heavy on Michelin, when we had a lot of deliverables for the brand, it would be coming up with all these different creative pillars of ways to how the brand incorporates into travel or how they incorporate with food, how they incorporate it in their heritage, coming up with creative ways to display this stuff right here, like getting things ready for a client meeting.</p>
<p>Basically, the day starts, we get briefed on what&#8217;s due, what everyone&#8217;s working on. And that&#8217;s pretty much it, thankfully for me. I&#8217;m in a space where I can just do what I need to do and no one really bothers me, I guess because maybe they know that&#8217;s how I operate best. That&#8217;s pretty much my work day.</p>
<p>As far as doing side projects or painting&#8230; Well, the paintings more so of recent things. I take breaks in between that. But sometimes I might work on little side project here, do little brush strokes on the painting for maybe about, I don&#8217;t know, 15 minutes, come back to it a couple hours later. My day is basically just me being creative. I&#8217;m thankful to say that. I enjoy what I do, and I have fun doing what I do. And it&#8217;s how I envision my life. No stress. I&#8217;m not working in the cold. I&#8217;ve been there before. I&#8217;ve done a lot of things, man.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thankful that right now every day when I wake up, no two days are the same, but every day when I wake up, man, I can honestly say I&#8217;m not stressed about what I&#8217;m doing. And I&#8217;m doing what I love to do. It may not be the exact project that I want to work on, but at least I can say that my day consists of me being creative. And I&#8217;m getting paid to be creative. You know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. No, that&#8217;s a good thing. I think especially agencies tend to get the reputation&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if they get the best reputation, I&#8217;ll put it that way, sometimes because you&#8217;re often working from client to client so you don&#8217;t have a lot of time to spend with maybe a particular brand to do something before you&#8217;re put on another project or put on another campaign or something like that. But it sounds like with what you&#8217;re doing, especially because you mentioned earlier you&#8217;ve been on the Michelin brand for so long, you&#8217;ve had time to grow into it in a way.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
It&#8217;s cool because I&#8217;ve had access to all of their assets and their personal login site where it&#8217;s so many assets, so much history. And that&#8217;s a cool thing about working on a brand like this right here that&#8217;s been around for over 100 years; there&#8217;s so much that you can pull from. A.And not to sound cliche, but a lot of times with working on this brand, you don&#8217;t have to reinvent the wheel. Everything is there already, you just got to figure out how to repurpose it. I&#8217;ve worked on&#8230; What&#8217;s the faucet brand MOEN. I worked on MOEN briefly. I worked on Yellowstone National Park.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I said it before, but Mike&#8217;s Hard Lemonade. That was cool working on that. This was pre-pandemic. We had a cool, very, very dope idea and campaign for Mike&#8217;s Hard Lemonade, but didn&#8217;t see the light of day because the pandemic happened at the time. The pandemic happened and everything shut down so we had to redirect the direction of where we wanted to go. And it was a much, much, much more scaled down version of&#8230; It wasn&#8217;t even scaled down, it was a whole new direction. Everything that we created, the hours that we spent, no one really will ever see this out into the world. But that&#8217;s the nature of the game, you take it how it comes, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, you&#8217;ve worked before as a graphic designer, and we&#8217;ll talk about that a little later, and now you&#8217;re an art director at an agency. How would you describe the difference in those two?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t think there is any difference, man. Personally, I don&#8217;t. Maybe on paper where it says what the roles are, what the responsibilities are. On paper, it probably says certain things, but from my personal experience, I was doing the same thing coming up with ideas, coming up with ideas, coming up with ways to execute this thing, thinking of ways where we can&#8230; places where we can place these ideas so people can see it and engage with it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s similar to what I&#8217;m doing now. I worked in music, working at Mass Appeal. I worked on the record label side of the house. And sometimes I would work on the agency side as well. But it is the same thing, just one&#8217;s more culturally hip hop based, the other one&#8217;s more very American and reaches a broader audience and selling products.</p>
<p>But selling music is like selling products as well, man, so it&#8217;s the same thing. The way I see it, I think the only thing probably change is the company that you&#8217;re getting to check from. I always joke and I say this to people, and not to sound like a Debbie Downer or nothing like that, but you pick your poison. What are you able to accept and what are you able to deal with and whatever role or company or agency that you&#8217;re with? But I don&#8217;t find it any different at all.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is that the most challenging part about what you do? What you just mentioned?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I think the most challenging part about this right here, that working in design and advertising, from my experience, it&#8217;s a revolving door. I don&#8217;t know too many people that&#8217;s been in one spot for over five years. I just don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Early on, it was shocking. Not necessarily shocking to me, but it affected me emotionally. Damn, am I good enough? Or what could I have done differently? But then I understand it&#8217;s never personal, it&#8217;s business. And sometime business is up, sometime business is down. And when business is down, you might get cut. And that&#8217;s just the nature of the game.</p>
<p>And I think that&#8217;s where it just comes in. In trying to figure out too what do you love? You know, could work on one thing where the money is great, but you don&#8217;t really care about the work that you&#8217;re putting out. You&#8217;re not really in love with the brand or product or whatever that you&#8217;re working on. And then it could be something where you&#8217;re all about the mission that this one company or agency has, or you love what you&#8217;re working on but the pay isn&#8217;t the greatest. It&#8217;s all about trying, well, for me, trying to find that middle, that medium where, okay, I can get the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>But in all, back to what I was saying it&#8217;s a revolving door from, just from my experience, and a lot of my peers, not too many people I know stick around for a long time. And I don&#8217;t know whether it is because us being creative, you want to do your own thing eventually, or&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t want to make it a race thing or whatever, but it goes back to how do we see ourself? Well, for me personally, how do I see myself in a place where there aren&#8217;t many of people that look like me, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
And cannot coexist and naturally be myself in these spaces, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Do you think it might just be burnout or something?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s a few things. I feel like with junior people, when they don&#8217;t have the support or support from senior leadership, you got somebody might be fresh out of college and they got all these dreams of, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to do this. I&#8217;m going to do this award-winning stuff.&#8221; Of course everybody&#8217;s got those thoughts in their heads or whatever. But I feel like you take someone junior and you put them in a position and you don&#8217;t give them the support that they need to grow, it can be discouraging. And people will, &#8220;Yo, this ain&#8217;t for me right here.&#8221; You know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Or resourcing or whoever, they may not know a person&#8217;s&#8230; What&#8217;s their skillset? What&#8217;s that person&#8217;s strength? And the only thing they see is the person&#8217;s name and a title. And then, &#8220;Okay, well let&#8217;s put this person on this right here.&#8221; They might not even be the person that&#8217;s equipped for that. It&#8217;s like playing basketball; you can&#8217;t have the center playing the point guard position. You know what I&#8217;m saying? It don&#8217;t work out like that. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Well, you could, but you&#8217;re not going to get the optimum results.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit and talk more about you, talk about your personal life. Tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I&#8217;m originally from Jacksonville, Florida. That&#8217;s where I&#8217;m originally from. That&#8217;s where my early years were based out of. I moved away years ago, years ago. But I went to high school down there. And I was thankful to be in an art program going to an art school, Douglas Henderson School of the Arts, which at the time when I was going there, it was prestigious art school and everything.</p>
<p>But my father, when he went there, my father went there back in the &#8217;50s or the &#8217;60s or something like that. And at the time when he was going to that school, I think it was a school for Black students. You know what I&#8217;m saying? This is when segregation and all that stuff was going on. He went to that school decades before me. I just think it&#8217;s ironic that I ended up going there, but it&#8217;s a whole little different school at the time when I went.</p>
<p>But yeah, I got introduced to the arts there. Well, what&#8217;s the old TV show from back in the day? Fame?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Fame. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
It was like that, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Yeah, so it was a school like that and everything, man. Shortly after I graduated high school, a couple years went by, I tried to dabble in fashion for a little bit, but I couldn&#8217;t so I realized there wasn&#8217;t for me. I could design the stuff, but I couldn&#8217;t sew. And then going to college for&#8230; I went to Artist Studio Ft. Lauderdale only for one semester. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, I can&#8217;t sew then.&#8221; But it was cool though, it was cool though. I&#8217;m like, it&#8217;s more than just drawing, illustrations and everything.</p>
<p>Some years went by in between me having a child. After graduating high school, I just joined a Navy. I joined a navy cold turkey one day. I went to a recruiter and I was like, &#8220;Yo, I need a job.&#8221; You know what I&#8217;m saying? I need a job I can&#8217;t get fired from, maybe because the jobs I had at the time, life put me on a path where I wasn&#8217;t doing what I really wanted to do creatively, creatively, I was just working jobs. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Damn, this ain&#8217;t it right here, this really ain&#8217;t it.&#8221; I&#8217;m 21, 22 trying to figure life out. I went to a recruiter one day and I was like, &#8220;Yo, let me just hear what you got to say.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t even think I was going to sign up, but they hustled me like a car salesman, like a used car salesman.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Of course.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And at the time, they told me, &#8220;Yeah, you can get a sign on bonus for $7,000.&#8221; At the time when they told me that, $7,000, I had never seen $7,000 before. When they said $7,000, I&#8217;m seeing a million dollars in my head. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I was like, &#8220;Yo, yeah, let&#8217;s do it.&#8221; I joined the Navy in September 2001.</p>
<p>Yo, it&#8217;s crazy. I went to a recruiter station on a Friday. September 11th happened that Tuesday. Two weeks later, I was in bootcamp. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I was in bootcamp. Yeah. And I was in the Navy for 10 years. I&#8217;m a ex sub mariner. I was on submarines. There&#8217;s not many brothers on subs. At the time when I was on in the early 2000 and everything. And with me being in the Navy and being mostly in the north or whatever, the bulk of the time I was in the Navy, I started planting my roots in New York and in Brooklyn. A lot of people think I&#8217;m originally from Brooklyn, you know what I&#8217;m saying? That&#8217;s my second home. But I&#8217;m originally from Florida, from Jacksonville, man. I got roots down there as well. We&#8217;re all over the place right now. What else you want to know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m just curious about this 10 years in the Navy. First of all, my dad&#8217;s a Navy man, so I understand what that&#8217;s about. But the whole time that you&#8217;re doing this, were you also still pursuing creative things during this time?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yes. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Or how did that happen?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
No. Mind you, at the time in my early 20s, man. I look back on it now, I was a kid doing adult shit, you know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I was trying to figure it out, man. And I was a parent as well, you know what I&#8217;m saying? I was a parent trying to take care of a kid. I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t really know myself just yet. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
But I just know I need to provide some kind of way. And so the first couple of years of just me being in, it was just me just trying to figure out this thing, figure out this system, figure out what I got to do to not get in trouble and still keep some funds in my bank account and still perform and learn all the things that I need to learn, man.</p>
<p>Like I said, I was on submarines, and that&#8217;s&#8230; Aw man, that&#8217;s a whole nother world within itself and so much stuff that we have to know, from physics to&#8230; It&#8217;s so many things that I had to remember, being around top secret stuff, having a security clearance, working around nuclear weapons and things like that, man. It was a lot.</p>
<p>I was always doing drawing or whatever the whole time during those early years, drawing little tattoos for people and stuff like that. But it wasn&#8217;t until probably around 2004, the end of 2004, the sub that I was on, we left Norfolk, Virginia and we went up to Kittery, Maine. Kittery, Maine is on the border of New Hampshire, so Maine/New Hampshire. It wasn&#8217;t until I got up there that I wasn&#8217;t going out to sea, I&#8217;m just going to work for a couple of hours every day then going back to my barracks room. That gave me time to really do my art the way I really wanted to do it because I hadn&#8217;t done any art for so many years outside of high school. And by this time, I&#8217;m out of school for maybe seven years now, so I wasn&#8217;t really doing anything besides maybe sketching in my sketchbook. Seven years of not producing any work, it was really eating away at me. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I&#8217;m like, I know it&#8217;s more to life than this right here, there&#8217;s more to life right here. People tell you like, &#8220;Oh man, you do your 20 years, you&#8217;re going to get your retirement or whatever, and you still get out. You be young, you still be able to pursue other things.&#8221; But I knew deep down inside that that wasn&#8217;t me, that wasn&#8217;t for me.</p>
<p>But going back to, like I was saying, in 2004, a good friend of mine, he was from the Bronx. And around this time in early 2000, he was like, &#8220;Yo.&#8221; He knew that I like sneakers a lot. This is the early days before everybody&#8230; The sneaker app and all this other stuff like that. I was always one of those guys that had mad sneakers, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Before everybody knew me for my clothes and my sneakers and stuff, and he knew I could draw as well. A good friend of mine at the time, he was like&#8230; I guess he had went home for the weekend. He was from the Bronx. He went home for the weekend one time or something. He comes back, he was like, &#8220;I see these dudes customizing sneakers and everything. Why don&#8217;t you start doing that?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; I&#8217;ve always thought about it, but I never really tried to pursue it.</p>
<p>And I started searching on lunch, trying to figure out what paints and stuff I need to get. And once I figured out the right paints and everything, I think that&#8217;s when it really, really took off, where it really began for me as being an artist and putting my work out into the world through sneakers. This is the early days too. This is around &#8217;05, &#8217;06, going a little forward, the MySpace days, me just putting my stuff upon MySpace at the time and people checking for it. And it was like I was running a business out of my barracks room up in Maine. Nobody knew who I was, you know what I&#8217;m saying? No one knew who I was, they just knew the name TTK. That was my tag that I went by. My real name is Michael Harris. It&#8217;s a very generic name. There&#8217;s always another Michael Harris everywhere I go, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I was like, I got to do something that makes me stand down or whatever, so TTK. I was always into graffiti and stuff, man, so TTK was the initials that I like to tag. And I just like just it looks, the two T&#8217;s together and the K from a design point, I just like the way it looks.</p>
<p>Yeah, so everybody just knew, &#8220;Yo, this guy named TTK is customizing sneakers.&#8221; And this is the early days so there wasn&#8217;t a lot of people doing it how it is now almost 20 years later. That really opened my eyes. While I&#8217;m doing what I love to do and I&#8217;m getting paid to do what I want to do, this is what I want to do right here. I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s going to be customizing sneakers or working for Nike or whoever one day, but I&#8217;m being creative and I&#8217;m getting paid to be creative. This Navy thing, this right here is going to be my way out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was just asking were you still doing design and stuff or interested in design this whole time while you were in the Navy? And it sounds like you turned it into a profitable side business almost.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah. That led to me doing a bunch of other things. I went to high school for visual arts, traditional means in the &#8217;90s, man, like painting and things like that. I knew I wanted to paint, but I knew I couldn&#8217;t carry a big canvas with me everywhere. And I know not everybody has an appreciation for, I don&#8217;t know, fine art or the graphic design. Even though graphic design is isn&#8217;t everything that we see and interact with, most people don&#8217;t even realize that. But I was like, &#8220;Wow, how can I get my skillset, show what I want to bring out to the world and how people buy it?&#8221; Put them on sneakers. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p>The first year of me customizing sneakers, I wind up being featured in a book, I can&#8217;t even think of the name of it right now, but it was a book about custom sneakers or sneaker art from the early 2000s. But I was featured in this book. I wind up winning some contest with Finish Line at the time. I wind up having my two solo art shows at the time, and I wind up doing some freelance work for Timberland, the brand. And this is within the first year of me doing this. And I was like, &#8220;Wow, you know what? I got something right here. I&#8217;m onto something.&#8221; You know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
And what I was doing then, it&#8217;s very&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, I call it maybe it&#8217;s&#8230; It wasn&#8217;t on the skill level that I&#8217;m at right now, but I saw, you know what? I got something right here. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I got something right here.</p>
<p>And then shortly after that, I wind up meeting a good friend of mine who&#8217;s like a brother to me, Justice Hall. He was a designer at Timberland at the time. Because Timberland&#8217;s headquarters is in New Hampshire. I forget the town that it&#8217;s in in New Hampshire. But Justice saw my work on display at this skateboard shop. He saw my custom sneakers. And when Justice saw my work, he reached out to me. And he didn&#8217;t know who I was, he just saw the name TTK and he saw the work that I was doing. And it was like, &#8220;Yo, this person&#8217;s dope. I need to find them.&#8221; And he found me and we connected.</p>
<p>And he calls me up. It&#8217;s funny, I tell this story all the time. But when Justice, he got my information from the guys at the skateboard shop in New Hampshire. And they didn&#8217;t tell him who I was or anything like that. He was like, &#8220;Yo, this is this guy, this is TTK. Call him up, man. He&#8217;s dope.&#8221; When Justice calls me up and I answer the phone, I said, &#8220;Hello,&#8221; the first thing he says is, &#8220;Oh shit, you&#8217;re Black.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;What you thought I was?&#8217; I was thinking the same thing too because when they said designer, I didn&#8217;t think it was going to be another brother, someone the same age as me. You know what I&#8217;m saying? That&#8217;s into the same things that I&#8217;m into. It was like we were shocked to meet each other. And it was crazy because up there in New Hampshire/Maine, there aren&#8217;t many brothers up there. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
At the time, whenever it was like you see another Black person up there, you were like, &#8220;Oh man, you&#8217;re from up here? Oh man, where you from?&#8221; Or whatever. &#8220;Man, we should hang out or whatever.&#8221; You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Because I really didn&#8217;t see many of us up there or whatever, man. But anyway, so whenever me and Justice connected, it was like he put me onto so much. And I talk about it all the time. He showed me that everything that I wanted to be, I could be it. This guy&#8217;s the same age as me, similar interest and everything, come from similar backgrounds, and this guy is doing all the things that I wanted to do in life at that point. He just encouraged me.And at the time, I didn&#8217;t own computer, I didn&#8217;t own anything. The only thing I knew how to do was to paint and just hustle and just do art. And he told me, he was like, &#8220;Bro, you&#8217;re a brand and you don&#8217;t even realize it. You created a brand in a barracks room and people are buying your work from all over the world.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;You&#8217;re special, man.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;Yo, you really need to get out the Navy, man.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yo, I can get you a job right now.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m under contract.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;You can&#8217;t break it?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Nah, I can&#8217;t break this contract. I get out in&#8230;: At the time, I think I had five more years left because I had just reenlisted.</p>
<p>Yeah man, I owe a lot to Justice, man. He credits me for giving him a breath of fresh air and inspiring him as well, but I thank him all the time, man, because if I never met him, I think I would&#8217;ve got to where I needed to go eventually, but it would&#8217;ve probably taken a little bit longer. Like I said, at the time when I met Just, this is 2006. He&#8217;s showing me his portfolio. I didn&#8217;t even have a portfolio at the time, I just had some photos of my work that I took. And I took him to the pharmacy at the time to get the photos developed [inaudible 00:37:03] or whatever, man. Like I said, I didn&#8217;t know, I was very, very green. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I didn&#8217;t know. I knew I got a good product and I just know how to hustle. That&#8217;s the only thing I knew.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s showing me all his credentials and everything, he&#8217;s telling me about, &#8220;Yo, I work with Kanye.&#8221; This is during the Touch the Sky era and all of that, man. He&#8217;s showing me this. He&#8217;s showing the brands he&#8217;s worked on. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I did this cool sneaker for my man right here.&#8221; You know what I&#8217;m saying? He was like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t even worry about the credentials. It&#8217;s going to come, man. You trust me. You got it.&#8221; Once I met him and I saw what I wanted to be, it was no turning back after that. I was like, &#8220;Yo, I&#8217;m getting out. I&#8217;m getting out. I&#8217;m going to figure it out one way or another.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fast forward, I don&#8217;t know, I can&#8217;t do the math right now, 15 so years later I&#8217;m here talking to you, bro. There&#8217;s a lot of stuff in between that I&#8217;m jumping over, but, yeah, I&#8217;m here, I&#8217;m here. And I think I&#8217;ve done a lot of great stuff. My name is in places where I only dreamed about, or I&#8217;ve worked on things where when I was a teenager only dreamed about working on or thought it would be cool if I got to work on this or connect with this person and work on this project. And I did it. I&#8217;m still doing it. Sorry for the long rant, yo.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, it&#8217;s all good. Let&#8217;s hop forward to 2011. That&#8217;s when you got out of the Navy. You had been in the Navy for roughly about a decade. And then right afterwards, you enrolled in City Tech, which is a university in New York city. Talk to me about that time.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
It was interesting, man, because I was so hyped to get out and just be a civilian again because&#8230; In fact, most people didn&#8217;t even know that I was in the Navy because I was doing so much my artwork, putting my work out there. By this time, I&#8217;m not really even doing sneakers anymore, I&#8217;m painting, and people know me for my paintings. It was an interesting time. But I knew just from my first time going to college in the late &#8217;90s, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;All right, things are getting&#8230; It&#8217;s digital now.&#8221; I just can&#8217;t see myself going to school to pay to be a fine artist. Nothing against people who do. You know what I&#8217;m saying? But for me, like I said, I had bills. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I still had some kids to support. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;All right, how can I be creative and get paid to be creative?&#8221;I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to do. I knew the process of applying for art colleges just from the past, but I&#8217;m like, damn, I don&#8217;t really have any work that represents what people are looking for in this current state of the world, 2011. And I was like, &#8220;Man, I know I got the skills, but I don&#8217;t necessarily have the work to show it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A good friend of mine, he told me, he was like, &#8220;Yo, why don&#8217;t you go to City Tech?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What&#8217;s City Tech?&#8221; He was like, &#8220;You can get the same education there at a fraction of a price.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;A lot of the teachers that teach there, they teach you the big name schools as well.&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yo, dude, you don&#8217;t even got to do a portfolio, you just go and you show up. Just apply.&#8221;</p>
<p>I went to City Tech, I applied, I got in. And within maybe, I don&#8217;t know, two weeks of me getting out the Navy, it&#8217;s my first day of class. And the first year or so I&#8217;m trying to figure out, all right, what do I want to do? I didn&#8217;t feel like I was being challenged. And then maybe almost around the first year of me being there, I was in a class with this professor named Douglas Davis. Whether he knows it or not, he&#8217;s the person that really inspired me to stay at City Tech because I met him in the first day of his class. I saw he was speaking in a language that I understood. And I just liked the way he just came across in the room. You know what I&#8217;m saying?I&#8217;ll never forget this. This is over 10 years ago, but the first day of class, he comes in, he looks&#8230; He&#8217;s not much older than me so he looks young, he looks like he could possibly be a student at the time. He comes in and he says, &#8220;My name is Douglas Davis.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;What I do, I get money.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You listen to me, you&#8217;ll get money too.&#8221; And he says something, I think he says, &#8220;I&#8217;m surprised. I remember it was yesterday.&#8221; He said, &#8220;My wife, she don&#8217;t got to work. I bring home enough money to support my family doing what I love.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;You listen to me, I&#8217;m going to give you everything that I got. But when I ask for it back, you better give me 100%. I&#8217;m going to run this class like it&#8217;s an agency. If this ain&#8217;t going to be for you, I&#8217;m not going to judge you. I&#8217;ll help you get to where you need to be. But if you here for the ride, let&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, man. I never heard no professor in the classroom talk like that. And I was like, wow. His whole presence. He&#8217;s saying what I want to hear. Yeah, man, and that really put me on the path of going the route of learning about advertising and the stuff that I&#8217;ve been seeing for my whole entire life and just wondering why, wow, I like the way this ad looks, but I can&#8217;t explain why I like it. Being around him and other professors as well, but that really&#8230; I guess I feel like it cemented me in at City Tech where it&#8217;s like, all right, I&#8217;m not going anywhere because I like studying under this guy right here, I like studying under this other professor right here. They&#8217;re talking in the language that I want to, you know what I&#8217;m saying? That I want to hear. And they&#8217;re telling me the things that I need to know to apply to what I do already. Yeah man, that&#8217;s how I ended up at City Tech.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, shout out to Douglas Davidson who we&#8217;ve had on the show twice now. That&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve heard his classroom style, though. But as you described it, I was like, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s 100% him.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yo man, I tell you, he&#8217;s a great guy. No joke, man, when I was in his class, I felt like I was on&#8230; What&#8217;s the one show? Making the Band or something like that, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Because I didn&#8217;t want to mess up, you know what I&#8217;m saying? I didn&#8217;t want to mess up.</p>
<p>The nights leading up to the days when we had to present, he was like, &#8220;Yo, when the door is shut, the door is shut. If you not in, you not in.&#8221; I would make sure I&#8217;m on the train early, that way I&#8217;m not late to class that day and everything. I have everything set up, staying up all night just trying to get it right and just going up there. Because he didn&#8217;t hold any punches or whatever like that, he really ran it, his classroom&#8230; He didn&#8217;t run it like a classroom, he ran it like it was an agency, like it was a business. He&#8217;s a great guy, man. You can tell he really cared about what the people that&#8230; The students that he was working with. And he was there. He&#8217;s a real special person, man, he&#8217;s a real special person. And he&#8217;s someone that I&#8217;m very happy that I was blessed to meet in my journey along the way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Speaking of that journey, you documented a lot of this in a recent project that you released called Just Like Me. You directed it, you put the whole thing together. Douglas was in it as well. Talk to me about the documentary. First of all, why did you decide to do a documentary?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
With the documentary, that came about&#8230; Well, actually it&#8217;s a idea I&#8217;ve had in my head for many, many years but I just never really talked about it. I didn&#8217;t really talk about it to anyone; maybe one person. But it&#8217;s just something that I had in the back of my head. I was like, if the opportunity presents itself, it&#8217;d be cool to make this thing. It&#8217;s just something like a passion project.</p>
<p>And the opportunity came sooner than what I thought it was going to come in life. But around the time&#8230; In 2020, summer 2020, everybody&#8217;s in the house, the pandemic, COVID, all that stuff, and then the incident with George Floyd, all these agencies and companies having, I don&#8217;t know, a coming of age moment. We didn&#8217;t know. You know what I&#8217;m saying? What can we do to support Black people? Or whatever like that, man.</p>
<p>That was a moment in time where someone said to me&#8230; A real good friend of mine, a mentor as well, he said to me, &#8220;This is a moment in time where you need to use this opportunity to make what you want to make and do what you want to do, because I know you can do it.&#8221; And when he said it to me, I&#8217;m just thinking from a point of having anxiety and just fear of what&#8217;s the worst thing that could happen? This could happen, this could happen. And I just brushed it off.</p>
<p>And he came to me, he was like, &#8220;Yo, look man, make what you want to make.&#8221; I&#8217;m paraphrasing right now, but he said to me, &#8220;Your story is a very, very special story. How does someone go from working on nuclear submarines to knowing all the people that you know and working on the stuff that you worked on? You really have an interesting story.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not telling you what you should make or whatever, but you got something.&#8221; And I was like, all right. He was like, &#8220;I&#8217;ll help you get to a certain point with putting the pieces together, but after that, you running the show.&#8221; Because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never directed a documentary. I&#8217;ve been around when documentaries are being made from my time working at Mass Appeal and I saw how much work goes into making a documentary. I know it&#8217;s a lot of work. He was like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, you have what it takes.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I was like, &#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll put some days aside.&#8221; I wrote up three paragraphs, three, four paragraphs. I talk about basically the moment, this particular moment in time about how people were talking about the state of Black people in America with all the whole George Floyd&#8217;s things and the police incidents. It&#8217;s nothing new, it always happens, but the spotlight was on it in that moment in time.</p>
<p>Like I said, plus these companies are talking about, &#8220;Yo, we need to bring in more diversity,&#8221; and all this other things like that. I thought about why is it that there aren&#8217;t many Black people and there aren&#8217;t many brown people in these spaces of creativity?| And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Why is that?&#8221; And I start thinking about my own personal experiences, about how we don&#8217;t really hear about them. And it&#8217;s like, I know a lot of Black creators, but the average person don&#8217;t know who these people are. But they&#8217;ve done a lot of great things and they&#8217;ve contributed to a lot of things that are historic now. And I&#8217;m sure you know, with you doing your podcast, you know we create a lot of great things that everyone knows and a lot of people benefit from, but a lot of times people don&#8217;t know who the wizard was behind the curtain that created this thing.</p>
<p>And I thought about too about why there aren&#8217;t many of us in these spaces. And I thought about a lot of us don&#8217;t know that this path exists until maybe much later in life when people got bills, they got families to support and they give up on being a creative. They give up on it because there&#8217;s always this narrative of being a starving artist. And that&#8217;s not true.</p>
<p>Going back to something Douglas David said to me once, and I always quote it, he says, &#8220;This thing called design is like the Matrix.&#8221; You know what I&#8217;m saying? &#8220;It affects all of us. We all work, operate in the Matrix and everything, but you&#8217;ll never know the Matrix exists until someone points it out to you.&#8221; And that&#8217;s like how design is. Everything is designed, everything, but most people don&#8217;t think about the whole process of that and how it interacts with us. And I thought about, wow, more of us, more Black people knew about this at an early age and were aware that you can make a living off of this, you&#8217;re not going to be a starving artist, I felt like you could see more of us in these spaces. And in order for me to try to educate more people on it, I wanted to show people who were influential to me. There are many people who are influential to me, but I wanted to show a few Black men and women who I&#8217;m blessed to cross paths with them in my journey and what they meant to me.</p>
<p>And not only just show who these people are, show their work because a lot of times I feel like when it comes to designers and things like that, or just anything&#8230; I&#8217;m losing my train of thought. But I feel like we will show a person and we&#8217;ll have the title, but a lot of times you don&#8217;t know the work that they&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p>I think about if I was 16 or 17 years old, I might not know what a creative director is. I might not even understand what a ad agency is, but I know this Nike shoe right here, I know this commercial right here, and now I can connect the dots like, oh man, this is the person to help put this thing together right here. You know what I&#8217;m saying? Show the work. That&#8217;s what I wanted to do with the project. I wanted to show some people who that were like me and the work that they&#8217;ve done and the work that have had impact on so many other people. And I pretty much wanted to make something that I would&#8217;ve loved to have seen when I was younger.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long spiel, but I wrote up a short paragraph explaining that, about how representation is very important, representation is very important. You need to see examples of a roadmap of people that have done things before you that can hopefully inspire you to want to go down that path.</p>
<p>And I also told a story in the pitch about when me and Justice met each other, when mt man Justice hall, when me and him met each other in the early 2000s, why were we surprised that we were both Black? We were surprised because we don&#8217;t see many of us so it&#8217;s a shock whenever we do find it, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
At that time. And I pitched it and I got the green light, you know what I&#8217;m saying? I got the green light. And I reached out to everyone from St. Adams to Douglas Davis to Julian Alexander, Aleesha Smalls Worthington, Dana Gibbons, John Petty III, and Justice, Justice Hall. I reached out to them, and they were all on board.</p>
<p>I connected with my man&#8230; He&#8217;s a creative director, he&#8217;s a director as well, my man, Ben Hype. And me and him came up with the whole creative look and vision, and we put it together. I just knew working on this right here, I knew that I wanted to make something visually appealing, visually, visually dope. The message is dope, but I want the visuals to be engaging as well where when someone&#8217;s watching it, they&#8217;re not going to want to look away because it&#8217;s just a beautiful piece. And I thought about what&#8217;s the series on Netflix? Abstract.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Abstract. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
You know what I&#8217;m saying? Out of what two seasons, they may feature one Black woman or person of color.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They had Ralph Gilles in the first season, and then in the second season they had&#8230; Oh God, they had Ian Spalter, who&#8217;s head of Instagram in Japan, and they had Ruth E. Carter, the costumer. They had her.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Right, right. This is just my opinion. I feel like that just an afterthought, like, &#8220;Oh, we got to check a box,&#8221; or whatever. You know what I&#8217;m saying? And Abstract is a great series, but if you go off of that, you would think Black designers don&#8217;t exist. You know what I&#8217;m saying? Don&#8217;t get me wrong, we&#8217;re rare, but it&#8217;s not as rare as how that series made it seem. You know what I&#8217;m saying? There&#8217;s a lot of us. But that&#8217;s what I wanted to show. Yo, we&#8217;re walking in plain sight every day, and we put a lot of things out into the world that you seen but you probably didn&#8217;t know that, hey, I&#8217;m the person behind this right here because&#8230;</p>
<p>And not even to sound the cliche or stereotypical, but whenever you&#8230; A lot of times when they think of basketball courts or sports, you think of a Black man. You know what I&#8217;m saying? When you think of entertainment or whatever, you think of Black people. But what about all these other roles and titles out there that we&#8217;ve contributed a part of, been a part? And I wanted to show this right here. But not show it in a preachy way or like I&#8217;m giving a lecture, I wanted to do it in a way that&#8217;s conversational.</p>
<p>And I credit my man, Brandon Coleman. He&#8217;s a designer. He&#8217;s another one of the first Black designers I ever met when I met Justice at the time. But he gave me the inspiration to go that route because like I said, I never done this before, I never directed anything before. I know what I wanted to see and I know that I want it to look good, I want it to be visually appealing. But he asked me a question early on. He said, &#8220;How do you want tell your message? Do you want to have a lecture or do you want it to be conversational?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, a lecture?&#8221; He was like, &#8220;No, you want to have a conversation. Put yourself back into the 16, 17 year old version of you, TTK. Did you like when people were preaching to you? Or did you like when when people were having a conversation back and forth?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;re going to do it, but think about that whenever you&#8217;re trying to put this story together.</p>
<p>And that helped me with the whole creative direction. Whenever Ben Hype was filming it, I told him, I was like, &#8220;Yo, I want you to show the people, show their hands, show them moving around, show closeups of them.&#8221; I want you to feel like you&#8217;re in the room with these people. I want you to feel like you know them. And even though if you may not know them or whatever, but you konw their work. But I want the people, when they view this, I want them to feel like it&#8217;s an intimate moment, like you&#8217;re close with these people, like you&#8217;re talking to a cousin or someone who&#8217;s a part of your family or a friend that you&#8217;ve known for years. And I think I was able to accomplish that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, the documentary is really great. And we&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes so people can check it out. We&#8217;ve had Julian on the show too. Julian is episode 250, I believe.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. But no, it&#8217;s a great documentary. I hope everybody will get a chance to check it out. When you had the idea and you put it all together, like what we talked about I think before we started recording about you never know how it&#8217;s going to be received. What has the reception been like since the documentary&#8217;s aired?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been good, it&#8217;s been very, very good. It&#8217;s slow, you know what I&#8217;m saying? It&#8217;s slow or whatever. But so far I haven&#8217;t had anyone say anything, &#8220;I wish you could have done it this way or whatever, this and that.&#8221; The response is always the same, &#8220;This is amazing. I never seen anything quite like this before. And it&#8217;s very real, and I feel inspired.&#8221; I did it. That&#8217;s what I wanted to do.<br>
Like I said, when I initially pitched the idea, I said I wanted to make something that&#8217;s meant to educate and inspire. Whatever comes after that is just a extra benefit. I wanted to make something that lives beyond this particular moment in time where if you watch it a year from now, two years, five years, whatever, it&#8217;s the educational piece. And I want people to be inspired by&#8230; I want to hopefully inspire the next generation of Black creatives out there to show, hey, these are people that are alive right now and they&#8217;re doing it versus I&#8217;m hearing about somebody who did some great things back in 1970. I&#8217;m like, wow, I&#8217;m hearing about it from someone else&#8217;s perspective versus hearing it from the person when they&#8217;re alive right now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going off on a rant right now or whatever, but I think about how Cey adams that&#8217;s featured in a documentary, why isn&#8217;t he taught about in schools? You pay this money to go to school for design and everything, you learn about all these other designers, and they&#8217;re great people and they&#8217;ve done great things, man, I love the work, but Cey is on that level of, in my opinion, the Paula Schers and all those other people out there because he&#8217;s done so much stuff that people know. They know his work but unless you&#8217;re into this thing called design, you probably wouldn&#8217;t even know who Cey is. And I feel like he&#8217;s someone who should&#8217;ve probably been on the Abstract series. This man was around in the &#8217;70s, New York, going from graffiti on trains to his work in the &#8217;80s to the &#8217;90s, to being in, what, the National African American Smithsonian Museum. Come on. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m skipping over 40 years worth of work right here because it is too much to talk about that he&#8217;s accomplished in his lifetime. Why isn&#8217;t he taught about in school? And it goes back to what I was saying, when you think of design, they don&#8217;t think of us. And I was like, &#8220;Yo, I&#8217;m not making this to ask for a seat at the table, I want to make this to just educate us and show us, tell these stories from a real perspective versus someone years later to tell the narrative a certain way.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I want you to hear from the people while they&#8217;re alive, people who are heroes to me, people who, whether they know it or not&#8230;&#8221; I took a little bit from all of them to get to this point right here. I want other people to be inspired as well to accomplish things that I didn&#8217;t accomplish or we didn&#8217;t accomplish, but a lot sooner.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel you 100%. I can liken it to what I do with Revision Path, with having folks on here. I&#8217;ve been able to have people on here at different parts of their career journey. There&#8217;s folks who I&#8217;ve had on maybe in 2014 that now I can bring back seven or eight years later and be like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s talk about how things have changed,&#8221; or something. You know?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I totally get that. Actually, I have a funny story. Well, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s funny, but I have a story about Abstract. This was in 2019 I think was when the second season was about to come out. And I had watched the first season. Well, I&#8217;m not going to lie, I watched Ralph Gilles&#8217; episode on Abstract for the first season and that&#8217;s it because I was like, I don&#8217;t want to hear about everybody else. I was like, I&#8217;m going to watch his.</p>
<p>And the place I was working at the startup at the time, and we were looking for design firms for a project that we were going to do, this lifestyle vertical. And so one of the agencies we reached out to was Godfrey Dadich, which is in San Francisco. The Abstract series came from Godfrey being Scott Dadich, who was the former co-founder of Wired. And I didn&#8217;t talk to him directly, but I talked to someone at the agency because I was like,&#8221; Yeah, my name is Maurice Cherry,&#8221; blah blah, blah, yada, yada, yada. And they were like, &#8220;Oh, we know who you are.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Oh, okay.&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t coming to them in a personal capacity, it was a professional capacity. And not even for the show, it was for my employer at the time.</p>
<p>They were talking to me about the second season of Abstract. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh yeah, the second season of Abstract is coming out.&#8221; And they were like, &#8220;I bet you&#8217;re really going to be excited about this because we got two Black designers for this season.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Why would I be excited about that?&#8221; Yay, you found two, but I&#8217;ve found hundreds. I mean, I don&#8217;t know if they were saying it to be solidarity or something. I don&#8217;t know, I just thought that was weird that they brought it up in that way. We ended up not going with them, not for that reason. But I was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll check it out when it airs on Netflix.&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, we managed to find two great Black designers. I&#8217;m like-</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
We managed to find.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, we managed to find, which is funny that they said that, because I was like, one, I&#8217;ve known Ian. Actually, I did an event here in 2017 back when he was&#8230; Well, he still works for Meta and everything with Instagram. But I met him at a live event here in Atlanta for Revision Path. And then Ruth, I don&#8217;t know Ruth, but I&#8217;ve had Ruth&#8217;s goddaughter on the show, Courtney Pinter. She lives in Switzerland. I think at the time she was doing flavor design for this company called Givaudan. Now she works for Fifa. But I&#8217;ve also had Hannah Beachler to give the Black Panther connection. I had her on the show for episode 300.</p>
<p>Your overarching point around the importance of being able to have people give their own history in their own words is super important because when I started Revision Path, and this was almost 10 years ago, that&#8217;s not to say that these stories weren&#8217;t out there, but they were really hard to find. And one of the few places that I found them was at AIGA when I started volunteering there with the diversity and inclusion task force. Because they would do these design journeys things and they would talk about folks. But even the way that they&#8230; The imagery and everything almost memorialized them. And keep in mind, these people are not dead, but they memorialize them in this way like they&#8217;ve gone on to greater things. And I&#8217;m like, these folks are still alive. What are you talking about?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
And they&#8217;re active, too. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, and active. Michelle Washington&#8217;s one of the first people that I had met through that. Her and I are working on the book together. Maurice Woods, who&#8217;s been on the show before, Maurice Woods of the Interact Project. I think he&#8217;s episode 12 or 13. Emery Douglas from the famous former Minister of Culture from the Black Panther Party, AIGA medalist, he&#8217;s been on the show. That was episode 15. But I didn&#8217;t find out about those folks until I volunteered and did that. And the way that even they just put it out there made it seem like these are not living people still doing work, it was almost like in memoriam. Nah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s like when we was putting the pieces together for Lust Like Me, Douglas Davis, he connected me with Cheryl D. Miller. I don&#8217;t know if you know her.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah, oh man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
She&#8217;s episode 248.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I felt like I was sitting with royalty talking to her. You know what I&#8217;m saying? Me and Davis had some questions to ask her. Man, once she started talking, man, the questions just went out the window. She was just dropping so many jewels and so much history and stuff, man. And it&#8217;s like, wow, how come I didn&#8217;t know this woman&#8217;s story? I&#8217;m happy that I spoke to her while she&#8217;s alive saying, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Hear it straight from&#8230; It&#8217;s from the source.</p>
<p>And she said something. Well, I don&#8217;t know if you remember, but at the very end of the documentary, Just Like Me, there&#8217;s a quote from her at the very, very end before the credits. When we were talking, she said something, &#8220;It&#8217;s sad that your generation has to experience the same thing I experienced 50 something years ago around the time when Dr. King died.&#8221; She was like, &#8220;Yo, all these companies had an awakening moment for about a year or two, maybe less than that.&#8221; And she was like, &#8220;And this is what&#8217;s happening right now because of George Floyd. These companies are having an awakening moment, but it&#8217;s going to fizzle out,&#8221; unfortunately, man.</p>
<p>When you say we can have all the different programs, DEI, all this, whatever, if you want to change it, change it. And she said something too. She was like, &#8220;Yo, if they try to tell you that we didn&#8217;t exist, that&#8217;s a lie.&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;I&#8217;m fortunate that I got all of this stuff because I was alive and I archived it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like a magician, she pulls out a issue of Communication Arts from 1970. And I ordered it because of her. She was like, &#8220;This is one of the first&#8230;&#8221; This is what from 50 years ago, she just pulls this magazine out. She was like, &#8220;This right here on page whatever, 90 something or whatever, you see the Black designers right here? This is 1970 right here, so if they try to tell you that the only person that was out doing things is Milton Glazer and all those guys like that,&#8221; she was like, &#8220;nah, he was just the only person that was getting the work. That&#8217;s why you knew about him. But these other people were out here as well. And here, this is their work right here on.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;I got it in the archives right here, so nobody can ever try to pull the wool over my eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>And when I got that issue, I was able to back order it online, and I saw Ms. Dorothy Hayes, she was a Black designer as well. And I used to see she was a professor at City Tech. And I never knew that this woman was one of the first Black designers ever published. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I had no clue. I never had any of her classes, but I would just see her in passing. And I&#8217;m like, wow, there&#8217;s so much history that we have. And that&#8217;s why I feel like we got to tell our stories before&#8230; Tell them in real time and tell them authentic and speak to the people who needs to hear it because you already know how it goes, man, years later, the narrative, it gets switched up and it gets watered down. That&#8217;s not how it really was. Yeah, man, salute to you for what you do, man. I&#8217;m honored to be a part of this right here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Thank you. And yeah, Cheryl is 100% right about that. When I ran across Cheryl, this was in 20&#8230; Now you got me here telling stories. This was 2014, and I had just started doing volunteer stuff with Revision&#8230; Not Revision Path, with AIGA, started doing volunteer stuff. And that&#8217;s when I learned about her thesis that she did in 1985 when she was at Pratt about Black designers and their viability in the industry and how that became this 1987 print article, and then there was this AIGA symposium.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m doing all this research trying to find&#8230; Well, one, doing the research on what happened from that thesis, but then secondly, I wanted to put it into this presentation that I was putting together that I was going to present called Where Are the Black Designers? And I was like, is Cheryl still alive? And I remember asking folks at AIG, and they were like, &#8220;Well, we don&#8217;t know what happened to her.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Let me find her.&#8221;And I found her. How did I find Cheryl? Oh, I know, I found her on Amazon. Wow. She had written a book about her mother. It wasn&#8217;t even about design, it was about her mother and the relationship she had with her mother and everything growing up. I just found her book, eventually did some more searching, found a website, reached out on a whim and was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m Maurice Cherry. I&#8217;m doing this research. I&#8217;m putting this stuff together. I&#8217;d love to talk to you about this kind of stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I first encountered Cheryl, like I said back in 2014, she had put design behind her. She had had her design work and stuff. She had, I wouldn&#8217;t say retired, but she raised a family, became a theologian. She was living a totally different life. And then since then, of course, doing the presentation and then more people finding out about her work, now she&#8217;s Dr. Cheryl Miller and has given lectures across the country and doing all amazing stuff and is still here doing this stuff.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
That&#8217;s beautiful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s beautiful, it&#8217;s beautiful. And so with Provision Path, I&#8217;m certainly fortunate to be able to share that story and to bring more awareness to people in general about what Black folks are doing in design everywhere. I just had this year my first Black designer in South America, which is something I wanted to have for a long time. I was like, I&#8217;m going to hit every continent. Couldn&#8217;t hit Antarctica, but I done talked to a Black designer on every continent so far start with 2022 this year with someone in South America. Yeah, I just want to keep going and keep telling more stories and getting more folks on here to tell their stories so folks know that we did exist.</p>
<p>To that end about the whole black squares thing, in 2020, that summer, I was looking up a bunch of old Ebony and Jet magazines and stuff. I think Google has the full archive, the full digital archive of Ebony Magazine, and so I was looking at issues from when Dr. King was assassinated. And when I tell you it was the exact same thing about companies posting black squares, exact same thing people were doing back then when King died, sometimes even the same verbiage. I&#8217;m like, this is wild, this is wild.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s one thing Ms. Miller was saying, she was like, &#8220;Just change it. You want to make change? Do it.&#8221; These people that have positions to do it, they don&#8217;t want to do it. This right here is a moment in time. Like she said, I&#8217;ve seen it before. I&#8217;m not even thrilled by it. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not thrilled by it at all. Just from her telling me&#8230; Hearing stories that I&#8217;ve never heard before. One day, thankfully, you&#8217;re doing what you&#8217;re doing so people will have,&#8230; We&#8217;re able to control our own narrative more so now. It was great, but at the same time, it&#8217;s bittersweet as well, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right, right.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Because wow, man, I&#8217;m experiencing the same thing my elders experienced. How come I don&#8217;t know about Cheryl Miller, the woman who created the original BET logo? You know what I&#8217;m saying? Something that&#8217;s a part of my childhood. Why more people don&#8217;t know about who this woman is right here?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m honored that I was able to speak with her and basically just sit and listen to her talk, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Just sit and listen to her talk. And to have a quote from her in the documentary, I was like, man, that was a great book end on it. It was a real book end to the project. Like I said, when you watch it, in the very beginning it says how it started, and at the end it says how it&#8217;s going. And you see her quote at the end, someone who&#8217;s been around that predates all of us. She predates even Cey, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Who has 40 something years of work. She predates him. To have someone like a OG basically, a vet, to have her to be a part of the project, man, I&#8217;m thankful. I&#8217;m thankful for everybody that was a part of helping me put this project together, Just Like Me. Man, I&#8217;m thankful for everybody, man. But yeah, Cheryl Miller&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want the next chapter of your legacy to be?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I want to be known as a painter more. I want to be known as that. I want to do gallery shows, more of them. Because in the past where I was just doing art shows myself, and I was just happy if I was able to fill the room with friends and stuff like that and create a memory. I want to sell my work on a high level. I want to work with more brands, but I want to be working with brands because they want to work with me, not because I need a job. I want to bring my personal creativity and my expertise to the table. &#8220;Yo, we want to collab with you. We love your story.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I want another opportunity to make a project, another project like Just Like Me but bigger. I know when you watch the documentary, it looks like it was&#8230; Yeah, it&#8217;s put together very, very well, but oh man, we were building the car while we were driving it, making this thing right here. We were really making something out of nothing, but it looks like it&#8217;s on a high level so I would really like to have a chance to make something maybe&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the same type of topic or something completely different. I wouldn&#8217;t mind directing another project.</p>
<p>All in all, I just want to continue to be creative, continue to make a living, and live comfortable using my imagination, man. I don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s going to go in the next five years, but I&#8217;m speaking into existence right now what I want. And truthfully, I feel like I can&#8217;t even fathom what&#8217;s going to be for me because it&#8217;s going to be something that I&#8217;m not even expecting. You know what I&#8217;m saying? Just this documentary, just like&#8230;</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t mention it, but working on a project for Nas, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Well, I worked on a few project for Nas but having my name and the credits next to Nas and Kanye, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Wow, you can&#8217;t erase my name from this project. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I&#8217;ve worked on this right here. You know what I&#8217;m saying? If you would&#8217;ve told me at the time 15 years ago that, &#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re going to work on this project. You&#8217;re going to be the person who designs and put this thing together,&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;How is that going to happen?&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t&#8230; I&#8217;d imagine it, but I was like, wow, it seemed like a fairytale. But the have, I did it, and it&#8217;s a thing of the past now, I&#8217;m onto something new, wow, that&#8217;s great.</p>
<p>And if you would&#8217;ve told me three years ago that I would direct a documentary, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;How would I do that?&#8221; And that&#8217;s going back to what I was initially saying, five years from now, I just want to be doing something great and making a living and just putting the best stuff out into the world, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work online?</p>

And you can watch the documentary. The documentary&#8217;s only&#8230; It&#8217;s just in the 30 minutes, but it&#8217;s strong. It&#8217;s a very powerful piece that I&#8217;m really proud of. I always say that project is my magnum opus project at the moment. Yeah, that&#8217;s where you can find me at.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
TTK, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show, one, for sharing your story, which again, I hope people will check out the documentary so they can get a chance to see it for themselves, but also just your whole story about perseverance and pursuing your creative passion. I think that&#8217;s something that hopefully a lot of people can get inspired by. And I&#8217;m excited to see what you do next. If this documentary is any indication, I&#8217;m pretty sure what&#8217;s coming up next is going to be great. Thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
No, brother, thank you for having me on here. Thank you. Also want to thank my partner, Chevon, because she was very vigilant about trying to get me on your show. Thank you to Chevon as well, man. And she&#8217;s @chevonmedia on IG and on Twitter. Yeah, thank you to Chevon. I&#8217;m honored to be a part of this. And maybe, I don&#8217;t know, five years from now, maybe you&#8217;ll reach out to me to revisit what&#8217;s going on in my life for whatever project I got going on, man.</p>

<p>We have all had to change things up in one way or other over the past few years. But if you&#8217;re like this week&#8217;s return guest, Nakita M. Pope, there&#8217;s power in pivoting! (You might remember her from <a href="/jordan-taylor/" data-wpel-link="internal">my recent talk with Jordan Taylor</a>, or from <a href="/nakita-m-pope-2016/" data-wpel-link="internal">our 2016 interview</a>.)</p>
<p>Our conversation started with catching up on what&#8217;s happened over the past few years, and Nakita spoke about some of her recent projects, including launching a business course and a subscription box turned online community &#8212; <a href="https://bellabossbox.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Bella Boss</a>! We also talked about her work as a design educator, the recent closing of The Creative Circus, being awarded as an AIGA Fellow, and she shared how her passion projects have impacted her career. Nakita&#8217;s love for community and giving back really shines, and I think you&#8217;ll get really inspired by this interview!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Hi, I&#8217;m Nakita Pope. I am a designer, creative director, studio owner, and professor. I&#8217;m the chief chick at Branding Chicks, which is a boutique branding agency here in Atlanta, Georgia. And I specialize in brand strategy and brand development for women owned businesses and femme focused brands.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s the year been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, man, the year has been a little bit of a whirlwind. I was just talking to someone the other day and telling them that during the pandemic, everybody, well, a lot of people kind of slowed down. Everything got a little bit slower. The pace wasn&#8217;t as rigorous. For me, everything sped up a little bit. It was super busy. And so I feel like 2022 has been about wrapping up that kind of frenzied level of work and of coming back to center a little bit. So it&#8217;s been some ups and downs, but it&#8217;s been a good year. I can&#8217;t complain. It&#8217;s been a great year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything in particular that you want to try to accomplish this year, before the end of the year?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, man, get some rest. That is my goal by the end of this year. I am wrapping up some things right now, and that&#8217;s my goal is to take this last quarter of the year, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;ll be the whole quarter, but I definitely want to take some time at the end of this year to just sort of recenter myself and get some rest.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m always doing so many things at once. I kind of like it that way, as a creative, it keeps me from being bored. But I&#8217;m starting to realize that it&#8217;s been a very long time since I stopped everything. And so I&#8217;m looking forward to taking some space to do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Good. Definitely, take that space now before, say, oh, I guess before the winter really starts. But it kind of feels like any time between Thanksgiving and New Years is sort of a down period for everybody. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; hopefully, you&#8217;ll get a chance to get some of that rest. I think we all probably need that.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah, indeed. Indeed, more than we think.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Let&#8217;s talk about Branding Chicks. Now, you&#8217;ve been in business now for what, over 12 years, now, right?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s been a while. It went by so fast. That sounds crazy, 12 years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has your business changed since we last talked? That was back in 2016. How has your business changed?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
It&#8217;s changed quite a bit. A lot of it has stayed the same, but so much of it has changed. I think part of what has changed&#8230; Well, I&#8217;ll start with something that&#8217;s stayed the same. So one of the things that stayed the same is I kind of always worked remotely, because I have sort of a niche sort of brand. I feel like I end up working with people all over. And so it&#8217;s not specific to Atlanta, necessarily. And so that was always kind of how I worked. But now since the pandemic and all that stuff, I find that it&#8217;s expanding even more, because other people are now looking outside of their geographic locations even more.</p>
<p>And understanding that they can do really robust and deep work with people, even if they&#8217;re not necessarily in the same place or able to meet face to face. So I feel like that has both stayed the same and also changed. I feel that I&#8217;ve also been able to work with some amazing organizations that are doing really great work that I feel really strongly about, personally. I&#8217;ve been able to do some deeper dives with some brands, and do some larger projects with some of those brands. And to me that&#8217;s growth, to allow me to do more of what I want to be doing, and more of where I feel that I can have the best impact. That&#8217;s how I measure success. So in that space, I&#8217;m really happy with the direction that things are going in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you seen a change in the market with respect to the things clients are looking for? Have things shifted or changed during the pandemic?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. I think some of it, from a brand strategy standpoint, I&#8217;m noticing more and more that organizations and companies are starting to understand that even if they were already committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion, they are looking to build that and bake that into their brands a bit more. Which I love to see, because that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m passionate about as well. And I know that in some cases we see companies doing that, and we&#8217;re not sure if it&#8217;s going to stick.</p>
<p>But from my perspective, when I see companies that come to me for that and they are looking at the foundational parts of their brand and their brand personality and their core values and things like that, if they&#8217;re baking it into those things, then I find that they are more deeply passionate about it and more committed to it. So I see a lot of that happening on my end, which, like I said, I&#8217;m really happy to see. And it allows me to work in some of those spaces that I work in outside of my business, also, in my business. So it gives me a chance to bring some of that knowledge in, and also, help people build brands that they feel like really represents them in every way. So I see a lot of that shifting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When did you first see that shift? I&#8217;m curious.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I think 2020. I think when George Floyd happened, and so much of the conversation got so much louder. A lot of us have been talking about this for a long time, working in this space for a long time, both at the front lines and behind the scenes trying to make some of these things happen. But I think overarchingly after the nationwide, worldwide conversation got so much louder, I think that some of these companies are realizing that they need to change their ways. And/or if they were already committed to it, then they need to be even more vocal about their commitment. So I feel like that was the catalyst for a lot of it, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does a typical day look like for you now?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, man, it&#8217;s all over the place. Most days I am working on client work. Two days a week, I&#8217;m usually teaching as a professor. But other than that, some days I&#8217;m also consulting or I might have a public speaking engagement or doing things like this, doing a podcast interview. So it really varies quite a bit from day-to-day. But I kind of like that, it keeps me from being bored, and it gives me a chance to dive deeper into the things that I care about and the spaces that I work in a lot of different ways. It&#8217;s all connected. It doesn&#8217;t feel disjointed to me. It&#8217;s all connected in some way, but it gives me a chance to touch it in different ways.</p>
<p>And they all feed each other. So all the things that I learned with my client engagements brings me into the consulting with other clients. All of those experiences I can bring to my students, and give them a more robust education about how we work with clients and things that I&#8217;m working on, and what the industry looks like and all that stuff. And when I&#8217;m doing industry stuff, then I learn some other things and then bring it back to some of those other things. So I feel like it&#8217;s all connected, but it does allow me to have a different day, every day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious, has the pandemic changed business for you in any way? I know we talked about sort of have you seen a change in the market, but since the pandemic has started, has that shifted how you do business?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Not particularly, to be honest. I think just in terms of my processes and my creative process and stuff, that hasn&#8217;t changed very much. Like I said, I think more people are willing to work remotely. So that&#8217;s changed a little bit of the opportunities that I&#8217;ve been getting and people that are reaching out to work with me. I think from a logistical standpoint, I think more people want to be on video these days.</p>
<p>Like I said, I&#8217;ve worked with people all over the country for a while now, and most times people were completely fine with just a phone call. But now that everybody&#8217;s kind of been forced to work remotely, I think that video calls are now the go-to instead of the phone call. So from a logistical standpoint, that is something that I&#8217;ve seen that&#8217;s changed. Which I don&#8217;t mind most times, but it is definitely interesting to see a shift in that. But then I saw the uptick in it and then I saw the fatigue that came from it.</p>
<p>So now I&#8217;ve gone back to giving people a choice, &#8220;Listen, you don&#8217;t have to be on video if you don&#8217;t want to. Let me know what works best for you. I don&#8217;t want to make it more uncomfortable for you or make it more of a heavy lift to have this meeting.&#8221; So I try to be respectful of that too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I say that also when I have meetings, I actually have two separate booking links, one is for phone, one is for Zoom. And I&#8217;ll only give the Zoom to people that I like. People that I want to see, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You can get the Zoom call.&#8221; If you just hit me up out the blue and want something, a phone call is fine. It&#8217;s the same information. So I get what you&#8217;re saying though about having that option though. Because even I think with the fact that everybody&#8217;s getting on video, folks still have not really gotten used to it. We&#8217;re-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; what, two something years in and people are still like, &#8220;Oh, sorry about the background,&#8221; or the lighting is bad or whatever. And I&#8217;m not expecting studio quality video here-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
No, right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; even though we are very much in the future. I&#8217;m not expecting that. But I don&#8217;t know, sometimes it&#8217;s different. Plus, there&#8217;s all these different video platforms. There&#8217;s Zoom, there&#8217;s Google Meet, there&#8217;s WebEx. What else do I have installed? I have BlueJeans. I have Teams. I&#8217;m like, Just pick up the phone.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
It&#8217;s too much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right, just pick up the phone. It&#8217;s the same information. It&#8217;s the same information.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I&#8217;m going to have to steal that one. I might have two separate links too, now. Because mine was already set up, just the default was phone. And then I realized that all the instructions said, &#8220;I will give you a call at that time,&#8221; after they book. But I still get emails, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t ever see a link to a video call.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;That&#8217;s because it wasn&#8217;t really supposed to be one.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see a link.&#8221; Or sometimes what&#8217;ll happen with people is they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Oh, well I&#8217;m in the car going somewhere and I&#8217;m not going to be&#8230;&#8221; Just call me. Just call me.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
It really is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The phone still works. It did not go away in the pandemic. It still works. I see that one thing that you&#8217;re offering now is a course. You&#8217;re offering a course called Building a Business Brand. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
That was something that I did in collaboration with Small Business Invoicing Company. And they were looking to just build a library of resources for their small business audience. And so I was able to do that with them and it was really great. It was a series. I think there were three modules. But we just talked about the benefits and the value of being able to build a brand for your business. Whether you&#8217;re creative or not, regardless of what type of business you have, I think most of us start a business because we&#8217;re really passionate about what it is that we do. We&#8217;re passionate about whatever that skill set is, whatever product or service that we are putting out there in the world. And so that tends to be for most people where your area of expertise is.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re necessarily an expert at being able to brand yourself or market yourself. Even creatives that are in these spaces every day struggle with that, because it&#8217;s hard to figure out what your personal brand is or your business brand is. Sometimes it takes having some help from outside. But we just talked about the fundamentals of that, and how much of a difference it can make to distinguish you in your category.</p>
<p>I hear all the time where some people are getting ready to start new businesses or they come to me and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;I&#8217;m starting a business that&#8217;s this, fill in the blank. And people are telling me that I shouldn&#8217;t start a business in this, because it&#8217;s oversaturated and there&#8217;s already so many people doing that thing.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s really where branding comes in. The fact that you can establish a personality or some value-add or some way of talking about your product or service that&#8217;s different from everybody else is what&#8217;s going to stand out.&#8221; So it was really kind of built around that and it was super fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you thought about expanding into doing other courses?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, for sure. I&#8217;ve done lots of workshops here and there before, both under the umbrella of other organizations, and some independent ones on my own. And I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;m going to tackle this, because like I said, I&#8217;m trying to take a little bit of a break, but I&#8217;m looking at, one of the things that I see is that, for me, I really care so much about what it is that I do. And teaching is something that&#8217;s really close to my heart.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m always looking like, what do people need? What is it that people are struggling with? Or where can I have the most impact? And one of the things I see, especially for designers is that, and not just designers, actually people that are in marketing, for instance, some people who have design backgrounds or even people that are in coming from sales, often I hear people, &#8220;I want to talk about brand strategy. I want to get into that, but I have no idea how to make that transition.&#8221;</p>
<p>And for designers, especially going from strictly the visual identity and the creative side of things to talking heavily about strategy sometimes is a challenge. And it&#8217;s not because they&#8217;re not already doing it. Because that was my situation, in retrospect, I realized that I was always a strategic designer. That was always a big part of my process. But I didn&#8217;t necessarily put it out there. I didn&#8217;t explain all of my process to my clients necessarily. I didn&#8217;t build it into my proposals. It just wasn&#8217;t at the forefront. But it was there underneath all the time. Before I designed anything, I did all the research. I looked at their competitors, I did all these things. But I realized that for most designers, it&#8217;s hard to make that transition, because they don&#8217;t know how to reposition themselves in the market in that way.</p>
<p>And they don&#8217;t know what they don&#8217;t know. They don&#8217;t know what they need to know to be able to take those parts that they may already be doing, and be able to go deeper with that and really make it a big part of their practice. And because that&#8217;s part of the process that I really love, I&#8217;ve always been looking at how can I do more of this? And then of course at some point I had that fork in the road, where I had to decide, am I going to position myself in this way? Or am I just going to make this a bigger part of my design process?</p>
<p>And so when I started Branding Chicks, that was the pivot for me to decide that I was going to make brand strategies the thing that I led with. And I still do a lot of design for my clients, but I also am now in a place where, probably, about half of my clients, I&#8217;m only doing strategy for, I&#8217;m not necessarily creating any deliverables on the design side. So it&#8217;s kind of the best of both worlds.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I feel like we&#8217;ve started to see designers probably over the past maybe four or five years, start to lean more into that strategy. Because it&#8217;s been pushed a lot to say-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; &#8220;Yes, you can know how to do design, you can know the programs and the tools and the methods, but until you&#8217;re able to apply that in a business sense, then that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ll become truly effective.&#8221; Douglas Davis, who we both know, has a whole book about it. So it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re starting to see a lot of designers try to go into. The thing with the courses, though, I&#8217;m really interested about, because I feel like courses are something that, and I&#8217;m dating myself here, I&#8217;m thinking way back to 2010, probably, even a little bit earlier than that, but do you remember CreativeLive? Does that sound familiar to you?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yes, I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
CreativeLive used to do these multi-day courses with entrepreneurs would come in and they would teach. And I mean for the time it was pretty novel. I actually don&#8217;t even know what CreativeLive is doing now. But I know that something that is pushed on a lot of entrepreneurs, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, take the knowledge that put it into a course, and then sell the course.&#8221; Which is always an option, but are your clients going to be the same people that you want to sell your course to? It feels like it opens up a separate revenue stream, potentially. But then unless you&#8217;re just not a great salesman, that&#8217;s skills you have to tap into.</p>
<p>I tried to do courses when I had my studio, and even though I&#8217;ve taught before, I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to sell the course.&#8221; It didn&#8217;t feel right for me to sell the course. And I know that people do, this was actually a little bit before Skillshare, but people would do Skillshare and things like that. I taught at Mediabistro and I sort of did my courses that way. And it was easy because it was just like you had a PowerPoint, you had a microphone, you spoke all through the lessons and stuff like that.<br>
And it works, but it did add on, for me at least, it just added on this extra dimension of sales that I have to do. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;It&#8217;s not worth it. For the money that I&#8217;m getting from it, it&#8217;s not worth it for me trying to hustle on these courses. I&#8217;ll just get some more clients.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah, I totally get that. And I agree with you. I don&#8217;t think that any of the courses that I&#8217;ve done previously or the one that I&#8217;m going to be doing about brand strategy isn&#8217;t really targeted towards clients. It&#8217;s much more targeted to other creative professionals more than anything else. So I look at it as a form of professional development, I mean, because I did the one that you&#8217;re talking about in partnership with someone else, that was meant to be an evergreen course, so it was fully recorded and all that kind of stuff. And so they&#8217;ll have it for a while and their audiences can access it whenever.</p>
<p>The way that I&#8217;m approaching my brand strategy course is I&#8217;m looking at it as sort of a masterclass. I want it to be hands-on and I want it to be small and I want it to be in real time, because I enjoy that part of teaching. And I feel like there&#8217;s so much so to learn, there&#8217;s so much to share, and there&#8217;s so many questions that people always have that this is born out of my day-to-day, and people that ask me these questions or they send me emails and those kind of things. So I&#8217;m looking at how can I help them in real time? I want to answer your question, not a general question like yours. I want to answer your question.</p>
<p>So I feel like, for me, I&#8217;m looking at sort of a masterclass kind of thing more than an evergreen, pre-recorded course. I think there&#8217;s a lot of value in those as well, but I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s what I really want to do. I just like the hands-on so much more, so that&#8217;s the way that I&#8217;m looking at it. Yeah,</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I gotcha. So while we&#8217;re talking about teaching, I have to ask you about The Creative Circus. The Creative Circus is where you&#8217;ve taught for, how long have you been teaching there?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I think this is my 13th year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
13 years. It&#8217;s closing its doors. Jordan Taylor, who I had on a couple of episodes ago, we talked about that. How do you feel about it?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a set of mixed in motions. It really is. Other than some workshops here and there and some guest lectures and things like that, this has been my most continuous experience with teaching and it&#8217;s something that I truly love. So it&#8217;s always going to be something I truly love. I&#8217;ve seen so many talented people come through those doors, and it&#8217;s such an amazing alumni network. And so many people, I&#8217;m still connected to both that are still in the building, people that are graduates, former instructors, and things like that. So it&#8217;s a mixed set of emotions.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited about what my next chapter looks like. I know that frees up some mental and emotional space, and also some time to do some other things. So in some ways I&#8217;m excited about that, but I&#8217;m going to miss that place. I&#8217;m going to miss my students. So it&#8217;s definitely been some emotional times, up and down, over the last six months or so.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at that time, because you not only were there as a teacher, but you were advising, especially along DEI and stuff like that, what feelings in particular come to mind? Are there any sort of memories that you have specifically about your time there?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, so many. I think the things that stand out most to me is, as a teacher, the thing that you want the most is to watch someone&#8217;s light bulb go off. And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, man, I get it now.&#8221; And I&#8217;ve seen that happen over the years in multiple ways. Sometimes it&#8217;s about a course that I&#8217;m teaching, sometimes it&#8217;s about the DEI training that I might be doing, or it might just be those life conversations that I have with my students. I just love connecting with the students more than anything else.</p>
<p>So many of those moments are the ones that I hold close where they trusted me to tell me something about their lives or to ask for advice. I was able to help them with something that really made a difference for them in their professional careers or their academic careers. Those are the things that I&#8217;m going to keep close to my heart, because those are the things that let me know that I was having impact and made it all worth it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you step back and just look at, I guess, Atlanta as, I don&#8217;t know, I guess you could say a design education city, I feel like over, I&#8217;d say maybe the past 20 or so years, I mean, we had Atlanta College of Art, and then that went away. Now, there&#8217;s The Creative Circus that&#8217;s going away. I&#8217;ve heard there&#8217;s been some changes at The Portfolio center, which I think it&#8217;s now just called Miami Ad School, I believe.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Mm-hmm. It is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you feel about just the state of design education in the city? I mean, I feel like we&#8217;ve had these specialized colleges for a while that taught them, and then over the years they&#8217;ve sort of changed and went away in some way.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah, lots of changes over the years. I think some of it&#8230; Well, one of the things, like you said, this is definitely a design education city. When I was on the board with AIGA, I was running the education committee, and we have seven design programs in metro Atlanta. That is unheard of for even most other metropolitan cities. So even the more niche schools that you&#8217;re talking about, there&#8217;s still, Georgia State has design programs, Georgia Tech has design programs, University of Georgia, which we kind of still count. There&#8217;s other schools as well that have designed programs even outside of The Portfolio School, and more specialized schools and things like that.</p>
<p>So it was just such a breadth of education in that space. I think that some of the changes are good. I think some of them are going to have some ripple effects. I think one of the things that has always been a struggle, and I think with the changes in the programs it&#8217;s going to add to it, is that even though so many people have been educated in design here in the city or around the city, they tend to not stay in the community for their professional pursuits.</p>
<p>They get their education in this space and then they move to another place. Which nothing is wrong with that, but that has been part of the challenge is trying to retain that talent here. Because I think sometimes, especially for those students who might move into the city specifically to go to school, they don&#8217;t necessarily always have time while they&#8217;re in school to dive into the creative communities here in a real way. So they only see the little bubble that&#8217;s created for them by their programs. So they don&#8217;t necessarily get a chance to see all that&#8217;s available and what the real Atlanta creative community looks like. So when it&#8217;s time for them to look for a job, they don&#8217;t always consider staying.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like there&#8217;s an ongoing trend in Atlanta about not being able to retain, or I would say appreciate creative talent.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Nope.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Not just in design, I&#8217;m thinking specifically about music, but music, art, design, I feel like that&#8217;s an ongoing thing, where, and I mean we&#8217;re speaking of the city as it&#8217;s a person, but I don&#8217;t know if the city appreciates what it has and what it cultivates here to the point where people would want to stay here. There&#8217;s been several musicians that have blown up elsewhere, but when they were here in Atlanta, nobody would give them a chance. I&#8217;ve certainly had folks on the show who were from Atlanta, and they may have gotten their education here, but they had to go elsewhere to find opportunities or to do big things.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had other Atlanta folks that are, I would say, other educators and other business folks to ask, like, &#8220;Why do you think that&#8217;s the case? What is it about Atlanta that&#8217;s not making these people want to stay? Is it the workforce?&#8221; I would imagine there are other factors, just cost of living and traffic and stuff like that. But I even think about when I was in my 20s, I definitely, at one point. Wanted to leave. I was like, &#8220;I feel like I&#8217;ve hit a ceiling.&#8221; This is well before I started Revision Path. But I was like, &#8220;I feel like I&#8217;ve hit a ceiling in my career. I don&#8217;t know where else I can go from here, unless I move away.&#8221; Maybe that&#8217;s what plays into it. I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I think there&#8217;s a lot of factors. I think some of them, you&#8217;ve already tapped into. The other side of it, my experience is a little different from yours. I came here for grad school. I came here to go to Portfolio Center, which is now Miami Ad School. And I was going to finish my two years and I was going to just leave it open. Where do I end up? I don&#8217;t know. But everything is wide open for me. And so by the time I graduated, I was actually looking at moving to Seattle, but I graduated in the middle of a recession. So I shot my book all over the country, and people are like, &#8220;We love your work, but we&#8217;re on a hiring freeze. We&#8217;re not hiring anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>So that meant that I ended up staying here. I mean, it took me a little longer to find a job and all those things. So I was like, &#8220;Well, I guess I&#8217;ll just stay here for a while.&#8221; And so I ended up getting my first design job here. And I think, honestly, that&#8217;s the best thing that could have happened for me. The other thing I&#8217;m aware of is that my situation also isn&#8217;t everybody else&#8217;s, is that because I&#8217;m independent and I&#8217;ve been independent for so long, I never really went through the process of trying to move up in a creative agency completely.</p>
<p>I worked in agencies. I worked in in-house. I&#8217;ve done a lot of those things, but on the short term, or I did them for a little while. And so I did a lot of that moving around in the beginning. But for the last 12 years, I&#8217;ve worked for myself. And so for all of the things that come along with being an independent creative, and there are many, both positive and negative, I think one of the biggest positives, and I can say this in hindsight now, is that there is no ceiling when you&#8217;re on your own. When you&#8217;re on your own, you create your own path, for better or for worse. You might make some mistakes. Whatever those things look like, you&#8217;re on your own. So I feel like, for me, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d have been able to do all of the things that are available to me now had I stayed in a traditional agency environment for my entire career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
And I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the truth for everyone else. I know other people have taken that path and it&#8217;s worked out extremely well for them. I don&#8217;t know if it would&#8217;ve for me, and it&#8217;s hard for me to know, because I don&#8217;t have the opportunity to do both. I did some in the beginning, and now I&#8217;m here, and I think everybody&#8217;s path is their own.</p>
<p>But I do think about that often. What would that have looked like? And would I have gotten to a place where I was like, okay, like you said, I have to move away if I&#8217;m going to move up, or I have to go do this if I&#8217;m going to move up or whatever those things look like? So I think it&#8217;s different for everybody, but the landscape of what it looks like for different people and what your personal commitments are, and what kind of lifestyle you want to live and all those things really play into whether this is a good fit for you or not.</p>
<p>But on the flip side, I do think that Atlanta is a lot of creatives here. And I do feel like it&#8217;s a very supportive, creative community. So I don&#8217;t know, like you said, if the city itself does everything that it can, but I feel like once you find your people here, I feel like that network is amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I agree. I agree 100%. Once you get into that niche and you find those folks, you find your tribe, your people, whatever you want to call it, there&#8217;s no limit to the things that you can even work on. And to speak to what you said earlier, I did have to leave. I had to leave where I was AT&#038;T, strike out on my own, and then that&#8217;s when I started to really&#8230; Well, first of all, I could never have pictured staying AT&#038;T. There are people who I used to work with back then in 2008 that are still there. God bless them, because it couldn&#8217;t be me, could not be me. I say that to say, though, I mean, everyone has their path, for some folks staying in that very comfortable, crucible of being a production designer, if that&#8217;s what they want to do, that&#8217;s what they want to do.</p>
<p>I just knew that I could do better than where I was at. And this is not a slight on the people that are still there, but I could do better. And I just didn&#8217;t know, when I think about Atlanta in 2008, I mean this is pre SCAD. This is pre a lot of larger tech companies setting up offices in such here.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
True.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
This is pre Uber and Lyft. I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a car. Where am I going to find a good job? I got to catch MARTA somewhere, it&#8217;s wild.&#8221; So now I think the city is definitely different in that aspect. We do attract a lot of people that want to come here for, I think, just creative art stuff in general, not just for maybe design. But over the past 10 years, we&#8217;ve really blown up with television and entertainment.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And that opens up a lot of roles in the creative space. So the environment here has just gotten a lot more rich since then.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Agree. Agree, wholeheartedly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now speaking of the sort of Atlanta community, you mentioned AIGA. I just want to congratulate you on your recent AIGA Fellow Award.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Such a great honor. AIGA, for those of you out there that don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s sort of the national body of professional organization for designers. And so we&#8217;ve got chapters all over the country. The Atlanta chapter has been active for a really long time. And each chapter has the opportunity to award fellow awards to people in their community that they feel have really moved forward the area of design or made impact on the local, regional, and national level.</p>
<p>And I think our chapter has honored 32 people, possibly. No, 16 people. It&#8217;s a very short list, so I was honored for 2021. We just had the celebration a couple months ago, because of the pandemic and everything. But I was given the honor in 2021. So that was a magical moment for me. It gave me an opportunity to really celebrate my community and celebrate all the things that I&#8217;ve been able to do and touch, and people that I&#8217;ve been able to meet in this community. So it was really a great night.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I&#8217;m glad that the community has come around you to recognize all of the great work that you&#8217;ve been doing, and to have their support for you. So that&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah, it was a great honor. It was a great honor.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now speaking of other projects, I see that you have this project called the Bella Boss Box. How did you come up with the idea for doing a subscription box?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
So we talked about having your people. I feel like, I don&#8217;t know about you, but my friends are the ones that always get me into stuff, especially my creative friends. They&#8217;re the ones that call you with a bright idea and be like, &#8220;So this is what I&#8217;m thinking.&#8221; So it was kind of similar to that. One of my good friends, Nekeidra Taylor, and actually we met through a client. A client of mine introduced me to her because she was like, &#8220;I think you guys should meet.&#8221; And so this was years ago. And so we&#8217;ve been friends and professional colleagues for a while.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s in public relations. And so during the pandemic, we hadn&#8217;t done our normal check-ins or have coffee here and there, kind of thing. And so we finally had a check-in call, and we were just catching up and talking. And we just ended up talking about our journeys as entrepreneurs and what the pandemic had been like and our support systems and things like that. And the fact that without those support systems, we wouldn&#8217;t have been able to do half of the things that we&#8217;ve been able to do.</p>
<p>And so from that conversation, we started thinking about what must it be like for people, especially women, who are starting businesses or running businesses who don&#8217;t have that support system. I think that I&#8217;ve been lucky, personally, because of my network and people who&#8217;ve introduced me to other people or just friends of mine who I&#8217;ve been friends with for a long time, but who are now also business owners as well. And even if your friends and your family support you in what you&#8217;re doing, and sometimes they won&#8217;t, sometimes they just won&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>But even if they do, if they&#8217;ve never done it before, they still don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s actually like. And so sometimes it helps to have someone that you can pick up the phone and call and ask a question, and feel like it&#8217;s a safe space to ask a question. Or to just vent and be like, &#8220;Look, I&#8217;m about to go work at Popeye&#8217;s.&#8221; That used to be mine when I was really frustrated with being an entrepreneur. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yep, I&#8217;ll just go and work at Popeye&#8217;s. I like chicken. It&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>And you need those people that you can call and say that, and they totally get it. You don&#8217;t have to explain it, you don&#8217;t have to do anything. They&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s that day, huh? Mm-hmm. So what happened?&#8221; And so that&#8217;s kind of how it was born. We talked about it and she&#8217;s like, &#8220;No, I think you should do&#8230;&#8221; We talked about a subscription box. How could we build a community of women that would be able to connect with each other in that way? So we came up with the idea for a subscription box, and I was like, That would be really cool.&#8221; And she&#8217;s like, &#8220;You should definitely do it.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, I should do it. Why, I got to do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>And so she&#8217;s like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time to do it.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not doing it if you&#8217;re not doing it.&#8221; And then next thing I know, we&#8217;re setting up an actual call to talk about it. And that was October 2020. And so we planned this whole thing and launched the whole thing during the pandemic. We launched in April 2021. We hadn&#8217;t seen each other in person until March 2021. So this was all done on Zoom, during the pandemic. Even though she lives here, we were still kind of staying away from everybody and stuff. So it was kind of crazy.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s been awesome. I feel like we&#8217;ve connected with some really amazing women all over the country who have a multitude of different types of businesses and things like that. And then just this summer we decided that we were going to pivot a little bit. The subscription box was going really well. As a designer, it was awesome. It gave me an opportunity to create things specifically for that community. We had a zine. I was designing products for the boxes, and I did all the branding for the boxes themselves, and all that stuff. And she&#8217;s in PR. She did a lot of the writing and things like that. So we really were a good fit to compliment each other.</p>
<p>But this summer we looked at everything and kind of like we tried to have those moments where we stop everything and start working on the business instead of in it. And okay, where are we? And where do we want to be? And we felt like the community part of it wasn&#8217;t getting as much shine as we really wanted. That was why we built this thing in the first place, so we decided to take a break and regroup and relaunch just the community.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re still kind of working on that. We&#8217;re taking a break. She&#8217;s busy. I&#8217;m busy. We both have separate businesses on top of this one. So we&#8217;ve decided to just take a break for a little while, really get grounded in what we want, and then relaunch again. Preferably, we want to do an online community so that we have a chance to provide deeper relationships for the women that are our subscribers. So that&#8217;s what we really want to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So you&#8217;re pivoting from the subscription box to an online community. So just sort taking that notion and deepening it, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yes, exactly. Exactly. Because I think what we heard from our subscribers was that they love the items in the box, and they love so much of that stuff and the magazine and all those things, but they really love the idea of being exposed to other women who were doing amazing things and hearing about people&#8217;s businesses. And we would do this series called Respect on Our Name. So we would do interviews with black women entrepreneurs on Instagram. So people really responded to those kind of things a little bit more than the items in the box. And so much of the stuff in the box was also about providing resources and information. So we felt like we could wrap that all up and also bring the community to a higher level if we pivoted a little bit. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re looking at doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you interviewed me back in 2018 for Design Observer, and during that interview you had asked me how passion projects have impacted my career. Now I want to flip the script and ask you that question. How have your passion projects impacted your career?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Lots of different ways. I think Bella Boss is definitely one of those passion projects. I probably would&#8217;ve done that even if it wasn&#8217;t a business. That&#8217;s just something I&#8217;m passionate about. I&#8217;m passionate about seeing Black women shine and succeed and women in general. And I think running a business has been such an adventure for me in so many ways. And I think that I know what it&#8217;s like even when you have support. I can&#8217;t imagine what it&#8217;s like when you don&#8217;t have support. So I always try to be that support or give people resources wherever I can. So I think Bella Boss is definitely something I would consider to be a passion project.</p>
<p>Mentoring is another passion of mine. Almost everything that I&#8217;ve done has come from something that holds a special place in my heart. Teaching is just more of mentorship for me. So mentorship and teaching are very much tied together. I&#8217;ve done a lot of public speaking, and I used to be terrified of public speaking. But the thing that shifted public speaking for me was looking at it as a bigger classroom. And because I love teaching so much, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, you just get a chance to share knowledge with more people.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I feel like those aspects of my career have come out of the passion of wanting to share with other people. Branding is so much about being creative and solving problems and all those kinds of things. And I think all of those things are core to my personality and core to the things that I care about.</p>
<p>One of the stories that I love the most about when I was a kid is that my mom told me that I used to love puzzles. And so she would buy me all these different puzzles. So because I had so many, I got to a point where I would literally dump all the pieces out in the middle of the floor and solve them all at one time. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s pretty much what I do every day. Mm-hmm. That&#8217;s pretty much the life that I&#8217;ve built for myself.&#8221; So when I think about things like that, I feel like all the things that I care about or that&#8217;s fun for me, or that&#8217;s interesting for me has been the foundation of every single thing that I do every day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How have you built your confidence over the years as a creative professional? I mean, you&#8217;ve been doing this for a very long time. That longevity obviously has to come from somewhere. What fuels you as a creative professional?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I try not to stop learning. As a teacher, I feel like you have to learn all the time. But even outside of that, I think I&#8217;ve always been naturally curious. And so for me, I want to ask more questions. I want to learn more. I want to talk to all the people that know the things that I don&#8217;t know. I want that, that&#8217;s what feeds me. And so I feel like confidence for me comes from knowledge and it comes from experience. And sometimes you have one without the other or vice versa, and then sometimes you have both. And I think over the years, I&#8217;ve just tried to learn as much as I possibly can on a day-to-day basis. And because of the years behind me, now I have the experience as well. But in the beginning, I didn&#8217;t have all the experience. I just had the knowledge and I had the willingness to learn.</p>
<p>And I think, if nothing else, I feel like those are the two things that has allowed me to grow the most and to be willing to take a chance. I can&#8217;t stress that enough. So many of the things that I&#8217;ve been able to do or that I&#8217;ve done that I can look back and be the most proud of are the things that terrified me in the beginning. If it doesn&#8217;t make me want to vomit a little bit when I say yes to it, then it is probably not going to make me grow. And so going back to our previous conversation just about being an independent and how that looks so different for me, I think the flexibility to try a bunch of new things and different things and to take on new challenges, I&#8217;ve had the flexibility to do that for the last 12 years, and I&#8217;ve taken full advantage of that.</p>
<p>If someone comes to me and says, &#8220;Hey, I really think you should do this thing.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never done that thing before. I don&#8217;t know much about that thing. Let me go learn some more about that thing and then decide.&#8221; And then if I decide, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s going to be a challenge, but I&#8217;m going to do it anyway.&#8221; I feel like that&#8217;s where all the growth comes from. And those are the things that have allowed me to be more confident. Not just because of what I already know, but because of the fact that I&#8217;m willing to take a chance and willing to take on the challenge.</p>
<p>I know that I&#8217;ve done that before and I didn&#8217;t die. And I made some mistakes, but most of the time it went pretty well. I&#8217;m like, that just gives me more confidence to do it again to something that&#8217;s unknown that I&#8217;ve never done before. I was just like, &#8220;Okay, I did that. Everything was fine. Okay, let&#8217;s try it again.&#8221; So I think so much of that is just taking chances too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Whose work are you inspired by right now?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, quite a few people. Some of them are visual, of course, and then some of them are just community-based kind of things. I love what Kenny Thacker is doing with a 100 Roses from Concrete in the advertising industry. I think the programming that they&#8217;re putting together and the resources that they&#8217;re providing for young Black people are just amazing.</p>
<p>Visually, I am a big fan of Bisa Butler and her work, and right now I just can&#8217;t get enough of it. My best friend bought me one of her coffee table books for Christmas, and it&#8217;s like one of my prize possessions right now. But I get inspiration from so many different places and I&#8217;m like discovering new people every day, truly every day. That&#8217;s why I tell my students all the time that I use social media as a curation tool.</p>
<p>So I usually don&#8217;t care how many people follow me, but on any of my platforms, if you go look at them, I probably follow three times more people than follow me, because I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Ooh, I want to see what this person is doing.&#8221; &#8220;Ooh, what is this person doing?&#8221; Ooh, I didn&#8217;t know about this artist. Let me follow them.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Ooh, that agency&#8217;s doing that. Let me follow them.&#8221; So I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;I just want all that good stuff coming in my feed when I log it on.&#8221; So I find new stuff and new people and new agencies and organizations and artists all the time. And that&#8217;s part of what feeds my creative process too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What haven&#8217;t you done yet that you want to do?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I want to travel the world. I do travel. I don&#8217;t travel as much as I would like to, but I would like to hit the majority of the countries before I leave this Earth, so that&#8217;s one thing. Another is I need to finish my book. I think the last time I was on with you, I might have talked about my book and it has been sitting in a dark closet for a long time. I did the first draft of it, and then I just kind of let it go. In retrospect, I think I might&#8217;ve just gotten scared and was like, &#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t do this.&#8221; But I definitely want to revisit it. I&#8217;m going to pick it up again. I still feel like the subject matter is important. I think it&#8217;s still relevant and I still want to do it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a book about branding, and I just feel like there&#8217;s not enough resources out there that make it plain what branding really is. And I think especially for entrepreneurs who are trying to build a brand and don&#8217;t know what that means, or even for individuals who are trying to build a brand for themselves and don&#8217;t know how to do that, I think that there&#8217;s a lot of insight, hopefully, that I can provide. So I definitely want to tackle that and get it back up and running. I just hate that I didn&#8217;t finish it, so it&#8217;s got to get finished.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I think if you go back and take a look at it, especially with all the knowledge you&#8217;ve gained now, you&#8217;ll probably see some things in there that you can update, that you can maybe add to-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
For sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; or something. So take your-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Definite change.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; time with it. Take your time with it. I mean, the thing with books, I mean, I&#8217;m finding this out myself as I&#8217;m working on a book, which I guess is a sort a scoop. I mean by the time this comes out, people will know that I&#8217;m working on a book about Revision Path. But-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Ooh, I&#8217;m excited.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve been working on a book about Revision Path and it has been a journey. Because at first I was like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, I&#8217;m going to do it about the show or whatever.&#8221; And I was talking to my editor and he is like, &#8220;No, you have to go deeper.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;There&#8217;s not really that much to it. I wanted to do the show, and I did the show.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;No, you have to go, go back further. Where did the seed start?&#8221; And it&#8217;s taken me all the way back to my childhood. It&#8217;s like a therapy session-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I love it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; trying to get through this book. I mean, I don&#8217;t know when it&#8217;s going to come out because I&#8217;m still working on&#8230; Well, one, I&#8217;m working on the proposal, but then just even all of the thought to go into how I&#8217;m going to approach the story and talk about it and everything, it&#8217;ll be good when it comes out. It&#8217;ll be sort of parts autobiography part about the show, but-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, man. That sounds awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; it&#8217;s a lot. It&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yes, it is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
It is a lot. And I think it is a major undertaking. So I feel like even when I started it several years ago, I told myself that even being willing to take on a project that big, is a victory, period.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Full stop.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; absolutely. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Regardless of what happens after that, that is a victory.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want the next chapter of your legacy to be?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
To be honest, I&#8217;m kind of leaving it up to the universe a little bit. I think part of this break that I&#8217;m taking is just about getting some rest and giving myself a chance to take a break and be able to hear my own voice about what I want next. The benefit of all the work and the thing, the people that I&#8217;ve been connected to and done stuff with and collaborated with, it&#8217;s such a blessing that I have several opportunities to do things next, but I want to make sure that I make the right move. I want to make sure that what I&#8217;m doing next is going to be fulfilling, that it&#8217;s going to allow me to grow, because that&#8217;s always something that I want. I never want to stop growing. So I&#8217;m really taking a break just so that I can hear my own voice and decide what&#8217;s next.</p>
<p>But also I&#8217;m taking my hands off of it a little bit and sort of letting things unfold the way that they should unfold. I think sometimes, and I&#8217;ve had to learn this the hard way, because sometimes I just want to plan everything, but so often when we try to make plans, the plans that we make are coming from our perspective. You can&#8217;t plan something that you don&#8217;t know about to some degree. But I think that sometimes you need to let there be some divine intervention, some universe to step in, because sometimes the things that we think we want next isn&#8217;t big enough, because we can&#8217;t see it yet.</p>
<p>And so I feel like I don&#8217;t know what it is, but in my heart, I feel like that&#8217;s where I am. I&#8217;m at that kind of space where it&#8217;s time for something big, but I don&#8217;t know what that thing is, yet. So I&#8217;m just going to center myself and take some time and figure out what that is. Branding Chicks, of course, will still be part of the equation, at least for now, but I feel like there&#8217;s so much more to do and so many more people to have fun with and create with. So I&#8217;m excited about whatever it ends up being, to be honest. I just don&#8217;t know all of what it is yet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I think that&#8217;s a good place to be though. To know that you have this possibility or all these possibilities ahead of you and just be excited for what that could be. That&#8217;s a great place to be, because a lot of folks are stuck if they don&#8217;t know what or whatever they think might be coming next is just more of the same thing. So to have that, I guess, opportunity to dream in that way, that&#8217;s priceless. That&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
You have to believe it first. That&#8217;s what believing really is, right? If it was already concrete and set in stone, then you don&#8217;t have to believe in it. It&#8217;s just there. So sometimes you have to just believe that it&#8217;s going to be great and that it&#8217;s coming and that it&#8217;s yours, and that you&#8217;re going to have what you&#8217;re supposed to have, period. I believe that. So I don&#8217;t know all of what that&#8217;s going to look like. I don&#8217;t know all the details, but I do believe that I&#8217;m going to have what I&#8217;m supposed to have and I think it&#8217;s going to be good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
You can check us out at brandingchicks.com. That&#8217;s where you can find all of my work there. And Bella Boss is bellabossbox.com. The site is on hiatus right now while we pivot, but you can still find us there. And also on social media, you can check out Branding Chicks, both on Instagram and Facebook, and for Bella Boss Box, also on Instagram, Facebook, and I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re on Twitter, no, but Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, Sounds good. Well, Nakita Pope, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I feel like every time that I see you, and I know that you and I haven&#8217;t seen each other in a while, because of-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; the pandemic, but every time I see you, you are such a just bright light of just like energy and positivity. And I know that the Atlanta community, of course, knows this, that&#8217;s why you have that AIGA Fellow Award. But when I think of somebody that is always such a positive, just, influence in the design community locally and otherwise, I think of you. So I&#8217;m just-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Thank you very much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; so glad that you&#8217;re still doing your thing. I&#8217;m excited to see what you come up with next. And thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you so much for that. And thank you for always supporting me. And I love these conversations, whether they happen on the podcast or not, where we&#8217;re just catching up. So thank you so much. I appreciate it.</p>
