Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>Azeez Alli-Balogun came highly recommended by several former guests, so I knew that a great conversation was going to happen. Azeez currently works as a lead product designer on the globalization team at Netflix, and he&#8217;s also a co-founder of <a href="https://www.designtodivest.com/" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Design to Divest</a>. But if you think that&#8217;s all there is to Azeez&#8217;s story, then think again!</p>
<p>We started off with a quick 2022 check-in, and then he talked about his plan to work on more Black-focused design projects, and also gave a glimpse at what it&#8217;s like working at Netflix. From there, Azeez spoke about growing up in Louisiana, becoming a jewelry designer, and how he transitioned into product design. We also spent some time talking about Design to Divest and Azeez shared what he wants the organization to accomplish in the future. Everyone has the power to make change with design, and Azeez is a prime example of this!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
My name is Azeez Alli-Balogun. I am a product designer at Netflix, a product design lead at Netflix on the globalization team. What that really entails is that we&#8217;re looking at how do we enable Netflix products and the content that we create to live in local markets, but also experience global audiences.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So I work a lot on the enterprise tools or the tools that help us create the subtitling assets, the dubbing assets, and all of those things that actually help our content become very, very locally resonant in local markets and local geographies, but also accessible to global audiences.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2022 been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been going really great. It&#8217;s interesting. We&#8217;re in the end of January, and it&#8217;s been incredibly productive, quite a lot of work that I&#8217;ve been doing in the beginning of the year. I&#8217;ve been invited to do a couple of different types of projects that I feel were very, very impactful. I think it&#8217;s just there&#8217;s so many seeds and so many things that have been planted in 2020 and 2021 that are starting to kind of blossom a little bit, which is both good and, also, I&#8217;m getting to a point where I need to make sure I&#8217;m prioritizing myself and my rest. I want to make sure that 2020 doesn&#8217;t lead to burnout for me with opportunities coming my way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything special in particular that you want to achieve this year?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I mean the biggest thing that I think is really focusing on some of the work that I&#8217;m doing with Design to Divest, but really starting to produce more content or areas in where people from marginalized backgrounds, particularly the Black communities and African communities and indigenous communities, to be able to access design differently, access learning differently, and be able to participate in the creation of the world that we live in through their own cultural knowledge base.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So that type of work is something that I&#8217;m looking to start to really tangibilize in more meaningful ways. So I&#8217;m pretty hopeful that with all of the work that I&#8217;m doing and the projects and the communities that I&#8217;m a part of, that I&#8217;ll be able to create these platforms that allow or bring in more Black, African, and indigenous creatives to the forefront of creating some of the institutions that are going to shape the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, let&#8217;s talk about the work that you&#8217;re doing at Netflix. You&#8217;re the product design lead for the globalization team there. Now, you mentioned what you&#8217;re doing has to do with subtitles and dubbing. I can only imagine probably after the success of titles like Squid Game and Lupin and stuff that you probably have had a lot on your plate. But tell me more about the work that you do.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s a lot of stakeholder management. So it&#8217;s interesting in the sense that the team that I&#8217;m working on really crosses so much of what Netflix does. It&#8217;s an integral part to growth. As Netflix grows our global subscriber base and grows into global markets, it&#8217;s incredibly important that we&#8217;re effective in the way that we localize our content as we start to even increase the volume of content that we produce, the volume of film and the volume of movies, and really trying to create platforms for different geographical spaces outside of Hollywood to be able to share their stories.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So a lot of the work is when you go into Netflix and you&#8217;re able to see the option to choose 20 different subtitles or watch things in dubbing, all of that stuff is work that I&#8217;m directly impacting and the team that I work on directly impacts. We&#8217;re working with linguists. We&#8217;re working with project managers. We&#8217;re working across the board with so many different types of stakeholders to ensure that there is quality attached to the subtitles and the dubbing and that if a director in Nigeria creates a television show or a movie, that same movie can be enjoyed by somebody in Swedish and it doesn&#8217;t lose a lot of the cultural nuances that represent how that content or how that TV show or film was created.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s a heavy task because it&#8217;s very difficult to even measure things, like what is a good subtitle? What is a good dubbing or voiceover? Can we make sure that we are staying true to the content? Because when you think about different languages, it&#8217;s very, very &#8230; If you&#8217;re lucky enough to be able to speak multiple languages, then you know that there are certain nuances and certain kind of things that just don&#8217;t translate.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
You want to be able to translate those cultural nuances so people start to really understand what it actually means to experience the culture that that film or that television show or those characters are actually situated in. So there&#8217;s a lot of really trying to figure out how do we communicate, also creating a lot of the workflows that allow our stakeholders, the project managers internally at Netflix with the linguists and the other vendors that we use in order to create all of these assets, how do we allow them to do this work very, very effectively and at the volume and scale of the amount of content that we produce on a yearly basis?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So talk to me more about the team. What does the makeup look like?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a typical product team. I mean you have your designers. I lead a particular area of the globalization design side. I have two other design partners who are also design leads in other areas. I work with a product manager, and I&#8217;m in constant contact with the globalization project managers and program managers as well as vendors and linguists in order to really understand what is necessary and how to create the best conditions for their workflows to be successful in delivering on the subtitling and dubbing and other localization assets.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So the core team is I&#8217;ll have my UI front end team and backend team designer and me, as a designer, project manager. We&#8217;re the core product team building out all of the tools. And then we&#8217;re in constant communication with the project managers, the vendor managers, the linguists who are actually authoring and creating a lot of the subtitling and localization assets in order to ensure that we&#8217;re providing the tools that are really supporting their workflows in a positive way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So Netflix has linguists that are doing the translating, I mean as they&#8217;re listening through to the content and making sure that those subtitles, like you said, are kind of accurate to the plot, culturally accurate, et cetera.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean there&#8217;s a whole process there of subtitle authoring. I can&#8217;t get too deep into lots of that stuff because I think it&#8217;s one of the things that does set Netflix apart from some of the other services that you might encounter, the level of detail that we go into trying to create good subtitles. There&#8217;s a lot of experimentation and things that we&#8217;re doing right now in order to enable that process to be better for our members.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I remember when Squid Game had come out and there had been some kind of talk about like, &#8220;Oh, well, if you&#8217;re watching Squid Game, don&#8217;t watch it with subtitles because the subtitles aren&#8217;t right,&#8221; or something like that. Or no, it wasn&#8217;t the subtitles. It was the dubbing, I think, one of those two things. But I mean I can imagine even with a show like that, there&#8217;s still going to be some sort of cultural differences or things like that that get lost in translation.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean that&#8217;s exactly right. I mean there&#8217;s always going to be some dissonance. We&#8217;re always testing things out to try to get it right. I think the one thing that&#8217;s really great about the culture at Netflix and how we go about designing and building product is we experiment in order to figure out how we can learn and improve and constantly improve. So if we don&#8217;t get something right the first time, it&#8217;s a learning experience for us. We take all of that feedback and use it to ensure that we&#8217;re doing better as we move forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does an average day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Average day? I try to segment a little bit of my days or my week. Some days I load up with meetings, so I&#8217;m meeting with engineers and my product manager partner and other stakeholders. And then other days, I create that space for me to kind of just work and I&#8217;m designing and creating different concepts that are related to the conversations that I&#8217;ve been having, so kind of going through the whole design process, but in very, very short cycles.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It&#8217;s not spending three months or two weeks or just doing nothing but research, but do longer cycles of discovery research on a particular area that we&#8217;re trying to improve operational efficiency on and then take that, summarize that research into some opportunities, create some concepts behind that, and then start to socialize that with engineering and product in order to start to tweak and do more of &#8230; I try to do much more co-creation, co-designing with the stakeholders, the engineers, and product all together.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That way the decisions that are being made are made with the right amount of input from the different internal stakeholders that influence how the product actually tangibilizes itself. So my typical days typically would be I have some times where I&#8217;m dedicated. I need time to intake all the information that I&#8217;ve gotten and then start to visualize that into some sort of concept.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
And then a lot of the times, I am taking those concepts in meetings and doing a lot of co-design in order to fulfill requirements and understand what the needs are directly with both the users and then my product stakeholders as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the most challenging part about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Stakeholder management maybe. The reason that I would say that is when I think about the idea of complexity, what really makes anything complex is that you have a bunch of different competing priorities that happen at scale. So being able to really clearly align all the different priorities that are happening from different parts of the process and different stakeholders into something that works, I think, is the most difficult part because I&#8217;m also constantly listening and observing what people are saying, what people are doing, and then trying to translate that down into a language that can be understood by everyone who is involved.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
As you know, it&#8217;s interesting as we talk about language and linguistics, not only in different languages. There are different languages within different industries. There are different languages within different professions. So everyone might have a different way of communicating the same thing. Oftentimes, you can be in meetings where people are trying to communicate an idea or a concept with the language of their own profession.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So engineers might be communicating things in a certain way that&#8217;s different from product. That&#8217;s also slightly different from the way that the type of language that design would use to communicate something. And then our end users are using a different type of language and trying to wrangle all of those different concepts and in the way that people are trying to express what it is that they&#8217;re trying to think of in a way that everyone&#8217;s aligned on and everyone kind of understands.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That&#8217;s where I feel like a lot of the true power of design comes because once you start to take the language and start to visualize things, then people can have something to have an opinion about. They can have something to kind of analyze and say, &#8220;That&#8217;s not it,&#8221; or, &#8220;That is it,&#8221; or, &#8220;It&#8217;s this and this. Add this or that or the other.&#8221; But bringing life to the words that are being said by all of the people in the room and then allowing people to kind of mold what&#8217;s been created to make sure that everyone&#8217;s voices is really being heard.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I would imagine language and linguistics probably influence a lot of the design work in general, right?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean just really trying to understand the nuances of it and how those nuances can be misinterpreted because, as you know, a misinterpretation of even body language or a language or just a word or a concept can have dire consequences. So it&#8217;s important operationally as well as it is tangibly when we&#8217;re trying to create the product and making sure that the things that we create are very, very clear and transparent.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Netflix, it&#8217;s been an interesting place working. It&#8217;s been the most different place that I&#8217;ve worked at in my career because of the culture. The culture at Netflix is very unique. As I mentioned a little bit before about the experimentation culture of just trying to do things to learn, to get feedback, and then course correct. That also kind of goes into how we&#8217;re managed as employees. There&#8217;s a lot of the idea of freedom and responsibility and then the culture of feedback. All of those feed into the way that we&#8217;re able to work and the way that we&#8217;re able to kind of explore different areas of our profession in ways that we may have been restricted in other organizations.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So I think that that&#8217;s a huge part that I typically really enjoy at Netflix and enjoy working with a bunch of other people who have similar mindset of growth and discovery and learning. It really shows through whenever we&#8217;re able to create, learn from the products and the things that we create, and prove it for our members.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. That&#8217;s pretty cool. It sounds like Netflix does give you that freedom. I know there&#8217;s some companies of people whom I would love to interview, but they have a strict embargo on their employees cannot do podcasts or anything like that. So it&#8217;s good that at least they let you all be able to talk about your work and do other things freely.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean it&#8217;s definitely encouraged, but I mean there&#8217;s definitely tons of stuff that we can&#8217;t say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I walk a line a lot of times trying to make sure that &#8230; Because there&#8217;s so much transparency at Netflix and I think that that&#8217;s one of the really great parts of the culture at Netflix is that, as an employee there, the leadership from the top down is always going to be as transparent as possible. But with that comes responsibility of we&#8217;re letting you know all of this information. We don&#8217;t expect you to go out and tell the world all of the secrets and things. This is internal information that we are providing you context so you&#8217;re able to really do your job to the best of your ability. We don&#8217;t want to hide things from you.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
But it comes with a lot of responsibility, that level of transparency and that level of trust that our leaders kind of put in us as contributors to the mission that the company is trying to achieve.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Gotcha. I&#8217;m curious to learn more about you, your particular origin story. Tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Both of my parents are from Nigeria, and I was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. So I grew up in Louisiana. I spent most of my childhood in Louisiana and went there to high school. I went to Southern University when I graduated high school for a couple of semesters before switching over to design and going to University of Louisiana at Lafayette. But growing up, I wouldn&#8217;t have thought of myself as being a designer. I wasn&#8217;t exposed to it in that way. I mean my dad was in school for architecture, so I was exposed to that.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
But the ideas of industrial design or other aspects of design weren&#8217;t really things that came across. I played basketball, growing up. I was more interested in trying to go to the NBA than I was with anything else. But I was also an avid reader. I read quite a lot, and I did a lot of writing, drawing. So there was always that creative aspect, but I imagined myself going into medical school rather than design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So when you went to University of Louisiana at Lafayette though, you ended up majoring in industrial design. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean that was really the reason that I left Southern University because they didn&#8217;t have an industrial design program. So initially, whenever I was in school, my intention was to be a pediatric surgeon. Actually, I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to study biomedical engineering and then go to medical school to be a pediatric surgeon.&#8221; That was my intention. At the time, too, biomedical engineering was a fairly new field of study within the higher education to where if you really wanted to do that, you had to get a master&#8217;s degree.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So while I was at Southern University, I needed to kind of create a curriculum for myself, working with my engineering faculty. I was doing mechanical engineering and double majoring in cellular molecular biology. But after a while, I was just like, &#8220;Something about this is not really what I want to do. I would love to create the medical tools and the medical devices. I&#8217;d love to design those things.&#8221; But it was just something that just didn&#8217;t feel right in terms of the education for me while I was in engineering.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I started doing some research. Maybe I might like automotive design. Through that, I found what industrial design was, and I was like, &#8220;Whoa. With this field, I can actually design medical devices. I can actually go and design prosthetic legs and all of these different things that I was interested in kind of creating.&#8221; That&#8217;s how I found University of Louisiana at Lafayette because that was the only school in Louisiana, at the time, that had an industrial design program. So I ended up going there and studying industrial design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So you kind of, I guess, looked at another way to get into the medical field then by looking at industrial design.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So in your early post-grad career after you left school, you ended up going into jewelry design. I&#8217;m curious. What drew you to that?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It wasn&#8217;t anything that really drew me. It was literally I graduated shortly after a recession in Louisiana. There were no jobs, really. It was really difficult to get a design job, especially in the South, in Louisiana. So really, what happened was that my portfolio was a bunch of &#8230; It was pediatric medical tools and prosthetics and stuff like that. The jewelry company, which had a connection to some of our professors at University of Louisiana, looked at my work and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;We really like your aesthetic visually. You have a really good sense of style and taste,&#8221; even looking at the medical tools, the medical stuff that I designed.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That&#8217;s literally how I jumped into jewelry design. I was interested in fashion. I was interested in design in general, but I wasn&#8217;t intending to go be a jewelry designer. If anything, I would have wanted to go to do something in footwear design at Nike because that would have merged a lot of the biomechanics and technical medical things that I was thinking about in terms of design with human performance. So yeah. Jewelry design just kind of came about. It was an opportunity that kind of came about, but it really allowed me to start to understand what it meant to design for things that were going to be worn on people&#8217;s bodies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That makes sense. How long were you a jewelry designer?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I was there for about two to two and a half years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It was quite an interesting experience, but even though while I was there &#8230; This is also the field of user experience design or a lot of the digital product design, all of that stuff. That was still fairly in its infancy. So even while I was there, I participated in some things, some interface things that were very interesting. From there, after I left that company, I wanted to discover what is it that I really wanted to do, but I also needed to look at where the market was going.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Industrial design jobs weren&#8217;t en masse. A lot of these jobs that when you&#8217;re designing physical things, they don&#8217;t have incredibly large teams. Just seeing the digital world kind of pick up, I started to make some pivots over into really learning that particular skillset, branched off to try to do a little bit of my own freelance work, both as an industrial designer. But then what I found was that I was getting more clients, more people looking for branding and web development and more digital kind of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That&#8217;s kind of how I ended up pivoting or going to grad school to learn really more of a service design kind of method to incorporate both to be more agnostic about what my skillsets delivered and more focused on what the outcome needed to be of whatever it is that a client or somebody wanted to create.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good way to put it in terms of trying to be more agnostic because what I&#8217;m hearing, and you can please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong here, it sounds like you were just trying to find where you were going to fit in. You&#8217;ve graduated. You have these design skills. While there certainly were things that you wanted to do in terms of design, those opportunities just weren&#8217;t available. So you were trying to see what could maybe your skills transfer into.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean I think that that&#8217;s a good characterization. I&#8217;m a person who is always ready to adapt to a situation. I have my core values and principles that I&#8217;m going to stay in those, and I&#8217;m not going to allow my value set and my principles to be swayed. But those principles aren&#8217;t rigid outcomes. They just help guide me in terms of the decisions that I need to make in life. But at the same time, I don&#8217;t create a level of rigidity to what it is that I can be and what it is that I can do.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Because it in the same way of when you&#8217;re designing a product or a service for someone or for people or a community, you need to allow it to be what it needs to be rather than always trying to force it into being something that you envisioned from the beginning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, when did you decide to go to grad school? Was that during this time as well?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. That was during this time. I was looking at a handful of schools. I was looking at Pratt, RISD. I almost went to SCAD for the service design program because I had a friend who I was in undergrad with who was there, and he told me it was a great program. Service design&#8217;s still kind of a fairly newer field in design in the United States. It&#8217;s still catching on. You&#8217;re starting to see it more so now than it was years ago. I mean it&#8217;s definitely been something that&#8217;s far more developed in Europe than it has been in the United States. That&#8217;s just a reflection of the market and how we view the utility of design here at organizations.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Hearing the service design methods and methodologies, that was very interesting to me, and I was ready to go to SCAD. But also, another friend of mine who I was in undergrad with had mentioned ArtCenter to me before, and I really liked the rigor that ArtCenter placed on developing your technical skills and the level of polish that a lot of the portfolios and a lot of the students had the capacity for after graduating from ArtCenter. And then also, ArtCenter had this program with the Drucker School of Management where the graduate industrial design program also could be a dual MBA degree.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Once I got there, I didn&#8217;t see the usefulness not necessarily in an MBA because I did take MBA classes at UCLA. I do see a benefit in that, but I didn&#8217;t see the benefit for that particular school that ArtCenter was partnering with. So I didn&#8217;t actually go forward with that, though it was a decision that I made to go to ArtCenter in the first place because that option was available.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
While you were there, you also managed to work on an internship which let you transition into product design, right?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I did a couple of internships there. The education, too, in grad ID, the name can be misleading because it&#8217;s industrial design. But really a lot of the training was for us to be innovation leaders, to be able to come in and really understand what the business needs are for a company and help them pivot into creating products and services that now are able to accommodate the changing landscape. So we would routinely have different companies come in. This is part of the ArtCenter education where different companies come in and do these studio projects.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
We did one with Uber whenever I was in maybe my fourth semester or something like that, where Uber was creating their Uber Air platform. We worked in groups with other students from other departments. So we had transportation designers, automotive designers, as well as interaction designers, in addition to us in graduate industrial design and worked with some of the key executives for that particular unit doing the Uber Air. Our task was really to design what that whole experience would be if we were to create air taxis.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
If Uber were to go into this business, how do we start to visualize what that whole experience would be, all the way from understanding what the airport security type situation would be to what is the interior of the electric vertical landing takeoff vehicle going to be, all the way to really understanding the market. So if you create this type of service, well, who are going to be the people to use this service and who are going to be the early adopters all the way down to the late adopters in order to get this service off of the ground?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So it was a pretty involved project that took a whole semester where we built life-sized mock-ups to test out what the interior of the vehicle could be and could look like. We did a lot of architectural design and sketches to understand where would we create and put some of these what we call sky ports, which would be the airports for people to access these vehicles, designing also how would we implement or integrate this into the existing application, so if somebody wanted to catch an Uber Air vehicle. So it was a pretty involved project that spanned the scope of a bunch of different design skills from automotive design to interaction design to industrial design and whatnot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Kind of sounds like a air taxi, in a way.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Exactly. It was an air taxi. There&#8217;s so many different nuances in terms of what that whole experience could or would be. And also, there are limitations to the technology that existed at the time, still even to right now. A lot of that technology is still being developed in a way that could make it really feasible and economical to launch a service like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I would imagine also even just getting FAA certification because, unlike something like UberX where anyone that has a driver&#8217;s license can drive, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean anyone with a pilot&#8217;s license, I would imagine, would do Uber Air or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. There&#8217;s definitely some technical and some licensing, piloting things there, especially, also, I mean you&#8217;re thinking about just air traffic control as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, that&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I mean that&#8217;s been there for a while. There&#8217;d be some adjustments and things that would need to be made in order to allow for another set of vehicles to be in the air.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So after you graduated from ArtCenter College of Design for grad school, you ended up working at a couple of other places before Netflix. You worked at a biotech company called Script Health. So you, I guess, in a way managed to get around to doing some work in the medical field, even in this sort of roundabout way. But then you also worked at IBM working on products on their data, AI, and cloud integration teams. When you look back at those two experiences specifically, what do you remember the most?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It was interesting because with Script Health, one of my friends who&#8217;s a pharmacist, that was his startup that he was creating. I was actually working on that while I was in grad school and helping him really design and bring to life the vision of that product and that service that he was trying to create. So I won&#8217;t go too deep into it, but the gist of that really was building out a service to deal with the opioid epidemic and providing the right type of medication for overdoses, things like naloxone, to places in rural communities.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a huge lack of access to the right types of drugs and services in the most marginalized communities or the most affected communities. And then that learning, kind of taking a product from zero to one, the amount of work and effort that it takes to do the research and then finding a market fit, pivots and things that need to happen, partnerships that need to be made and created, and then visualizing the concept and telling the story and the narrative in a way that is going to inspire and communicate what it is about.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That was also a crash course for me, really working with engineers as well as working with outside agencies that were taking my design work and starting to code it into something and really understanding what are the specific things that I need to communicate in order to make sure that what I do design ends up being the thing that gets created and it not being some kind of mangled version of that because there are details that I left out or things that I didn&#8217;t communicate that they just had to make a decision on, and it may not be the right decision.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
When it comes to IBM, the thing that I learned at IBM really was a lot of stakeholder management and also a lot of leadership skills, what it means to manage up, as well as how to align people and influence people around a shared objective and a shared goal and then trying to get things done within a short period of time. I feel like those were some of the key things. I mean I can dive really deep into aspects of that, but I think those were the main things that I&#8217;ve learned.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Working with people, I think, is an incredibly important part of being a designer, and understanding how to do that effectively, I think, is something that it takes a lot of designers a lot of time to really understand what it actually means to do that beyond just your hard technical skills.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, another thing that you sort of created that came about while you were at ArtCenter was Critical Discourse in Design. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. That happened while I was at IBM. So this was after my graduate program. I still have a lot of really great connections with a lot of the faculty at ArtCenter. After the murder of George Floyd, there was just a lot of energy around something needs to be done. I&#8217;m in the design community. Think about racism. When we think about prejudice, when we think about all of the things, these institutions that are perpetuating these things, they are designed institutions. They&#8217;re created.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
For me, in addition to, okay, well, protesting is one thing. But based off of my own skillsets and my own proximity to the type of work and things that I do, how can I start to impact or influence the change that I want to see in the world? So I started these conversations with some of my friends who are still faculty at ArtCenter to try to uncover what is something that we can do. We didn&#8217;t really have an idea of what it was going to be.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
But through the conversations and through a lot of the things that I was talking about in terms of how &#8230; A quote that I constantly say is that, &#8220;Design is the invisible hand that shapes all lived experience.&#8221; So Critical Discourse in Design came about when we started really thinking about when you think about oppression, oppression needs physical tools and objects. It needs a physical space. It needs to be designed.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So when you think about you can go throughout history and you can look at what are the tools or the innovations of oppression? A noose, a prison cell, all of these different things. So if you can design for oppression, then you can design for liberation. Critical Discourse in Design came about like, &#8220;Well, what does that conversation of designing for liberation, what does that actually mean? How do we start to translate theory into action? And then who are the voices that we need to bring to the table in order to be able to have these conversations?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Because when you think about the design industry, also where the Black designers is calling out is the 3% or 4%, depending on who you ask, of the people who are designers are Black. So the voices that are the most impacted by the things that are being created in the world are not at the table to voice how they feel things should be. They&#8217;re not able to provide their cultural intelligence to the institutions and the systems and the tools and the things that get created in the world.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So Critical Discourse in Design really was a response to that. It was really a response to how do we start to now bring in these voices and also to leave people not with just new words and new theories, but a theory that can turn into practice and really starting to understand what the connection between pedagogy, what people are learning, is with practice, how people create, how people experience and actually deliver things into the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, let&#8217;s talk about Design to Divest, which it sounds like came out of Critical Discourse in Design. Tell me about that. I know you&#8217;re one of the founding members of this collective. We&#8217;ve also had another member of the collective on the show before, Michael Collett. But yeah. Talk to me about Design to Divest.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. While I was actually creating Critical Discourse in Design, one of my really close friends who was working with part of Design to Divest messaged me and said, &#8220;Hey, do you have some capacity to join the steering committee here? This is what we&#8217;re doing.&#8221; So I joined Design to Divest. At the time, it was really meant to mobilize design skills and different designers, to mobilize those design skills around social impact projects. It was very like graphic design-based.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So I think part of what I was doing whenever I joined the team was really thinking about what Design to Divest actually meant as a concept, and what are the most impactful ways that we can create positive change or the change that we want to see in the world? That started over the past two years that we&#8217;ve been just having these discussions and doing projects and working on things to manifest into a version of what it is today, where we have a lot of things that we&#8217;re going to be releasing this year, hopefully, and that really talks about what it means to divest the inequitable systems that have been designed and created in the world. How do we start to celebrate and design for the communities on the margins?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean I think that came about at such a monumental time, during the summer that you mentioned where, of course, there were people out in the streets that were protesting against police brutality. You talked about the murder of George Floyd. Again, it seems like this was a time when a lot of people were really looking for this kind of thing. They were looking to hear from Black voices, but also just looking for ways that they can, I guess, channel whatever frustrations they had into something more positive.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. Not to say that that time still isn&#8217;t happening now, but [crosstalk 00:45:33]-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah. We&#8217;re still in it very much. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
We&#8217;re very much in it, but it was reaching fever pitches. It wasn&#8217;t just in the United States, it was globally. Me being Nigerian and seeing with SARS and the protests that were happening in Nigeria, the protests that were happening in South America, things happening in Brazil, it was everywhere, where you started to see people were really fed up with the institutions and the things that were meant to serve them. But people were just like, &#8220;Nothing is actually serving any of us, and nothing is serving us in a way that&#8217;s going to provide any level of comfort or any level of support. It&#8217;s actually doing the opposite.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So I think Design to Divest became, especially for designers, because I think so many designers get into design feeling that they can change something or that there&#8217;s some sense of positivity that they can use design to affect, but no one ever tells them how. And then it typically falls flat with very altruistic ideas that really don&#8217;t connect back to impact. It just connects back to some sense of moral I don&#8217;t want to say superiority, but just a sense of moral reflection that you did a project that did something, but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily connect back to impact.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I think with the idea of Design to Divest, we really want to give people a path to connect the things that they do to the impact that they want to see in the world, the impact that they want to see in institutions, and the impact that they want to see in the different products and tools and experiences that we experience in the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, speaking of that impact, given now that the collective has gone on now, what? I guess this will be your second year of going into things?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you want to see Design to Divest accomplish?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Quite a lot over time. But I think about education is a really core thing in terms of &#8230; One of the things that we&#8217;ve identified, too, is that there&#8217;s so many designers on the margins, designers of color, but particularly Black and indigenous designers who don&#8217;t have access to any type of content or education that teaches design in a way that validates their culture, in a way that validates their identity, in a way that celebrates the cultural intelligence of their heritage towards the creation of the things that exist in the world.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
When you look at design, the canon of literature and text that&#8217;s being taught to designers all are from European white men, and so there&#8217;s always a cultural disconnect. Essentially, what it does is informs people getting into design that you need to either erase your culture and assimilate into this culture if you want to find success in this profession because your culture is devalued or isn&#8217;t valued as a producer of good design, if you call something good design.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So part of what my hopes for Design to Divest is to really provide that platform, on one hand, for Black and indigenous designers to be able to have content and community to engage with around design that validates their identity, that validates their cultural heritage, and then that brings them to the table of creation. I feel like the world is a group project and, typically, only a select group of communities and culture have gotten to participate in creating the institutions, organizations, and business that shape the lived experiences for all of us.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s time that we create this space of ownership. I think this is what equity means, ownership and creation, and stop blocking these communities that are on the margins, Black, indigenous communities from participating in the creation and the stewardship of the world. I think that I want Design to Divest to be that platform that allows Black and indigenous communities to harness their ability to design through their own cultural intelligence, to create and populate the institutions and things in the world that are going to serve our communities.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the people that inspire you?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a tough question because I&#8217;m typically just inspired by people, in general. I&#8217;m inspired by culture, in general. Obviously, I&#8217;m inspired by my family, by my parents, aunts, and uncles, especially coming from Nigeria, making a way for themselves as expats into the United States and balancing multiple cultures. I&#8217;m also inspired by other designers, other creators, but also other people in other professions. I constantly draw inspiration from economists, from lawyers, from doctors in the way that they approach the work that they do.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I can say, as of late, too, I&#8217;ve been inspired by people like Andr√© Leon Talley and Virgil, who both passed, but seeing the impact that they&#8217;ve had. You can see that by the outpouring of support and the outpouring of responses that people have to their passing. To have that level of impact on community, I think, is also something that&#8217;s incredibly inspiring to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to somebody that is looking to enter into the design field? Because it sounds like, with your career, you&#8217;ve managed to really take that and apply it across a number of different facets of design and, even now, you&#8217;re still kind of paying that forward with the work you&#8217;re doing in Netflix, but also with this community work through Design to Divest. So if someone&#8217;s listening to this and this is inspiring them to want to get into design in some sort of way, what would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I mean one of the most important things, as a designer, is to be curious. I think that one thing that I would tell people is you just kind of have to do it. There&#8217;s so many people who are going to have something to say about whatever it is that you do. It&#8217;s also kind of that&#8217;s the idea of design is that whenever you design, there&#8217;s a difference between art and design in a sense, whereas design is really not meant for yourself. Design is outward. It&#8217;s meant to be critiqued by the people that you&#8217;ve created it for. So you can&#8217;t wait for perfection.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I think I would tell people that they have to just go out and do it. But another one of the most important things, too, is that design is a very community-driven profession. I think that it&#8217;s not done in isolation. I think that that&#8217;s in contrast to the way that we were taught about design. We were always taught about these individual people who are design heroes, whether it&#8217;s Dieter Rams or Frank Gehry or whatever. They&#8217;re not doing these things alone as individual people. They have a network of people. They&#8217;re talking to people.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
They are influenced by people, and they are finding different people who is inspiring to them to communicate with and also build with. So one of the most important things is to constantly seek out the people who are doing things that you find interesting and try to have a conversation with them and try to build your own communities, because that&#8217;s going to be the path forward for you finding the opportunities to design the things that you want to design, to create the things that you want to create and with the people that you want to create.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
And then lastly, too, I would also say is that you really want to start from a place of purpose. So if you don&#8217;t really have a purpose yet or you haven&#8217;t identified what that is, definitely just take some time to think about it. As everything, it could be an iteration. Your purpose whenever you were 16 could be different when you&#8217;re 24 or 50. But having a sense of purpose and principles to back that purpose then allow you to make decisions a lot easier. It gives you something to filter the opportunities that come your way with something that means something more to you than just existing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work would you like to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I&#8217;m doing a lot of the work that I want to be doing in combination with Design to Divest and some of the freelance projects that I&#8217;ve been working on as well. But I think more of that work, more of the work that I&#8217;m doing with Design to Divest, more of the creating the platforms, creating archives and things who are Black and indigenous designers to be able to participate in the creation of the world. Also, I mean I do quite a lot of mentorship.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So I&#8217;d love to be able to build careers and create more pathways for designers from other marginalized communities, including Black communities and other marginalized communities to have a pathway to create. So I see within the next five years, continuing to grow and scale the impact that I&#8217;m able to have on the design community from both a pedagogical, educational standpoint as well as a practice and people standpoint.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So when I think about the practice, it&#8217;s really illustrating to both the business and design world that you want to be able to take &#8230; What it really means to be diverse and to harness diversity for innovation is being able to take the different cultural knowledge systems that exist, where there&#8217;s the aboriginal system of knowledge, the African system of knowledge, and being able to apply that to the problems that you&#8217;re facing as a society or in your particular company, reframing the problem underneath those systems of knowledge, and then allowing those systems of knowledge to be able to deliver on solutions for you.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So doing work that allows me to bring more of those different systems of knowledge and those different diverse perspectives into the creation of things, and then on the people side of just continuing to bring more of those people who are holders of that knowledge, the descendants of African people from different African cultures who hold that knowledge or indigenous people, Native people, and providing a platform for them to use that knowledge that&#8217;s been passed down to them to design and create things that make the world a better place.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and your work and all your projects and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I try to not be so visible online all the time. They can find me on my Instagram, Azeez_Alli. In the near future, we&#8217;ll be releasing a new website for Design to Divest where they can check out some of that work that I&#8217;m doing. If anyone wants to chat with me or anything like that, they can always shoot me a message on LinkedIn. I definitely try to respond to people who reach out to me and might not be immediate, but definitely something that I&#8217;m open to chatting more and more with people who resonate with some of the things that I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Azeez Alli, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show, one, of course, for telling your story about how you got into design. But I think it&#8217;s really important, especially now, as a lot of people are really looking at the work they do and try to figure out how it can make an impact in the world, I think the way that you&#8217;re taking your design knowledge and, one, how you&#8217;ve been able to apply it to different parts of design, but then, two, also using it in a way to pay it forward to the community is something that is super important.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hope that we get to see a lot more of that in the future. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. Thank you so much for having me.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in the know about the DC design scene, then this week&#8217;s guest probably needs no introduction. Reece Qui√±ones is a force for good when it comes to design, whether it&#8217;s in her role at The Hatcher Group as executive VP and creative director, or by teaching the next generation of designers as an adjunct professor at George Mason University. And she doesn&#8217;t stop there!</p>
<p>Reece talked to me about an average day for her at The Hatcher Group, and talked about growing up in DC and being exposed to architecture and art at a young age. She also spoke on her work experiences before The Hatcher Group, and gave some great perspective about being a long-time design educator, including what she feels design students want from the design industry these days. As a designer, you can never stop learning, and Reece Qui√±ones is a prime example of how you can use your skills to give back to your community!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Hello. My name is Reece Qui√±ones, and I&#8217;m the Executive Vice President and Senior Creative Director for Hatcher, a PR marketing and design firm in the DC area. I&#8217;m also an Adjunct Professor of Design at George Mason University located in Fairfax, Virginia.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2022 been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been great. Very, very busy. We ended 2021 with a bang, and I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s almost the end of January already. It just seems like it&#8217;s flying by, but it&#8217;s been very good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. You and I talked about this before recording, but it seems like the year started and there was no kind of ramping up into anything. Everyone just kind of got to work, which usually I don&#8217;t mind that, but it has been a very busy month so far.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Yes, it has. It has been busy, and I think we&#8217;ve been two years into the pandemic, so there&#8217;s a lot of fatigue out there too. So with everything, with the work continuing to ramp up, with everyone feeling really comfortable with this telework, it just seems there&#8217;s a lot of pressure. There&#8217;s a lot of pressure to still perform as companies are starting to think about how they&#8217;re going to return back to the office. I think a lot of people are really trying to say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m good here.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, we&#8217;re at this, I think really interesting shift in, I want to say it&#8217;s uniquely American, but it&#8217;s really something that&#8217;s happening worldwide. But I mean, we&#8217;re in America, you and I. So I think it affects Americans differently because we have such a symbiotic relationship with work. So the fact that there are going to see these large structures around capitalism and work that have been upended because of the pandemic, companies are trying to see if hybrid is a good deal, if they should still stay remote. They&#8217;re selling office spaces, they&#8217;re buy more office spaces. Companies are really trying to figure out what&#8217;s next, and I think it&#8217;s difficult for them. But then also with workers, we&#8217;re realizing in general that the work is always going to be there, that we have more power as workers than we thought, and so we can advocate for greater, better work experiences. So this is a really transformative time overall.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I think so too. I think Hatcher has done a really great job. They just went flexible first. Meaning if you want to work from home, you can. If you want to work in the office, you can. And if you want to do both, you can. And just really looking at that, I think has been really something that has kept people in the office and just really just love the culture that we&#8217;ve created there. So I&#8217;m just happy that we were able to move forward with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right now, are you able to go back into the office or you&#8217;re still kind of doing things remotely?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
We can if we want to, but most people are remote, and it&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does a average day look like?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
It&#8217;s busy. One of the things that we really worked on during the pandemic when we just immediately switched over to working from home just one day to the next&#8230; I was telling you a little bit earlier, I was the only holdout. I thought for some reason that it would only last a week and then I realized like, &#8220;Oh, wait, I don&#8217;t think this is going to last a week.&#8221; I went back to the office to get my chair, to get my desktop computer and all the things that I needed. But one of the things that we really worked on is communication. So work at Hatcher is really just this wonderful realm. My team in the morning, we always jump on chat. We say, good morning like you would if you just came in the office. This morning, one of my designers saved a dog that was kind of limping in the street and we were hearing about it. The play by play, but that&#8217;s the wonderful thing about it. So we have kept a wonderful relationship. That&#8217;s always really good.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
It&#8217;s really busy. The way I form my team is really in a way that everybody can grow in the way they want to grow. So as a part of their goals, they say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m more interested in DesignOps. Can I move in that role?&#8221; Or, &#8220;I&#8217;m really interested in becoming an art director? Can I move in that role?&#8221; So I try to ensure that all of my designers have the ability to learn from each other and to learn different types of design. So if I have somebody that&#8217;s mostly print that wants to learn UX, they can do that.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Yeah, just a really busy day. We have a great team of production that just keeps the trains moving. I have three art directors that help to ensure that the work looks great. In my senior creative role, I can normally formulate the strategy and just look at high-level creative. But it&#8217;s a busy day full of meetings, but it&#8217;s also one that&#8217;s really exciting and we&#8217;re able to really do some amazing things with amazing clients.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s really great that people are able to be flexible on the team like that. If there&#8217;s other things that they want to get into, they can do that, particularly I think within an agency kind of framework. I&#8217;ve worked largely with startups over the past five years and with those, it can be easy to just bounce from thing to thing because they maybe haven&#8217;t built out a robust network of people that work there yet. It&#8217;s mostly engineers, they may not have that much on creative. So if you want to jump into doing something else, you can just say, &#8220;I want to do something else,&#8221; and you can do it. With firms, it seems like it&#8217;s a bit more regimented because you&#8217;ve got creative directors and art directors and production designers, et cetera. But it sounds like it&#8217;s pretty flexible at Hatcher.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
It is. It&#8217;s really important to me because I realized as I was coming up, the integration of design was really important. I know you remember a day that when there was a job description, they wanted everything like, &#8220;Oh, are you a website designer? Can you do print? Can you do this? Can you do that?&#8221; And we&#8217;re all looking at each other like, &#8220;Come on, really? What do you want?&#8221; So I did. I learned all those things. So over the years, I did UX, I did product design, I&#8217;ve done marketing communications design, advertising, environmental design, digital. So you&#8217;ve done all of it, and I realized that it really encapsulates the importance of design. That the foundational thing that you need to always know about design is basically that good design can transcend whatever medium.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So you need to understand how to design well, how to communicate that, how to understand your user, no matter if it&#8217;s a brochure or you&#8217;re working on a product. It&#8217;s still the same. You still have a user that&#8217;s going to use it that you need to consider. So that&#8217;s how I formulate my team and really pushing them to learn, &#8220;Hey, you want to do motion? Okay, let&#8217;s do motion. Let&#8217;s grab you, and let&#8217;s have you work on this project.&#8221; It just really grows the team so quickly and allows us to have more people that can do a certain type of task.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So given that, how do you approach a new project if seems like designers can be that flexible to bounce between disciplines like that?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
My production team have learned&#8230; Again, we still have kid designers that might be really good at motion, or really good at long-form reports or annual reports, et cetera. Then we also know what designers want. I might have a designer who have asked, &#8220;Hey, I really want to work on an infographic,&#8221; and so we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Great.&#8221; Depending on the project, depending on the level that&#8217;s needed for that project, sometimes I do need a senior designer to work on a project. Sometimes I need an art director to work on the project. Sometimes it&#8217;s a team. We gather together, we look at all the projects and we assign them based on who can best deliver that project. Then if we have somebody that wants to learn, then they are also put on the team as well. And then from there, we schedule out and have a meeting, a launch, and the work gets done, and it&#8217;s always at a high quality. That&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve been known for, for my students as well, as well as my staff, that quality is important.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look at your work, what would you say is the hardest part about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I love design so much. It&#8217;s really a hobby as well when I&#8217;m in my off hours. So as I&#8217;m looking over what the hardest part is, is just making sure that&#8230; I think it&#8217;s more on the client side. So it&#8217;s just making sure that they understand our process and they understand the whys in the decision making that we have. The world is so much more design savvy because of media, because of video, social media. They&#8217;re seeing good design on an every basis. Several times a day, they&#8217;re just seeing good design come to them.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So a lot of clients will come with preconceived notions on what they think will be appropriate for their project, and sometimes it&#8217;s not. Understanding the user, understanding the metrics, understanding the goals and the KPIs they have on the project. So sometimes I have to sit and kind of explain why we came up with a certain direction for them to understand why it works. I will say, even though that is the difficult part, it 99.999% of the time works because when you use design, when you use the foundations of design, the theories of design, and you explain it back to the client, then they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, I get it. Great.&#8221; Because that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re hiring a firm for. So I think it&#8217;s the hardest part, but it&#8217;s also really rewarding as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s so interesting now, because clients, like you said, they&#8217;re exposed to more or we&#8217;re just all exposed to more through television or streaming or whatever. They&#8217;ll come with these very elaborate ideas and oftentimes it&#8217;s like a therapy session in a way where you&#8217;re trying to get to what the actual thing is that they&#8217;re trying to do so they don&#8217;t get so caught up in the visuals or the presentation. Or just letting them know that maybe the visuals and the presentation you&#8217;re looking for, maybe you can&#8217;t get that on your budget, but if there&#8217;s a certain feeling you&#8217;re trying to evoke, then maybe we can get there by doing these other things. And so it is very much this kind of push-pull process with clients sometimes.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Yeah. Always. Always. But you know what? It&#8217;s a rewarding thing. Our firm really is mission forward. We focus on education and opportunity and environment. So for us and just so much more, education is one of our large areas as well. With every single client, even though there&#8217;s that push-pull, there&#8217;s always this satisfaction because everything we&#8217;re doing is really to help them with their mission. At the end of the day, no matter how hard it is, you go home happy or rather you shut off your computer happy since we&#8217;re at home now. But yeah, it&#8217;s just a wonderful place to work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit. I know you&#8217;re a native of the DC metro area. I&#8217;d love to kind of learn more about what it was like growing up there for you.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. Actually I was born in Puerto Rico. My family&#8217;s from there. Have no accent because we came when I was two, and we moved to Silver Spring and throughout the years I&#8217;ve moved to several areas in Silver Spring. But I&#8217;m still here, and I love it.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
The DC area is really a melting pot. I think out of the top 10, there are two cities, maybe three cities that are the most diverse in the country within the DC area. So it was really different. When you grow up in the &#8217;70s, you&#8217;re in school and you have 63 countries represented in your school. That was the school I went to. 63 countries. We had 63 flags in our school. Yes, it was very different. It was very different. The older I got and the more I traveled, the more I realized that the DC area is so special. It is so special. I haven&#8217;t found a place that feels like it where you can have friends that look completely different from you, speak a different language, and nobody looks at you twice. No one. Like no one. They just don&#8217;t look at you twice, because that&#8217;s normal.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Of course being in the DC area, there&#8217;s also almost like a different economy as well too, because you have the government here. And this is one thing that I think people who grow up in the DC area need to realize as designers and just people, that when hardships happen around the country, they&#8217;re not quite as hard here because you have the government here and the government can&#8217;t shut down. So when 2008 happened, just traveling around the country, you could see so many areas with malls closed and strip malls closed and in the DC area, there were still open. The malls aren&#8217;t doing it quite as well now, but&#8230; So it&#8217;s always important for designers and creatives to just always learn and always see outside themselves. Just don&#8217;t live in a bubble, but always look outside of your area. See how other people are living and experiencing the same things you are because it&#8217;ll just make you a better strategic designer in terms of how you can deliver to the audiences you need to reach.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So growing up around all this diversity and this extremely multicultural school. I mean, 63 countries in one school, growing up is a lot. Were the arts and design kind of a big part of your childhood? Were you exposed to that a lot?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I was exposed to art in terms of drawing, and that was really nice. Our school had a really wonderful art program as well as high school. I was introduced to photography. I would make posters and I would draw, but I actually never heard the term graphic designer at all. I went to college first for architecture, and I got into one school, but decided that architecture wasn&#8217;t quite for me. So I graduated Maryland with an art degree because at that time, I found out later their design program was closed. But I had an art degree out of Maryland, and I still didn&#8217;t know the term graphic designer. So I decided to go back to school. I went to Montgomery College just to get a two-year degree in multimedia and design. So that&#8217;s the first time I heard design with multimedia and I was like, &#8220;Okay, this is cool. Let me take it.&#8221; And I just happened to take an elective called Quark.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Yeah. I just happened to take it because I had electives to take and I was like, &#8220;Quark. Hmm. I wonder what this Quark is.&#8221; And that&#8217;s the first time I saw graphic design because it was graphic design, I think like 120, and it was like Quark 101.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I took Quark and I was in the class and I remember just having such a good time. I mean, I was going for it. I was making newsletters. I mean, it was fun. Our screens were only like 15 inches and that was like state-of-the-art back then, because computers had just come in the scene just about three or four years earlier. They kind of became mainstream. And so I was in class and the professor, I will never forget him. Professor [inaudible 00:20:48], he looked at my work one day and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;You&#8217;re really good at this.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Good at what?&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Ah, good at this.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;What is this? I&#8217;m just making a newsletter.&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh dear God.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Can somebody tell this child what class she&#8217;s in?&#8221; And somebody&#8217;s like, &#8220;Graphic design.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Graphic design?&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yes, you can do this for a living.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Wait, what?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And at that moment I knew everything was going to be okay. I had found my passion. I really knew that it was going to be okay. I took every single graphic design class I could from him especially, and I graduated and I got my first job as a graphic designer with the Gazette newspapers, which was owned by The Washington Post at that time. And that&#8217;s how I got my start.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious about Quark. I want to go back to that because that&#8217;s a very&#8230; You said that and my mind immediately went to like&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if this is probably the right timeframe. I&#8217;m guessing this is like mid &#8217;90s probably?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
You are exactly right. You&#8217;re exactly right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
It was &#8217;94.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d have to research. I don&#8217;t even know if Quark is still like a thing now, but I remember first getting into Quark. I was in&#8230; Let&#8217;s see, &#8217;94 I&#8217;d probably just got into high school. So yeah. I remember using Quark and Adobe PageMaker because I designed my high school&#8217;s newspaper or redesign my high school&#8217;s newspaper. Because before that we were using or they were using&#8230; And this is because I grew up in the sticks, but also I think just because publishing hadn&#8217;t reached digital fully yet everywhere, but we were still doing mimeographs.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh wow, yeah. Yep. No, no. You laugh, but my first job, we were waxing down the pages of the newspaper on flats. So it really was the turn of graphic design becoming more digital to it being more mechanical. So using Exacto knives when we needed to change a word.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
But it was such good experience. So I love it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s so interesting because you&#8217;re&#8230; I mean, you&#8217;re learning the tool and you&#8217;re learning how to do this. There&#8217;s no real examples that you can look at. When I think about what designers can do now and how much is out there in terms of education, they can go on YouTube. They could do LinkedIn Learning or they could do Skillshare or whatever. Like there&#8217;s so much out there. We were really winging it back then like just-</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh my God.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; trying to figure it out.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
We were. We were winging it and that&#8217;s why I love that class Quark, because the professor had a saying, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Welcome to my class. Number one, do you know the Mac, or have you ever used a Mac?&#8221; And I wasn&#8217;t sure how to answer that question. Some people raised their hand and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, more importantly, have you never used the Mac?&#8221; And I was about to raise my hand and the person next to me took my hand and said, &#8220;Do not raise your hand or he will kick you up.&#8221; And he kicked out two people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Ooh. Wow.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So I would&#8217;ve never known, I should have been a graphic designer. But the one thing he said is, I&#8217;m going to teach you everything about this application, every dropdown, popup menu. And it&#8217;s up to you to create something that visually communicates an idea.&#8221; And he did. He taught us every single part of that. It was almost like a YouTube in the class. I think the way he taught really did inspire me to teach as well, but you&#8217;re right, we had nothing. We had absolutely zero. We were just going into it like, &#8220;Okay, here&#8217;s a blank page. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). And really trying to figure it out and just see how these tools work. You could read the instruction manual, but the instruction manuals were like these big thick Bibles. It was hard to get your creativity around it when the instruction manuals were just&#8230; Well, I guess that&#8217;s the other thing. There were instruction manuals. There were like printed books that you had to go through and try to figure this stuff out. So it was&#8230; Wow, what a time.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
They were called Bibles.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What a time.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Like what Bible?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Uh-huh (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
The illustrator Bible, I remember, I remember. I know back in the day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about your early career after you graduated. Did you stay around in the DC metro area?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I did. I stayed around in the DC metro area and I worked for the Gazette newspapers. And I just remember just saying, &#8220;Hey, oh, I wish I could do more in design.&#8221; I just think that people are just put around you and you need to listen to their advice. And there was a coworker named Marie. She was awesome. And she was like, &#8220;Reece, you&#8217;re really talented. I don&#8217;t think you should be stuck here.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; this and the other. And she&#8217;s like, &#8220;You know what, I don&#8217;t want to hear you complaining unless you&#8217;re applying.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;What?&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, don&#8217;t complain to me about that you want more, unless you&#8217;re applying for another job.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;There&#8217;s no way I can get a job. I&#8217;m just one year out of school.&#8221; And she&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want to hear it.&#8221; And she was serious. She wouldn&#8217;t let me here until I started applying. I applied and I got my first firm job at HR communications in the DC area. And when I told her, she&#8217;s like, &#8220;There you go.&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad it worked.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;What?&#8221; And that&#8217;s just how she was.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And so I never complained about a job ever again, unless I was doing something about right. That was really good advice. And from HR communications, I went to an in-house marketing firm, which was great, because it was marketing communications and I really learned a lot about marketing. Went to focus groups, helped conduct them. And that was just wonderful experience to learn how your work is really resonating with your audiences. And I think for first time, and this was still the &#8217;90s, I realized that it&#8217;s not what I wanted. It&#8217;s what the customer needed that I needed to deliver. Design early on, was about your skill and how you could deliver it. But when I worked in that marketing group, I really learned that I need to listen to that audience and that was really eyeopening for me and just a wonderful experience there.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And then from there I went to another firm, and that firm was, I think the change in the quality of my work. This firm was called [inaudible 00:27:03]. And again, they were another marketing communications firm, but their designers hailed from around the world. They had a designer from Spain, a designer from Korea, and one from the Philippines and all over. And what was amazing was this being the &#8217;90s, I thought I knew all the programs. They&#8217;re the ones that taught me that, &#8220;Hey, oh my goodness, your program can actually merge with other programs.&#8221; And that&#8217;s when I learned that you could actually merge your files, and get this, from Illustrator into Photoshop. You could merge your layer files into&#8230; And that was way back in the day. It just changed the way I could design because now I could make montages that you could only see in magazines where you&#8217;re just like, &#8220;How&#8217;d they do that.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how they do that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And so they taught me all these really deep tricks and tips about the actual programs that I think really changed the quality of my design. And again, just really an amazing group of very talented designers. I remember when I got that job, I interviewed for it three times. And the first time I went, the owner was like, &#8220;You&#8217;re good, but you&#8217;re just not what we need. It&#8217;s not quite what we need.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Can you tell me about my work? What is it that you like, what is it that you don&#8217;t like? I don&#8217;t have an ego. Let me know how I can improve.&#8221; He told me, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;I like this, but our quality has more depth. It has more layering.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Okay, that sounds great.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So I went back and I kept designing, adding more things into my portfolio. About three months later they called me in. And at that time I told them, &#8220;Well, I have a new job. I&#8217;m not going to come in.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Just come in. Let&#8217;s just have a chat.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll just have a chat.&#8221; So I went and showed them a couple more pieces and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh wow, you listened.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Well, of course.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I love your work.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Of course I listened.&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hmm. All right. Hmm.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So he had me come back to talk to the art director and I realized at that time they were trying to have me leave the job that I had just started. And I wrote a list why I should stay at the job where I was or why I should go. And I realized that even if I stayed in this new firm for six months, the level of work that would come out of it would be so much more than I could ever get at the firm that I had gone to. So I decided to go. The only job that I have ever been in less than a year, but it was life changing. It was honestly life changing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now after that, is that when you ended up joining ASCD?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
That is correct. That is correct. That firm hit the dotcom era. The early 2000s where all the dotcoms kind of lost their funding. And that was 90% of our work. So the firm shut its doors and I was left without a job. And I was like, &#8220;All right.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Okay, what are we going to do here?&#8221; And I told myself, &#8220;Because now you have eight designers looking for work that each have the level of quality you have&#8230;&#8221; So I started looking for work and there were jobs that had a little bit more technical motion, people were getting into flashback then. And so I would just refer other designers and they would be like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, thank you so much,&#8221; because the job wasn&#8217;t right for me.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
But I also told myself, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to look for any job. It doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221; And I applied to a role for an in-house designer with an in-house agency. They called themselves an in-house agency. And that was kind of in the early 2000s. And that was rare to have a team of designers that would call themselves an in-house agency. So I went, I tried and I looked.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And the work, I was like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, what are you guys doing here?&#8221; I realized that they were a midsize publisher for educational book and products. And I was like, &#8220;This is amazing work. I&#8217;ve never done a book before.&#8221; So I showed my portfolio and I got the job. It was such an incredible experience, designing books and just growing within that environment, that I stayed. I also had a wonderful manager. And it&#8217;s true, you stay at a job where you have a great leader. And so he saw leadership potential within myself and would give me opportunities to lead projects. And then I started leading web projects, and then I started to lead applications. So product manage. It&#8217;s a wonderful experience where I was able to do everything from&#8230; Could design applications, as well as apps towards the end of the 15 years. Could design websites, online store, hundreds of books, just everything, run the gamut, including their large annual conference. So I would do the branding around the entire annual conference. And then through the years, I got promoted four times.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So it was just a wonderful opportunity to grow. And I was on vacation when that was a thing, when you left the&#8230; I got a call from a recruiter at LinkedIn for a position and I remember it just wasn&#8217;t right. I was happy where I was. And I said thank you and the recruiter said, &#8220;Well, just take a look at our job description online.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Sure, sure. I&#8217;ll go ahead and do that.&#8221; And so I clicked the link and here I am in France and I&#8217;m scrolling down, I&#8217;m scrolling down. I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I don&#8217;t think this is right.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And then there was in LinkedIn, at least back then, there was a title: Other jobs like these. And I was like, &#8220;Okay, so another job like this.&#8221; So I started looking at those jobs and there was one job there and it was The Hatcher Group. And I was like, &#8220;Huh, let me just read it.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re looking for a senior VP of design. Hmm. All right. Let&#8217;s take a look at what this looks like.&#8221; And it looked good. It was everything I was doing now. And I was like, &#8220;This is good,&#8221; but they really wanted to grow what they had as a design team. So they only had one designer and an intern and they were mostly a communications firm, QPR firm at that time, and they really wanted to grow it into more.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And so I&#8217;m reading the description and there&#8217;s one line and that line stuck out to me. And that line was, &#8220;Above all, we&#8217;re looking for someone who is kind.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Whoa.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I was like, &#8220;Whoa.&#8221; Yes, &#8220;Wow. Who looks for somebody who is kind? This is awesome.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Especially at an agency.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Especially at an agency. I was like, &#8220;Well, if I&#8217;m going to go somewhere, let me go to a place where they want somebody who&#8217;s kind. I think I&#8217;m kind, but I know they&#8217;re kind because they&#8217;re looking for someone who is like them.&#8221; So I knew that just from the job description. And so I applied and I got the job. And so that was four years ago and we&#8217;ve grown from one designer and one intern to a team of 16. So we&#8217;re doing some great things and I have an amazing team.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I focus on hiring diverse designers. I think it&#8217;s important. I think a lot of firms run into trouble when they don&#8217;t hire diverse designers because we can check with each other and say, &#8220;Hey, does this work for this audience?&#8221; Because you don&#8217;t have that lived experience. And that is very critical for me, but what it does too, is it teaches the other designers how to have a critical, but worldwide view of work that we&#8217;re doing, especially because we&#8217;re working with very sensitive topics as well in terms of education and the environment and equity within those spaces. It&#8217;s just really important to understand how the images that you use, the icons that you use, even the way it&#8217;s placed, how that reads to your intended audience and if it portrays them fairly. That&#8217;s actually something that we focus on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to go back briefly to ASCD. I mean, that was such a large part of your career. You were there for 15 years.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at that time, is there anything that really stands out to you that you remember the most?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh, absolutely. We had a wonderful team. It&#8217;s where I learned how to manage. It&#8217;s where my boss gave me the opportunity to take his job as he was promoted into a larger role. And it&#8217;s also where I learned to ensure that your designers can grow in the way that they want to grow. Instead of keeping people siloed into one area, I learned that it works well. It works so well for that team. We were so productive and people grew exactly where they wanted to and they became designers first, and then they learned the mediums second. So that&#8217;s where I learned that.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Quality was actually something that was so key to that team and to my boss. And I learned that quality is actually something that happens when the whole team works together as a unit, when everybody helps each other. And so I also hire people that don&#8217;t have egos, because we really do critique each other and help each other grow and ensure that everything that comes out of our shop has the quality that the customer expects, the client expects. But most important, I learned how to manage. I learned that if you treat your people like you&#8217;re equal, like people, you&#8217;re not their parent and you shouldn&#8217;t be, but you treat them like you&#8217;re equal. And if you&#8217;re having a problem with someone, just have a conversation and say, &#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s going on? Is everything okay? How can I help you? You tell me how I can help you.&#8221; Then you have a team that will come to you first. If anything goes wrong, my team just comes to me and say, &#8220;Hey, here&#8217;s what went down.&#8221; And then I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay. So how did you fix it?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So we work through the solutions and we grow people. And I think that that is such a wonderful quality that I loved during the 15 years. I loved being able to go to my boss and say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s how I screwed up. Here&#8217;s how I think we should fix it. Do you agree?&#8221; And nine times out of 10 he did, &#8220;Oh yeah, that&#8217;s a great call. And you know what? It&#8217;s okay. We all screwed up sometimes.&#8221; And so I managed the same way and I think it&#8217;s really important that folks feel free to grow and to make those mistakes because that&#8217;s how you get exceptional designers. And I have exceptional designers. So I&#8217;m a very lucky person.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, definitely sounds like to be able to have that level of openness among the team like that, that really takes really, I think depthful but also very skillful kind of just management. And with being at ASCD as long as you have, being able to really learn that in that environment has definitely helped out with what you&#8217;re doing at Hatcher.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Absolutely. Absolutely. 100%.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you also are a design educator. We&#8217;ve had several design educators here on Revision Path. You&#8217;re an adjunct professor at George Mason University where you&#8217;ve been since 2008. Tell me about your time teaching there. I&#8217;m curious, what are you teaching now?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Actually now, I start next week. I am teaching UX design as well as design principles and theory. So methods and principles, which is really the theory of design. It&#8217;s their first studio class where they learn how to design. And it&#8217;s one of my favorite classes. I&#8217;ve taught it since 2008 and I love it. I love it. I love it so much. And I love the outcome of not only the program and the students. About a fourth of my staff are my former students.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh really?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh absolutely. Oh absolutely. I snag them when I can. Absolutely. I kind of fell into teaching&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
One of the wonderful parts of working with the in-house firms is that they have lots of benefits. ASCD had tuition reimbursement, so I was like, &#8220;Hey, why don&#8217;t I get my M.F.A. in design?&#8221; And I found a program that had most of their classes at night in the University of Baltimore. I applied and got in, and I went through that there. I learned and worked with the head of the design program at George Mason, and one day I was just sitting around and he said, &#8220;You know, I think you would be a really good professor.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Oh no, not me. There&#8217;s no way,&#8221; because I grew up with a stutter. Just learning how to speak fluently was just really hard for me. And even now, even though I now have lived a little bit more than half my life without the stutter, I still can hear the struggle. So I just doubted myself so much and he just left it alone.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Years later, he called me and he said, &#8220;Hey, how about that teaching gig that I talked to you about?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Oh, it would be wonderful, but&#8230; I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;I really need you.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you call me tomorrow? Think about it.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
The next day, I called him. I couldn&#8217;t sleep that night. I was so nervous about teaching. I just couldn&#8217;t sleep. And so I said, &#8220;You know what, I know it&#8217;s a good opportunity. It&#8217;s hard to get in, but I just don&#8217;t think I can do it.&#8221; And I left him a message and he didn&#8217;t answer me back. So I kept texting. The day after, he called me and said, &#8220;Hey, I got your message. I&#8217;m sorry I got it late. I already put your name in and I can&#8217;t change it.&#8221; And come to find out, he could have changed it. But I thank him every day. His name is Don Star. I thank him every single day for tricking me into a teaching job because the first night I taught, I realized, &#8220;I love this. This is so amazing.&#8221; And you just get this vibe when you teach.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
My mom was a teacher and she told me, she&#8217;s like, &#8220;When one of your students learns how to read, your whole body gets this shiver. You just get this vibe that, &#8216;Wow. What I&#8217;m doing is making a difference.'&#8221; And she&#8217;s right. I got that same vibe when I had a student who really understood a concept, understood a theory and was able to apply it and created something that looked so beautiful. And I was like, yes. And I got hooked. I got to teaching.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So I just got hooked to teaching. And with that first class, which was the design methods and theories class, I just had a great time. I kept teaching. There&#8217;s other classes I teach as well. I&#8217;ve taught typography, infographic design, motion graphics, and I just have a blast with it all. Like I said, I think that teaching is so important and learning how to teach those foundational skills are the critical part that I think is missing in some programs as well. Because I also interview and hire and look at hundreds of portfolios all the time, and just those little things that you can see throughout is what I teach. The things that people don&#8217;t get, or they don&#8217;t understand how to really put their work together or how to continually improve their work. So I just have a great time with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you say things have changed since you started teaching there? Have you grown as an educator?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I have. I don&#8217;t like grades, though I have to grade folks, but I love projects. And so my projects have gotten more complex. They also have introduced a digital aspect to them because everything now has a digital aspect. Even if you do a report, we&#8217;re asked to do social media or a little motion graphic video that will help to launch that report. So I think I use what I see at work as a part of how to improve the way I teach. So when I see shifts in the industry or in the way clients are asking for work, I also change how I teach to mirror that, to ensure where that my students are ready for hire as soon as they graduate</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
From your perspective, and again, you&#8217;ve been teaching since 2008 and you&#8217;ve mentioned these changes, what do design students, and I guess design graduates also, what do they want from the design industry?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
That&#8217;s actually a good question. I&#8217;ve had a couple students, especially during the pandemic really kind of reached out for co-mentoring because we haven&#8217;t been in person for two years. So they want to be ready. They want to be ready to get a job. They want to ensure that they&#8217;re not looked over. They really want to understand how their work applies in the real world. And that&#8217;s actually something that I do. As a part of every single class, I also take one class period to teach them salaries. What are you worth? What are you worth when you go out? Here&#8217;s the salary range. Here&#8217;s how you can adapt it for the DC area. Or let&#8217;s say you were going to New York, here&#8217;s how you adapt it. Let&#8217;s say you were going to Chicago, or let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re going to Alabama or to Mississippi. Here&#8217;s how you can change and see what you&#8217;re worth and how much you can ask for.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I also go over portfolios. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;These portfolios work and here&#8217;s why.&#8221; I go over resumes. &#8220;These resumes work and here&#8217;s why.&#8221; And I explain to them how to get ready for the real world. Why it&#8217;s important that their work is good. How they can self-edit to ensure that you don&#8217;t have one piece that looks really bad with work that looks really good, because I see that all the time. When I&#8217;m looking at the students&#8217; portfolios, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Why did you add that invitation?&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, because I don&#8217;t have an invitation.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;But do you think it looks good?&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;No, it&#8217;s not my best work.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to judge you on that.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, as a creative director, if I look at this, I&#8217;m going to say somebody helped you with everything else. And the one that looks bad is the one you did on your own.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Mm-hmm (affirmative).&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Take that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So I help them learn how to edit their work because as you&#8217;re coming up, you always have a couple of duds in there where you&#8217;re&#8230; They&#8217;re not horrible, but they&#8217;re just not the level of quality as some of your other work. So learn how to edit because your portfolio is the way that someone&#8217;s going to hire you. I really help them with that. And I think that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re really looking for. They&#8217;re looking for help to ensure that they can get a job, because we all know how it feels when you graduate and then you have to like make it on your own.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
That intense feeling of fear like, &#8220;Oh dear God, I&#8217;ve got to pay for everything myself.&#8221; And back then it was harder because you literally left home. Nowadays you can come back, things are changing a little bit. But back then, they were just like, &#8220;Okay, you&#8217;re gone. Bye college. You&#8217;re gone.&#8221; But kids still feel that. They still feel that fear. So just helping them know that these things can help them. And then I also do mock interviews and I do them in class so that people can see how I answer questions. I tell them, &#8220;Just ask me anything.&#8221; And I&#8217;ve gotten some really tough questions for them to see how I answer that so that they can really have a leg up when they go to their first interview.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And even afterwards I will help students. I give them my email address. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hey, you want a mock interview? Let&#8217;s do it. You want me to look at your portfolio? Let&#8217;s do it.&#8221; Just the other day, I had a student who was so nervous about an interview that they had, catchy with Deloitte, and they were just so nervous. And so they just wanted me to go over again&#8230; They just wanted to practice and they wanted to go over it one on one. So I took some time to help that student and they reached out and said that they got the job and I was so excited because there&#8217;s another level that&#8217;s hard here to the pandemic. Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So they just have that nervousness going out. I take the time for that too, because I think it&#8217;s important and I wish I had that when I was first coming out. And so I make sure that I&#8217;m there for them so that they don&#8217;t have to feel like they&#8217;re going out alone.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I think what you&#8217;re doing with reviewing their portfolio and resumes and talking about salaries and doing mock interviews, that stuff is so, so, so important for designers just to get out there and know what it is that they have to do to try to compete in the marketplace, but also to position themselves in the best possible light.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve done some work in the past with the art institutes, particularly the Art Institute of Atlanta here in Atlanta. They sort of do this thing every year where they bring in people from the local design community and they have a dinner at the school. And what they&#8217;re doing with that is one, just trying to meet practitioners out in the city, but also to get a sense of like, &#8220;What do we need to be teaching students? What out there are you seeing in the market that we need to inform them of?&#8221; Whether that&#8217;s about upcoming technologies or certain-</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I love it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; design trends or things like that, to try to stay current and keep up on top of things. It&#8217;s funny, you&#8217;re talking about your adjunct experience and I&#8217;m thinking about, I taught adjunct&#8230; Oh, this was 2012 I think. Like 2011, 2012, I was teaching like a principles of web design course-</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh, love it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; as an adjunct. And what I tell you, it was so dated&#8230; Well, first of all, it was a BIS course. It was a business information systems kind of major. So it already wasn&#8217;t like technically really designed. You were just teaching business students enough design to sort of get by, I guess. But the curriculum was so old.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like when I started, they had students learning how to design web pages using tables. And I&#8217;m like, this is 2011, 2012, sometime around that.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I learned tables in the &#8217;90s.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Me too. I learned tables in the &#8217;90s too. And I&#8217;m like you have to teach because this was in that period where CSS layout design of course was the norm at that point. I remember working at AT&#038;T in 2007-ish and we made the switch from tables to CSS. I mean, you want to talk about seeing grown people cry at work?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I know. I remember that switch. It was emotional for many.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In this teaching thing, I remember going to the Dean and like petitioning to rewrite the curriculum because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You&#8217;re setting these students up to fail-&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8220;&#8230; if you&#8217;re teaching them how to design in tables and then they go out there in the world trying to get some design jobs to say they have some HTML experience and it&#8217;s this dated. We&#8217;re not setting them up in the best light.&#8221; Eventually they did let me rewrite the curriculum. So I did teach them basic CSS and stuff, but I&#8217;m thinking like, &#8220;What if I didn&#8217;t?&#8221; Or what if another educator was just like, &#8220;Oh, this is what I&#8217;m teaching? Okay.&#8221; And just went with it. So the fact that you&#8217;re extending that out, you&#8217;re doing way more than usual. I mean, I certainly commend you for that.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh thank you. But now, what I was going to say is that that&#8217;s really important and that&#8217;s one of the things that I love about George Mason. Is that with the curriculum that I&#8217;m able to continually update it. So every single semester I update everything to ensure&#8230; Including my samples, because I want to make sure that the students have the latest and the greatest of how you can incorporate design into all this new technology. And it&#8217;s just really important to be able to do that because it&#8217;s true. Just like you said, if you don&#8217;t do that, you are setting them up to fail from the beginning and school&#8217;s not cheap, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s make sure they have all the right tools so that they can go out and live their best life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is the design community like for you at this stage in your career?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh, it&#8217;s awesome. The DC area, as well as the Baltimore area, because I&#8217;m still connected through school, they have such a strong design community that they overlap as well at times, but it&#8217;s really strong. I&#8217;m a part of AIGA, I volunteer. I am on The Continuum Fund, which is a scholarship fund for underserved designers, and it&#8217;s just wonderful. It&#8217;s great to grow with designers and also bring up new designers and seeing them grow in leadership roles as well. It&#8217;s actually something that&#8217;s important because no matter how large your city is, the design community is actually small. And that&#8217;s the thing that I think that people need to understand. Like I&#8217;m connected with so many people around the city and know when they&#8217;re looking for someone, I can refer other people. And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to always get connected to the community where you are, because it&#8217;s a great way to help you find jobs or just to grow and design or just to give back, to mentor or to help an upcoming student or designer that joins a group. So I encourage everybody to do that if they can.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you&#8217;re a recent DC design fellow. Congratulations on that.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Thank you so much. I was shocked and honored to be named an AIGA Fellow. It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s given to just a few people and not every year. And for me to be chosen, I was very humbled and just very gracious. It just makes me want to triple my efforts in terms of what I&#8217;m doing and teaching and mentoring, because I realize now that it&#8217;s made a difference. The power of just winning that award is just realizing that you can make a difference. You can help your community just by giving back. It was a really fun experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of your influencers? Who inspires you?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
It&#8217;s actually everyone around me, but including, and I think the most important are my students. I am the creative director I am today, I am the leader I am today because of them. They inspire me to push further. They inspire me and grow&#8230; They just have just great ideas that they use on their projects, that they come forward, that they ask, &#8220;Hey, can I do this?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hmm, I don&#8217;t see why not. Let&#8217;s have a go.&#8221; And so they keep me always growing, learning and searching for new ways to apply design. And they inspire me every day. I think that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m hooked to learning and I&#8217;m hooked to teaching because basically I learn from them. As much as they learn from me, I learn from them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are you the most excited about at the moment?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I think I am the most excited about how technology is informing design, how we can apply design to new things. For example, augmented reality. So AR, VR and how I can apply that within my teaching, as well as within my own firm. I love how the industry and how design has to continually change. I think that that keeps us fresh. It keeps us learning. It keeps us growing. And that&#8217;s important. I mean, I think creativity really requires the pursuit of experiencing learning and observing as much as you can. One of the things I always say is you cannot design what you don&#8217;t know. So you have to continually be curious and open-minded and just always be a student. And just continuing to learn, not only in your field, but what&#8217;s around it, and be ready for it so that you can continue to visually communicate ideas to your clients.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? I mean, with what you&#8217;ve got going on with teaching, as well as your work at The Hatcher Group, it sounds like you&#8217;ve got a very, very bright future in terms of what you want to.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I&#8217;m always living in the present. Right now, I am so excited with the work I&#8217;m doing at The Hatcher Group. I recently got promoted to executive vice president, which actually allows me to do a lot more business development, not only with the firm, but with our clients. So it&#8217;s a wonderful place for me to be. In five years, I can tell you, as long as they&#8217;ll have me, I will still be teaching. That I do know. I love it. It&#8217;s how I actually relax after a long day, is I teach. And the moment I go in and I say, &#8220;Hi class, how are you doing?&#8221; Like all the stress leaves. And we just have a great time and we laugh and just learn together.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
In terms of what I do, I hope that I&#8217;m always going to be tied to design in some way, the next five years for me, just really&#8230; It incorporates me continuing to learn. I&#8217;m always looking at the next program. I know it&#8217;s weird, but I am looking at a doctor&#8217;s program. So I think it&#8217;s important for me to continue just growing and learning within my own field, and right now just doing what I do at Hatcher.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Well, they can go to thehatchergroup.com as well as my own personal website, 09creative.com. And I am also on LinkedIn at linkedin.com/reecequinones</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Reece Qui√±ones, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. I mean, just going through everything that you are doing with The Hatcher Group and with education and your background and everything. I mean, you&#8217;re someone that I think a lot of people in design industry can look up to. It&#8217;s so interesting before we recorded, you were talking about how you don&#8217;t know, or you didn&#8217;t know why you received the DC fellow award. And I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t see how you didn&#8217;t know considering how much you&#8217;ve been, not just a practitioner in design for a very long time, but also how much you&#8217;re giving back to the next generation of design through teaching-</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh, thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; and everything. So I am so glad to have had you on the show and to share your story and I look forward to seeing what comes next. Thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Thank you so much. I had an awesome time.</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Hey everybody. My name is Omari Souza. I am a professor of design and design research at Texas State University. And I also organized the State of Black Design conference.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve been on the show before the first time you came on the show was back in 2017. How&#8217;s the year been going for you so far? This is 2022.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Man. To be completely honest with you with being in the middle of COVID these past three years all feel like one extended year. So it doesn&#8217;t even feel like I&#8217;ve started a new year yet. It just feels like I&#8217;m still ending 2019.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I guess it all has blurred together. I was online earlier today and I saw where people were making these comparisons, like January 2020 to January 2022, like how people were first starting to talk about the coronavirus and all that sort of stuff. But it does feel that way. I know a lot of folks now that are just trying to get their bearings so far. At the beginning of the year.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s exactly what it feels like. It&#8217;s just being up and down, well, being up and down in terms of figuring out how you&#8217;re maneuvering through COVID and educating and working. Whether you&#8217;re at home whether you&#8217;re allowed to wear a mask or not wear a mask based off of how the population is doing with COVID at the moment, it&#8217;s all pretty tough.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And granted, I say that living in Texas, I know in some other cities and states that have taken it far more serious in the state that I&#8217;m in, things have been a bit more constant in terms of mask wearing and some of those other things, but it&#8217;s been a lot to adapt to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And I know you&#8217;ve got a lot on your plate now because you&#8217;re also organizing an event while you&#8217;re doing all of this. You&#8217;re organizing this year&#8217;s State of Black Design, which begins next month. Tell me about how this event started and where you got the idea for it from.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
It started in a lot of places in all honesty. I normally tell people that it started as a response to the George Floyd murder. There was a lot of civil unrest at the time and a lot of people wanted to have these conversations about race and the intersectionality of race with practice, regardless of what that practice was.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
But also at that same time period and before there were a lot of designers in the BIPOC community that felt that they weren&#8217;t being represented at the majority of design related conferences. Whether it be HOW, or HOW Conference or several others, you would look at entire like 20, 30 person lineups, and maybe not see any person of color in that lineup, or maybe one or two, when in reality there was so much talent out there doing so much amazing things.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So this moment after George Floyd&#8217;s murder ended up being this huge boiling pot of emotion, a lot of the designers feeling like they didn&#8217;t have a space to be heard or to be seen, or that their contributions to the industry and to the field weren&#8217;t being recognized or appreciated. And there being this overall desire to learn more about how race is impacting these different pockets of society. So initial, I took that as an opportunity to hold something on my campus.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So what I thought was going to be on my campus, I created an Eventbrite page, hired a student to do some of the marketing material for us and anticipated we may only get a 100, 200 students that attended our program. Low and behold, we ended up getting roughly 4,000 people who registered for the event. And we&#8217;ve just been continuing since after realizing that there was a demand and really a need to have some of these conversations that weren&#8217;t happening prior.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s interesting about&#8230; Well, one, I guess the timing of all this came about in an interesting way, because one, it did, as you said happen, because you were hearing from so many people that there&#8217;s a lack of events around Black designers. And then of course the summer of 2020 was this big racial reckoning, so to speak, which I guess for a lot of people activated them into doing something and for you, this was one of those things.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah. And it really felt nerve wracking but gratifying is actually put together. You were one of the folks that actually came out and spoke with the initial one. And wanted to make sure I take my time to thank you for that, because I know that you&#8217;re super busy and you sacrificed your time to speak at the events. But one thing that we all spoke about afterwards was the response that we got on Twitter from it.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
There were studios that tuned in live and actually created visual graphics of what was being discussed. There were people that tweeted and sent personal messages about how they never felt so seen or heard in the field itself. There was just such heartwarming messages that were coming in response to this at a time period where there was so much anger and anguish. So it felt really good to put that together.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I remember seeing, I know Webflow was one company that did these sketch notes right along with it. And for those that are interested the 2020 event, I think it&#8217;s on YouTube, right?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s on YouTube.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And it was myself, it was Renee Reed, a couple other folks who had been on the Revision Path Podcast, but that was a really great event. It was just this one day thing that we all came together and spoke and it was a lot of fun. And I&#8217;m glad to see that you got that kind of feedback from it.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah. I needed that as well. Timothy Brad Levis who&#8217;s also been on the show, spoke with me before programming, before I began planning the second event and he said to me planning a conference you typically do it in four stages. The first stage is, oh my God, I&#8217;m so excited. I can&#8217;t wait to do this second stage. Oh man, this is so much harder than I thought it was going to be.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
The third stage is I can&#8217;t believe I agreed to do this. I&#8217;m never doing this again. What was I thinking? Then the fourth stage, once you start getting the response says, &#8220;You know what? It wasn&#8217;t that bad. I can do that again.&#8221; All the positive messages that I got at the time period, put the battery in my back to be able to do it again, the following year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So given the popularity of the 2020 event, what can we expect from state of State of Black Design this year? Because you&#8217;re putting it on again.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So there are a couple of things that I am trying to do differently that I think people can be really excited about. The initial event was really my attempt to give people a space and a platform and not necessarily do so in a manner that felt control or contrived. I really wanted everyone to be able to speak their truth and talk in a way that other conferences haven&#8217;t allowed them to.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And I think that was a part of the success of the initial event. The sheer rawness of some of the discussions, the second event was really making an attempt to continue that on. But part of the response that I was getting was really from companies that were trying to figure out how do we then create this pipeline for designers of color, into industry that we are struggling to fund. So I used this event as a mechanism to create this pipeline.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I was going to use donations and sponsorships to keep the cost of the event free to students, but then leverage that money to pay our speakers as well as make attempts, to offer scholarships to students that are studying design as well. So for this event, the conversation that I had with a number of the sponsors and stakeholders was really along the lines of what are some of the areas that our participants can be best served going forward.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And one of the things we talked about is it&#8217;s great to have these avenues open up where they can interview then IBM, if they&#8217;d like to, or an Argodesign or materials or PayPal, Adobe, and everyone else that sponsored the event. However, especially considering that a lot of these participants are coming from programs that may not have the funding to give the same level of education within design and some other institutions or some folks are participating that are self-taught, it would be amazing to give some professional development opportunities.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So this year I&#8217;ve been speaking to a lot of folks about hosting workshops in order to teach the people that are tuning in some new skill sets that they can use to improve their portfolios or to add new weapons to their utility belt. When not to make a comic book fund to improve their skill sets on a day to day basis, something else that they can pull on to solve complex problems. Additionally, we&#8217;re speaking about hosting projects that can be worked on with particular employers to gain exposure to what particular assignments are like.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So not only can you interview, let&#8217;s say for example, with an NBC Universal, whom will also be a sponsor of the events, but they will also be giving competitions where you can design a movie poster for a film that doesn&#8217;t exist, but it then becomes an opportunity for you to engage with art directors in this particular industry and talk about potential internships or ways that you can improve that work. We&#8217;re also making steps to expand our target base.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And we&#8217;re beginning to invite and have additional programming for high school juniors and seniors. So if you are getting ready to go into a college and your visual creative in your high school, K through 12 education, which you don&#8217;t know what a career will look like as a designer. How to begin it, how to start searching for a community on campus or even the right campus or program to go to. We&#8217;re beginning this process of attempting to educate some of those students as well, to try to set folks up for the success that they&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it sounds like this expanding almost into this career fair. I mean, of course there&#8217;s going to be the different talks and stuff, but you&#8217;re doing also a lot around making sure students are set up with interviews and other opportunities to network with companies.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah. I really want&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m backtracking. After the initial event, there were a lot of companies that, as I mentioned prior that were looking to find ways to diversify their workforce. And if that&#8217;s a discussion that they&#8217;re having, I want to be able to bring people to them, especially when a lot of the participants of these events are also saying that they would love to work for some of these fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
However, I also want to make sure that I&#8217;m providing an avenue by which they can continue to improve the skillsets that they have in between this, the attending our conferences and in between their potential interviews for one position to the other. So, my hope is if a student who begins to attend from their junior year of high school takes advantage of some of the workshops that are there.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
If they continues to attend these workshops and listen to these panels and interview with these companies that have been sponsoring their exposure and the connections that they would&#8217;ve made by the time they&#8217;ve graduated would put them further ahead than it would have if they&#8217;ve never attended and never worked on anything outside of what was in their classroom.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the speakers for this year?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Man, we have a ton of great speakers this year. This year, we will be headlined by Nikki Giovanni, which I&#8217;m super excited about. We will also have Jelani Cobb who will be speaking. We will also have Anne Barry fellow Kent alum. That will be there. We will have Regina Gilbert, Lacey Jordan will be there.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Theresa Moses, Silus Monroe, Maryam Moma, Mike Nichols, Kalina Sales, Roberta Sampson, Raja Shaa, Trey Seals will be giving a workshop on type design. We will have Jennifer White Johnson. That&#8217;ll be hosting a panel on disability design. Kelly Waters will be there. Shelby Zinc from Microsoft will also be there as well, and this is just to name a few. The list is really extensive this year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was going to say, that&#8217;s a lot already.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s an amazing list of people. And I I&#8217;m really fortunate that they have all been willing to participate in this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting, we talked about 2020 just earlier. One thing among many things that stuck out for me that year was just seeing how many Black designers found community online that year. I think because of events like State of Black Design and so many others that started that year. Black designers came around these events and really formed this sense of community. Have you felt that since the State of Black Design?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I feel like the year of the State of Black Design, there were so many things happening within the community and people attempting to build their own table. That I think that year in general, when the first State of Black Design happened, we also had Where Are The Black Designers hosted by Mitzi. Black Ignite, which was hosted just a couple months after that, by Heather Lee. Hughe also had their events as well as myself, which I believe was the last event of the year.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
We were all in communication with one another, especially after our initial events happened. And we&#8217;ve all leveraged one another in order to keep everyone going. We each serve a different role, but have each come together as a family, just to keep things going. So for the second events, I know we had Jasmine Kent from HOW, Heather Lee from Black Ignite and Mitzi all sit on a panel together.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve consulted with Mitzi and Heather Lee on a number of things that I was doing for Black Ignite Heather Lee brought me on to give a keynote. And I say all of this to say, there&#8217;s not only been a community in terms of the following, but the folks that have been attempting to lead these separate initiatives have also been coming together to assist one another. So it&#8217;s a fight and champion for the things that they view as important.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And I feel like that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s been extremely beautiful and powerful when considering three, four years ago, a lot of these spaces weren&#8217;t available. There was no State of Black Design or Black Ignite or Where Are The Black Designers and the followings for each have been extremely impressive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. They really have. I mean, of course, for folks that have been following Revision Path around that time, I talked all about Where Are The Black Designers had Mitzi on the show and everything, but yeah, it is interesting seeing how all of that has&#8230; And I mean, I have to say it has come together very quickly. Even from my somewhat limited perspective of looking at the landscape of the design industry from 2013 to now and seeing how few events and things there were around black designers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Even just media, like when I started Revision Path there was not any other podcast that were talking to Black designers about the work that they&#8217;ve done. And now of course, nine years later, there&#8217;s several others besides myself. But just to see how things have grown in such a very short period of time, I&#8217;m curious to know, why do you think these other events just don&#8217;t get it?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Because what I find interesting aside from the speed of all of this is how I don&#8217;t want to say how limited the resources have been, but y&#8217;all really pulled all this together from nothing. You put out a webpage or you put out a call on Instagram or something and you have thousands of people flocking to you registering, signing up for your event, spreading the word fostering community. And you see a larger slash other design competitions or events and things like that don&#8217;t even come close to that. Why do you think that&#8217;s the case?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s a number of reasons. Going back to my thesis research that I know we talked about in the initial interview, they&#8217;re a large percentage of Black college students that end up going to these. So they end up going to social serving programs because based off of the research I did in my graduate year of college, there are a lot of students that when choosing a major will choose majors that help them either contextualize things they&#8217;ve experienced or choose majors that help them advocate for others. And I think that advocacy piece for a lot of people comes off as being politic. I think with design, while it can be a tool that&#8217;s used for advocacy, it&#8217;s often communicated solely as a tool of luxury.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So even in terms of how conferences typically communicate themselves. So if you go to, not picking at any conference in particular, but if you visit Hughes site, it&#8217;s really all about how to learn the latest and greatest in designing for a fortune 500 company or a major firm that&#8217;s dealing with a fortune 500 company, but it&#8217;s never articulated.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
It&#8217;s never really given any attention to areas that maybe of concern for people of color. And the reason being is that design always wants to come off as being apolitical. In my thesis research, I voted Melissa Harris Perry in her book Citizen.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
She had the segment where she talks about whenever people think of politics. They&#8217;re often thinking about Democrats or Republicans when in reality, the art or of being political is really attempting to pull one person&#8217;s attention from one thing to something else. So if I&#8217;m trying to get you to look somewhere that you&#8217;re not currently looking, that happens to be political.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And then she then makes the argument that being Black in America is really a political act within itself because you&#8217;re consistently attempting to get people to recognize your humanity, so the discussions that we have at a lot of these events are not just about being a better designer or what you can do in the workspace, but it&#8217;s really these difficult discussions around the nuances of being marginalized.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
How do you exist in a space being a Black person where you might be microagressed or the racism that you experience may not be as subtle all the time. It can be subtle, and sometimes it can be very direct, what can you do to protect yourself mentally, emotionally, and physically? What are the courses? How can other people be there for you to support you through these types of things? And in many cases, these are conversations that aren&#8217;t really had in your traditional conferences, but their topics of discussion.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And there there&#8217;re things that Black signers are speaking about whether or not these conferences are including them and not to mention traditional design programs typically tend to keep things very Eurocentric, and they don&#8217;t typically provide much room for cultural relativity or exploration into the cultures that a lot of people of they come from.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So if you now have workshops that are being done. So for example, Trace Seals will be giving his workshop. A lot of his work is predicated on designing typefaces of marginalized audiences. That&#8217;s not something that would traditionally be taught at a design school currently, but if it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s being provided at a workshop, it now becomes something that deals in that nuance and becomes interesting to people that have been marginalized.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
That want to know more about that history but also how do I leverage that history and culture into my professional practice. Black Ignite, HOW Design, Where Are The Black Designers and the State of Black Design each give you an opportunity to have that conversation safely, and also learn to explore visually things that you may not see traditionally in the classroom.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I will say each of those events also are very different. Like State of Black Design is this conference slash career fair Hughe is like a family reunion kind of feel almost Ignite, at least from what I&#8217;ve seen from Ignite is just a bunch of straight up short talks, almost like a, I forget the name of it. What&#8217;s it called PechaKucha. I might be mispronouncing that I&#8217;m&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s sort of a series of short talks and things like that. And then you may have a conference that&#8217;s got more longer, more didactic talks or something. But no, I like that each of these events also has their own flavor. They all feed on each other. They work in concert, at least from what I see with other Black design events that are out there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like, of course the four that you mentioned, which are fairly new, that doesn&#8217;t preclude also the existence of Black In Design, which takes place at Harvard University or Creative Control Fest, which takes place in Columbus or it doesn&#8217;t shy away from those events. Or try to pit one against the other, it&#8217;s all one community, or at least it&#8217;s all one shared community. I should say. If you&#8217;re a black designer now this is probably the best time in history for you to attend events that specifically speak to you as a Black designer, like it hasn&#8217;t ever been, I think this good in terms of variety.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah. At least not that I can recall. And yeah, I feel that wholeheartedly. It&#8217;s really interesting, the entire idea of these separate organizations that really are in support of one another. And aren&#8217;t looking to pit anyone against anybody.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Like no, one&#8217;s asking attendees of one, not to go to the other. And in fact, we&#8217;re usually co-promoting whenever Where Are The Black Designers, HOW or Black Ignite has something if they send it to me, I&#8217;m always promoting and pushing people to attend. And they&#8217;ve done the same thing for me. And it&#8217;s really been appreciated.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;re juggling State of Black Design, of course, with teaching. You&#8217;re a design educator. You&#8217;re an assistant professor at Texas State University in Austin. When you were back on the show, the first time you were teaching at Laroche College, which is in Pittsburgh, what is it like teaching at Texas State? Tell me about your classes, your students, how is it?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Texas state is a really interesting place. It&#8217;s about 30, 40 minutes South of Austin, and also about 30, 40 minutes in north of San Antonio. So it&#8217;s sandwiched between these two major cities and in terms of diversity, it&#8217;s probably the most diverse institution in terms of student base that I&#8217;ve ever taught at.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s really beautiful to see in terms of things that I I&#8217;ve taught there. I typically teach a few design research classes, both at the graduate and undergraduate level, and I&#8217;ve also taught foundations and typography, but I consider myself more to be a design researcher. So I&#8217;m always happier teaching the former than the latter courses.<br>
<b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now, do you have a specific focus of your design research while you&#8217;re at Texas State?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I would say yes and no. So at the graduate level, in the past, I&#8217;ve taught a class called communication seminar, which is an introduction to design research methods that students can use for their thesis. So I begin educating students on research methodologies, like quantitative research methods, literature reviews, so forth and so forth. How do you build your design direction, map out plans, constructing logic models, so forth and so forth. Identifying stakeholders, yada yada yada.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I teach a class called design for experience as well, where I typically tend to leverage some of my own graduate based research around using design not only to using design classroom, not only is a space to develop new skill sets, but also expand considerations on what things could be applicable for. So I&#8217;ll teach design research methods and some UX techniques, but rather than using them for digital artifact, I ask students to expand their thought process on what an interface is.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
It doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be strictly digital, but it&#8217;s anything that anybody interacts with. So if we&#8217;re designing for behavior purposes, how could we use these research methodologies in order to bring about a particular behavioral change versus doing it strictly for additional clicks or site visits or things of that nature? Sometimes we will work in collaboration with other organizations. One summer, I saw the course, we worked in collaboration with Kyahokas Municipality Housing Authority. They were applying for 50 million grant to improve the quality of life for residents in a lower income community.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And we asked to be a part of the project. So we jumped in while they were performing the research and began asking questions to identify certain things that were happening in the community that design could be used to leverage as a solution to improve quality of life. One of the problems that we ended up finding was given the conditions that folks are living in.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
One thing that they definitely were missing was adequate opportunities to build community with one another and communicate with one another while also bottlenecks around communicating with the leasing office and people that managed the property.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So we proposed a number of solutions that had nothing to do with digital components, but were more so interfaces that we can build on the community grounds themselves to improve that person to person and person to business interaction on these grounds in order to change some of the cultural issues that were happening within that particular space.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
This year, there were a few projects that we&#8217;re going to be working on as well, that are all about community engagement, interacting with a group of people, but then attempting to solve a problem for behavioral change while using design as the so, and for me, I find this a lot more interesting than working along the lines of an arbitrary design brief, because I feel like the strictly giving students a brief, doesn&#8217;t give them an opportunity to meet people and expand their thought processes.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And if, as designers we&#8217;re supposed to be this empathetic group, but we never get an opportunity to meet or engage with the people that we&#8217;re designing for. We&#8217;re strictly designing within our own locked in biases. And that can also be very dangerous for marginalized audiences.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So putting them in a position where they have to get out of the classroom and interact with an audience, puts them in a space where they&#8217;re challenging their own perceptions and what a problem is. And if they&#8217;re designing with this audience and as they&#8217;re working, as they&#8217;re meeting them, as they&#8217;re engaging them, it puts them in a, in a process of thinking, my best results or realizing that my best results can come at hand when I&#8217;m working directly with the person who the solution is for versus working behind a desk without ever having to engage with them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious, you&#8217;ve been there now for about three years. How would you say things have changed since when you first started there? Because it sounds like what you are doing right now is something you maybe have to work up to getting to.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I&#8217;m still at a point where I&#8217;m attempting to recommend changes and then get buy-in around those changes, which isn&#8217;t a slight against Texas State. I think the reality is I&#8217;m an extremely young professor. I&#8217;m only 35 years old. And many of the professors around me have been teaching for just as long as I&#8217;ve been living in some cases.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So for me to be this young and come and make attempts to challenge the way that certain things are being done, even if I&#8217;m citing that in new research or things of that nature for any program would be a lot to take in because that whether directly indirectly illuminates that for potential changes to come they&#8217;ll need structural pedagogical changes as well to make room for some of these changes. So I think, for myself there&#8217;s still this need to get buy in or to prove the benefit of particular things that other folks may not be too familiar with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you say you&#8217;ve grown as an educator since you first started teaching?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I think there&#8217;s a number of different things. I think naivete is something that I&#8217;ve shed a lot. Have you ever seen the&#8230; There was a documentary on charter schools? It was called Waiting On Superman.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I saw that.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ve watched it again recently. There&#8217;s a section of the documentary. One of the educators who started a charter school in Harlem was talking about how he went to get his degree at Howard and he&#8217;d learnt so much and felt like as soon as he got out, he&#8217;d be able to change and improve the entire education system within two years, three years, if he was being lazy, but he had all the information necessary and he was going to get in there and make all those changes. I think that&#8217;s where I was when I first started teaching, I was really enthusiastic about the education that I got.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I felt super empowered about it, and I immediately felt like I&#8217;m going to jump in and make all of these changes. The longer I&#8217;ve been teaching, the more I&#8217;ve realized that it&#8217;s never an immediate change. You can never change the flow of the river that you&#8217;re in, but you can disrupt the water.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And if you make these minor disruptions over time, you can make an immediate impact. Well, not immediate, but you can make this impact for that immediate space, but you might not be able to change the flow of the water that you&#8217;re currently in. And I think that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve had to sit with and I guess be more strategic about what impact can I have and what impact will I be okay with having, if I can&#8217;t change the entire flow of the rigor itself?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you think about this state of design education now as it relates to diversity? Because I&#8217;d imagine with the years that you&#8217;ve put on this conference now and even changing to different schools that maybe you have gathered a bit of a reputation, a good reputation, I mean, but from your perspective, how do you see design education?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I think design education is at this really interesting spot. I think there are topics about decolonizing design practice and there are a lot of people that are doing a lot of work on plural versatile approaches professors such as Leslie and Noel that continue to do amazing things and encourage me in a lot of the stuff that I do.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I think there are a lot of folks like Cheryl Miller and her collaborations with designers off of the continent of America and working with Afro based designers and attempting to bring their aesthetic and their design language onto the forefront, I think is also something that&#8217;s really interesting from an institution standpoint and a university standpoint. I think a lot of the difficulty ends up being in people being threatened by that change or being uncertain, how to handle the new wave of demands that are coming for design institutions and programs, especially as the student populist becomes browner from one generation to the next.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I think in a lot of ways, it&#8217;s an exciting time to be a student. And it&#8217;s an exciting time to be a professor and see universities make room for these things to happen. I would imagine a difficult time for those that have no idea what steps to take next. Like if I&#8217;ve never had to consider anything other than Swiss design or anything other than the Bowhouse.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And now you&#8217;re saying that there are all of these other visual languages or aesthetical approaches or cultures that I should include in my curriculum and give equal amounts of respect to this one thing that I&#8217;ve made my bread and butter over the last 30 to 40 years. I can imagine that there&#8217;s a lot of anxiety, but still it&#8217;s necessary. And anxiety is never a reason to be paralyzed by anything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you encountered any of that? Like from other educators?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah. All the time. It&#8217;s usually not as direct as this makes me feel nervous or I don&#8217;t necessarily know how I can stack up to attempting to do this, but a lot of times it may come off in passive aggressive terms of we&#8217;ve done it this way for so long. And maybe you should just learn how to do it the way that we&#8217;ve been doing it before you make re for changes.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah. I don&#8217;t think people ever come out and say that, &#8220;Hey, this makes me feel uncomfortable or insecure about approaching this particular subject matter. Can I work with you on this?&#8221; It&#8217;s usually this attempt to stopping the clock or slowing down change. And that&#8217;s not necessarily me saying a Texas State thing. I think that&#8217;s something that that&#8217;s happening in a lot of places within the industry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ve had a few other design educators on the show particularly last year that spoke to that as well. And also speaking to how, I guess students are looking for more from their design curriculum. They&#8217;re looking for more from their design educators in terms of how they see the world now and the work that they&#8217;re doing, they want to know how can they be more, I guess, involved in different causes and stuff like that. From your perspective, have you seen a similar kind of change over the years from your students?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. So my graduate research, when I was at Kent State University, there were a few interviews that I did where I asked students how they ended up choosing their majors. And there were a number of students that ended up choosing a major just because some of the course material was interesting to them. So there was one student in particular, the group in a predominantly white neighborhood, but that a student was Black.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So that student felt that there wasn&#8217;t enough access that he had to finding out more information about people that looked like him within the city and neighborhood he lived in. So he ended up taking a few African American history courses, and then that ended up becoming his major because he fell in love with the subject matter. I feel like there are a number of visual students that I&#8217;ve taught that have been a part of design programs, both at Texas State and Laroche.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And Tri-C when I taught there. And also at Kent State when I was a graduate assistant and there&#8217;s this interest in exploring visual languages that relate to them culturally, that they can see themselves in. And I think it&#8217;s really amazing for them when they find that, but it does create a space of pedagogical opportunities for professors. If we&#8217;re willing to bravely lean into it. One conversation I had with a few of my cohorts recently, especially considering that Texas and the university is within the Southwest of the nation.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I mentioned, I think it would be a really good idea to start doing research and creating coursework and materials around the influence of San Marcos has a huge Mexican population as is Texas in general, but trying to do this course on the influence of Mexican and Southern American aesthetics on the design language of the Southwest, I feel like you teach a course like that to some of our students that are looking for something different than Swiss and Bowhouse design or your ecentric perspectives on things.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s also another opportunity where you can then teach something that allows a student to have a greater appreciation for a culture outside of themselves. Or give a student an opportunity to further contextualize their own identity and have a greater appreciation for some of the things that they were exposed to without having full knowledge of what the richness of these things were</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, along with those kinds of opportunities. You&#8217;ve also managed to network with and meet a lot of other Black design educators. Tell me how that&#8217;s been.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been amazing to be completely honest with you. I&#8217;ve been able since the first State of Black Design to meet a number of people and try to find ways to collaborate and or talk about new pedagogical approaches or projects that are being offered in classrooms. I&#8217;ve met consistently with Kalina Sales, Dr. Perry sweeper and Dr. Oji in our biweekly DFA meetings and some of the stuff that they&#8217;re working on.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And some of the insights that they share with me are super invaluable in terms of my growth as a professor, I meet consistently with Teresa Moses, she and I are curating a State of Black Design book. And of course, during these meetings where we&#8217;re talking about the book assignments, they&#8217;re consistent topics or the discussion points around what&#8217;s being done in our classroom, Dr. Leslie Noel and I are working on a book called Restorative Design.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I&#8217;m learning a lot about her practice, not just through writing with her, but even some of the experiences she shares and what we&#8217;ve been writing, all of which enriches me in a lot of ways that I may not say to them consistently, but it&#8217;s been an amazing opportunity to see and hear other people that look like me that are dealing with students similar to who I&#8217;m dealing with, give me some of their master tips, or even seeing some of them just blow up and shine in their own career. Professors like Jennifer White Johnson, every time I look up, she&#8217;s doing something else amazing. And the community that she advocates for and the work that she&#8217;s been getting has been amazing to sit back and watch.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you want to see this year? Is there anything you want to accomplish outside of course, of State of Black Design, but what do you want to see this year?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I think the thing that I want to see this year, that I&#8217;m hoping that I can pull off is really this professional development. Well, not really professional development. I&#8217;m hoping that these tables that we build, whether it be Where Are The Black Designers, Black Ignite, [HUE] and the State of Black Design, that we find a way to continue to pouring into our collective audiences, outside our annual conferences.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I know where the black designers has a really good community. They keep in touch via Slack, but trying to find a way to continue growing people in their own personal endeavors, not just through professional development methods, but also just through personal artistic explorations.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I think having a space where we allow other creatives to learn more about what it is that they want to do, but make it give room for people to explore new avenues and develop aesthetics and techniques in their own visual approaches would be something that I would love. And I think it&#8217;s something that we need currently as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And also you teased this book idea a little bit earlier. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah. So after the first State of Black Design, we did a CFP called proposal for essays, from anybody who was interested in contributing. We&#8217;ve gotten the number so far and a commitment to print from Intellect Publishing. So currently Theresa and I are reading through it and making attempts to decide what changes need to be made if there are essays that need to be lengthened and things of that nature, but we&#8217;re hoping that&#8217;ll be published by next year.<br>
<b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Congratulations on that.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Thank you kindly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So overall, and this may be a tall order from where you&#8217;re at now, but aside from this year where do you see yourself in the future five years from now? What sort of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Five years from now. I&#8217;m hoping I have tenure, but the work I&#8217;d like to do, I think it&#8217;s similar to what I was hoping to do in my initial interview. I would to begin a design for social good innovation practice that I do alongside my teaching. I&#8217;m hoping that the traditional classes that I&#8217;m allowed to teach that over time, I&#8217;m given room to change them slightly.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s not just commercial focus, but we&#8217;re giving them techniques and tools that they can use for commercial entities if they choose to, but also allowing them to advocate or contextualize their own experiences through these methodologies as well. I&#8217;m hoping that I can continue to write these books. I&#8217;m hoping that yeah, five years down line, all of these books that I&#8217;m working on currently are published, that I can continue to evolve the State of Black Design to meet the needs of its audience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you, about State of Black Design, about everything you&#8217;re working on? Where can they find that information?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
You guys can find me on LinkedIn. I&#8217;m pretty active there. I do have a site omarisouza.com, and finally, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m pretty active on Instagram, which is just Omari.Souza.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And the event?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
The event is stateofblackdesign.com.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. And by the time this comes out, tickets will be available so people can register to sign up, correct?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yes, sir. Please register. We&#8217;d love to see you guys there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Omari Souza, I want to thank you so much for coming back on show. We&#8217;ve kept in touch since we have done that interview back in 2017. So it&#8217;s been amazing to just see your growth as an educator, as a researcher, and really getting more involved in doing community work with what you&#8217;re doing with State of Black Design. So I&#8217;m excited to see what is going to come next for you in the future. And of course, I&#8217;ll definitely be tuned in for this year&#8217;s event. Hopefully, People that are listen will tune in as well. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
No problem at all. I appreciate you as well for having me and all the advice that you&#8217;ve given me as well since 2017.</p>

<p>After years of asking questions to designers and developers all over the world, now I&#8217;m in the hot seat! For this special mailbag episode, I answer your questions about Revision Path that you sent in from our website and via social media. (And I have to say, you all definitely asked me some hard questions!)</p>
<p>How long does it take to put together a podcast episode, and have I ever had to take an episode down? What happened to our design anthology RECOGNIZE? Why did we have Facebook as a sponsor? What are my thoughts on AIGA? And why do we charge for job listings? Listen to this episode for the answers to these questions, and several others. Keep sending us your questions, and I may do another one of these episodes in the future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So this first question is from Jarvis J., and he asks, &#8220;how far are you from where you thought Revision Path would be right now?&#8221; That&#8217;s a great question. I promise not to say that before every question, although these are some great questions that I got in. I would say very far, but also not far at all.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When I started Revision Path back in 2013, I really wanted it to be kind of an online magazine. And then, I&#8217;d say probably within the first year or so of doing Revision Path and trying to keep it on a fairly regular schedule of it being an online magazine, I discovered it was just easier to make it a podcast. I could turn it around much quicker and stay on a schedule. I would say just that first transition was more than what I thought it would be when I started doing this whole project.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But as far as like where we are right now, and if we&#8217;re far from where I think I wanted to be, I would say yes. I mean, we&#8217;ve been doing this podcast now for almost nine years. I think it&#8217;s been a good, steady resource in the industry. Like people are always coming to Revision Path for one reason or another, whether it&#8217;s finding out about black designers or placing a job or something like that, and I think that&#8217;s been good. However, there are bigger things I would love to do with the show. And we&#8217;ve sort of over the years had opportunities to do some of those things, but just not on a consistent basis. For example, live shows.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We did our first live show in 2017. That was here in Atlanta. We did it with Facebook Design, and that was a great show. We did our 300th episode in New York City at The Greene Space back in 2019. That was good. And in 2020, actually we were planning to do a live tour across the U.S., in conjunction with different chapters of AIGA. So we were going to start in Los Angeles, and then do, and not necessarily in this order, but I&#8217;m going from west to east, but doing Seattle, Houston, Little Rock, Chicago, Atlanta, D.C., New York. That was the plan, because I had talked to people from each of these chapters. We had talked about doing some kind of programming. I was going to just basically pay out pocket to go to each of these places, and schedule and do live shows.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so we did the first live show in 2020 in Los Angeles. That was with Roland A. Wiley. We recorded that at Leimert Park in Los Angeles, and then the coronavirus happened. And then once that happened, the flights got canceled, plans got changed. There was talk of me trying to take these same instances, this tour, I should say, take it online and do digital things. But if you remember spring of 2020, we didn&#8217;t know what was happening. The pandemic was just beginning and people were still trying to figure out what all this was and what we were going to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So the thought of sitting at home and doing a live event on Zoom didn&#8217;t really vibe well with me. Like I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I don&#8217;t know if I want to do that.&#8221; And then also I lost my job because of the pandemic in May of 2020. So I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I really don&#8217;t want to do it now.&#8221; There are bigger goals I have. For a while in the past, Revision Path had a blog. We had a blog with fairly regular entries from guest writers. I would love to continue to do that. I would love to do live shows again, once it&#8217;s safe for us to congregate in that way. And I&#8217;ve even thought of ways that Revision Path could maybe branch out more and do more video things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can tell you this, last year there was&#8230;or there are plans, I should say, because they&#8217;re still on the table, to do some sort of a live video show with Revision Path, like on Twitch or something like that. I think at one point we were talking about doing it with Facebook, and doing it on their Facebook Watch platform. But now Facebook book is Meta, and they&#8217;re doing stuff with the metaverse. And so that kind of fell through a little bit. So I would say right now my goal is just to keep hitting these milestones with the podcast.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;ll hit episode 450 this year. We&#8217;ll hit episode 475 this year. We&#8217;ll hit episode 500 next year. And then of course next year will also be Revision Path&#8217;s 10th anniversary. Do I have plans for those things yet? No. I should probably start thinking about that since it&#8217;s going to be coming up sooner rather than later. I&#8217;d say just in terms of the initial idea of Revision Path with it being this online magazine, and now to it being this sort of steady staple in the design industry for us to have the respect of design organizations, tech startups, tech companies, et cetera, for it to be in the Smithsonian, I would say, is very far from where I thought Revision Path would be. I hope that answers your question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Our next question here is from K.B. who asks, &#8220;how long does it take to put together an episode of the podcast?&#8221; How long does it take? It varies, because putting together the episode, if we&#8217;re just talking about postproduction from when I finished the interview up to when I get it back from RJ, who is our editor, I would say it roughly takes a week. But the thing is, I record so far in advance that RJ just kind of gets to them week by week by week. And so we have a regular production schedule. I record the intro and outro every week. So we record that in the beginning of the week, I pass it on to him. He already has the raw interview file. He does his edits, gets it back to me. I get a transcript done, upload everything, and it&#8217;s good to go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So usually in the postproduction stage, takes about a week. If we&#8217;re talking about everything before that, also kind of adding into it, I would say that also will vary, because when the guest books on the show, that&#8217;s usually everything that I need to go ahead and get started with the actual interview for the episode. So I&#8217;ll do my research. I&#8217;ll put together a few bullet points. Then I have the guest on the show. We do the interview.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I&#8217;ll put it like this, the time that we book for the interview is roughly 90 minutes. 90 minutes doesn&#8217;t mean that we use everything in that 90 minute. We may use probably only about an hour or so of that audio, but I do 90 minutes, one, to handle any sort of technical difficulties that might arise on my end or on their end. Sometimes maybe they&#8217;re not in a super quiet space, or there&#8217;s like mic issues or headphone issues. We work those out before we start recording.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then when the guest is ready, I let them know I&#8217;m about to start recording. We do the recording, we do it all the way through, hopefully, fingers crossed. I&#8217;d say now it&#8217;s much better. Sometimes we would have issues with the recorder that I use or with Skype or with the guest internet connection or with my internet connection. There can always be things that go wrong. But within that 90 minute timeframe, I&#8217;ve got everything I need to go ahead and send off to RJ to start to get the episode together.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
While I&#8217;m doing the interview, I also will take notes, like edit notes to say like, here&#8217;s a timestamp where I coughed, or here&#8217;s a timestamp where the guest dropped something or something like that. And he edits through all of those and it&#8217;s good to go. Roughly the interview portion, including everything else, I would say it takes about like a week or so to put an episode together. I try to do them in advance because I&#8217;m also scheduling them around different events that might be happening, or trying to see which episode can I place in this spot for maximum reach or that sort of thing. So it kind of varies, but roughly about a week, I would say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d say the quickest turnaround I&#8217;ve done on an interview has been maybe a couple of days. Like we record, I get it to RJ, he gets it back to me, and then we have everything together. But if I&#8217;ve got everything that I need to get started, and we request with the guests, we get that going, we record it, I send it off to RJ, get the transcripts, all that stuff, roughly about a week to put an episode together. And then it&#8217;s out for the world to hear.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Ryan B. asks, &#8220;have you ever had to take down an episode for any reason?&#8221; So luckily within the 430+ archive of Revision Path episodes, I have never had to take down an episode; knock on wood about that. I&#8217;d say 99% of what I record with the guests ends up in the final episode. We&#8217;ll edit out a cough or a sneeze or something like that, but there&#8217;s very few episodes that I&#8217;ve had to really aggressively edit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And to that end, because everything that we talk about goes in the show, and the guest has reviewed it and everything, we have not had to take any of those down. Now, what has happened, I&#8217;d say in recent years is that we will get people who will write to the show leaving, I would say the equivalent of a negative Yelp review about the guests, but not about what the guests said on the show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s never about what they said on the show or what I said on the show or our conversation or our topics, but they will leave a negative review about their personal interaction with the guest, and using that as justification for why I should remove the interview, which I never do. If you had a negative run-in with this guest for one reason or another, that&#8217;s on you. That has nothing to do with the episode that I&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And usually these are for like old episodes too. Like ones I&#8217;ve done maybe 3, 4, 5 years ago. There&#8217;s someone that sort of comes out the woodwork and is like, &#8220;Hey, this person said this thing to me or did this thing to me. I don&#8217;t know why you have them featured on your website. You should take it down.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m not going to take it down. That&#8217;s a problem you had with them. That has nothing to do with what I talked about with them, or anything like that.&#8221; So I don&#8217;t take those down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, it&#8217;s a different story with 28 Days of the Web. 28 Days of the Web is our sister site, 28daysoftheweb.com. We do these profiles for every day in Black history month in February, where we profile a different Black designer or developer or something. I have had to take quite a few of those down for different reasons. The biggest reason being that the person just doesn&#8217;t want to be recognized.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
None of the information that I have when I put those profiles together is coming from like some secret private place. Like it comes from their public LinkedIn, their public website. I&#8217;m getting that information from there, so I&#8217;m not creating anything myself. Like it&#8217;s all from them. And so they&#8217;ll see it and they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Oh, well thank you for the honor, but I want you to take this down.&#8221; And so I&#8217;ll take it down in that instance, because it is something that I&#8217;m doing to recognize people that I may, for one reason or another, not have on the show, because I haven&#8217;t reached out to them, or&#8230;I have a long list of people, like potential folks that I could have on the show. I think it&#8217;s maybe about 2,500 people at this point.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So everyone that I have on the show that I could talk to, I can&#8217;t have because we just do it every week. And so some of those people will end up becoming 28 Days of the Web profiles. I mean, even if you go back all the way to 2014 when we started that, you&#8217;ll see some of those people have been guests on the show eventually. Have not had to take down a podcast episode, but I have had to take down a 28 Days of the Web profile here and there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
This next message is from Jordana T. who asks, &#8220;what&#8217;s the biggest blessing in disguise you&#8217;ve gotten from Revision Path?&#8221; I&#8217;d say the biggest blessing in disguise is probably the rooms that Revision Path is mentioned in that I&#8217;m not a part of. I think that&#8217;s probably the biggest thing. I&#8217;ve done this now for a long time. I&#8217;ve interviewed a lot of people, and those people will talk to other people who talk to other people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s oftentimes I&#8217;ll be researching something for work or anything like that, and I run across someone who&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh yeah, I know you. You&#8217;re from such and such.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s probably been the biggest blessing in disguise is knowing that the work that I&#8217;ve done is being mentioned in other rooms and other places without me necessarily having to be in them. That&#8217;s probably the biggest thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think the other biggest blessing in disguise for me is the network that I&#8217;ve been able to build, just personally and professionally. Interviewing all these people has gotten me an in with different companies in different ways, whether that&#8217;s for sponsorship purposes, whether that&#8217;s for consulting or any number of other things. I&#8217;ve been able to get my foot in the door so I can say, oh yeah, I know someone at Microsoft. I know someone at Dropbox. I know someone at Meta, or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s not to say it in a braggy sort of name-droppy sort of way, but it is a blessing in disguise to be able to have that one-on-one access to someone who could possibly get me access to someone else. I think that&#8217;s been the biggest kind of a blessing from the show. Doing this interview-based show is always good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Another big blessing in disguise is honestly just the fact that so many people are appreciative of hearing these conversations. Like I will get messages from people who are just glad that they found this as a resource, whether it&#8217;s through their own research, or a friend or a colleague of theirs is on it. Like hearing back from people, what they thought about the show or what they thought about the interviews, and how much of a help it&#8217;s been to them has been a real blessing. Knowing that I&#8217;m putting something out there in the world that, yes, is educational, and that you&#8217;re learning about these people, but is also inspirational.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m glad that people are finding that inspiration from listening to these stories and listening to people and learning about what they do and being able to expand their own kind of personal knowledge of black designers and the work that black designers can do. Yeah. That&#8217;s kind of been the biggest blessing in disguise from doing this whole thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Next up is this question from Rosie. Rosie asks, &#8220;how come some of the podcasts have transcripts and others don&#8217;t? When will that be fixed?&#8221; The simple question is that some podcasts don&#8217;t have transcripts because I don&#8217;t have the money to pay to get them transcribed. That&#8217;s the easiest way to answer that question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We do have an accessibility sponsor that we&#8217;ve had now probably for the past year, which is this great studio in D.C. called Brevity &#038; Wit. When we were part of the Glitch Media Network back in 2019, we had podcasts for a couple of episodes, well, not a couple, for a lot of episodes. And those are the ones I think in the like 250 to maybe 340 range of episodes, those have transcripts. But no, all of the podcasts do not have transcripts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We use a service called Rev, R-E-V, to do our transcripts. And they&#8217;re roughly, I think it&#8217;s like a $1.25 a word or something like that. So you can imagine with 400 plus episodes, that&#8217;s a lot of money to transcribe all of those episodes. Now, if you are a company out there who would love to sponsor us so we can get all of our episodes transcribed, I would love that. Like please hit me up. I would love to make that happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But no, because of that, that&#8217;s why some of the podcasts do have transcripts, some of them don&#8217;t. One of the goals I would love to have is to have the entire archive transcribed, but that is probably going to happen way off in the future. That&#8217;s something that we have to have the funds to be able to do. I do know that now there are these sorts of automated services where you can send them a MP3 or an audio file of some sort and they&#8217;ll spit out a transcript. They sort of do this speech to text kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But what I find with those is that the transcripts that you get back, unless you&#8217;re speaking in absolute like perfect English, they are always going to be messed up. Like with Rev, I know that there are real people that are transcribing them. So there are certain words and things that they&#8217;ll pick up on and spell correctly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If I use one of these automated services, by the time I get all those transcripts back, I&#8217;d have to then probably go through all of them individually to make sure the words that were said were right, especially if we&#8217;re talking about interviews that have slang terms in them, or the names of companies or things like that, that will be hard to spell out. I guess that would be hard for an AI to kind of figure out, but a human could figure it out. That&#8217;s why not all the episodes have transcripts, but that is something in the future I would love to do. And if you&#8217;re a company that&#8217;s listening and wants to sponsor us to make that happen, I am all ears. Hit me up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, this is a really good question. This one is from Cole M. Cole asks, &#8220;what are your thoughts now about AIGA? In early episodes, it seems like you didn&#8217;t like the organization, but you&#8217;ve also worked with them in the past. And now you have the new president of AIGA as a guest on the show, which is it?&#8221; Okay. Fair enough. I would say I probably still continue to have a complicated relationship with AIGA. Part of that complication, I&#8217;d say it comes in waves.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Back when I was starting out as a designer in the like mid-2000s, and trying to really become a part of the design community in Atlanta, I did reach out to AIGA Atlanta several times, and never really heard anything back. They never responded to my emails. I would go to events. I would feel out of place at events and things like that. And so it wasn&#8217;t until, one, I started this podcast. And two, they saw that I was doing work with AIGA National, that the local chapter here started to pay attention to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d say probably the most egregious example of that is when I spoke at HOW Design Live here in 2016, and the president of AIGA Atlanta at the time had reached out to me, and was like, &#8220;Oh my God, I feel like I should know who you are. I don&#8217;t know who you are. You&#8217;re one of two Atlanta people that are speaking in this conference. We should get to know each other.&#8221; Which I was like, &#8220;Whatever.&#8221; Super transparent. We didn&#8217;t know who you were before, but now that you&#8217;re hot, we kind of want to know more about you, that sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like Cole said, I have volunteered with AIGA. I was on their national diversity and inclusion task force for three years. Did a lot of work there. Ended up making my exit from the organization. And then a few years after that decided to cancel my membership with AIGA. I do have a complicated relationship in that respect. I&#8217;d say within the past, what&#8230;almost 10 years now? I&#8217;ve seen AIGA go through now three executive directors. Like I knew Ric Gref√© back when I started the show. I knew Julie Anixter, who was the executive director, and I still keep in contact with. And I know Bennie, Bennie F. Johnson, who was our 375th episode guest, who was the new executive director of AIGA, not the president.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve had relationships with each of them. Bennie and I actually talk fairly regularly outside of podcast stuff. I would say Bennie, and this is to the organization as a whole, I mean, it&#8217;s over a hundred years old, and they have not done a great job with keeping up with the times. I think anyone that is a modern designer, particularly if you&#8217;re a product designer or a UX designer that came about in the past 10 years, like AIGA doesn&#8217;t really have any relevance for you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s partially the organization&#8217;s fault with not really keeping up, in that respect, with the trends of where the design community has gone. I think they are starting to make those changes now, and starting to become more of a professional organization that offers services and access and information of things that are of importance to current working designers. I can say they did not offer that before.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So like there&#8217;s different conferences and webinars. There&#8217;s like continuing education courses and things you can get now through AIGA. They&#8217;re really trying to turn things around. I&#8217;ll say from the time that I have worked with AIGA, I&#8217;ve even been to the headquarters in New York. Recorded, not an episode there, but I did record an interview there. Got to sit in the AIGA boardroom, and talk to people. They&#8217;re a small organization. I&#8217;ll say that they&#8217;re may be about 25 to 30 people. So they&#8217;re not this like massive group. They&#8217;re a small organization that happens to have these different chapters across the country. And each chapter kind of operates independently, for the most part, of AIGA headquarters.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so a lot of people&#8217;s, I think experience with AIGA, particularly through their chapter, is what colors their perception about the organization as a whole. Certainly that was the case with me. Now that I&#8217;ve worked both with local and with national, yeah, I have kind of a conflicted relationship. Am I an AIGA member now? No, I&#8217;m not. But I do think that they are starting to become an organization that is doing what needs to be done for the modern designer now, which is really be not just an educational resource, but I think also becoming a resource that is important to the design business community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ll give you an example. In Canada, there is a organization called RGD, which is kind of, I don&#8217;t want to say Canada&#8217;s answer to AIGA, but it is a professional organization for graphic designers in Canada. And a lot of employers in Canada really look at your RGD membership as a good thing to have on your resume, or something like that. So if you take the skills tests and things that RGD has, and you are able to put those on your resume, then it means you&#8217;re a designer of a certain caliber.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Whereas I think if you&#8217;re an AIGA member and you put that on your resume, it probably doesn&#8217;t mean anything to most companies. They probably have never even heard of AIGA, or know why it&#8217;s important, or why hiring an AIGA member is a benefit over hiring someone who is not an AIGA member. Those are things that I think the organization still is trying to work out for itself. Those are kind of my thoughts on AIGA.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s still an organization that is doing great things. Like many other companies and organizations, they&#8217;re trying to find a way through this pandemic, because AIGA does and continues to do a good number of in-person events and things like that. It&#8217;s just different when you can&#8217;t congregate like you used to. Like how do you have the big AIGA design conference, for example, that&#8217;s like a four or five day event, how do you have that when everyone&#8217;s at home? You bring it online. And so they&#8217;ve managed to bring it online and make it more accessible to more people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now that they&#8217;re using online as kind of that event space, they&#8217;re able to have other types of events that they can spin up for different sort of niche parts of the design community. They&#8217;re doing what they can. I am still not a member, like I said before, but I think they are taking steps in the right direction to make the organization more of what it needs to be for the modern designer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sarah Z. asks, &#8220;why are you charging for job postings? The job board on Where Are The Black Designers is free, so I don&#8217;t understand why I should post a job here instead of there.&#8221; Okay. So I debated on whether or not I was going to include this question in the episode, because it&#8217;s a question, but it&#8217;s also actually a very common gripe that I get from companies that write to the show. So I figured this would be a good public way to say what I&#8217;m already saying privately to many companies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I understand that companies are trying to diversify where they post their listings. It&#8217;s something certainly I think that has been a thing that&#8217;s been present in the industry, but especially after the kind of &#8220;summer of racial reckoning&#8221; in 2020, a lot of companies were like, oh, we need to seek out the black voices and where the black people are and blah, blah, blah, and all this all kind of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, I get that. And people will look at Revision Path, they&#8217;ll look at other black/POC focused job boards, like Where Are The Black Designers, or People of Color in Tech&#8230;there&#8217;s a number of them. There&#8217;s actually a lot of them now more than there used to be. Some of them do allow you to post for free. Some do have a charge that&#8217;s associated with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When I started the job board, which I think was back in maybe 2015, 2016, I think, the price was $99. So it has not changed the entire time that I&#8217;ve had the job board. Actually, what we did, I want to say around 2016, 2017, was we started to offer lower priced job to your listings based on the type of job that you were posting. So, full-time and part-time jobs were $99, but if it was say an internship or a contract gig or a freelance gig, it would be $49. So we would make it half price.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And what I found was that people didn&#8217;t even want to pay the $49. They expected it to be free. A lot of people expect some kind of discounts. Like I will have multi-billion dollar organizations that will contact me and want a discount on a $99 job posting. Usually they want it for free. But when I say it&#8217;s $99, they want to know if there&#8217;s any discounts. I don&#8217;t offer discounts. Like I keep the price low to make it accessible. I know that if I were to have it for free, everyone would post jobs here, which is not to say that&#8217;s a bad thing. But then on the back end, I would have to spend so much extra time trying to filter out what&#8217;s quality from what&#8217;s not. And what I find to be the differentiator for that is putting a cost on the listing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The cost is $99. We mention it on the podcast, like three or four times when you post it, depending on when it falls within our production cycle. So it&#8217;s getting out to thousands of people worldwide, which I think is a pretty big reach, aside from it just being on our job board. We also used to do a newsletter. We found the newsletter was not very active in terms of people finding out about stuff. So we would just put them right there on the podcast. And actually, if you go to the job board, I think it&#8217;s still there. But if you subscribe to RSS feeds, I don&#8217;t know if people are still doing RSS feeds in 2022, but you can get a RSS feed to the job board. And then you can get the jobs as they&#8217;re posted, like with no delay. So, it&#8217;s a big reach.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And the reason that I have that cost is to make it so I can differentiate between that. There&#8217;s this comparison thing in this question that I also wanted to address, which is, why is this black job board free, but this black job board isn&#8217;t? Don&#8217;t do that. Don&#8217;t do that. If you&#8217;re a company that&#8217;s doing that, don&#8217;t do that. Like, one, black people are not a monolith. But two, we&#8217;re catering to different, I want to say we are catering to fairly different communities with Where Are The Black Designers does, with Mitzi Okou and what I&#8217;m doing with Revision Path.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m sure in the Venn diagram of our two communities, there is some overlap, but it&#8217;s not a perfect circle. So to try to compare and say, well, their job board is free, and your job board is $99. What&#8217;s the deal with that? I mean, it&#8217;s $99 because it&#8217;s $99. Also all the proceeds from the job board go right back of the show. Like the money from that pays RJ. It pays our transcripts. It pays for advertising. So it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m just pocketing the money. I don&#8217;t see any of that money. It&#8217;s a direct loop right back into the show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So every job listing that we get, yes, it makes sure that it goes out there, but then also it keeps the show alive. I mean, for several years we had a Patreon, and we still have a PayPal where you can donate either on a one time basis or on a monthly basis. But I found those weren&#8217;t ways to really keep the show going. The job board really keeps the podcast alive. And so those listings go directly back into the show. So that&#8217;s why I charge that much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One is quality control. And two, because it&#8217;s a source of revenue to keep Revision Path open. Well, I mean, not like it&#8217;s closed like a business, but you know what I mean. It keeps the show going. But I will say, the jobs that we get are from all over. There&#8217;s educational jobs, there&#8217;s private sector, jobs, there&#8217;s small businesses, et cetera. We just did this thing last year, where we created kind of like an enterprise type job board sponsorship. So if you wanted to sponsor for like the entire year for one flat price, which is, to be completely transparent, is $2,000. You can post as many jobs as you want to the job board, no problem. You get a code. You can post them all the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One of the current job board sponsors we have is Work &#038; Co, and they post all the time. I&#8217;m sure if you&#8217;ve listened to this show within the past, what? Maybe like five or six months, there&#8217;s been several Work &#038; Co positions that we&#8217;ve put up. And they&#8217;re a pretty well known reputable agency. As to why we charge for job postings, like I said, one, it&#8217;s quality control. Two, it actually keeps the show going. Like it goes directly back into the production of Revision Path. That&#8217;s why I do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Next. Y&#8217;all are giving me some really spicy questions here. I&#8217;ll answer them. Anyway. This question is from R.G. who says, or who asks, I should say, &#8220;why is Facebook a sponsor of Revision Path? It feels hypocritical given all the harm Facebook has done to this country and this democracy that you would cape for them so hard on this show. Why is that?&#8221; Y&#8217;all are a trip. Okay. I&#8217;ll answer it. I&#8217;ll answer it completely honestly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Revision Path first came on Facebook&#8217;s radar in 2015 back at South by Southwest, when I did the Where are the Black Designers presentation. I did it there. Some people from Facebook were there. They invited me to their Facebook house. For those that don&#8217;t know for South by Southwest, it&#8217;s this big interactive, film, and music festival that takes place in Austin every year. And so companies, particularly for the interactive part, will rent out spaces like restaurants and things like that, and basically turn it into their base of operations, also known as their house. So you&#8217;ll to have like a Facebook house, a Microsoft house, an eBay house, whatever.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So Facebook had a house there, and I got to meet folks. That is how, from doing that, I ended up not only speaking at Facebook to close out their design lecture series in 2016, but also got to visit the campus, be on the headquarters, record a number of interviews while I was out there. And yes, Facebook has, in the past, financially sponsored Revision Path. Facebook has not been a sponsor of Revision Path since 2018, I think, 2018.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When we joined the Glitch Media Network, again, I&#8217;m trying to be as truthful here. I&#8217;m just trying to think of the best way to put it. When we joined that network, the CEO of Glitch, who is Anil Dash, has said a number of very kind of inflammatory things about Mark Zuckerberg, who is of course the CEO of Facebook. And so let&#8217;s just say that that didn&#8217;t really mesh well, the fact that we were joining this network, and Facebook is like, yeah, you know what? They kind of just gave me the silent treatment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So for the year that we were on the Glitch Media Network, Facebook was no longer sponsoring. I think there was conversations and opportunities around re-upping that sponsorship in 2020, but then with the pandemic and everything, it all just kind of fell through. We were even at one point, and this is kind of leading up to our 300th episode, we were going to do that episode at Facebook&#8217;s headquarters in New York, and had been talking about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The team that I had at the time &#8212; shout out to TK and Deanna and Britt &#8212; yhe team I had at the time had even went to Facebook&#8217;s campus in New York to scout it out for the event, but it ended up falling through. We ended up getting The Greene Space. The rest is history. I&#8217;ve had conversations with folks from Facebook since then. Facebook is now Meta, but Meta is a huge organization. Even the people who I talk to back in 2015 have moved on from the company, or they&#8217;re in other parts of the company. So I have to speak to like a whole new person about what Revision Path is and why it&#8217;s important. So I often have to like plead my case to them several times.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And after a while it&#8217;s just like, well, why even bother? Especially once we joined the Glitch Media Network in 2019, and that wasn&#8217;t a fit in terms of being on the network of a company that has openly disparaged the sponsor. Kind of not the best thing to do. I&#8217;ve had conversations with folks from Facebook. I mean, of course we&#8217;ve had still people from Facebook on the show, but they have not been a sponsor for a minute, Facebook/Meta. I mean, even at the top of the year, we had Charlene Atlas, who was a researcher at Meta Labs, their Reality Labs. Yeah, that went fine, but that was not a sponsored thing. We haven&#8217;t spent Facebook&#8217;s money on this show in years, but I appreciate that people are, I guess, calling me out in a way, or calling the show out for that sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I do appreciate that because it keeps me honest. It makes sure that the audience knows like this is where we stand in terms of like certain issues and things of that nature. But no, Facebook/Meta has not been a sponsor for a long time. I could see how, that sort of hypocritical remark, I could see where that would come from, particularly because we were taking their money during the time of like Cambridge Analytica and all that sort of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I get that, but a lot of that information came out after we had already took and spent the money. So like, I can&#8217;t unspent the money and give it back to them. But I also never told them like, we are no longer sponsoring. They just sort of moved on, especially once Facebook themselves got into podcasting. I think, and I&#8217;m speculating here, so if you work for Facebook and this is the case, don&#8217;t come after me, but I&#8217;m speculating that once they got into podcasting themselves, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, why are we sponsoring shows?&#8221; That kind of fell through. And to be honest, I haven&#8217;t pursued it since then.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Rob asks, &#8220;I have a question, but it&#8217;s about something related to Revision Path, RECOGNIZE. What happened to it? And is it coming back this year?&#8221; I&#8217;ll answer that second question first, which it is not coming back this year. I&#8217;m not sure when RECOGNIZE is coming back. I do want it to come back, but it&#8217;s not coming back this year. As far as what happened to it, tail as old as time, we don&#8217;t have the money to put RECOGNIZE on. That&#8217;s kind of the biggest reason behind it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The first year that we did RECOGNIZE, we received a grant from InVision from their Design Forward Fund, and that allowed us, one, the opportunity to pay the illustrator and to pay the writers for their finished edited submissions. But then it also meant that it would have the audience of InVision on their blog, which I think is called Design Together, I believe is what it&#8217;s called. So we had that big kind of megaphone and platform for the first year of doing RECOGNIZE.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The second year, we started it in 2019. The theme in 2019 was Space. And then we started in 2020, and the year, the theme for 2020 was Fresh, I believe. The pandemic kind of put just a big rain cloud over the entire kind of, I don&#8217;t even want to call it a competition, because it&#8217;s not a competition, but it put big rain cloud over the entire process, because people aren&#8217;t thinking about trying to submit to a design anthology when they&#8217;re just learning about this virus and how it&#8217;s spreading and what they can do to try to protect themselves from it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We did receive a fair number of submissions, but what happened was we got, I think we got down to six, that were kind of good ones that I wanted to move forward with. And then four of them completely just dropped out of the process. They were like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time for this. I&#8217;m too stressed. I&#8217;m too this.&#8221; Which I completely understand. And we ended up just proceeding that year with two authors, Regine Gilbert and Kahlil Crawford, I believe is his last name. And we published those. Those two ended up also getting republished in A List Apart. Shout out to Aaron Gustafson, who&#8217;s the editor-in-chief over at A List Apart for helping to make that happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But the interest, because of the pandemic kind of died out. Plus I had just lost my job. I was paying for all of this out of pocket, like out of savings and everything. So it just got to the point where it&#8217;s like, oh, this is a lot. And even as I thought about the third year, I wanted the theme for 2021 to be Reboot. And we had made graphics for it and did a campaign. I think the open time was like three months, which is the largest submission period that RECOGNIZE has ever had, to give people enough time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And we got a number of submissions. And then after reading through all the submissions we got, I didn&#8217;t feel any of them were good enough to kind of move forward on. There were like three or four that I&#8217;m like, well, maybe if we shifted this and changed this. But then just kind of stepping back and looking at the entire process with how much it was going to cost and how much time it was going to take to work with these authors. And the fact that these submissions were just not really up to the quality that we used to get. The quality really decreased from year to year of the submissions.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I made the executive decision in 2021 to just put the hiatus on RECOGNIZE. One, because, like I said, the quality just wasn&#8217;t that great. I mean, it&#8217;s hard to put out a design anthology of essays when the essay prompts that you&#8217;re getting, or the essay submissions you&#8217;re getting have nothing to do with the theme that we put forward. Like the theme was reboot, and we were getting just basically things that people wrote about whatever they wanted to. They wrote about nothing that had to do with design. They just wrote stuff. Some people sent in designs, which&#8230; it&#8217;s a literary anthology, so you don&#8217;t need to send me something visual. So the quality just was really not that great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then looking at how much it was going to cost in terms of editing, paying the illustrator, paying the writers, I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I just don&#8217;t have the money for this.&#8221; So we didn&#8217;t have a sponsor or anything lined up for it. And so that&#8217;s why I ended up putting it kind of on hold. One of the things I would love to do in the future is bring it back, but bring it back in like an actual printed form. I&#8217;m working on a project right now, at the job where I&#8217;m at, where we&#8217;re making an actual magazine, like a print magazine. And so I&#8217;m able to work with printers and see how much it costs and all the kind of behind the scenes stuff that goes into making a print magazine.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m like, I think RECOGNIZE would be great as like an annual digest of some sort, but that would require, I think, many more submissions, many more quality submissions, in order to make that happen. Not to mention the price to print and ship, which was much less than I thought it would be once I really started doing research. That&#8217;s what happened with RECOGNIZE.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The quality of the submissions greatly decreased. The pandemic I think just took a lot of wind out of people&#8217;s sales for wanting to contribute to something like this. And I didn&#8217;t have the funds to really keep it going on my own. If we get a sponsor that&#8217;s able to make it happen, then maybe we&#8217;ll bring it back. To answer that second part of your question, again, it is the not coming back this year, and I don&#8217;t know when it will come back in the future, but it will come back. I do want to bring it back, I just don&#8217;t know when.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Medina D. asks, &#8220;I recommended a friend of mine to be a guest on the podcast. When are you going to interview them?&#8221; So this particular guest that Medina is talking about, I&#8217;m not going to say who the guest is, but I have already reached out to them, just waiting for them to hopefully respond, and we can make that happen. But I do want to sort of pull the curtain a little bit back on how we have guests on the show and how this process works. Because I would say within the past maybe year, maybe the past two years, I&#8217;ve gotten a lot of people who want to come on the show who it&#8217;s very clear they&#8217;ve never heard the show before at all. And the only reason that they want to be on the show is because it&#8217;s a black podcast.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I will get any number of people in a number of different fields. Many of them not even designers. I&#8217;ll get nonprofit CEOs. I&#8217;ll get marketing people. I&#8217;ll get authors of business books, all want to come on the show and talk about my book. Oh, I want to come on the show and talk about this project that I&#8217;m doing, and it doesn&#8217;t fit with the tenor of the show. They&#8217;ll say they&#8217;re a big fan. And I&#8217;m like, well, clearly you&#8217;re not a big fan because you would know that we don&#8217;t cover this sort of stuff on the show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d also say probably the interesting thing is that many of these people who do this are also not black. Is it a black show? Yes. Because I&#8217;m a black host and I talk to black guests, and that&#8217;s the thing about the show. Like I talk to black designers and black tech people too, but I try to be very deliberate in that, because what will happen sometimes is that I think, one, because Revision Path has been around a long time. And because we do kind of straddle between design and tech, Revision Path is often miscategorized as a show for people that it&#8217;s not even about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So like for example, people will say, oh, well, Revision Path is a show about black designers in Silicon Valley. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s not geographically specific in that way. Or people will say, well, Revision Path is a show that talks to BIPOC creatives. We don&#8217;t talk to BIPOC creatives. We talk to Black designers, creatives, artists, that sort of thing. So I have to be very deliberate in that, because oftentimes Revision Path just gets lumped into the overall &#8220;diversity in tech,&#8221; or, I guess diversity in design conversations too, but in a way that makes people think that they can just come on the show for whatever reason, even if they don&#8217;t fit sort of what the guest roster is, or what the theme of the show is about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When I do have guests on, I try to let them know that even if there is a particular project that they want to plug, the interview is not just about the thing you want to plug. Like we&#8217;re not that kind of show. First of all, because I record in advance, like up to a month in advance. Like by the time you hear the interview, it&#8217;s been at least a month or so since we&#8217;ve had that conversation. It&#8217;s hard for me to do really timely things. And I do that on purpose to keep our production schedule pretty lean in that respect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But secondly, if you just come on the show and it&#8217;s all about, here&#8217;s the one thing that I&#8217;ve done, that doesn&#8217;t make sense in the entire archive of the whole show, because it&#8217;s about people&#8217;s individual journeys as designers, as developers, et cetera, et cetera, not about this one thing they did this one time with this one company that they worked with. It doesn&#8217;t become this sort of evergreen sort of thing, if you just want to come on and talk about one particular thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I don&#8217;t know. I think Revision Path has ended up in some PR database, because I get all kinds of folks that are like, &#8220;Oh, I want this person to be on my show. And they&#8217;ve done this, this and this.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, this is a white man. Why would I have them on the show? You looked at the guests, do you see that I have white men on the show? What&#8217;s not clicking? I don&#8217;t know. They&#8217;re clearly not paying attention in that respect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But to put a finer point on Medina&#8217;s question about the friend that she had said wants to be on the show, oftentimes people will recommend like friends of theirs, colleagues of theirs, et cetera, to be on the show. And I like that. I love to get that sort of warm referral. What I will ask is that if you do that, please supply enough information to me, so I don&#8217;t have to hunt down who this person is. Like for example, someone will say, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve got a really good friend who should be a guest on the show. Respond back and I&#8217;ll tell you who it is.&#8221; I&#8217;m not going to do that. Why don&#8217;t you just tell me who it is instead of having to play this kind of back and forth game.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Or they&#8217;ll give very little information like, oh my friend Alan would be a great designer. Okay. Alan who? Does Alan have a last name? Do you have a link to Alan&#8217;s website or LinkedIn, so I can find out more information about this person whom you&#8217;re recommending? Make my job a little easier by giving me the information, especially if this is like a friend or a colleague of yours that you want on the show. Like, help them out. Like help me out, but help them out too, to make sure that that information is correct.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, when I do outreach, and I guess this is sort of branching out from your question a little bit, Medina, but when I do outreach, I try to make sure that I connect via email. One, because I just have my one inbox, and it&#8217;s just easier for me to manage it that way. If you&#8217;re a designer that&#8217;s got a contact form or something like that, just make sure that it works. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I go to a person that I would love to interview, and I go to their website, and there&#8217;s absolutely no way to contact them. There&#8217;s no social media links. The contact form doesn&#8217;t work. There&#8217;s no email address listed. It&#8217;s like, how am I supposed to reach out to you?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And maybe they don&#8217;t want to be reached out to, which is fine. That is totally something that you can do, that people can do. I don&#8217;t feel any sort of negative way about that, because for a while in my career I was very much the same way. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk to me, just let me do my work.&#8221; But it becomes harder when there&#8217;s not really an easy way to contact the person, or I don&#8217;t have enough information for me to do even preliminary research to see if this person would be a good fit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Also because I do record very far in advance. Just because you send me this person&#8217;s name, I may not get to them for months, because I already have other people whom I&#8217;ve reached out to, or there&#8217;s just other folks in the queue. So it may take me a while to finally get around to that person, but I&#8217;ll get onto them eventually. I have a long list of about, I think I mentioned this earlier, maybe about 2000 to 2,500 people, that I could reach out to. Like I go through that list pretty regularly when it comes to reaching out to folks because I&#8217;ve been keeping the list now for nine years, and I&#8217;m continually adding to it and such. And so I make sure that when people recommend folks, I do move them to the top of the list.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d also say, let that person know that you are recommending them. So that way if I reach out to them, it&#8217;s not this, well, who are you? And what is this show? And blah, blah, blah, that kind of thing, because then it&#8217;s weird. It&#8217;s like, okay, well your friend recommended me, or your colleague recommended you to come on the show, and they often don&#8217;t even know. So like, let your friend know, copy them on the email or something. Help them out as well. But yes, to Medina, I did reach out to your friend. If they happen to get back to me, I would love to have them on the show. Let them know that I reached out to them, and then they can respond, and we can make that happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. We&#8217;ve got time for one last question, and this comes from Maya W. who asks, &#8220;you always ask a guest where they see themselves in the next five years, where do you want Revision Path to be in the next five years?&#8221; My overall aspiration for Revision Path is to grow this into becoming a multimedia network. The biggest reason I think is to grow beyond being typecast. I mentioned before about how Revision Path is often kind of misnamed or mislabeled as all these other things that it&#8217;s not. Being able to grow Revision Path into a network allows or would allow me more places to really say, this is what this is about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What I&#8217;m envisioning with this kind of multimedia network is we still continue the podcast, because that&#8217;s the main keystone of all of this. I&#8217;d want to keep that. Maybe expand out to do other types of shows. There are other shows I would love to do. I would love to bring on other hosts on this platform. Maybe acquire some shows, have like a Revision Path network. That would be great. I would love to do something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I would want to have an editorial arm at Revision Path, where we bring back the blog and have a regular staff of writers. We bring back RECOGNIZE, and make that a printed annual design anthology. And I would even lump 28 Days of the Web into that as well. Like bring that under the whole editorial arm. And then branch out and do video as well. I sort of teased that a little bit, about the possibility of doing some sort of a weekly live show, maybe on Twitch or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I also want to do short documentaries or licensed short documentaries, licensed web series, things like that. Basically really build this out so Revision Path becomes kind of a staple in the Black community that deals with design. When I started Revision Path, I&#8217;d say probably one of the thing that I really wanted to do was make sure to inform people about who Black designers are. Like why are we doing this? What&#8217;s the reasoning behind all of this?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Part of this also even stems from research that Cheryl Miller, who, AIGA medalist. We&#8217;ve had her on the show before. Has talked about her 1985 thesis around basically why is it that there aren&#8217;t more Black designers in the industry? And part of that being that a lot of Black parents don&#8217;t really understand like what design is, or they think of it as a hobby and not an actual profession.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so one of my hopes with expanding Revision Path into being this multimedia network is to provide enough information so people know like what design is. Like the black community knows like this is what design is. These are all the different sorts of things that you can do. And it&#8217;s as viable of an option to go into as if you were to go into medicine or to go into sports or to go into engineering or whatever. You just have more information.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, granted there&#8217;s been a lot of talk and initiatives and things around STEM. Arts kind of gets lost in that. Sometimes it&#8217;s lumped in as STEAM as opposed to STEM, so the A gets thrown in there. But I want Revision Path to be this multimedia network that really lets people know that creativity in the Black design industry of course is something that we&#8217;re known for. These are the types of people that are doing it. These are the positions that are available. These are career paths that you can take. Basically just provide more information.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like I&#8217;ve been very fortunate that I know that the show is even taught in some schools. Current designers are learning about this show and learning about the people on this show to help inform them as designers when they get out there in the world and create new things. Imagine the kind of reach that Revision Path can have if we&#8217;re able to do that through more ways than just this podcast.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Podcasting is great, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but I also realize that the platform is the barrier to getting out to more people, because everyone&#8217;s not going to listen to a podcast. They may watch a YouTube video. They may read an article or something like that, and so to allow Revision Path the space to grow into those particular types of media would be great. Next five years I&#8217;d want to do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And of course be able to do Revision Path full time. Like right now Revision Path is very much still my nights and weekends project, because I work a nine-to-five job. I would love to do Revision Path full time, and have the sustainable revenue from patrons and from companies and from sponsorships to be able to really do this full time and really crank out a bunch of great stuff. It&#8217;s not still just me, because I do have a small team, but to even be able to expand that team out to do more would be great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Next five years, I hope to be there. I am putting things in place to make that happen. I just brought on a sponsorship director to help with getting more funds in for the show. And turn that revenue into these things that I want Revision Path to eventually become. I&#8217;ve got a plan for it, I just have to try to work the plan, and hopefully within the next five years we will be there, and you will be there too.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re headed to the Great White North this week to meet someone that I learned about while doing a deep dive on Nigerian artists. Emmanuel Nwogbo is a visual artist based out of Montr&eacute;al, and to me, his work reminds me so much of the creativity and fun that design can create.</p>
<p>We chatted right around his first anniversary of moving to Canada, and we discussed his day job as a graphic designer, and how his passion for the arts inspired him to leave Lagos. We also talked about <a href="https://www.mister365.ca/365-project" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">his 365 James Bond Characters project</a> &#8212; a series of designs and compositions paying homage to characters in the 007 Universe. Emmanuel&#8217;s quiet confidence is one of his biggest strengths, so don&#8217;t be surprised if you see his work in a gallery near you one day!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
My name is Emmanuel Nwogbo. I am from Nigeria. I am a graphic designer, so I work full-time as a graphic designer. I also do freelance graphic design, and I also do some visual arts. At the moment, I do the visual arts on the side.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So how has 2021 been for you? Did you learn anything new about yourself? How has the year been?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Honestly, its probably one of my best years so far. So I moved to Montr√©al at the end of 2019, and then 2020 happened, so 2020 was a very strange year. So 2021 was like my first full year in Montr√©al. Honestly, it went really well. It went really well, I pretty much hit all my goals, so that was a very exciting. It was also my first summer in Montr√©al, which everyone was &#8230; People really hype up the summers here. I can see why. So this was my first real experience of the summer in Montr√©al. It was a little restricted still because of COVID, but honestly, I think I had a pretty good year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What makes the summer so nice in Montr√©al?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
There&#8217;s so much to do. There&#8217;s so much going on here, event wise. There&#8217;s always something happening. You never run out of stuff to do. Typically, without any COVID or anything like that, there&#8217;s a ton of festivals that come in town and all that. It wasn&#8217;t as much as it typically would be, but there was still a lot of things to do here. There&#8217;s a lot of sports, a lot of physical activity, parties. There&#8217;s a lot. Honestly, I was a little bit overwhelmed at some point. It was a lot of things happening. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds like Atlanta in the summertime.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Really?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Or really in the late spring, going into summer, because that&#8217;s sort of our festival season, and where there&#8217;s usually a festival, a neighborhood festival or something every weekend or something. I say that&#8217;s usually the best time to come because it&#8217;s not too hot, the pollen is usually not too bad around that time. It&#8217;s maybe a two or three week period where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, this is perfect.&#8221; We have that in the spring, going into the summer, and we have it in the early fall. Because it never really gets super cold here, so early fall, I don&#8217;t know, like back to school, September, October, is usually a really nice time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, that&#8217;s good to know about Montr√©al though. Maybe when the world starts to open back up, people can experience some of those summers.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Yeah, but you only want to come here in the summer, honestly, because winter is just miserable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh man.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
There&#8217;s no fall. It&#8217;s summer, then all of a sudden it is just winter.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh man. So for 2022, do you have any goals or resolutions that you want to share?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So usually I try to set goals and plans. The only thing on my list for next year right now is to get my citizenship, become a Canadian. That&#8217;s the only thing on my list right now. I started the process this year, I submitted an application, so now I&#8217;m just playing the waiting game, but that&#8217;s the number one thing on my list.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Second &#8230; I would say this is kind of the second thing on the list, but I&#8217;m not really sure how it&#8217;s going to go. I decided I was going to try to do some exhibitions in Montr√©al, because I haven&#8217;t done any since I moved here. So, try to break into the art scene a little bit. Honestly, I&#8217;m a little bit overwhelmed by it, because it&#8217;s a big city, and there&#8217;s a lot of art here, there&#8217;s a lot of competition. So there&#8217;s that little fear there. So I am going to attempt to see if I can do some exhibitions next year. If not next year, then maybe 2023. It&#8217;s a little difficult given that I have my full-time job and I have my own personal practice. Yeah, but those are the two main things that I have planned for next year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of the full-time job, you work for MTL D√©veloppement. You work there as a graphic designer. Tell me about that entails. What&#8217;s a regular day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So the company is a real estate development company, so they build condos, they sell condos. So essentially my job there is to make promotional materials for the marketing department, essentially materials that help sell these condos. And so for each condo project, we create an entire brand around that project, and then we then try to create ads, and our design is based on that brand that we created. So the company itself has its own brand and then each of the projects has a brand that comes with it. So my job essentially is to create those brands and to design for those brands, and to make sure that everyone that is doing anything for the brands is adhering to the brand identity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So you&#8217;re doing this for, let&#8217;s say, like condominium complexes or subdivisions?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
It&#8217;s mostly condominiums.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. All right. I got you. Sounds like Montr√©al is probably a pretty booming real estate market then?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s pretty booming, despite the fact that there was a pandemic. It&#8217;s still booming.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has it been working during the pandemic?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
I wasn&#8217;t really affected too much. I think there was maybe a one or two month period where my hours were reduced. So we had to go on this program that the government would &#8230; I think you work out pay &#8230; You say about maybe 20%, and the government would pay the rest, so I had to cut down to like 20 hours for about a month or two, but I pretty much worked all through the pandemic. So, worked from home, worked in the office, worked from home again, and then now we are back in the office since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So the job was pretty much not affected, but obviously there was a reduced &#8230; The real estate market suffered a little bit, so there was reduced sales. So the marketing was totally &#8230; It was a little bit different than what it is right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Also, with the work that you are doing as a designer, you work with another design agency called Queer-IT. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So that job, that&#8217;s actually the first job that I got in Montr√©al. So I came in October and then I got a job in November of 2019. And essentially, I saw this ad where they were hiring, looking for a graphic designer, because I was just applying for every graphic designer job I could see. So I saw the ad and had an interview with the person that runs the place, and then they just hired me.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
But essentially, what the job we is, is you give them your hours and then they send proposals to you based on your hours, or sometimes they just reach out to you and ask you to send the quote for a certain job. And then if the client accepts your quote, then they give you the job. Or sometimes they just tell you, &#8220;Well, this client wants to rebrand. Their budget is $2,000. Can you work with that?&#8221; That kind of thing. That&#8217;s basically how the system works.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
But essentially, it&#8217;s basically still like every graphic design job, except that I would say the company is maybe targeted more towards queer people. So that&#8217;s one thing that I was a little confused about when I got hired, or when I applied for the job. When I applied for the job, I said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not queer, so are you only hiring queer people?&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Oh no, you can apply.&#8221; So yeah, I applied and I got the job.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. It sounds like a collective model, where you&#8217;re not necessarily working full time, but as work comes in, if you have the time to work on it, they pull you into the project, they include you on the proposal. You&#8217;re sort of part of the working team for whatever that project might be, if they happen to land it.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Exactly, that&#8217;s how it goes. And then there&#8217;s some projects that I did with them where the client was doing a full business plan, so there was like a strategist there, there was a copywriter, and we work as a team to deliver the project.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I want to switch gears here a little bit as you&#8217;ve been talking about your work, because I&#8217;m curious to know more about you growing up. Because you&#8217;re really a prolific artist, and I think that&#8217;s something that I really want to explore more as we go on in the interview.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a big one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So I grew up in Lagos, Nigeria. So Nigeria is the most populous black nation in the world, over 200 million people. And Lagos probably has a [inaudible 00:11:51] 30 million people. Nobody knows the real number, because the census is very funny, very corrupt. But Lagos is huge. I grew up in Lagos.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Lagos, I would say, it&#8217;s pretty much &#8230; It&#8217;s a crazy city. There&#8217;s so much going on there, there&#8217;s so much crime, so much corruption. But again, even besides all that stuff, there&#8217;s a lot of art, there&#8217;s a lot of, I would say, heritage that comes with it. Lagos is an old city. It&#8217;s probably one of the oldest modern cities in Nigeria. So there&#8217;s always something going on.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So growing up, I wasn&#8217;t exposed to too much arts in a sense, but I&#8217;ve always had the talent to draw. I always knew how to draw, so I was always in the fine art class. And even when I went to high school, which is secondary school in Nigeria, you had to pick certain subjects. A lot of people were not doing fine arts, we were very few doing fine arts. Maybe 20 in the class. When I say 20 &#8230; This school was a big &#8230; I went to public secondary school, so it was a government public secondary school. It was huge. My graduating class had 506 people in it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Yeah. So it was a big school. Out of that 506, there was probably maybe 15 or 20 people that were doing fine arts. So that was my main exposure to arts. And honestly, the arts are not really supported in Nigeria. I think it&#8217;s a miracle that even my parents allowed me to go do arts at university. A lot of people were not happy about that. Because the general belief is that if you&#8217;re not a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer, you&#8217;re not making money. So there was always that to battle with, but I would say that &#8230; Honestly, the truth is a lot of artists are not making money in Nigeria. I also think it&#8217;s the way they present themselves. Art is not really respected, but then there&#8217;s also people making a lot of money it from it too. So I think it&#8217;s all about positioning and how you market yourself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s so interesting, because I was going to ask about whether or not your parents supported you in this, but it sounds like you really got that encouragement from school to focus on arts and everything. When you decided that you wanted to go to college for the arts and for design, were your parents okay with that?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So they were totally okay with it. I didn&#8217;t know anything about design growing up. I was an artist in traditional media, so drawing, painting. So when I wanted to go to school, I wanted to do fine arts. And then I got the admission, and then I got to the school and then I did one year in fine arts. And then I had this friend that was doing graphic design and he would just make cool stuff on Photoshop. So I decided, &#8220;You know what? I want to make cool stuff.&#8221; So I just switched. That&#8217;s how I ended up in graphic design.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
But the program that I did was kind of an interdisciplinary program, in the sense that there was no real focus. We did a lot of things like art history or cover the art movements. We also did 3D &#8230; I did a full year in of 3D in design. I also did web design, I did regular graphic design, logos branding. We did everything, but there was no real focus. So even when I came out of college, I didn&#8217;t exactly know what I was because then it&#8217;s like you know how to do a little bit of everything, but you&#8217;re not really good at one thing.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
But the one thing that lacked in that whole school was research, because there was more focus on the finished product. But then as I&#8217;ve come to learn, a lot of design relies heavily on the actual process, not as much as the finished product. So when I came to Canada, to NSCAD, to do the Masters, it was a totally different experience. Because then at NSCAD, they were focused on research. That&#8217;s when I learned how to do research.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
And so they wanted me to do something &#8230; Because the Masters program has a thesis, like a final project. So they wanted me to do something Nigerian based. So I ended up doing this &#8230; I decided to tackle a social problem, so I decided to focus on the oil industry in Nigeria. So oil was discovered in Nigeria in 1956, and Nigeria is divided into four parts. There is a North, which is pretty much half of the country, and then there&#8217;s the South South, Southeast, and then the Southwest. I&#8217;m from the Southeast. So Nigeria has three tribes: Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa. So the Hausas are predominantly in the north, the Yorubas are predominantly in the Southwest, the Igbos are predominantly in the Southeast. And then the South, Southeast covers a lot of minorities.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
But at the time, when oil was discovered, oil was only discovered in the South South. So what that meant was that oil exploration, all the illegal practices that companies like Shell and all this other big oil companies, all the illegal practices and everything, all the nonsense that comes with oil exploration, only happen in the South South. But the Nigerian economy is pretty much only reliant on oil. So what that means is that that part of the country produces pretty much most of Nigeria&#8217;s revenue and sustains Nigeria&#8217;s economy. But then the people are suffering because Shell has so much influence in the Nigerian government. And so what that means is that they&#8217;re pretty much allowed to get away with whatever they want.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So the oil industry is regulated, but it&#8217;s regulated to a point. Like I remember when I was doing the projects, around 2015, then there was an average of 1,000 oil spills in Nigeria every year. And that&#8217;s the reported ones. But in Europe they only had like seven in the last 10 years. So that&#8217;s how much oil spillage happened in Nigeria, and that&#8217;s because of illegal practices of mostly Shell. So my whole project was focused around how can we create awareness, because usually the only time you can get the Nigerian government to do something about it is when there&#8217;s pressure from the international community.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
But the Nigerian government does a really good job at hiding this whole problem. There&#8217;s a good 30 million people in this part of Nigeria, in this South South region of Nigeria, but even when I was growing up in Lagos, you only heard about this problem when the people in the area got upset. And then they created rebel gangs, and then they started kidnapping white oil workers, and asking for ransom. That&#8217;s when you started hearing about it.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
But on a regular basis, you wouldn&#8217;t &#8230; Like people would die all the time there, there was huge respiration problems, there was huge pollution issues, nothing was ever covered in the news. Or if it was covered, it wouldn&#8217;t be highlighted upon.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So the whole focus was how can I create awareness to this problem? And then that awareness would force the Nigerian government to treat the people of that region well. And one major issue that Nigeria has, and even till now, is that even though Nigeria runs a federal government, the government is more unitary. Because I know, for example in the US, and even in Canada here, each province or state has control of its resources and everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, pretty much.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Yeah, in Nigeria it&#8217;s the opposite. Even though we also have a federal government, all the states &#8230; We have 36 states, and each state, everything each state generates or makes goes to the center, and then it gets divided at the center to all 36 states based on some metric they come up with. So what that means is that the region or the country that was responsible for, say, 90% of the economy, by the time everything gets split based on population and other metrics they have, they get 15% back. But they are the ones taking all the damage, and so their whole protest has always been we want hundred percent control of our resources. But I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to happen anytime soon.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So initially when the rebels started, it started up as a small operation, and then it became a big time operation. They were kidnapping oil workers, they were killing government officials. 2006 was the peak of the rebels in that area. And they were getting their money from oil bunkering, which is also contributing to the problem. Oil bunkering is when you break a section of the crude oil pipeline, and then you take crude oil from it and then go refine it and then sell it.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So they were doing that and they were making money to fund their operations, but that was also contributing to the problems, because that was causing oil spills and all the same environmental damage that the region was facing. And that region is right by the Atlantic ocean and then River Niger, which is the second largest river in Africa, and also runs through that region. So most people there are predominantly fishermen, and the water and the ecosystem is totally messed up. I think it&#8217;s going to take like a hundred years of no oil exploration for the environment to return back to its natural state. That&#8217;s how bad they&#8217;ve wrecked it.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s what I spent almost two years doing in the Masters. And it honestly was a very successful project. It taught me lots about Nigeria that I didn&#8217;t even know about. And it was an interesting research in the sense that me being Nigerian, and knowing all the nonsense that goes on in Nigeria, and then me now being outside Nigeria and trying to do all this research, and then reading research papers and materials from people that have been to Nigeria and seeing their take on Nigeria was pretty hilarious. There&#8217;s some American articles that I read about the same problem in Nigeria, and there are some claims they made and they said, &#8220;Well, this doesn&#8217;t happen.&#8221; Or, &#8220;This never happens.&#8221; Or the way they tried to exaggerate certain things was &#8230; Yeah. It was actually interesting to see that from a different perspective.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, that&#8217;s a lot that you just described around Nigeria and corruption in the country, and I definitely want to go back and touch on that, but I want to bring it back a little bit, because you took us all the way from college, to going to grad school, to going to Canada. It sounds like, back when you were mentioning this program, that it didn&#8217;t really prepare you for the working world. Was that the impetus to move to Canada? Did you just want to get out from another country? Because it sounds like you moved from Nigeria to Cypress, which is where this university was located. And then what spurred the move, of all places, to go to Canada?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
What spurred the move was I&#8217;ve always wanted to come to the west, so it was either Canada or US or maybe the UK. I left school in 2014 February. That&#8217;s college. But I was already applying to several schools. So I got to teach university in Arkansas, and good thing I didn&#8217;t go there because I don&#8217;t know who lives in Arkansas but &#8230; Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You would not have liked it. You would not have liked it.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
But the reason I ended up Nova Scotia was because the school has a little bit of reputation. I heard about the school and the founder of the school is Anna Leonowens. So I just wanted to go to the school, because the school had a reputation in the art community. I didn&#8217;t know anything about Nova Scotia, I didn&#8217;t know anything about the school. I just did some quick research. It&#8217;s the smallest place I&#8217;ve ever lived in. I think it&#8217;s like 300,000 people in Halifax. So that was a complete shocker to me. It was a totally different experience. I just wanted to come to Canada, right? I wanted to come to Canada or US, but Canada just seemed to work out better. And my dad has always preferred Canada, because he doesn&#8217;t like America because of the guns, and the fact that most people are just a little bit crazy in America.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s fair. That&#8217;s a fair assessment. But Halifax also has a pretty big black population too. We&#8217;ve had, back on the show &#8230; Oh God, this might have been a hundred or so episodes ago, we had Duane Jones back on the show. I think that was episode 203, if I recall, so it was a while ago.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a huge black population, but you have to go look for them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He said the same thing. He said that too. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
I used to work at a hotel in Halifax, at the front desk, and there are some times where a gal was having her birthday party, and all these black people would come. And every time I&#8217;m always confused. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I have never seen this many black people before.&#8221; You actually have to go look for them. You have to go to specific places to find them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How was it adjusting to Canada? I mean, outside from the fact that it&#8217;s a totally different country and different weather and everything, how was it adjusting?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
It wasn&#8217;t too bad because when I came I was so busy with school that I didn&#8217;t really have time to do anything else. The weather was a huge shocker to me. So I came in August and there was a slow transition. And then, all of a sudden, on January first, that was the first time I ever saw snow in my life, there was a snow storm. January first of 2015, I woke up and there was a huge snowstorm, the snow was like four feet high. So yeah, that was an [crosstalk 00:25:38].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Whoo!</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So yeah, I had to shovel snow. So that was my first experience with snow.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Adjusting wise, in terms of &#8230; The thing with NSCAD is at the time I was there, there was about 1,000 students roughly, maybe five black people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, interesting.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
There was no real advocacy. Again, it&#8217;s an art school, there&#8217;s not enough black people going to art schools. But I&#8217;m used to always being the only black person in most places that I go. Most classes or most things that I&#8217;ve done, I&#8217;m always the only black person there. That was not a problem for me. That&#8217;s something that I was already used to. But I never really had any issues, honestly, because Halifax is a very small and very laid back city. And also because it&#8217;s Canada too, there&#8217;s not a lot of overtly racist problems. People are very low key about their racism, because Canada &#8230; People here are supposed to be nice, so they always hide everything,</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s still there though.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Oh, it&#8217;s a hundred percent still there. Like I had a lot of experiences when I worked at the hotel for about three years. There was a lot of incidents that I thought were pretty much very racist. But in general, there was nothing to the face. Plus I&#8217;ve also noticed this, I noticed this even from working at the hotel. Because I&#8217;m a very tall black guy, a lot of people just don&#8217;t mess with me, just in general. People just don&#8217;t mess with me even though &#8230; That&#8217;s just something I noticed. So I never had any issues, overtly.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
The first house that I stayed in &#8230; I don&#8217;t know if they have this in the US, but here in Canada, when you come to university for the first time they have this arrangement where you stay with a family. Yeah, so when I first came, I was about 20 years old. I came in August and I already arranged to stay with this family, and I only ended up staying there for three months because I don&#8217;t think that family has ever hosted a black person before, an African in general. So it was a very strange situation. It was this old woman and her husband, they were maybe in their 60s, 70s. And it was just weird living with them. They just didn&#8217;t know how to interact with an African. It was really odd. So I ended up moving out because I was just not comfortable.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
And so even that area they lived in, they lived on Gottingen Street in Halifax, which is a predominantly black neighborhood. So typically, because of the way Halifax has been, I say, constructed, that&#8217;s a hugely black populated area so there&#8217;s all these cops and all this sort of stuff. But at the end of Gottingen, it turns into a super white neighborhood, so that&#8217;s where I lived at that point. And so the woman, when I first moved there, she said, &#8220;Well, you have to be very careful because you&#8217;re going to be a person of interest.&#8221; I still don&#8217;t what that means till today. I just remember her saying that to me. And I still know what it means.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, it just means &#8230; Honestly, it&#8217;s just you&#8217;re a black guy in a white neighborhood or something like that. So if something were to go down then you&#8217;re the first one that they&#8217;re going to suspect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So where I live now in Atlanta is a pretty black neighborhood. It&#8217;s called the West End. But before that I stayed in Buckhead, which is kind of the richer, whiter part of town. I stayed there for a couple of years in college and then afterwards. And I remember I would go to the grocery store and get groceries, and then even on the walk home, which was not that far, because the grocery store was on the same street, maybe about a half a mile, I&#8217;d say three out of four times I would make that walk the police would just roll up slowly. You hear the siren and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; &#8220;Well, we heard about some things going on in this area.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well I&#8217;m walking with groceries, so I don&#8217;t know what you think I&#8217;m doing.&#8221; So it&#8217;s like, yeah, you&#8217;re a person of interest. They just want to, I don&#8217;t know, intimidate you I guess.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
In Halifax, there&#8217;s something they call DWB. It&#8217;s Driving While Black.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. There&#8217;s a lot that everywhere, it seems like.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a lot of racial profiling, people just getting stopped randomly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Driving while black, walking while black, shopping while black. Unfortunately, that is all still a thing that we have to contend with even this far into the future. But I want to talk about this project that you did in 2018. So you did this &#8230; I guess you could call it a creative project where you designed or you did these photo manipulations, adding yourself in with James Bond characters. You did 365 of these. Can you tell me a little bit about that project?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Yeah, so the project was not about me adding myself. I think maybe I added myself in two out of 365.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
But basically what the project was &#8230; The planning started in 2017. I decided I was going to do a 365 project. This is something that I&#8217;ve always wanted to do. Because every year I try to set a goal at the beginning of the year and say, &#8220;Okay, this is my new year resolution and this is how I want to accomplish it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So I started working at the hotel in 2016, and the only reason I started working at the hotel was because I needed to get my permanent residence, which is kind of like the Green Card. It&#8217;s similar to the Green Card in US. And part of the requirement was that I was required to work there for a year, and the hotel was helping with it, so I pretty much got stuck there. But I was fresh out of school, this was a year after I got out of school. But then I&#8217;m also thinking, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to be stuck here for a good year at least, maybe two years. I&#8217;m not really practicing design. I need practice.&#8221; Because you need to practice or you&#8217;re going to forget. So I was thinking, how do I go about this? But I also have the issue where I was always working at the hotel and I had very little time.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So in the summer I did this 26 day creative project where I did something with the alphabet every single day. I did ABCD. Something based on A, something based on B. Just like that. And then I did all 26 days. I didn&#8217;t miss a day. So I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, so this is actually doable.&#8221; So I decided, okay, starting first of January of 2018, I&#8217;m going to do a 365 project, but I had no idea what I was going to do.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So I did a lot of research, came across this lady, she said she didn&#8217;t know how to cook, so she went and bought the recipe book and she would make something from the recipe book every single of the year. And then there&#8217;s this guy in New York, he would go around New York and paint historic windows. So every day of the year he painted one historic window. A lot of projects like that, that I started following. So I was thinking, what am I going to do? And then I found this guy on Tumblr, when Tumblr was still a thing back then. He was doing a 365 project where he just remade one movie poster. And I was like, that&#8217;s actually interesting. I would like to do something that is movie related. And I&#8217;m a huge James Bond fan.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So I saw this, then I remembered that there was this article that I saw about top 103 James Bond villains. I&#8217;m like, okay, so if there are 103 villains, it means that there&#8217;s more people. So I started looking up on the James Bond Wiki, I found [inaudible 00:33:17] characters. So I made a list of all the characters, did some research on each one to make sure that I had enough content that I could use. And so I did that, took me almost three months to compile. And then January first, the goal of the project was to make one poster that pays tribute to a different James Bond character every day. Just from the movies, not the books. So that was the goal of the project. And the only objective that I had was that every day just had to look different. That was just it.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
And at the beginning of the project, I wasn&#8217;t focused on the actual design itself. I was more focused on &#8230; The main challenge for me was &#8230; Because I knew I could do the design already, but can I do this for 365 days straight and not miss a single day? That was the most important thing to me. But I also didn&#8217;t want to cheat. I didn&#8217;t want to pre-make stuff. I have to make something every day. So for me that&#8217;s the challenge that was going on. Till today, some people don&#8217;t believe that I actually made one every single day. Some people are like, &#8220;So did you make three in advance and just wait and post it every day?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Considering how much time it took, because I was averaging about 3.5 hours every day by the end of the year. And some days I had four hours, some days I had one hour, some days I had three hours. Well, basically I had about 3.5 hours every day to &#8230; I knew the character already, come up with a concept, and execute that concept. So that totally changed my whole design process, because there&#8217;s one problem that I had that that project fixed. The problem was when I get an idea and I think that this idea is a good idea, then I&#8217;m going to stick with it. It&#8217;s hard for me to leave that idea alone. But this project made me unintentionally grow out of the habit. Because there&#8217;s some days where I&#8217;m looking at the time, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve been stuck on this one idea for three hours now. I have only two hours left. I have to do something else.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So then at first I would discard ideas. But then somebody told me, &#8220;Well, instead of discarding it, then you can just have a folder where you just put in all the stuff that you haven&#8217;t used, and then in the future you can use them again.&#8221; Which is what I started doing, I would just put the ideas there. But at first, the first month started off as more of an abstract deal, because I was afraid of copyrights and stuff. But then when I read up on copyrights and all this sort of stuff, I was able to move towards more using the photos. And honestly, when I started, I wasn&#8217;t delusional, thinking I was going to go all the way. I was like, &#8220;You know what, I&#8217;m just going to do this and see how it goes.&#8221; And then when I actually did the first 30 days and I didn&#8217;t miss a single day, I was so much confidence. So that&#8217;s how went that project went.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was going to ask, what did you learn about yourself throughout that process?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
I am kind of a perfectionist, but then I also learned that I have to be okay. Because usually when you post your work online, you&#8217;re usually posting what you think is the best. Like, &#8220;Okay, this is really, really good and I&#8217;m going to post it.&#8221; But then I realized, well, I either have to make really good stuff and post it every day or I have to be fine with posting stuff that are not very good.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So, at first I really struggled with that because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;If I have to post this, this has to be good on some level. It has to be good on some scale.&#8221; And so it started off like that, but then I met a lot of people that were doing projects too, and I talked to a lot of people. And a lot of people told me that you have to be fine with the days that are not good. You have 365 days, so if this day is not so great, you had a bad day. The next day you can knock it out of the park.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
And then I also figured out how to take breaks without missing a day. So some days, because I was working morning shifts or evening shifts or night shifts. So some days I would make something at nine o&#8217;clock in the morning, and the next day I&#8217;d make something at 8:00 PM. So that&#8217;s a good, what, 30 hours of rest? So it&#8217;s like I missed a day, but I didn&#8217;t really miss a day. And I made a lot of sacrifices. There were parties or places I couldn&#8217;t go to because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well I haven&#8217;t done today&#8217;s work.&#8221; So everything is in the back burner until I do today&#8217;s work. Once I do the work and post it, it&#8217;s like a sense of accomplishment, a sense of relief, that came with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I have to give it to you for really finding a way to do it every day. I did a similar type of a 365 project. Not a visual project, I did a podcast where I recorded an episode every day for 365 days called The Year of Tea. And I did these short, five minute episodes just reviewing a different tea every day. And I didn&#8217;t get to it every day. There were definitely some days that I batched about a week together, especially if I was traveling or something like that. So I have to give it to you for carving out &#8230; I mean, one, carving out time to do it each day, but then the fact that you carved out so much time, like you said you were averaging around like three and a half hours a day for these designs. That&#8217;s a lot of time.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Honestly, there&#8217;s a few days where I spent a good eight hours on this. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well today is Saturday, I&#8217;m home, sure.&#8221; I would sit in front of my computer for eight hours. Because then, the days that I have so much time, I feel like those days that&#8217;s where I put in way too much time and I try too hard. Because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well I have a lot of time today, so I&#8217;m just going to spend as much time as possible in this.&#8221; But there&#8217;s a day that I only have 30 minutes and I managed to do something also.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you told me before we had started recording that there&#8217;s hundreds of characters to choose from. Because initially I was like, &#8220;There&#8217;s over 365 James Bond characters?&#8221; I was like, there&#8217;s James Bond, there&#8217;s probably every bond girl, every bond villain, and I feel it sort of tops off right there.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
I mean there were some people that have one scene you know? There was a few people that showed up for one scene, so you have to do something for this one person. Maybe they said something funny. But so what I did was, when I was setting up the list, I spread out the characters. Because there&#8217;s a lot of characters that I wanted to get to, so I spread them out. So it was those characters that I wanted to get to that kept me going the whole time. I kind of put them strategically. So at the beginning of every month I have one major character, so one big villain or something like that. Day 200, I have one big character I have to work on. I strategically positioned each one.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So the way I started the project &#8230; So all James Bond movies, and even the recent ones, there&#8217;s this organization called [Spectre 00:40:13]?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So each person at that time, especially from the movies in the &#8217;60s, they had a number. So there&#8217;s a number one, number two, number three. So that&#8217;s how I started. And then on day seven, I did James Bond, which is Double O Seven. So that&#8217;s how I started the first few days. But there were little things like that. And so, I unintentionally populated the James Bond internet space. Like when you just look up random things about James Bond, you see my stuff popping up. So that that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m really happy about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I mean the thing with James Bond movies is that they come out every few years or so, so there&#8217;s a lot of time between movies to really fill that space with stuff, because there&#8217;s not a lot of active talk. I don&#8217;t even know if there&#8217;s a James Bond comic book or something. You would think with all the superhero movies and stuff, there&#8217;s always some kind of media that fills the gap between movies. It&#8217;s a television show, there&#8217;s a comic book, there&#8217;s something. James Bond, it feels like exists only in fiction and in movies. Of course it&#8217;s from the books, but there&#8217;s not really that other media around it to fill the gap.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
I think a few people not named Ian Fleming have written books recently. But I think it&#8217;s because Barbara Broccoli that owns the IP, and MGM, they have a really, really strict hold on the IP, so it&#8217;s very difficult for you to be able &#8230; Now that Amazon bought MGM, maybe Amazon might want to produce a TV show or something. Who knows? But I also think it&#8217;s because the IP is so old and it&#8217;s right from the &#8217;60s, so it&#8217;s one of those things where there&#8217;s so much content already, so maybe they don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re going to make money. Who knows? I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Could be. Oh God, you mention that &#8230; I feel like there was a cartoon series for James Bond. I don&#8217;t know if you remember. Well, I don&#8217;t know if they even showed it outside the US. It was called James Bond Junior. I&#8217;m showing my age by saying this, but it was like in the early &#8217;90s. They had a TV show called James Bond Junior. I think it probably only lasted a season, but it was James Bond&#8217;s nephew who was also named James Bond, which I guess kind of makes sense for the show. But yeah, I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s on YouTube or something.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
I&#8217;ll tell you one anecdote about Africans in general. So, if you say &#8230; Say I&#8217;m 27 right now and say you&#8217;re 37, all the things that you experienced as a 37 year old, when you say you were 10, I probably experienced the same thing. Now, because of the internet, everything gets everywhere quickly, but as I&#8217;d say, the late &#8217;90s, early 2000s, we were a good 10 years behind everything. The first computer I used was Windows 98. I also used dial up internet, I had a Walkman, I had the CD player, all the stuff, VHS. All the stuff that people my age here didn&#8217;t experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Out of all of the characters that you did, was there a favorite one?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
My favorite one was &#8230; What was it? Day 124, which is May Day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Grace Jones.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Yeah, Grace Jones. So I did that on May first, which is May Day. So, that&#8217;s my absolute favorite. That&#8217;s the one that I&#8217;ve sold the most, that&#8217;s the one that people love the most.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m going to have to check that one out. I don&#8217;t know if I saw that one on your site, but I definitely have to go check that one out.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
You know the famous We Can Do It poster, with the woman flexing her biceps?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Yeah, so I did one with Grace Jones, where the background is yellow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh nice. Nice, nice. So you alluded to this when you mentioned this piece, but you&#8217;ve even managed to exhibit designs from this project, you&#8217;ve done a number of different exhibitions with it. How have those went?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
They went really well. So at the beginning of 2019, I did the exhibition &#8230; Actually, no, in May of 2019, I did an exhibition in a small gallery called Corridor Gallery in Halifax. It&#8217;s at Visual Arts, Nova Scotia. So that was the first exhibition that I&#8217;ve ever done. So I would consider myself a digital artist, so having to print out my stuff, put it in a frame, hanging it on a wall, totally new to me. But that was a great experience, so that&#8217;s the first time that I felt like an artist. That was amazing.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
And then I got to exhibit at the Halifax Public Library last year, despite the pandemic. I was there for about two months. The gallery there is a very lovely space. Huge. And they only accept, I think six artists a year, because each person stays for two months. So I applied and they accepted almost immediately. So I was beyond overjoyed. So that was the big exhibition that I had done. It was very good. I made a few sales from that.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
But like I said, the exhibitions, those were the things that made me feel like a real artist. So I really like exhibitions, that&#8217;s why I want to do some in Montr√©al, like a bigger city. Because I&#8217;ve always considered myself like a Nigerian artist. So the James Bond thing, I got a little popular from that because the James Bond IP was world renowned. Some people have never seen a James Bond movie, but when you say James Bond, everyone pretty much has an idea what you&#8217;re talking about. But I kind of want to stray away from that in a sense. I want to do more African themed exhibitions, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m working on right now. I&#8217;m trying to see if I can do something for next year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So what prompted the move from Halifax to Montr√©al?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Like I was saying earlier on, Halifax is a very small city. Honestly, I was looking at it and &#8230; Because I did that job at the hotel where I was pretty much stuck for three years &#8230; I stayed in Halifax for five years. Two years in school, three years at the hotel. And I was at that hotel, stuck. I couldn&#8217;t leave because of the whole immigration thing, so I was not happy in general. And my last year at the hotel, there was a lot of racially motivated shit that went on. So every time that I think of Halifax, I associate it with the hotel.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
My plan was always get my permanent residence and move to some other city in Canada. That was always my plan. But I got my permanent residence in 2018 October, and then I decided, okay, in the new year, I&#8217;m moving to a new city. That was my resolution for 2019. I&#8217;m leaving Halifax in 2019. But the thing is because I made so many friends there, I knew so many people, I knew the city well, I was so comfortable, I just relaxed a little bit. So 2019 came around, and I applied for this artist residency in Banff. Banff is in Alberta. So I applied for the artist residency and made it to like the final three, but I didn&#8217;t get it. But that was my plan. I was like, okay. I had assumed that I was getting it for sure. That was how much faith I had in this. I was like, &#8220;Okay, once I get this, I&#8217;m just going to move to Banff.&#8221; The program was a two year program, do it for two years and make connections, and see what happens from there.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So I didn&#8217;t get the program, so I decided, okay &#8230; So that was in May of 2019. I was like, &#8220;Okay, what am I going to do now?&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t sure. So my sister had a wedding coming up in August, so I went to Nigeria for the first time in six years for the wedding. And I decided, you know what? Once I come back from this wedding, I&#8217;m moving. But where to? I wasn&#8217;t sure. So I wanted to move to Vancouver because my sister was coming to BC for school, but then I started looking up Montr√©al because I knew somebody that lived here. I started looking up Montr√©al. So I went on Indeed, checked to see graphic design jobs. I was like, &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s a lot of graphic design jobs here.&#8221; And I can learn French. So I decided, you know what? I&#8217;m moving to Montr√©al.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So I decided, okay, I&#8217;m moving. So I went to Nigeria, I came back, I gave them my two weeks notice at the hotel, and then I moved in October first. Luckily for me, I was able to get an apartment right from Halifax. So I got the apartment, but then I started getting cold feet, because then I didn&#8217;t have a job, no real concrete plan. So to make sure that I moved, I shipped all my bags.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s one way to make it happen.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So I left just one bag. So after I shipped my bag, I bought my plane ticket. I was like, &#8220;Okay, I have to move now.&#8221; But then I discovered something. There&#8217;s so many people that discouraged me from moving. There was a few people that were like, &#8220;You know what, this is a good move. You&#8217;re probably going to make big advancements from moving.&#8221; But there are so many people that were projecting their fears and telling me, &#8220;Well, if you move then it doesn&#8217;t work out, what are you going to do?&#8221; People were saying all this stuff to me. But then I talked to my parents and they were in support of it, and I just moved.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Yeah, so I got to Montr√©al and I decided, well, I already did the job, worked at restaurants, walk at hotels, I think it&#8217;s time for me to get a design job now. So I decided, you know what? I&#8217;m only going to get a design job. So that&#8217;s how I ended up in Montr√©al.</p>

So now you&#8217;ve been in Montr√©al for what? A little over, you said two years now, something like that pretty much?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
About two years, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you gotten a chance to kind of see what the design community has been like outside of work?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Not really, because last year it happened, so that was kind of a write off. And then this year has been super busy trying to balance both jobs and also trying to have a semblance of a practice outside of work. So I haven&#8217;t actually had the chance, but recently I&#8217;ve been going to art galleries, checking out a few stuff and seeing what people are up to. But as for the design community here, the truth is in Montr√©al, if you don&#8217;t speak French, then you&#8217;re very limited in a way. Even though Montr√©al is super bilingual, most people you meet speak both languages, but if you speak French it&#8217;s like a new world opens up to you there. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to do by learning French.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s your French going so far?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Pretty good. All of 2020, I didn&#8217;t learn French, even though one of my goals was to learn French. So I moved here, but then I got cold feet, because I got a job even without speaking French. But then I was thinking if I try to learn French what happens if I forget words? What if I can&#8217;t learn? What if I can&#8217;t do it? Because usually I do things that I know that a hundred percent I&#8217;m going to succeed at this, that&#8217;s the kind of things I like to do. So I was a little afraid, but then at the beginning of this year, I was like, you know what? This is my New Year resolution. I&#8217;m a hundred percent committed to learning French, despite work and everything. So then I got Duolingo and then I got a private tutor. And honestly, the progress that I made this year, it leaves me thinking, why didn&#8217;t I even start last year?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Yeah, I actually made good progress. Speaking is very difficult because the pronunciations &#8230; The pronunciations are especially difficult for me because the sounds don&#8217;t sound like Igbo, and a lot of them don&#8217;t sound like English either. So there&#8217;s some sounds in French that my brain cannot just wrap around. It&#8217;s a fun challenge, so I&#8217;m not complaining.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I feel like the Nigerian accent is, and this is kind of this way with some African languages, it&#8217;s very throat based. The accent is very much deep in the throat, whereas with French, everything is nasally. There&#8217;s a lot of nasal stuff to it. So I know when you&#8217;re learning French, a good phrase when you get stuck with something and you don&#8217;t know, and your tutor probably told you this too, but just say, &#8220;[French 00:52:44].&#8221; Which is, &#8220;How do you say?&#8221; Yeah, so you can be speaking and you say-</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s a good one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, you can [inaudible 00:52:50], you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Eh, [French 00:52:51]&#8221;]. And you kind of roll your way through it. And most people &#8230; I mean, I&#8217;ve not been in a lot of immersive situations. When I have been, it&#8217;s mostly been France French, not Montr√©al French or Quebec French or Quebecois or whatever, it hasn&#8217;t been that sort of regional-</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a totally different bag, but the thing is my teacher is from France, and Duolingo I&#8217;m also doing is French, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m focused on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Yeah, once you really start immersing yourself in it &#8230; And I would say now it&#8217;s probably a lot easier to do, especially you got a smartphone or stuff like that, because you can set the language to French. And then you learn just from picking up context clues and stuff like that. You can watch movies with the subtitles and get the sense of what they&#8217;re saying, things like that. It&#8217;s a lot easier now than it used to be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When I learned French, I was a kid. I mean, I started in second grade and then studied it all through high school and all through college. So I know enough to speak it and read it, but it&#8217;s a different thing to be immersed in it, when it&#8217;s the only thing you hear. My French is very situational. If I&#8217;m in a situation where I need to know French, like it&#8217;s a French restaurant, I&#8217;m like, okay, I know all the things to get around. Like where&#8217;s the bathroom, I will order this, I need this. I know that stuff. But then if it were something where I&#8217;m plopped into Paris, I&#8217;m like, oh, okay. That&#8217;s the real test is how do you use it from day to day.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
But that&#8217;s the really amazing part about living in Montr√©al, because all the signs, everything is in French. It&#8217;s kind of a rule they have in Quebec. If you have any sign or anything you see outside is usually in French. That&#8217;s the rule they have. So everywhere you go, you&#8217;re exposed to French. People will say bonjour to you first, and then if you respond in English, then they speak in English to you. So my favorite game to play now is whenever I go out, I bullshit my way with French until the person realizes that I don&#8217;t speak very good French. I want to see how long I can play the game.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good way to do it, that&#8217;s a good way to do it. What are you most excited about at the moment?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Honestly, I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s one thing that really, really excites me. Oh one thing that I did this year that I can&#8217;t believe I did was I learned how to ride a bike. Yeah, I never knew how to ride a bike because when I was growing up, I didn&#8217;t have a bike. So I just never learned how to ride a bike. So when I moved to Canada, it&#8217;s one of those things where I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t know if this is something that I can do, so I just never did it. But then I tell people I can&#8217;t ride a bike and people can&#8217;t believe it, because most people can ride a bike. So I decided, you know what? This summer, this is what I&#8217;m doing this summer. This is my summer project.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So did you buy a bike? Did you use one of those rent a bikes or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
It was more like a rental one or a friend&#8217;s bike or something like that. I&#8217;m going to buy a bike, but that&#8217;s going to be next summer, because you can&#8217;t bike here in the winter. There&#8217;s people doing it, but those people, I think they have issues.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
But yeah, so that was the one thing that I did this year. It seems very small, but it&#8217;s one thing that just gives me great joy. Because I did a 30 minute lesson, and I could balance myself already by the end of the 30 minutes. And then I did another 30 minute lesson, and the next time after that, I was able to do eight kilometers. And then I was able to do 16, 20. And at the end of the summer I did 35 kilometers, so that was pretty amazing for me. All the while I never fell, until the last time I biked this summer, before it became cold. I was coming down on the bridge, one of these bridges in Montr√©al here, the Jacques-Cartier Bridge. I was coming down really fast, and they have these barricades that you have to wiggle yourself around. For some reason I got carried away. Next thing I know, I saw myself flying over one of these barricades. Yeah, that&#8217;s the first time that I&#8217;ve fallen in a really long time. Yeah, it was bad.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you think you would&#8217;ve went to if you didn&#8217;t become an artist and a designer?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Probably an engineer, because my dad is an engineer. So even though he was very supportive, and even my mom was very supportive too, I feel like if I didn&#8217;t go into design, they probably would have steered me in the direction of doing engineering.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you have an interest in it or do you think they would&#8217;ve just pushed you towards that because of societal expectations?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
I never had an interest in it. Honestly, I&#8217;ve never had interest in science in general. I can&#8217;t think of one profession in science that I have any interest in, honestly. I&#8217;ve never had an interest at all. I think I&#8217;ve always been an artist at heart. And so even my uncles were really against this. Like, &#8220;How can you make money from art?&#8221; I was never really worried about money, because I always tell people it doesn&#8217;t matter what you read in university. There&#8217;s people on YouTube now making funny faces and making millions. I&#8217;m like, they didn&#8217;t go to school for that. So I honestly think that what you go to study in university is not relevant to how much money you would make or how successful you&#8217;re going to be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean now the whole thing that I see with some artists that are making money, they&#8217;re making it off of NFTs. I was reading this &#8230; It was some article I read maybe a couple of weeks ago about this artist. She&#8217;s a Canadian artist. I forget where, but she just started learning about NFTs in about a month or so. And then using that, she made, I think 50 something NFTs, and has made like $300,000 or something like that. If you&#8217;re able to get that much just off of a month&#8217;s worth of learning, you can do anything.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Honestly, I&#8217;ve looked into NFTs a little bit, but I haven&#8217;t &#8230; I have a two week vacation at the end of the year, so I want to use the two weeks to really educate myself and see what I can do. Because so many people have been telling me, &#8220;You have to look into NFTs.&#8221; So I&#8217;m like, okay, maybe this is something I&#8217;m going to look into. Who knows? Maybe that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m going to make it big. Because my goal in art is to make that one piece of art that&#8217;s going to pay me for the rest of my life. That&#8217;s my goal.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hey, if you find a way to make it happen, let us know, share the knowledge so we can get in on it.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
I want to be that guy that just sticks a banana on the wall and people just pay $200,000 for it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
And then everyone can cry about it [inaudible 00:59:57].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If there&#8217;s somebody that&#8217;s out here that&#8217;s listened to your story and they want to follow in your footsteps, what advice would you give them?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
I would say, honestly speaking, I&#8217;m probably one of the most fortunate persons that I know. I would say that because pretty much most things that I do, I succeed. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s something special that I&#8217;m really doing that is leading me to succeed in most things that I do, but I don&#8217;t know, somehow I usually just pull it off. But I&#8217;m also someone that if I decide I&#8217;m doing something I&#8217;m going all in. And if I start something and if I realize that, you know what? Maybe this is not going to work out. I usually back out early. Once I get deep into it, then I&#8217;m seeing it all the way.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Like for example, the 365 project. By July, I was getting really, really tired, exhausted. Coming up with a new idea every day is not easy. Plus I have to make these all through artist blocks, like creative blocks. I had to find a way to make stuff. But I was also thinking, if I&#8217;ve made it this far, there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m stopping now, because then if I stop, I&#8217;m going to regret this for a long time. So that&#8217;s usually how I approach most things. Once I start, I&#8217;m going all the way.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
This is a problem that I realized that a lot of Nigerians have, and I used to have this problem. People are afraid to fail. Nigerians are afraid to fail in general, because the culture does not really encourage failure in a way where I feel sometimes failure is very important for you to get to the next level. Like you hear about these scientists where, oh, this inventor made 800 different versions before the final one worked. That&#8217;s not encouraged in Nigerian culture. If you do something, you have to succeed at it. This idea that nine out of 10 new businesses fail, if you start a business in Nigeria and you fail, a lot of people are going to make fun of you, even though it&#8217;s perfectly normal for businesses to start and fail.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So it took me a while to get comfortable with the fact that not everything I do is going to go the way I want it. And so since I&#8217;ve learned to accept that fact, I think my life has gotten a lot better.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Honestly, I&#8217;m not really a five year planning kind of person. I like to take things as they come, so okay, I plan for the next year. At end of the year, I&#8217;m going to sit down and think and see, and write down my goals and see if I have things that I want to accomplish next year. But usually, I take it year by year. So every year I have a big new year resolution that I want to hit, and I have very little ones that I &#8230; Because I like checklists, so I like to check, check, check. So I have very little things that I want to do, and I have a big one that I want to do for the year. And so I don&#8217;t really have five year plans.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Ideally, at the end of the day, I want to own my own design agency. I think, even before that, I want to become full-time freelance, but I still need to gain the confidence, because right now it&#8217;s really nice when you expect two paychecks every month. But then when you become full-time freelance, then you know that you have to do as much as possible, maybe at the beginning, to get money. Because I was looking into Upwork, and I realized that a lot of people in Upwork, they&#8217;re very, very talented and they&#8217;re probably very experienced. But if you&#8217;re starting an Upwork, you have to start like you&#8217;re starting all over. Because you have to beef up your reputation and your cred for you to be able to make money from it.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
So, I still need to gain a little bit of confidence, but eventually I think that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do. I&#8217;m just going to go full-time freelance, because I think that, like my dad always says to me, &#8220;You can&#8217;t get rich from counting on other people&#8217;s money.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
You talked about my website. I have to update the website because I made that website as a portfolio website when I was looking for a job, so I never really went back to go update it, but I think I&#8217;m going to go update it. But my website is mister365.ca, so Mister, M-I-S-T-E-R dot C-A. I&#8217;m very active on Instagram. My Instagram is nigerianexpert, E-X-P-E-R-T. You can find me on Instagram, that&#8217;s usually the best place to reach me. Or Facebook by my name, Emmanuel Nwogbo, N-W-O-G-B-O. I&#8217;m very active online.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Emmanuel Nwogbo, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I think from hearing you tell your story and even you talking about moving here from Nigeria, I get this sense that you have this very quiet, maybe not so quiet, confidence about you. I mean, I feel like you&#8217;re downplaying it maybe a little bit, but I definitely get this quiet confidence from you when it comes to pursuing the work that you want to do. Because it takes a lot of guts to move from Nigeria to Cypress, to Nova Scotia, now to Canada. You&#8217;re still in your 20s, you&#8217;re still trying to figure it out, you&#8217;re taking on these creative projects. That takes a lot of confidence to be able to do all of that and still push forward and succeed, so I&#8217;m going to be excited to see what else you accomplish moving forward with your entire creative career. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Nwogbo:</b><br>
Oh, thank you very much for having me. I had a good time talking to you.</p>
