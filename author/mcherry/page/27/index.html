Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>You may not have heard much about Eric Bailey, but there&#8217;s a pretty good chance that you&#8217;ve encountered his work out in the world. As the VP of experience design at Zillow, he brings over 20 years of strategic thinking, imagining, and making to revolutionize the process of buying or selling your home.</p>
<p>Our conversation began with Eric discussing how he builds culture and maintains joy on his team, and he spoke broadly about what he calls &#8220;the limitless possibilities of UX design.&#8221; He also talked about growing up in Ohio, being around for the early days of the Organization of Black Designers and Project Osmosis (which he co-founded), building his brand Properganda, and he gave the secret for how he&#8217;s maintained his authenticity throughout this career. According to Eric, anyone can look within and fulfill their potential through design &#8212; and he&#8217;s absolutely right!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Well, my name&#8217;s Eric Bailey, and I&#8217;m a design lead. I lead a team of designers at a company called Zillow, and I&#8217;m also a graphic artist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has the year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been going really well, not without its surprises. I think the big lesson in the last year and a half has been just be flexible, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
And be open to change. And so I would say that&#8217;s the one thing I&#8217;ve really learned is just be ready to expect the unexpected given the pandemic and given just changes in life that we can&#8217;t control. So be flexible and be ready also to take advantage of opportunities as they come up. But in general, me and my family, we&#8217;ve stayed healthy so we&#8217;re really, thankful for that. And yeah, and just really working through the different ways now that we interact with friends and family and also the way we work has changed shape for us. And so, yeah, I would say lots of silver linings for us.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, I got to spend lots of time with family, really meaningful, deep time, things that we would probably never be able to do or have in any normal circumstances, so I have no complaints.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, this past year and a half, I mean, I guess really coming up on two years now that I think about it, it has been transformative in many ways. I feel like that&#8217;s the most apolitical way that I can state that. It has been very transformative. It has changed all of us in many different ways that I think we will still be unpacking hopefully years after this time has passed. There has definitely been a general shift in the collective consciousness that I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to just snap back from.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, it&#8217;s a great way to describe it, is just transformation in every aspect of life. And so, yeah, it makes you realize that you have to become, I guess, a being of transformation, right? You have to be able to change yourself too so that you can adapt. So, yeah, adaptation has been, I think, that keyword for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s the only thing constant in the world, change.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s what it is. Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about the work that you&#8217;re doing at Zillow where you are a VP of UX. How are things been going during the pandemic with the team?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, no, they&#8217;ve gone well. The pandemic created a big threat to human beings and our way of life, but also to business. And so, there were some real questions about how Zillow as a company or the real estate industry, in general, was going to fare. I think that because the company, Zillow that is, is really part of the technology frontier around real estate, automating processes, consolidating processes, Zillow actually did relatively or very well during the time. There was lots of activity, lots of engagement with the business, one, because now people are doing so much online, and then, two, because they&#8217;re starting to think about how the pandemic might shape where they live and how they live. And so, that was a boom to the business.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I would say to the design team and I think the workforce, we really took seriously the taking on remote work as the de facto way we approach our day-to-day. And that was a big shift. That was something that was, I think, we entered with real interest and did deep research with the workforce to get a sense of where their sensibilities were. The overwhelming majority felt like remote or having at least the option to work remotely was preferred. And so, we&#8217;ve done everything we can to really put in place processes and tools and even aspects of our culture structured around remote work and asynchronous work. And so it&#8217;s really interesting. I think, great, lots of benefits, obviously, right? Now we can work with folks from many markets, many regions. We have really now diverse teams when it comes to that. Obviously, people don&#8217;t have to commute as much. So lots of benefits there. But there were some trade-offs too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What sort of trade-offs?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve been at Zillow for about three years, and I was a part of the team that was localized into an office, and now I&#8217;m part of a team that is distributed and virtual. And so, having experienced both, I would say one huge benefit of being in a physical space with folks is really the kinds of bonds you can build. I think that, eventually, we will need to, even with a remote workforce, we will need to create time together. We&#8217;ll be making plans for team offsites or onsites, I guess, and team meetings and really strategic moments for us to get together and collaborate. And that will be around problem-solving, but also mostly it&#8217;ll be around just building relationship and community with our team. So being in the same place just really does allow people to really get to know each other, I think, in a way that it&#8217;s difficult to do online.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. How many people are on your team?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I have about 22 people on my team. I lead what we call an experience area. And that experience area is called buy, sell, and transact. We&#8217;re focused on creating end-to-end experiences that support someone&#8217;s ability to buy a home from Zillow, Zillow sells homes, to sell their home to Zillow, and the transactions necessary to make that happen. So all the way through closing. And so I lead a team of product designers, essentially, that focus on that. And then I partner with research, user experience research, and content strategy. We partner to create those experiences.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. It&#8217;s interesting. I guess, over the past maybe year or so, I&#8217;ve talked to other design leads, and it&#8217;s really interesting to see how content strategy has&#8230; or really content in general, written word has become more of the design process to the point where they&#8217;re considered designers or they sit on a design team in that way.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right. Yeah. Well, hence the word strategy in there, right? So not just writers, but these are folks that are creating strategies for basically touching and building bridges with customers, particularly when we are creating experiences that are either unprecedented or our customer base is unaware of, right? Most people know Zillow because of your ability to dream and shop, you come and look at homes, and you look at your neighbor&#8217;s home and how much they pay for it and things like that. But then there are all these other services. Well, you can actually sell us your home, or you can actually buy a home from us. These are things that less of our customers are aware of. And so, to really reach out to them and connect with them, we really need to be strategic about the way we communicate. And that&#8217;s more and more of an imperative for our business.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have there been any particular insights aside from just, I think, team makeup and asynchronous work and stuff? Are there any particular insights that have arose over the past year now that the team is distributed?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, one, remote work for some companies is old hat, but for Zillow, a company that&#8217;s, I think, we&#8217;re 6,000-plus, a large company like ours, I think we&#8217;re still navigating how you build culture, how you sustain culture. I think the company has a really strong and rich set of cultural values, and it&#8217;s very good at holding one another accountable and living up to those values. But then there&#8217;s sort of the unspoken things. In a virtual world, I think maintaining the joy of your experiences is something that requires a real attention and real intention. And so, our design team has spent a lot of time, especially our design leaders have spent a lot of time really trying to be creative about, &#8220;Well, how do we keep our team engaged? How do we have fun at what we do in lieu of having a space where you can improvise, right?&#8221; And so, we&#8217;ve really been experimenting and there&#8217;s still lots of work to do there. But sometimes it&#8217;s important just for us to get together and have fun.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
The amount of effort and energy that actually goes into architecting those is pretty large. That&#8217;s, I think, a big insight for us.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I didn&#8217;t know Zillow was that big. 6,000 people?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, don&#8217;t quote me on the exact numbers. But yeah, we&#8217;re-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In the thousands.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah. And that&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve grown from this online platform to now a broad range of services and products. We&#8217;re a lender, so we offer mortgages. We have rental experiences and services for landlords and for renters. So just a really now a broad range of experiences around the home. And so in that, lots of different service providers under one umbrella.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know a lot of people have been moving or downsizing or just changing up how they&#8217;re living because of the past year and a half or so with the pandemic. It&#8217;s interesting. How has Zillow helped to facilitate that outside of, I guess, what it&#8217;s for, which is real estate buying, selling, and searching? I don&#8217;t know, I guess I&#8217;m wondering, are there any particular ways that Zillow has helped out during this time in that process?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
For its employees or for just in the world?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
For the world, yeah. For the world.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s a great question. Well, there&#8217;s definitely this migration, right? The economists talk about this migration from urban centers and across state lines. Many folks now are not bound to a specific region to make a living, there&#8217;s an influx of movement of folks that are moving to other states. Some are moving back to the states they came from, right? They would&#8217;ve been centralizing in Silicon Valley and in Seattle, but now maybe they&#8217;re going back to the Midwest or maybe they&#8217;re going back South. So huge migration there that is, obviously, an opportunity for Zillow.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
But also there&#8217;s this multi-generational trend, right? We have now families that are thinking about, &#8220;Well, I should probably live closer to home or maybe even with my parents or even grandparents.&#8221; So there&#8217;s also an influx of folks coming together and actually buying homes or bringing families under one roof. So really interesting market trends. We have internal folks that look at this, but those have been some of the big macro trends that I think are really interesting. And then obviously just doing everything remote, the fact that you can now actually sell your home online, you can purchase a home completely online or almost. There are a number of companies also they&#8217;re springing up around this capability. But yeah, the future of buying a home and finding a home is going to change dramatically over the next five to 10 years.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
It could be very similar to something like trading in your car, right? You drive into the dealership with one car, you leave with a loan and a new car, and you&#8217;ve left your old car. It&#8217;s all just one stop where you were doing that, you&#8217;re solving that problem for yourself and you&#8217;re focused on that thing that you want to buy. That should be the experience of buying a home, and eventually, it will.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. What does a typical day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Typical day&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Does that exist?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
No. Well, yeah, right, no day is typical. It&#8217;s interesting. I think for me and my team, there are a few things. One, we work really hard to try to package our meeting times to a very specific timeframe. So between the hours of 10:00 and 14:00 are when we try to make sure that our hours&#8230; this is when we have core meetings. One, it&#8217;s to accommodate for multiple time zones. But it&#8217;s also to make sure that the other times outside of that are considered flexible and should be focused on getting the work done. And so, that&#8217;s a practice that we are all trying to employ and adhere to, or live up to.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
On a day to day, there&#8217;s probably logging in in the morning, attending some meetings. There would either be team meetings. There might be critiques for the design team. They&#8217;re usually planning meetings, some meetings that are about the work that we&#8217;re going to do in the future. And then there&#8217;s usually heads down working time. And yeah, I think some of the meetings if you&#8217;re getting together with a team you might be working on a project, you might be in a sprint, so you&#8217;re working at some point in the sprint process like you&#8217;re ideating or maybe brainstorming. And so, we&#8217;ll be doing some sort of remote activities, collaborative exercises to arrive at some outcomes there with teams. There&#8217;d be multifunctional teams, so product managers, designers, engineers, even folks from marketing, and obviously content and research. But yeah, now it&#8217;s mostly online, whether it&#8217;s collaborative or heads downtime. I think that&#8217;s how I&#8217;d sum it up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You mentioned earlier about the challenge with building culture and maintaining joy. How have you been able to do that with your team specifically?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I think I have two teams. I see myself as a part of a group of peers. I partner with other product managers and engineers and folks that are cross-functional. And so, I do what I can to create somewhat of a culture there. And then I have my working team, my team of designers and design managers. But in terms of design and design managers, some important things are maintaining my one-on-one. So I have weekly one-on-ones with all my direct reports. I have two team&#8230; They&#8217;re not critiques, they&#8217;re really focused on having the team share their work at earlier stages to get coaching. So it&#8217;s less about giving direction and telling someone to make it blue instead of agreeing and more focused on changing the arc of their thinking. So pressure testing their strategy and the questions they&#8217;re asking and the answers they&#8217;re coming up with. So those, I would say, are two review meetings where leaders are giving feedback to the design team.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
And then there are monthly meetings. We have a team monthly meeting. We&#8217;ve opened that up as open format to make it&#8230; We let folks from the team lead it. And so, there&#8217;ll be someone who&#8217;ll volunteer and sometimes they&#8217;re workshops. Sometimes they&#8217;re about learning. Sometimes they&#8217;re about problem-solving. Sometimes they&#8217;re about bonding or connecting, but there could be a range of things. But really the meeting is the operating system or the lever you have to create culture.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I mentioned that other team and the other team is those cross-functional peers. And a lot of what I try to do there is really break the frame of your standard meeting format. When I&#8217;m leading meetings, I&#8217;m trying to make them interactive and make them conversations. I want them to be generative, so a lot of times I&#8217;m asking people to use the right side of their brains, folks that aren&#8217;t necessarily used to doing that. So giving them really solid provocations and asking them to think big with real big boat-like, &#8220;How might we,&#8221; statements?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
And then also done even some silly things like role play. I played Lori Greiner who&#8217;s one of the sharks from Shark Tank. We asked cross-functional teams to create concepts, and then I played a shark and evaluated the concepts, and they had to pitch those ideas to me. So even just trying to bring some humor into an otherwise what can be a, I would say, less than exciting format to computer screen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you wear a long blonde wig too?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I actually had a cut-out of her face. [inaudible 00:20:49]. And then actually before they came, I got them excited about it. I told them that we were going to have a guest actually, that Lori was coming. And so I&#8217;m a VP, so everyone thought, &#8220;Wait, maybe he knows her, maybe she&#8217;s coming.&#8221; They really got their pitches together for that, and of course, yeah, they got a big laugh when I came on with the mask.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. No, that&#8217;s good. I mean, that&#8217;s one of those ways that you bring joy is to just shake it up a little bit, you know?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, and not take yourself so seriously. We can&#8217;t do that, right? We have to have fun and remember that we&#8217;re human beings.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think more so than, I mean, just being human beings, we&#8217;re all human beings that are now going through this shared kind of traumatic experience. And so, I think anytime that when you&#8217;re at work, when you can let that facade down of it being so serious and just open up and be human, I think that&#8217;s what everyone just appreciates that now more than ever, I think.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right. Yeah, be authentic, your authentic self.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, when you initially booked the interview, and people that have listened to the show noticed this, that I always ask this question about what do you want people to take away from the interview? And one of the things that you had mentioned early on was that UX is a field with limitless possibilities. Of course, you&#8217;re AVP of UX at Zillow. Can you expand on that for me? How, from your perspective, is UX a field of limitless possibilities?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
For those that know me, they know I&#8217;m really into self-actualization. I really come to the realization that my purpose is to create user experiences that help people become who they hope to be. And those would be experiences that end customers or users would use, and obvious industries are healthcare, education. In this case, it&#8217;s finding a home, right, finding a home is both existential for people, but it&#8217;s also aspirational. You can change the arc of someone&#8217;s life in finding a home. And then it&#8217;s also through my teams, right, creating experiences for them that help them become the vision of who they see in the future. I develop over the years, and I can talk a little bit more about that later. So I think humans have a limitless possibility, and I think that the design field is really the perfect platform for that. It&#8217;s a perfect sort of Petri dish at least for creative people to discover who you are, who you want to be.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That&#8217;s because of a few things. I think, one, it&#8217;s really, really broad. It&#8217;s open to so many different kinds of talents. So we mentioned content, so people that are writers, people that are researchers, that are inquisitive and empathetic, people that are artists, and people that like to make and create, and people that are builders and people that are analytical. And so it&#8217;s just so open to the array of skillsets that it&#8217;s so welcoming, I think, to so many folks left and right-brained that I think it&#8217;s an incredible career. I started out as a graphic designer, but UX really is this thing that is multidisciplinary. Yeah, I think it&#8217;s a really rich field.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I think some of the skills that come to mind for me are there&#8217;s research, there&#8217;s synthesis, there&#8217;s storytelling, there&#8217;s facilitation, there&#8217;s interaction design, there&#8217;s service design, visual design, prototyping, right? These are all things that a user experience designer might be asked to do. And that doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to be an expert in all of them, but chances are you are going to bias us towards one or two of those, and you&#8217;re going to become an expert. You can have a team that has certain expertise in any one of these dimensions or two or three, I think is incredible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s really been interesting how really UX has exploded as a field over the past few years. Of course, you&#8217;ve got General Assembly and you&#8217;ve got other types of boot camps and other programs that are really cranking out UX designers into the industry at the same time as the design industry has gotten more lockstep in with tech. Companies have went from being just strictly visual designed and now being more product-based. And so, the market has changed, and to that end, the workforce has changed to go along with that. So I can see how those possibilities are really there because a UX designer can be called six different things for six different companies.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They could be UX, they could be product, they could be-</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; like you mentioned before, content, things of that nature. And so, it&#8217;s really flexible in that way.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
It is. Yeah, it&#8217;s incredible. And like I said, it&#8217;s welcoming, right? That means it welcomes folks that are the anthropologists and ethnographers. It&#8217;s just a really diverse field. I don&#8217;t know of another one that is as diverse. One other thing it&#8217;s really important to note is there&#8217;s real symmetry between the design process and new ways or progressive ways of learning. The field of education right now is really embracing the design process. You have a question, you go out and get answers to that question. You form a hypothesis, right? You answer that question. You experiment with your solutions. You validate them, and you learn from it. That is the basis of learning, and here is a field that you can do that every single day. Every single day you are applying progressive learning, and you&#8217;re following basically this process. You&#8217;re continually learning throughout your life. And that&#8217;s one thing that I just find really fascinating is that they&#8217;re really the same thing. That&#8217;s incredible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, you&#8217;ve mentioned before about being a graphic designer. To that end, I want to really go back and learn more about your origin story. Tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I grew up in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah. East Side.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;ve got a lot of Ohio folks, specifically Cleveland, on the show. I&#8217;ve even got some family, they&#8217;re in Cleveland, they&#8217;re in Youngstown, they&#8217;re like right around that area. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yes, that&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Cleveland&#8217;s a great design city too.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I think so, yeah, and we always represent. It&#8217;s an incredible town. Well, I grew up drawing. I loved to draw. I loved comics. I grew up creating characters and writing comic books and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh cool.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I think my parents put me in some classes at the Cleveland Institute of Art. They have an industrial design program, so it&#8217;s the first time I saw these models of people making, basically, the cars of the future. I mean, Cleveland Institute of Art is a pretty top-notch school. It&#8217;s affiliated with the Cleveland Museum of Art, which is one of just a handful of world-renowned art museums, something that I was exposed to really early too. So, yeah, it&#8217;s a hidden gem in the Midwest, and a lot of talented people come out of Cleveland.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was first there&#8230; When did I first go to Cleveland? I mean, aside from family stuff, but as a designer, the first time I remember going was in 2014. Yeah, 2014 I went. I spoke at a conference there. Damn, that was seven years ago, Jesus. But I spoke at a conference there. There&#8217;s a local studio there called Go Media, and they had this event called Weapons of Mass Creation. I don&#8217;t know if they still have the event. I don&#8217;t think they do, but every year they would have a number of different panels. It was a multi-day event. They would have live painting. They&#8217;d have break-dancing. It was a whole thing, and that&#8217;s how I really got introduced to Cleveland as a design city. I was like, &#8220;Man, this is great. This is wonderful.&#8221; And got to meet other designers from nearby, from Chicago and from Detroit and stuff like. So it was great. I want to go back to Cleveland once all this pandemic madness stuff is over. But, yeah, sounds like your parents really kind of introduced you to design and exposed you to that early on.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I mean, they knew it was ordained that I was going to do something creative. I mean, I had been drawing since I was maybe two years old, and I would spend hours and fill up sketchbook after sketchbook. I just loved to be creative. Yeah, they just did what they could to expose me to different things. I didn&#8217;t want to be &#8220;a starving artist&#8221; artist. Obviously a stereotype, but I didn&#8217;t know what design was. But I applied to a graphic design program in Cincinnati when I was coming out of high school. So it&#8217;s the University of Cincinnati in graphic design in School of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning and-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, it&#8217;s a mouthful.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
&#8230; really&#8230; Yeah, it is. DAAP is the acronym. But it was an amazing program. I think like many of my experiences, it was serendipitous. I just followed a calling, but I didn&#8217;t know what it was going to turn into. One, it was a five-year program, and two, it had a&#8230; First year was foundation, so you spend that first year with architects and industrial designers and fashion designers all doing the same thing, learning the same fundamentals. And then you break off into your expertise. And two, it had an internship program or a co-op program that wound up being six quarters in the field. So every other quarter I would-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
You wind up working the equivalent of a year and a half before you get out of school. And so that was an incredible experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not saying this to date you, but this is-</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That&#8217;s okay, you can date me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, but I mean, this is in the early nineties, this is really prior to the advent of the personal computer and design really coming into its own through things like CorelDRAW and Photoshop and stuff like that. It sounds like, I mean, that sort of hybrid program of work plus in-class instruction was really good.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I would say anyone looking at design programs should choose or take very seriously programs that have internships, right? Just the amount of autonomy and independence and the amount of clarity I got on what I wanted to do and what I didn&#8217;t want to do was incredible. The other thing is as part of that program you move from city to city. I worked at the National Park Service working on the publications and brochures that they use in the national parks. I worked in St. Louis at a retail doing design for retail. I worked in Dallas, Texas doing environmental graphics at an architectural firm. And then I worked at a small but cutting-edge design studio in Boston. Every quarter I was moving to a city, finding an apartment, and either living with other students or living on my own and had a full-time job. I mean, it was incredible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s really any design program like that now that really put you out there as a working designer while you&#8217;re still in school in that way.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, I think there are a handful, and they&#8217;re definitely worth you tracking down. I&#8217;ll any day hire someone from Cincinnati as an intern or full-time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How was your early career post-graduation because it sounds like you&#8217;ve managed to gain a good bit of work experience while still being a student?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah. I definitely didn&#8217;t want to stay in Cincinnati. I came out of high school in &#8217;90 and from 1995 was an undergrad. When you&#8217;re from Ohio, you do a few things. You either stay in Ohio, you move to New York, Atlanta, or Chicago. And so, I started applying to jobs in Atlanta and Chicago. I had some family in Chicago. I actually wound up a conference for The Organization of Black Designers. It was the first one, it was held in Chicago. Through that, I think I wound up landing some contract work in Chicago. So I went ahead and moved to Chicago. And then while in Chicago, I attended at a conference, and that really got me connected to a number of opportunities. But that was a really pivotal moment for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The Organization of Black Designers, wow. Revision Path and OBD kind of have a&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t want to say a history, that makes it sound contentious. But since I&#8217;ve started the show and I&#8217;ve been talking to people, the organization has definitely come up several times. I&#8217;ve tried to get David to even come on the show. But we&#8217;ve had other past folks that have been on the show, we did a whole oral history of OBD back in&#8230; Wait, when was that? 2018, I think, something like that. I mean, it&#8217;s just amazing hearing about how that organization came about it and really how many people it helped out because it&#8217;s something that I don&#8217;t think a lot of black designers even know about because it&#8217;s hard to really pin down-</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; that history. It&#8217;s not a story that&#8217;s like AIGA or something like that. I mean, you tell me because you were around, was OBD for the black designer back then?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
For me, I mean, one, I was probably maybe one, maybe two black students in my cohort, right? At least I would say I identified as black and that I was making it really clear I&#8217;m black. I kind of led with that. But very few in the design program in Cincinnati, very few&#8230; In all the internships, I was probably the only black person in all the internships, maybe one that I interacted with in the corporate environment. And then moving to Chicago and working at these firms, just seeing so few black designers. So this is the first time in my life I stood in a room and saw hundreds of black people that were creative that were just like me, and fashion, art, graphic, industrial design, you name it, architects. To do that for the first time is transformative. You just realize you&#8217;re not alone.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
So I think that&#8217;s what it did for me, just make me feel a sense of belonging in a way that I had never felt before and realize even if I do go back into these other spaces and I go to my nine to five at this company over here where I&#8217;m still the only black person, I know we&#8217;re out there, and I&#8217;m validated by that. I know I have a lifeline to them. I can always touch base with them. A lot of what I was doing was taking the people on that list and calling them up and saying, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m looking for work.&#8221; So a lot of it was pre-Linkedin, just using that network to see if you can make inroads and either get a job with them or have them refer you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But right around that time, you also got involved and helped co-create something called Project Osmosis. Can you talk about that?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, this is part of the oral history of OBD. I think I had the fortune of meeting some of the folks that after that initial conference in Chicago, there are designers there that convened themselves on a regular basis from that point on and kind of became the Chicago chapter of OBD. And that was led by Vernon Lockhart. You met with him before. He really helped coalesce a team of folks that we call ourselves OBD, Chicago, and we were representing OBD and that chapter. And so I was attracted to that group, so I joined them and had other friends that joined. And so, we got really close and just really bonded and tried to carry on the legacy of the larger org to both network, but then also to try to do some more outreach to the community and primarily to younger folks.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
And so, that outreach was through University of Illinois Chicago. We were doing programs either with students there or through local high schools, middle schools. I also did a little bit of internal visioning and journeying and we together came up with this idea of more like an outreach, like a consistent outreach to creative youth that would eventually enter the design community. And so, the idea was we know that there are creative folks out there that have this innate talent and they probably don&#8217;t see any pathway for themselves, right? They don&#8217;t see that there are these fields out there, these roads to success that they could take, and using their talent something that they could have fun and in joy every day.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
We wanted to expose more and more creative kids to these fields, to industrial design, fashion design, graphic, architecture, et cetera, and so we decided to create a program around it. There was this woman named Lisa Moran, Keith Purvis, Vernon Lockhart, Marti Parham. There&#8217;s a number of other folks, I don&#8217;t want to leave them out, but we basically came up with this idea of Project Osmosis. And that was, of course, these kids learning from the design professionals, and that was the genesis. We actually converted OBD Chicago into Osmosis. And that was its next incarnation; we were no longer OBD.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And shout-out to Vernon Lockhart. I mean, he is still keeping.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Oh my gosh, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; Project Osmosis going to this day.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
To this day. Shout-out to him. Wow. So you were working for a few different design studios back then doing a lot of graphic design work. What do you remember the most about being a working designer from that time?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny you mentioned the adoption of computers. I would say I was in my second year in college when we were using Mac computers and Adobe software. I was using those all through college and in my internships as well. And so, yeah, most of my work then going out, I would kind of&#8230; I think the first year or so I was a freelancer and I would use my network to see who&#8217;s looking for a designer, and I would join these small studios. There was a studio called Metaphor. There&#8217;s a number of others I can&#8217;t even remember right now. Pivot Design. I would just go work with them for a few months and work on mostly corporate communications and things for whatever local restaurants, whatever, doing mostly print work. But I wound up working at a small web design shop for the first time. They were working on websites, and that&#8217;s when websites and web marketing was just taking off. So this is 1997, &#8217;96, &#8217;97. And yeah, that&#8217;s when I started learning web design at this place called Streams Online Media. No longer around. And then I wound up joining a company called Giant Step, which was the digital arm of Leo Burnett, a larger ad agency, and so made my way into web design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s hard to overstate just how much of&#8230; There was nothing back then of web design.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
True. True.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There were maybe a couple of books, but even those felt like they were being written on the fly. There was just a lot of view source and figuring it out.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely, especially when it came to digital design. Digital design, it was a gamble, right? The paradigm for designers was you&#8217;re a graphic designer. You either work at either a large graphic design agency or you work at an advertising agency. And then you eventually become a creative director, right? Your Paul Rand was the prototype for your career. But I think digital, really those larger agencies didn&#8217;t have experience in that. So it was really the small tech companies and webshops and things like that that were really starting to hire designers and do groundbreaking work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Because they could move faster because they were smaller.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember, let&#8217;s see, &#8217;97. I was in high school in &#8217;97, and I remember that&#8217;s when I got my first HTML book. We had went to a&#8230; Was it a Walden Books?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Walden, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It was Walden. We went to Walden Books in Montgomery. I&#8217;m from Selma, but Montgomery&#8217;s 50 miles away, so we went to Walden Books and got this big HTML book. It was orange. It was like a thousand-page book. I don&#8217;t know, back then, they had a bunch of books like this for different languages. There was one for HTML, one for ASP, different things like that. And I remember this big, huge thousand-page book, and I would carry that around with me at school. And whenever I got a chance to go to the like&#8230; We had a supercomputer lab in my high school, and we had computers in the library. Whenever I had free time, I would just go in with that book and I had a Tripod account, and I would just start trying to figure out like, &#8220;What does the blink tag do? What does the marquee tag do?&#8221; Just trying to figure out how it works. Because it&#8217;s one thing to see it in the book, but then to actually do it on the web and see how it works in real time, to me that was just such a transformative time in learning design. Because really there were no rules.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You really could do what you wanted to do.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah. And this is also when so many of those other roles were starting to enter the field, right. You might be a graphic designer who was usually doing comps and mock-ups and doing layout for, let&#8217;s say, posters or books or write other corporate communications that was like a&#8230; we&#8217;ll say layout, but then there were people who were technologists, right? There were people who are anthropologists who were becoming information architects. And so yeah, just sociologists and cognitive psychologists. So that now as a designer, you&#8217;re starting to interact with these people. They&#8217;re also people with backgrounds in motion design and film design, and so they were starting to come together at these companies. And so that was really interesting, was just now interfacing with such a range of creative people, whereas as a graphic designer you might interact with a photographer and maybe an illustrator. But yeah, really interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I would say for of those of us, like designers that are probably 40 and up, to really see how the entire design community has changed from those early days in the nineties to now, it&#8217;s been really inspiring to see just how much things have changed.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. That is why I also say that UX or user experience is such an amazing field is just because it is really on the cusp of that Moore&#8217;s Law of continual transformation and change. It&#8217;s almost as if design is becoming something new, and UX is sort of, I think, on the forefront of that. So the fact that it&#8217;s, yeah, it&#8217;s constantly growing and changing it&#8217;s really exciting. It has a continual frontier, right? There&#8217;s a continual green field in front of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now even with all the design work that you&#8217;ve done over the years, you also have your own side business, side project that you do that&#8217;s called Properganda. How did that come about?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a great question and great timing for that question because what we&#8217;re talking about right now, this moment for me was a time when I stopped doing that kind of work. So when I was an undergrad, I kind of&#8230; Really short story here, when I was an undergrad, I did really well my first year, my second year in school I started to get really just uninspired and really had a hard time understanding how&#8230; I was this black kid. I&#8217;m pretty much the only one in my program, there&#8217;s one every year in the program. Really felt isolated. How is Gestalt psychology and semiotics, and how are these things&#8230; Will they have anything to do with me, all these Western theories and things?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
And so, I even had a professor approach me and say&#8230; I had a really hard end-of-year review, and he pulled me aside and said, &#8220;I look around the city, and I see so many black folks basically. But then I look in the program and you&#8217;re really the only one. I would think that you would want to essentially represent your race&#8230; or represent your race better.&#8221; One, he was not black so I had no [inaudible 00:47:33].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Of course.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
[crosstalk 00:47:33].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s pretty wild to say. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I mean, it was a jaw-dropping moment for me. And from that point on, I was singed by that, like really burnt by that. But we had a project shortly after that where we had to take a word and manipulate it and have it mean something else, a typographic study. Something clicked at me and for some reason, I chose the word Thanksgiving. I started playing with the letters in the word.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I started with red letters, and I changed one letter to white and another letter to white and another one and then started making the red letters disappear, and it started to simulate population. I started thinking about the reds and the whites and how whites move in and reds start dying off. And at the end I added, I just added an E to both words and wound up with the words take and give. And there was white take and red give at the end. So it was really just repeating the word Thanksgiving and changing the color of one letter each row. So the statement was obviously about colonization, about gentrification&#8230; well, not gentrification but genocide essentially and the Holocaust, American colonization, and was through a typographic study. And that was the first time I realized, &#8220;Oh, I can use the tools they&#8217;re teaching me to make the statements I want to make.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
And from that point on, it took off for me. I really loved visual pun. I really loved to use really simple graphics to make a really hard-hitting statement. And so the rest of my career there in undergrad was really making really cutting, really socially critical statements in my work. And that was my way of pushing back on that professor and basically on my cohort.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
It was really liberating for me. That&#8217;s what got me excited about design, was that I can use this craft to make a statement. Most designers, you&#8217;re meant to be objective, you&#8217;re not meant to make a statement. You&#8217;re meant to channel, right? This was my ability to communicate. So of course, I graduated. I went into the workforce, entered corporate America, and I stopped doing that kind of work. And that was around the time we talked about when I moved to Chicago and started working in health. So fast forward probably 15 years, I was working at a startup. I was a lead of design and really uninspired. I was really unhappy. I was burnt-out. For those years, I knew that I was not fully self-expressed.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
One night, I took out some of the old pieces that I worked on. The first one I took out was Thanksgiving, and I just updated it. I redesigned it, refined it. And that was really me getting in touch with that old self through the craft of just reworking those pieces. I picked up another one and started reworking and kind of updating it. And then from there, I started making new pieces, and they were usually some critical statements. An obvious, easy target is social media. That&#8217;s one that I have a love/hate relationship with. So started making lots of pieces around social media and its impact on us.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That was it. I just was creating for the sake of creating, and it really breathed life back into me. I was up until 3, 4, 5 o&#8217;clock in the morning, multiple nights just not being able to stop creating. That was kind of the genesis and coming back to that idea of Properganda. I had come up with that nomenclature in the nineties, and so I decided to bring it back and say, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to build something around this.&#8221; So Properganda it was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, Properganda, I like that because, of course, back then, proper was part of slang back then saying something was proper. I&#8217;m curious, have you heard of the book Visual Puns in Design?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Eli Kince.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yes, yes. Yeah. Tell me, how&#8217;s that top of mind for you?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, God, a few years ago, I was really seeking out design books by black designers.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Wow. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I got his book. Saki Mafundikwa has a book called Afrikan Alphabets that is super hard to find, and I managed to get that. And yeah, that&#8217;s how I first found out about it.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s my jam. When someone can use the visual image to break expectation or to change perception and change meaning, I just think it&#8217;s so brilliant. He&#8217;s actually a University of Cincinnati alumni.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, so he went to my school, he went through my same program, and he probably had that same instructor. Yeah, I love that sort of compendium of work that he collected there. I actually reached out to him maybe a few years ago when I picked Properganda back up. I was compelled to reach out and try to meet him. I think we chatted for a little bit through email. But, yeah, that&#8217;s so interesting you bring that up because that&#8217;s a really, I think, a great north star for me. Really impressed with this brother who, who was from my neck of the woods, basically,</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m going to try to get him on the show. I reached out to him a few years ago too, and I think we were trying to get something going but he was busy at the time. So I&#8217;m going to try to pick that back up because that is a really good book. And for folks that are listening, you may be able to find it on eBay or Etsy. Because I don&#8217;t even know if it&#8217;s still in print, but I know that there are some copies of it floating around if you&#8217;re trying to find it.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yes. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it sounds like having Properganda as that side project really helped fulfill you as a creative, even as you did your regular nine to five work.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I think it was I became really aware that my full-time work was not enough for me to be fully self-expressed and be fully self-actualized, and it was only going to be through doing that work that I would be my whole self. So from that point, it&#8217;s been a great ride. I mean, it&#8217;s hard. Like I said, I was compelled to do all that work. So I created a lot of work and lots of hours. I&#8217;m a full-time parent and have a full-time job. And so to do this as well, it&#8217;s a commitment. But yeah, it&#8217;s a part of me that has to be expressed otherwise I&#8217;m not fully myself.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
A lot of it is really not only just I have to create, I want to have that experience of creating. Because as a design leader and a manager, I create so little nowadays, right? I create success through teams, and my design is really people and their careers. And so then it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, but I still want to make things.&#8221; And so this gives me ability to do that. I call myself and this work the armchair activist, the person who walks through life, knowing that things aren&#8217;t quite right and just knowing something&#8230; It&#8217;s that whole matrix, right? You know that things aren&#8217;t right, but they need that tipping point. They need something to say, &#8220;Hey, look,&#8221; like nudge them and say, &#8220;You should be questioning this phone that you&#8217;re staring at for 10 hours a day. You should be questioning the things that you&#8217;re consuming. You should just think critically about your own behavior and how these things shape your behavior. So that what that&#8217;s based on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a designer I had on the show a few years back, his name is Andre Hueston Mack. He is a designer who had some experience in the financial industry but then later became world-class sommelier and now has his own brand of wines. They&#8217;re called Mouton Noir or Black Sheep Wines. His design, I don&#8217;t want to say it&#8217;s something similar to what you&#8217;re doing, but he also does these visual pun sort of designs as well. His design studio is called the Get Fraiche Cru, but fresh is spelled F-R-A-I-C-H-E like creme fraiche, and then cru is C-R-U, as in a vineyard because he does the wine. Actually, for people that are listening and for you too as well, if you all want to go to Bon Appetit&#8217;s YouTube channel, I know that that has had its own controversy, but if you go to Bon Appetit&#8217;s YouTube channel, he&#8217;s done a series of videos where he talks about wine and stuff so you can get to see his personality and stuff like that. But if folks want to check him out, I think he&#8217;s episode like&#8230; I want to say 313 or something like that, Andre Mack. It&#8217;s in the 310s from what I remember. I tend to remember pretty well who does what when. It&#8217;s a weird quirk, but if folks want to take that episode out, 313, it&#8217;s pretty good.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Thank you for sharing that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So between Properganda and the work that you do with Zillow and everything, and even, I guess, throughout your career, how have you worked to stay your authentic self?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Well, I think Properganda is part of my authentic self, so even manifesting that. One, acknowledging it, &#8220;Hey, I need to pay attention to this aspect of my personality, and two, I need to feed it, and I need to make it public and build it around it.&#8221; Acknowledging that in myself, and I think that&#8217;s advice I would give to everyone, listening. I do a lot of internal listening. I usually do visioning exercises at least once every two years. And that&#8217;s to check in with myself on, &#8220;Okay, what experiences you want to be having and what skills do you want to be developing?&#8221; And so, Properganda is a manifestation of that. It&#8217;s like that happened in order for me to be whole.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I think at work, a lot of it is around&#8230; Working from home was a milestone, something that I wanted to achieve. I just had the good fortune of things making that the case. For me, going into an office, commuting for three hours a day or four hours a day is not sustainable even though I&#8217;ve done it for 15 years. And so, having a better integration of home and life because home is the authentic me, so integrating that, that puzzle piece has fall fallen into place but that&#8217;s been important.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I think also you talked a little bit about the last two years and not just the pandemic, but all of this sort of&#8230; I don&#8217;t call it social up upheaval, but it was just folks tired and pushing and being vocal. Whether it&#8217;s the protest or the election or whatever, but they&#8217;re the real issues about equity in our country and race. Those issues now have become part of the discourse at work and/or on in day to day. Now people are talking about things that they would rarely talk about or in spaces that they would rarely talk about. And so that is really important to maintain that. Now if I&#8217;m at work, we will talk about being a black designer or a black design leader or being a black male or a black woman or a black trans person, all of the diaspora and all of the issues that go with that, those are now part and parcel of the things that we talk about in work in our daily lives.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
So being authentic to that and putting words to that is really essential. I think I spent many years compartmentalize my blackness from work. And so, now that&#8217;s what part of being my authentic self and bringing that authentic self to work is that we can talk about aspects of my identity, other people can talk about aspects of their identity, and then we can talk about these things that go along with that. One thing is also working on things that are relevant to my own interests. Zillow is really pushing to create a social impact agenda and initiatives that are focused on changing paradigms in the housing industry and the fact that housing is kind of key center point around inequity, especially in [inaudible 01:00:47] communities. So being able to participate in work and help steer work, that&#8217;s focused on creating social impact, like doing that also is a part of my full-time job. It&#8217;s not just about paying the bills but being able to move certain boulders that are important to me in my life and then also being more and more myself. Those are the things I really push for, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Do you feel satisfied creatively these days?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I do. I do. I think my biggest challenge right now is probably I want to do so much more and there&#8217;s just so little time. The last year was tough because the kids were home during the day, so we were working and we were parenting. And so by the end of the day, it&#8217;s just like, &#8220;I&#8217;m done like toast.&#8221; And so, there wasn&#8217;t a lot of bandwidth to do other things. Now the only thing that limits me in terms of my happiness with being creatively expressed is just time. But I now have the things that I know I love to do. And so, yeah, I would say the answer is yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you want the next chapter of your life to be like? Where do you see yourself in the next few years? What kind of work do you want to be doing, projects, stuff like that?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I think in the future I want to work to live, not live to work. And so that means that I want to work smarter not harder. I want to work on things that I&#8217;m really good at and do that with ease. And then I want to be able to take advantage of the benefits of my accumulated knowledge and expertise. So if I&#8217;ve worked for 25-plus years, I should be able to take the foot off the gas. And so, to be honest with you, it&#8217;s less about what new kinds of work I want to do and more about the balance I want to strike between work and life. I want to do less of busy work and logistics and administration and less churn and more generative and creative, and then also connecting with my family. I know that doesn&#8217;t directly answer your question, but, yeah, that&#8217;s the goal.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
They can find me on LinkedIn, so Eric Bailey. I think you&#8217;ll share some links there. I&#8217;m Properganda1, the number one, on Instagram, and then propergandadesign.com is a website for Properganda. Yeah, and there&#8217;s zillow.com. So you can obviously connect with Zillow and all the great things we have there for folks that are looking for a home, whether they&#8217;re renting or buying. And let&#8217;s see. Yeah, I think that&#8217;s not a huge digital footprint, but those are the things I keep it to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Eric Bailey, I want to thank you just so much for coming on the show. Thank you for, I mean one, sharing your story about how you really have become a designer and have made your way up in your career, but also really sharing how you&#8217;ve been able to balance these parts of yourself, whether it&#8217;s doing Properganda on the side, whether you&#8217;re building your teams. It sounds like you&#8217;re continually striving to have that sense of balance among the creative and the professional and the personal aspects of your life. And I think that&#8217;s something that all of us listening can really learn from. So thank you so much for coming on the show, I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Maurice, my pleasure. Thank you. I&#8217;m really honored, yeah, just to be a part of a illustrious cohort of interviews, so thank you so much.</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Hey. I&#8217;m Keni Thacker, Chief Diversity Creative at Keni Thacker, and also the founder of 100 Roses From Concrete, the premier network for people of color in advertising, marketing media and public relations. What I do during the day, and I can&#8217;t say during the night, but during the day, and during the day, I work with advertising agencies, big and small to help them build out their diversity and inclusion platforms and partnerships and programs, and just overall policies and practices as well.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
I feel like that&#8217;s super, super important. That&#8217;s where my passion has been for like the last 10 years, I would say being in advertising, even though I&#8217;ve been in advertising for 15 years. Then on the 100 Roses side, as the founder and chief creative officer, I&#8217;ve run an organization of about 100, maybe 130 people plus from around the country and it&#8217;s basically a professional development kind of network for people of color and women throughout those industries.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
We stand on the principles of connect, collaborating and growing together because that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve learned throughout my journeys, is something that&#8217;s so very, very important to have as talented creative people, whether it&#8217;s strategy people, project management, people, whatever the role is within advertising. I think it&#8217;s so very, very important to have a community where you can do those three things, connect, collaborate, and grow.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
As Andr√© 3000 would say, &#8220;Creating a community for opportunity.&#8221; That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing with 100 Roses From Concrete. That&#8217;s what I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has this year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Man, this year has been a whirlwind. I would say the last two years have been a whirlwind, but like the whirlwind just continues to happen. Despite our country and society kind of being on a fire, whether it&#8217;s from the police stuff, or the government stuff, or the health stuff, I&#8217;ve been kind of been like the Phoenix that&#8217;s been rising, or better yet, like the roads that grew from concrete. So it&#8217;s been good needless to say, there&#8217;s been a lot of opportunity, a lot of meeting a lot of great people, a lot of partnering with great people and things of that nature.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
I look at the world outside of my window kind of being on flames, inside, we&#8217;ve been lucky, my family and I have been lucky to be extremely safe and not gotten sick and anything like that. So I&#8217;m doing okay, they&#8217;re doing okay. But as career-wise, it&#8217;s definitely been one for the history books, needless to say, as someone who&#8230; Oh, and I&#8217;ll probably talk about this a little later, but as someone who was always in the room where it happened, but never had a seat at the table, I&#8217;ve definitely gained my seat at the table by creating my own opportunities over the last, going on two years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I certainly know what that feels like, being able to make year away from something that you&#8217;ve created. How have things changed for you since the start of last year?</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
How they&#8217;ve changed is I guess by creating my own&#8230; Well, I guess I&#8217;ve always had a brand, but by having the opportunity to really let my brand just do what it&#8217;s going to do without any restriction or without having my hand slapped, needless to say has been absolutely great. It has been absolutely great because I get to choose who I want to work with and who I don&#8217;t want to work with, and basically dictate my own path. It&#8217;s something that I may have thought of maybe when I first got out of school, like &#8220;Yeah, one day I&#8217;m going to start my own company.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
But as of last year I was even more thrown into the wild and I was like, &#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s just time to pull that plug and really just start my own thing.&#8221; So I have to say that I&#8217;ve been extremely blessed that a lot of the people that I work with are people that I used to work with, but at a different place. But being able to see them in positions of power and then seeing me doing the work that I&#8217;m doing, and then them supporting me and the work that I&#8217;m doing to also make their agencies better. It&#8217;s been an absolute blessing.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
There&#8217;s too many names to shout out, because it would take more than the hour and a half of this podcast. But yeah, just shout out to all my people, y&#8217;all know who y&#8217;all are. They definitely been able to look out. Because in full transparency, when COVID hit, I got let go from where I was working. Because I was a consultant and I got let go, and for about a week or so, I was like, &#8220;What am I going to do? I&#8217;m used to like always ever since like high school, like always used to having a job, so I had never really been let go before.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
When that happened, it really hit me in a different way psychologically, but then it was like, &#8220;Maybe this is the boost that I need to really just say, &#8220;Keni, start your own thing.&#8221; That&#8217;s exactly what I did and I remember it even after I got out of my funk, I remember tweeting and even, I think maybe in my Instagram stories, I just put like free agent. And after that happened, my inbox started blowing up.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
That&#8217;s when I knew I was like, &#8220;Yep, it&#8217;s time to really&#8230; All these great ideas that I had and things that I wanted to do within the space of D&#038;I, I was like, &#8220;This is the time to do it and things of that nature,&#8221; just due to the fact that the industry had renewed its interest in it, even though I&#8217;ve been doing this stuff for like 10 years. But being able to do it on my own rather than under the auspices of a huge company just makes it easier because I&#8217;m able to get things done in three months that I couldn&#8217;t get done in like 10 years or eight years.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Being able to have these like very direct honest conversations with these CEOs and different leadership people within the companies that I work with is great because before, I would have to wait weeks to get on somebody&#8217;s calendar. Now, when it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, Keni needs to talk to the CEO.&#8221; It&#8217;s not even a matter of me going through an assistant, it&#8217;s just me hitting up whoever my friend is, who&#8217;s the CEO or the head of talent like, &#8220;Hey, I got to talk to you about this. We should do this.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s just so much better and so much fun, but also impactful in a way that I want things to stay. I want to keep the heat on in regards to this conversation, because so many times it&#8217;ll get hot and then it&#8217;ll go cold. My job is to keep the heat on as much as I possibly can with the companies that I work with, but also just in the work with the roses well as making sure that our talent knows what they&#8217;re getting into by walking into this industry where a lot of other faces don&#8217;t really look like theirs.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, you have to keep that momentum going, especially, I think last year when as you alluded to, so many companies and organizations and stuff really started to look at what they were doing around showcasing black voices and black talent. Unfortunately this happened in the shadow of the murder of George Floyd, but companies started to come to and say, &#8220;Oh, well, there&#8217;s more that we need to do for our black workforces in particular.&#8221; But yeah, you have to keep that momentum going because I think as probably most working black professionals know, whenever these kinds of things spark up, they can very easily fade away.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
For lack of a better term, you have to keep your foot on their neck to make sure that things will still happen, to make sure that the [crosstalk 00:11:14] pledges that they have put forth will actually bear fruit and not just be a good PR opportunity.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
And to borrow a word from you. I just don&#8217;t want them to be pledges, I want this to be practice, I want this to be policy. Because anybody can pledge $5,000 to the NAACP or to whatever, but that&#8217;s a one time thing and you&#8217;re not really being held to the fire. Because it&#8217;s like, oh, well we did that and we can say, &#8220;Oh, in 2021, we gave $5,000 to the NAACP or United Negro College Fund,&#8221; or whatever you want to call it. But what about in the next year? Just because you donated a certain dollar amount doesn&#8217;t make the problem go away.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. A lot of these bigger companies will do that, they&#8217;ll just write a check and think that-</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; will solve everything.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Last year, probably last July, so just a little bit over a year ago, so last July I wrote an article for The Drum or an op-ed, better yet for The Drum, and I said, &#8220;advertising, you&#8217;re late.&#8221; Because the way I was seeing different brands and huge agencies respond to the George Floyd murder, let&#8217;s call it what it is, I was just like, &#8220;You&#8217;re late, bro. Police have been killing black people for 100s of years.&#8221; And not even the one time that it&#8217;s caught on television, but the one time that it blew everything up, then, Ooh, we care so much about black lives.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
But no one was really saying that when our babies were being murdered, When Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, no one was raising arms saying, &#8220;Oh my God, this is horrible.&#8221; It took for a guy that&#8217;s literally, I think George Floyd, if he was still alive would be a few years older than me for them to care. But when our babies were getting murdered, nobody gave&#8230; Excuse my language, but nobody gave a you know what.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
So to me during that period and seeing all these really big chest-beating moments for different agencies, I was like, &#8220;Wow. So now you care and now you going to allocate millions of dollars towards diversity.&#8221; But in my days coming up, I had to beg for money for my budget to do the projects that I was doing. Literally, and I&#8217;m talking about, not millions, I&#8217;m talking about like little bit of thousands of dollars for my projects. Beg literally like, &#8220;Please I need this.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Walking up to leadership&#8217;s face and be like, &#8220;Hey, why was my budget cut and why didn&#8217;t nobody tell me?&#8221; Those were the things that I had to do back when I was doing it on the agency side. But after the murder of someone that looks like me, it could have been my cousin, my brother, my neighbor, whatever, all of a sudden we&#8217;ve got millions. We&#8217;ve got millions also in the middle of a pandemic.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
I&#8217;m sorry, I don&#8217;t understand that math because I don&#8217;t understand that&#8230; Those agencies had millions of dollars in the middle of the pandemic while also laying off people at the same time. That&#8217;s why when a lot of interviews I was in last year, people like, &#8220;How do you think this is going to go and everything like that?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Talk to me in five years, because by next year, ain&#8217;t nothing going to be different. Ain&#8217;t nothing going to be different.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Yes, has the great, I call it the black gold kind of situation right now where brothers and sisters are finally getting the opportunities that they deserve? Yeah, it&#8217;s great right now, or as another friend of mine calls it, the great black mining or the great resignation of talent of color, because now they&#8217;re actually going to places that are giving them a proper bag. Yeah, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re in right now, but do I believe that this is going to be something that&#8217;s going to last long? I just don&#8217;t know. I just don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Because what happens after everyone gets these jobs and things of that nature, but then like as we said earlier, the foot comes off the gas because these agencies are like, &#8220;Oh, well, we&#8217;ve gotten close to our goals and now we do have a brother or sister or two in leadership, but it&#8217;s still not like 50% BIPOC, 50 that white people in leadership.&#8221; That&#8217;s not going to happen until I&#8217;m dead in the grave to be totally honest with you.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s just like, when people ask me like, &#8220;Do you think like this is going to change something?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I hope it changes something.&#8221; But from talking to OGs like Tom Barrell, he says, &#8220;This happens every 10 to 20 years, something happens and then everyone cares. And then after a while, it just dies down.&#8221; And I would say, even now, as we&#8217;re having this conversation, the wind behind the diversity and inclusion&#8217;s backs the way it was like last summer, it&#8217;s a softer wind right now. It&#8217;s not as hard as it was like pushing our boats in whatever it is up the stream.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
No, no, no. The wind is a whole lot lighter now. It&#8217;s a whole lot lighter now because they build some of these roles and things of that nature, and now every time I hear about a big agency doing something, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, well, we&#8217;re planning this and we&#8217;re planning that,&#8221; but I never really see anything come to fruition. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh wow, I&#8217;m impressed,&#8221; because all I ever hear is dollar amounts.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t hear about practices, policies, partnerships, and programs that are actually going to really shift the needle. I don&#8217;t see that, I just hear talking. Like I said, you put a quarter in me, bruh, you got to wait till the song goes out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, speaking of these programs and opportunities and such, 100 Roses From Concrete grew out of this environment last year, is that right? You founded it last year and one of the things that you have going on in the program is something that&#8217;s called the G.R.O.W.T.H. Initiative. Can you talk about that?</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Yeah. 100 Roses I actually found it in 2019.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Back when diversity wasn&#8217;t cool, that&#8217;s when I founded it. I founded it in 2019, but we didn&#8217;t have our big bang until COVID hit. It was crazy. At the beginning, March last year, Adweek, shout out to ad week, I&#8217;ll shout out to Adweek all day. Adweek wrote an article about 100 Roses from Concrete and immediately like our membership tripled in like two weeks. But then by the second week of March, here comes the lockdown. Here comes the lockdown, the organization was only running for probably about six months or so, and then everything is locked down, nobody can go nowhere, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
But one of the many thoughts that I had in regards to going onto a virtual platform, 100 Roses, because we used to actually meet in-person was that I have been working with young people, trying to get into the industry for the last 10 years, black and brown, white, whatever, it doesn&#8217;t matter what you are. As long as you want to be in this industry, I would mentor you, talk to you, things of that nature. So immediately I thought about young people&#8217;s internships for the summer of 2020.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
And how I was hearing right before I got let go from the agency where I was you that, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re killing the summer internships, layoffs are coming,&#8221; et cetera, et cetera. And I was like, &#8220;Well, damn.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s not fair,&#8221; because when you think about the summer internship, that&#8217;s that experience in your career, especially if you&#8217;re still in college, that&#8217;s that experience that either makes or breaks you. You either know that, oh, this is for me or no, it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Thinking about how many young people were going to lose that opportunity last summer, immediately, I was like, &#8220;No, no, no, no, no, no. I&#8217;m not going to let this happen. I&#8217;m not going to let this happen.&#8221; So immediately I brought together my team from 100 Roses and I was like, &#8220;Look,&#8221; I was like, &#8220;This is happening, this is about to start happening any day now.&#8221; And it did. And I was like, &#8220;I want to create a program that&#8217;s going to be virtual and it&#8217;s going to be for multicultural college kids from around the country, but it&#8217;s going to have them actually doing real work in real time virtually.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
And I was like, &#8216;Look, I know it&#8217;s a tall ask. Y&#8217;all don&#8217;t want to do it, cool, but I&#8217;m going to do it.&#8221; Because I was already doing programs like this back at two agencies before I got let go, so I already knew how to do this, but I used to do it in-person. So I was like, &#8220;Look, this is what I want to do.&#8221; And I was like, I want to call it G.R.O.W.T.H.? And they were like, &#8220;Cool.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I want to call it The G.R.O.W.T.H. Initiative obviously because I&#8217;m a Marvel fan.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
And then I had given the word G.R.O.W.T.H. to my creative team at 100 Roses From Concrete. I was like, &#8220;Somebody come up with a acronym,&#8221; and everything they sent me back was&#8230; It wasn&#8217;t trash, I just didn&#8217;t like it. And they were having a hard time with it and I was like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Give me about an hour.&#8221; And then I came back to them, I was like, &#8220;Look, this is what I want it to be, Giving Real Opportunity With Talent and Heart.&#8221; And that&#8217;s what G.R.O.W.T.H. stands for.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
That&#8217;s literally like, it should be the name of my autobiography because that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve been trying to do my entire career, is Give Real Opportunity With Talent and Heart. I&#8217;m not trying to build advertising or creative robot here. No, I&#8217;m not trying to do that. We give out awards, especially this year in particularly we gave out four financial awards. Actually we gave out eight financial awards at the end of this summer and we call them The Life After G.R.O.W.T.H. Awards.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
For each award, we give out two of them, so each award starts with a H. We give award for hustle, we give award for being human, we give award for being humble, and we also give an award for being human. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re looking for when we&#8217;re working with these young people and we see it come out of them throughout the program as they work for nonprofit clients across the country. Hell bruh, like this year, The G.R.O.W.T.H. Initiative was international and this is only our second year.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
So by keeping our foot on the gas and giving real opportunity with talent and heart, we&#8217;re able to actually see the change happen in real time. And then also work with agency partners that understand the value that this type of talent brings to the table at the end of the day. Shout out to R\West, shout out to Dego, shout out to Adobe, shout out to Samuels for being really, really great partners and realizing their value. And 21GRAMS/Real Chemistry, shout out to them too for really pulling up and saying, &#8220;We believe in what you&#8217;re doing and we definitely want to bring these young people in to make our agencies better at the end of the day.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s just this year, last year we had absolutely no partners. The only partner we had was Advertising Club of New York who we&#8217;re still partnering with, but Advertising Club of New York helped get us more students to be in the program. So it&#8217;s not like they were giving us internships or full-time jobs or whatever the case may be. But shout out to Advertising Club of New York because they saw what we were doing and they approached us and we were like, &#8220;Hey, the more the merrier, let&#8217;s do it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Also shout out to Save The Internships NY from last year that partnered with us as well. Because they saw what we were doing, they saw that we were grassroots. We&#8217;re not about trying to&#8230; I don&#8217;t even know what we were trying to do last year, but somehow we were like literally building the plane when we were flying it. But it worked out, because most of the fellows from last year, majority of them, especially that were career-ready already have jobs within the industry.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
And now even as I speak to you today, six of my fellows that just graduated back in the middle of August already have job opportunities. They&#8217;re not full-time job opportunities, they&#8217;re internships for the fall already.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
When I tell you that I&#8217;m keeping my foot on the gas, I&#8217;m keeping my foot on the gas and I&#8217;m going fast as possible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now one of the other opportunities that has arose and it&#8217;s also part of why you&#8217;re on the show right now is that you&#8217;re going to be speaking at Adobe Max this year. Can you give a little sneak peek about what your talk&#8217;s going to be about?</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Yeah, man. Adobe Max is like the cherry on the cake this year in regard&#8230; You asked me how my year was going and I was like, &#8220;Yo, it&#8217;s been super wild and everything like that.&#8221; When I got the email to participate in Adobe Max, I was like, &#8220;What?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;You sure you got the right person?&#8221; Because Adobe has been extremely generous to 100 Roses From Concrete and I&#8217;m beyond appreciative for everyone at Adobe that were able to hook us up with the technology resources for the young people in the G.R.O.W.T.H. Initiative.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Shout out to Harvey, shout out to Meg, shout out to everybody at Adobe that was doing it. But my talk at the Adobe Max Conference will be actually me and I&#8217;ll be hosted by my friend, Meg, who&#8217;s just awesome. We were like instant friends. Meg and I are basically going to be talking about how to level the playing field in the creative industries. How do you do that? Throughout our conversation, we don&#8217;t have as much time as you and I do on this podcast. Meg and I are going to be talking about the four things that I feel are most important to leveling this playing field.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
So we&#8217;re going to get into access, we&#8217;re going to get into opportunity, we&#8217;re going to get into experience and exposure. Because those four things right there are what talent of color needs, just talent, period, needs in order to really figure out ways to really level this playing field and making it fair for everyone. But I&#8217;m not only going to talk about the first part, but it all starts, Maurice with access. It all starts with access. If you want to understand why there&#8217;s such a disparity between of people of color and our white brothers and sisters, it all starts with access.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
It&#8217;s the allocation of resources. So when you think about the huge gap between financial resources, educational resources, housing resources, all those things, it starts with access. So I&#8217;m going to talk about that, and then I&#8217;m going to go down this like ski slope of talking about the three other things as well and how they&#8217;re all actually interconnected, and how if we view our diversity problems through that lens, we can actually get to&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not going to say there&#8217;s a definitive answer because the answer is going to be different for everybody, but at least to a solution, and to a solution that we can continue to grow and build and evolve over time. That&#8217;s where that access, opportunity, experience and exposure all are very, very important.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I&#8217;ve done Revision Path for what? Eight and a half? Oh my God, eight and a half years now, and I&#8217;ve had a number of conversations just around diversity in advertising, diversity in design, diversity in tech, et cetera. These conversations, aside from them running in tandem with each others for years, these have also been perennial conversations. If I were even to just pinpoint it for design, this is a conversation that has been going on at least since the &#8217;80s, for example.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you got these different industries, but they have the same goals as it relates to diversity and inclusion, diversifying the workforce, opportunities, things of that nature. A lot of what you&#8217;re mentioning to me sounds very similar to what I&#8217;ve heard from AIGA and what that they&#8217;ve tried to accomplish through their working groups and symposiums in the &#8217;90s and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
From your perspective, what do you think it would look like if these different initiatives work together? Say, what you&#8217;re doing with 100 Roses works with, I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m just pulling stuff out of my head, like say, diversity and design or design to divest or other types of things. What do you think it would look like if [crosstalk 00:26:52] these groups from different industries, yeah, if they work together?</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
If they work together, that&#8217;s how the foot stays on the gas, because then it doesn&#8217;t become, oh, we only talk about this during this time of year. 200 Roses, I have this thing called, that I just created not too long ago, but I guess it&#8217;s always been in the back of my mind when I think about me mentoring and counseling. I have this thing called a cadence of care, and when you create a cadence of care, that&#8217;s how you know that there&#8217;s certain times when you have to discuss this, and then the conversation does not go stale and it doesn&#8217;t grow old.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Because we find new ways to keep it relevant at all times. So if we were to bring all these different resources and movements and things like that together into some type of Voltron-ish type of being, then every single part, whether it&#8217;s the legs, whether it&#8217;s the arms, whether it&#8217;s the legs, whether it&#8217;s the chest, we would know that we have to keep moving. Because Voltron don&#8217;t do jack if it&#8217;s just standing still, so it has to keep moving. So by bringing&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Because I know people that run their own entities, good friends of mine that run their own different entities, I got the one school, we got Marcus Graham Project, we got The One Club, all these other different things. But we all run separately, but we&#8217;re actually all going in the same direction, is that we&#8217;re just all in different lane. So it&#8217;s a matter of that, knowing we all have the same destination, but I don&#8217;t even look at it as a destination because I feel like we need to keep just going, it needs to keep going.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
But that&#8217;s the way I would probably have to answer that question, is that if we were to build something like that, we will all know that we have to hold each other responsible order to keep that blood flowing and keep our foot on the gas to keep it going at all times.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Because the moment we stall is the moment things will go back to the way they used to be. You said this conversation and design is going back to the &#8217;80s, the conversation about diversity and advertising goes back to the &#8217;60s, goes back to &#8217;60s. An individual that I have to always shout out during all my interviews is, goes back to the late great Bill Sharp. He was the first group copy supervisor at JWT where I used to work like two years ago.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
And he passed away sadly in 2013, but he&#8217;s technically considered the godfather of diversity in advertising, because he was talking about it back in like the &#8217;60s, back in the &#8217;60s, he was talking about it. Once I learned about Bill&#8217;s work and what bill did with the basic advertising course, which is similar to like the Marcus Graham Project or the G.R.O.W.T.H. Initiative or the OneSchool. Once I found out about his work, I was like, &#8220;There&#8217;s no way I can work at the same agency as this great black man used to work,&#8221; not the same office, but the same agency where I used to work, &#8220;and me not give two damns about this topic and not put my days and nights, and weekends, whatever into this work.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Once I was properly informed about Bill, and Bill&#8217;s not taught about in ad school. A lot of times you bring up the word, Bill Sharp, people are like, &#8220;Who?&#8221; But he even wrote a book back in the &#8217;60s that I assign to my G.R.O.W.T.H. Initiative fellows called How To Get A Job in the Advertising Business and Be Black Anyway. I may have got a word or two wrong, but it&#8217;s an amazing book, and it&#8217;s only like 19 pages. But even if you read that book today, it sounds like bill is talking to you right now. That&#8217;s how important it&#8217;s.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Yeah man. Bill keeps me inspired and last year I was honored enough to receive his award for the future of advertising and I keep it right here above my desk lit up all the time. But yeah, Bill is the man and I&#8217;m very close to his family and everything like that. I keep them informed of everything that I&#8217;m doing and they always be like, &#8220;Yo, Bill would be proud if he was still around.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Having that co-sign from the Sharp family is something that keeps me going, but also if there&#8217;s opportunities to pull, whether it&#8217;s agencies or small movements like myself with me, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do. But that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s going to take. The Voltron cannot stand still, because if it does, we&#8217;re going to lose time and we&#8217;re going to lose space to gain that leverage within the industry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I have to say, I&#8217;m pretty sure, in terms of those conversations that you mentioned taking place since the &#8217;60s, that&#8217;s where I think the genesis of it for design has also come from too. I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn&#8217;t mention that. I feel like Cheryl Miller and many other luminaries of this issue will probably get at beyond that. But certainly I think these conversations have originated from a similar place because of course advertising really well known back then.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Even if you think about design as we look at it now, it grew out of that creative field, so that makes sense there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Switching gears because I know we spent a lot of time talking about what you&#8217;re doing now with 100 Roses, your Adobe Max talk. I see from looking at your Instagram that you&#8217;re a huge Marvel fan. I want to get [crosstalk 00:32:03] the Keni Thacker origin story. Talk to me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Yeah man. I grew up in Washington, D.C. in Maryland, like the DMV area. DMV was Maryland, D.C., Virginia. That&#8217;s where I grew up. That&#8217;s where before moving to New York, senior year of high school, even though I still finished my senior year of high school, my mother-in-law moved to New York. I finished high school and then when college came, when Lincoln University came into the play, I was already living in New York. I&#8217;ve been living in New York literally now more than half of my life to be totally honest with you.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
That&#8217;s where I grew up, so days and nights in the DMV, and then early adult years, just been here in New York ever since. That&#8217;s like my origin story. In regards to just like getting into the industry, I always say my origin story is nothing fabulous. I don&#8217;t have like these great stories to be like, &#8220;Oh, well, I was in Marple or I was in Marcus Graham Project or I was in the G.R.O.W.T.H. Initiative or whatever the case may be.&#8221; That&#8217;s not how I got into advertising.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
I would say, my first couple years after college, I worked in, I guess, the hospitality industry, so like conference centers, and hotels and things that nature, doing a lot of technology work and things that nature. Like sound systems, projectors, lighting, audio, things of that nature. Eight audio visual, event technology, whatever you want to call it, but that&#8217;s actually what landed me into advertising.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
As a freelancer, doing that work, I landed into Ogilvy and the first day I was in Ogilvy, I didn&#8217;t even know what Ogilvy really was until I was looking at the walls of the old Ogilvy office and seeing these different ads like the Superman, American Express ads and things of that nature and I was like, &#8220;Do they make commercials here?&#8221; And sure enough, they did. And spent a little bit of time at Ogilvy, but then while I was at Ogilvy, I got a call from, at least the agency formally known JWT at the time. Asked me if I was interested in a job and I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t even know what JWT is.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
So I asked one of the people at Ogilvy. I was like, &#8220;Hey, this place called JWT.&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s just like here, except they&#8217;re a little bit older.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Oh, cool.&#8221; Went to JWT on like a lunch break or whatever, knocked out that interview, went for another interview and I had the job. And I spent 13 years at JWT and I would say, 2011 is when I actually started the D&#038;I work that I&#8217;ve been doing, and then I left there on a high note doing the D&#038;I work, but still doing the technical work as well.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
The technical work was always like the stuff that paid the bills, but the D&#038;I work was something that I just did because I was passionate about it. Luckily, I had a few resources that let me do the D&#038;I work. And even when I was at JWT in particular, I created a program called The Young Commodores, which is very similar to the G.R.O.W.T.H. Initiative, except it was in-person. It was definitely not over 50 young people from around the country.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
It was actually the first high school, college mashed up of multicultural students that learned about the business and worked on real life clients. I created The Young Commodores and ran that for about three years. And then at the end of those three years is when I decided to leave JWT. And that&#8217;s when I left it for PR for a little bit. Then after PR that&#8217;s when I created my own company, Keni Thacker, but also before that departure from JWT is when I created 100 Roses From Concrete.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Nothing too fabulous, but more just like falling into opportunities per se, but also making the most out of those opportunities when I had them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s bring it back because you definitely put the foot on the gas there in regards to the origin story, but let&#8217;s bring it back to those DMV years now. I heard that your mom was a copywriter, so your mom was in the ad industry as well. Is that where you got your spark for this kind of work?</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Well, my mom was a copywriter very, very, very, very, very, very, very briefly. I didn&#8217;t realize that she was a copywriter until I was at JWT. Because I was like, &#8220;Is that what mom was doing?&#8221; Because I remember like going with her to the studio and someone was reading the words that she wrote. So I didn&#8217;t really understand it until I was actually in the advertising industry to understand. But my mom has lived like a million lives of needless to say, and copywriter was like one of those.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
She&#8217;s been a teacher, she still is a teacher, but as far as like educating people, that&#8217;s been like, I would say a really big bulk of her career, but she did do a brief stint as a copywriter. What agency? I have no clue because I was a little kid. I don&#8217;t even think she remembers, but she had a brief stint. And then when I was actually in ad school, shout out to the Adhouse, I was like, &#8220;I think this is what mom used to do back when I was like,&#8221; I could barely remember needless to say, but yeah.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
So the creative arts per se has always been in me somewhat. Don&#8217;t get it messed up. I can&#8217;t draw to save my life, so let&#8217;s not even go there. Any artists out there grab GDs as I call them, respect to you all. I can&#8217;t draw to save my life, but I can write a line or two, needless to say and I know good copy when I see it. So on the writing side, that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve always done. I&#8217;ve always written stories or back in the high school days in the DMV, I used to write a couple raps, did a couple rap showcases, things of that nature.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
But unfortunately during those days in the &#8217;90s, there was two great artists that came on the scene that kind of made me feel like, &#8220;You know what, you can&#8217;t do this?&#8221; And one goes by the name of the late great Christopher Wallace and the other Tupac Shakur. I was like, &#8220;Oh, okay, these dudes are really good at this. I&#8217;m not that great.&#8221; So I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m going to go to college. I&#8217;m not going to make it as a rapper.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And speaking of college, what made you decide to go to Lincoln? Because you&#8217;re in the DMV, there&#8217;s Howard, there&#8217;s other HBCU. Not saying that going to an HBCU was&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if that was the goal or not, but what made you decide to go to Lincoln?</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
What made me go to Lincoln was that my high school was in the burbs of Maryland, so it was in this suburb called Germantown, Maryland. I would say, &#8220;Shout out to Germantown,&#8221; but I have nobody live there anymore. But my high school was like in the burb, so Germantown was maybe 30 minutes outside of D.C. My high school was pretty diverse, but I would say it was still majority white. It was probably about 30% kids of color, 70% white kids.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
During that time in particular in going to high school, it wasn&#8217;t like being in D.C. where my elementary school was like all just black and brown kids, pretty much all day, every day. But due to the fact that I spent this time at this very mixed high school per se, I knew that I needed like four years of unadulterated blackness, needless to say. So I only applied to actually HBCUs, I didn&#8217;t apply to any PWCs at all, because that&#8217;s just what I wanted to do.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
But also shout out to one of my high school teachers, actually two of my high school teachers, Ms. Smith and Ms. Wilder was from ninth grade to 10th grade&#8230; No, from ninth grade to 12th grade, we always had field trips to historically black colleges. And maybe one [inaudible 00:39:34] there, once in a blue moon, we go to William and Mary, but we always went to Hampton. We were supposed to go to Lincoln once, but we never did, but we did stop by Temple and there was always like different organizations would sponsor these black college tours.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
So I was able to visit Morehouse and Morris Brown. Obviously, I couldn&#8217;t go to Spelman, but like North Carolina A&#038;T, I think I went there like twice when I was in high school. Those are the only kind of schools that I actually visited when I was in high school and I just knew that this was the kind of atmosphere that I would thrive in. Now, when it came to Lincoln, in particular, two friends of mine from high school actually went to Lincoln and they just raved about. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh my God, it&#8217;s the&#8230;&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Okay, cool.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
So I applied, actually got in. And when I went there for like an open house, I guess, per se, even though I was already accepted, something about just the campus made me feel&#8230; Because Lincoln is not a big school. Lincoln is far from the size of Howard or even Hampton. It&#8217;s a really, really small school, but something about like the feel of the yard just made me feel like, by the time I leave here, everybody&#8217;s going to know my name. And that&#8217;s exactly what I did in four years.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
I did not major in business, I did not major in advertising. I majored in education because I thought I wanted to be a teacher, but there was just something about the experience from Lincoln. And I get this question a lot when people ask me about like my historically black college experience and I tell them, &#8220;You know what, It was bittersweet.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;There was times when it was super sweet because I&#8217;m around my folks and everything like that, but also there was times when it was extremely bitter.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
There was times when I didn&#8217;t want to go back to be totally honest with you. There was times when I definitely did not want to go back. But my mom, always being in my corner, she was like, &#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re going back.&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;When you graduate, we graduate.&#8221; And when she said that alone, that touched my heart and I was like, &#8220;Wow, this means so much to her that when I graduate, she graduates.&#8221; And not that to say that my mother doesn&#8217;t have degrees, now she has multiple degrees, but just that alone made me like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll go back and finish out.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
I did it in a straight four years. Did two summer schools, but finished it in the exact four years that I was allotted to be there. And I&#8217;ve made some of my closest friends there like my roommates and everything like that. I&#8217;m still very close to one of my roommates, in particular, but still&#8230; Love to my other roommate as well, but still close to my friends there and it&#8217;s just something that can never be taken away from me, but even the rough times, I appreciate those rough times.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Because when you think about how we interact with other races, especially the white race in particular, there&#8217;s certain things that we expect because it&#8217;s just systemic, it&#8217;s just systemic. That systemic hate is just something that the system creates. But when some of those bad times that you have with your own people, it almost feels like it&#8217;s your family hurting you. When people ask me about my historically black college experience, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, it was great, but it also&#8230;&#8221; And this is kind of crazy math, but going to historically black college actually helped me deal with white people better.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Because the rough times that I went through at a historically black college will always surpass my roughest day with a white person. Because with a white person, I know it&#8217;s something that it&#8217;s systemic and that&#8217;s just the world that we live in. Whereas when your own people do you dirty, it&#8217;s like&#8230; You feel like we&#8217;re neighbors, why you slap my mom? So it&#8217;s something that even those bad times, I still embrace them because they gave me such a tougher skin.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Because when it&#8217;s your own people, it&#8217;s not a systemic type of player hating or whatever the case may be. It just hate at the end of the day and that hurts. But when it&#8217;s systemic, you kind of know like, &#8220;Oh, well this is just the system being the system and there&#8217;s not much I can really do to change this, because this was the system that person was also born into and that&#8217;s why they look at me this way.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
That&#8217;s my whole HBCU thing till I die. Lincoln&#8217;s the first historically black college and a lot of the things that I try to do, just whether it&#8217;s in life or within my career is always trying to be the first. I went to the first historically black college, JWT was actually the first advertising agency per se. Bill Sharp, first group copy supervisor. I have one child, I&#8217;m an only child, my wife is an only child.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a whole lot of ones that follow my origin story and that&#8217;s just how I operate. Even when I think about The Young Commodores program, it was the first high school, college mashup program to develop talent of color and white kids as well in the whole advertising business period. So it&#8217;s just something that I constantly try to do, I just try to&#8230; There&#8217;s a lot of ones along my story.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting. Lincoln is a very well known HBCU. Like you said, it&#8217;s the first HBCU, Langston Hughes is an alumni, Thurgood Marshall is an alumni.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Yeah. Albert Einstein visited there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a photo of Albert Einstein at Lincoln, like back in the black and white photo days. I don&#8217;t know when exactly it was, but even Albert Einstein visited Lincoln University. And the campus hasn&#8217;t moved, it&#8217;s still exactly where it is, in Southern Chester County, Pennsylvania, right off of route one, it&#8217;s an hour away from Philly. It&#8217;s still there and it&#8217;s even better now, because actually they do have an advertising program at that school now. So that&#8217;s always good to hear of the school growing and things of that nature.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I first heard about Lincoln&#8230; When did I first hear about Lincoln? I think it was when I was in college. So I went to Morehouse and-</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Okay. My best friend went there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh nice. The summer before I started, there was like the summer program that I was a part of and our math professor was a math professor from Lincoln, Dr. Shaba. Unfortunately has passed away rest in peace, but that&#8217;s where I first heard about Lincoln and he gave us the history of Lincoln. And Dr. Shaba is like one of the most well known black mathematicians in the world. That&#8217;s how I first heard about the school and everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
As you mentioned, you graduated from Lincoln, you were out there in the world, you were doing this work in tech, you kind of said for ad agencies and stuff like that. And then you started out later at JWT, which is where you spent the bulk of your career. When you look back at that time, what are some of the highlights that you remember from that?</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
The highlights were-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are there highlights? I would imagine so. I&#8217;m just.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
It&#8217;s all a highlight reel. No, some of it&#8217;s not. Some of the highlights was being able to executive produce&#8230; The first documentary I ever executive produced was for a Black History Month as a part of the diversity platforms that we were creating. But being able to executive produce my first documentary, that was when I was like, &#8220;Yeah, this is what I&#8217;m going to do.&#8221; Needless to say, it was a great experience. That very first one that I executive produced was actually directed by my man, Pete Chapman. He&#8217;s moved on and directed a bunch of great stuff for television, for Black-ish, for Grown-ish, for Atypical, Grey&#8217;s Anatomy.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
He&#8217;s just killing it basically right now in the game, but it was a great opportunity to work with him. I won&#8217;t say those were his early days, but definitely his day getting into the game and things of that nature. But not only did I executive produce that documentary, but I also made that documentary another four times after that. And then I started directing and producing those documentaries after I couldn&#8217;t afford Pete after the first time because he&#8217;s too good.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
But me getting into the production field and whether it was camera work and directing at the same time, being able to do all of that, then create these programs for young people. I would say two years after starting this kind of work, that&#8217;s when the accolades started coming in slowly but surely, but they were definitely coming in and it was all just mind blowing for me at the end of the day. So it&#8217;s been like one experience to the other, but I will say, creating Young Commodores, creating 100 Roses From Concrete, creating the G.R.O.W.T.H. Initiative, I would say, those have been like the steady, just like it never gets old, but also like ain&#8217;t no stopping now.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
But I also feel like I&#8217;m only getting started. Even doing this work for 10 years, to be totally honest with you, Maurice, I feel like I&#8217;m only getting started.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking to that, I&#8217;m curious, you mentioned all these firsts. You mentioned first for your program, things of that nature, where does that drive come from? Why do you have the ambitions that you have?</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
I think the ambition comes from my family. One, I&#8217;m surrounded by the strongest, smartest women, period. When I think about my wife, when I think about my mom, when I think about my kid, they&#8217;re all just way smarter than me. They&#8217;re smarter and they&#8217;re stronger than me. So by being surrounded&#8230; And shout out to all my nieces too, but they&#8217;re all so strong and also very focused that it&#8217;s like, I have got to pull my weight, dog. To be totally honest with you, I have got to pull my weight.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
So when it comes to the things that I want to do, I&#8217;m also thinking about the future for my daughter. When I say that I&#8217;ve been doing this work for 10 years, she&#8217;s only 11 years old, so literally-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
&#8230; it was after like a year after her birth that I was like, &#8220;You know what?&#8221; I just wasn&#8217;t feeling like I was being challenged, I wasn&#8217;t being fulfilled, and I didn&#8217;t even know that I could actually make a difference in this industry. But when she came along, I was like, &#8220;If there&#8217;s anything I can do to make sure that maybe the job role is just 5% easier for her than the 100% how hard it was for my wife and myself, and Lord knows my mom. She&#8217;s been working in industry&#8230; She&#8217;s still working and she&#8217;s about to be 80 years old.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
But if there&#8217;s any way that I can do to just make it 5% easier for her, then that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do. And that&#8217;s what I have done. Even if you scroll back to some of my older Instagram photos, you&#8217;ll see that I brought her on set when she was like three, four years old making spots.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
With the G.R.O.W.T.H. Initiative this summer, when one of the teams was making a commercial for her spot, I brought her with me so she could see what we were doing as like a ragtag kind of production crew and things of that nature. So I constantly try to bring her along for the journey, as much as I possibly can. Whether she&#8217;s super interested or not interested, still try to make her a part of it so she can understand and see how it works. But then also see like, &#8220;Oh, so these young people are 20, 22 years old,&#8221; or whatever the case may be, &#8220;and they&#8217;re trying to do this, and my dad is actually helping them.&#8221; You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Even when I do&#8230; Back when we could do things in-person, any award that I would receive, I would bring her up on stage with me so she could be a part of that experience as well. So she&#8217;s seen me win award from award to magazine&#8230; Now, she&#8217;s just numb to it all, so she [crosstalk 00:51:03]. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, dad, oh, you were in Business Insider. Oh, okay. Who cares?&#8221; But she&#8217;s kind of gotten numb to it all and it&#8217;s kind of a running joke around my house, because my wife always makes fun of me because &#8220;Oh, you think you&#8217;re famous?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
And then my kid said, &#8220;Dad, you&#8217;re like semi famous,&#8221; something like that. And that&#8217;s the running joke around the house that I&#8217;m not famous, I&#8217;m kind of semi famous. But needless to say, the accolades, when they do come through, I&#8217;m still blown away by any one of them. And I&#8217;m super grateful when they do come, because, one, I don&#8217;t do it for the accolades in the first place. You know what I mean? I&#8217;m doing it here to literally change the culture and doing it for the people that look like me and definitely, for the ones that are coming behind us at the end of the day.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Because when I think about my early days and just how, as I said, I think in the beginning of our talk is how I always in the room, but I didn&#8217;t have a seat at the table. I was in the rooms with our CEOs and our top leaders, going around the country, helping them with their technology as they&#8217;re meeting with these multi-billion dollar clients and things of that nature. I was there, but I didn&#8217;t have any power.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
But now, 15 years later in the advertising business, here I am doing a podcast with Maurice and about to be on the Adobe Max stage. And I can say that Adobe with more money than God is one of the partners for my organization that I started myself. You know what I mean? So it&#8217;s all just like&#8230; I can&#8217;t even call it a dream come true because I didn&#8217;t even dream this to be totally honest with you, Maurice. I didn&#8217;t even dream this.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
It was just more like being on the grind, doing what I do, trying to do it the best way I know how, bringing in the right people, because the Lord knows I can&#8217;t do it by myself. But that&#8217;s all it&#8217;s been bruh, to be 100% honest with you. That&#8217;s all it&#8217;s been, but I didn&#8217;t even dream of an Adobe partnership. But now thinking back to the days when I didn&#8217;t have a seat at the table and even though I was in the room. But now I can be like, &#8220;Yeah, I partner with Adobe, multi-billion dollar company and I did it from my living room, dog.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Mentioning your daughter, does she want to follow in your footsteps? Since she&#8217;s kind of been shadowing you, it sounds like for a very long time.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
She&#8217;s more into the theatrical arts, so she&#8217;s a little actress, needless to say, and she&#8217;s done multiple productions with her theater camp. She currently attends Harlem School of the Arts, shout out to Harlem School of the Arts, so she&#8217;s killing it there right now. But she more in front of the camera, needless to say. But she&#8217;s also a great writer in her own right and she writes about things that are important to her, even stuff that in regards to our country and things of that nature.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
So she definitely has her own opinion about things, because it&#8217;s sad to say, since 2017, she&#8217;s had her front row seat to everything that&#8217;s been going wrong. And I was telling a friend of mine from the UK, I was like&#8230; And this is back in 2017. I was telling him, I was like, &#8220;The worst part about what was then about to happen was that our kids will not be able to unsee this.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s very true.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
There&#8217;s just no going to what was. We as adults would be forever changed, but our kids even more so. And especially when you even think of just as of last year, being like stuck on the screen all day and that&#8217;s their form of school. We didn&#8217;t have to go through that when we were in school. Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
But like the resilience, I would say of these young people these days, even all the way down to my daughter&#8217;s age, the ones that are handling it well, like yo. I give them all the respect. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Y&#8217;all are way stronger than us,&#8221; because I would&#8217;ve probably quit school. I could probably sit street on the street all day. My attention span just wasn&#8217;t like that back then. Hell, it&#8217;s probably not like that now. But needless to say, the resilience of these young people, and shout out to my guests, the G.R.O.W.T.H. Initiative fellows, to pull together campaigns all virtually over these last two years.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
That alone, I tell them, I was like, &#8220;Y&#8217;all are special. You don&#8217;t understand how special you are that you&#8217;re able to pull together campaigns for these nonprofit organizations and most of y&#8217;all aren&#8217;t even in the same state. Hell, same continent.&#8221; Shout out to my nephew Sandip in New Delhi and then one of my other fellows in Singapore. They were joining like 5:00 AM their time our sessions.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
You know what I mean? 5:00 AM, 12:00 PM their time, literally oceans and oceans away. But they were joining and they got the most out of the experience, and they were doing their thing. It&#8217;s crazy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are you where you wanted to be at the stage in your life? When you think back to like the early days of what you were working on, is this where you saw yourself ending up?</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
No, I didn&#8217;t. I thought I&#8217;d constantly be working for like a company all my life. Obviously, I&#8217;m not a millennial, so I don&#8217;t bounce around every two to three years or whatever the case may be. As you see, I spent a long time at JWT. Was I planning on retiring from JWT? No, that I was never in the cards for me. I always wanted a way out and I always wanted to find just a way to still actively be involved in the industry, but maybe just not there.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
And I can&#8217;t honestly say, this is where I want to be, because then that&#8217;s me saying I&#8217;m comfortable where I am. And since I&#8217;m constantly on the move, it&#8217;s just like, yeah, this is good, but I feel like I could always do better at the end of the day. I&#8217;m not a sedentary type of person when it comes to my career and what I want to do, and especially, with like shout out Fast &#038; Furious kind of reference, but like with the nitrous boost that my career got, I would say over the last, going on the last two years, actually, I don&#8217;t ever want to just say, &#8220;I&#8217;m happy where I am.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
There&#8217;s one piece of advice I give young people all the time is like, don&#8217;t chase the checkered flag because there shouldn&#8217;t be an end to what you want to do. You should constantly be evolving and growing all the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Five years, hopefully, the Roses is on more solid footing. Not that we&#8217;re not right now, but even on more solid footing, more great partners, things of that nature, bringing, making this a reality, getting these right. Bringing this black BIPOC talent into these industries that don&#8217;t really have a lot of them. Keni Thacker LLC definitely, working with agencies on a longer basis, but also being able to really ignite sustainable and perpetual change within these organizations. That&#8217;s where I&#8217;d like to see myself.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
If we&#8217;re having this conversation in three to five years, that&#8217;s where I want to see myself. Just basically more growth at the end of the day, giving real opportunity with talent and heart on both ends. Whether it&#8217;s through the agency side, or through the work that I do with the young people, or the professional development that we do through 100 Roses from Concrete, that&#8217;s where I want to be like in five years. But even five years from now, I&#8217;m still not going to be comfortable where I&#8217;m at because I&#8217;m going to be like, &#8220;I know I need to do more.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And honestly, who knows what this world is going to look like in five years with the way things are going right now.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It kind of feels like the smart thing to still stick with what you&#8217;re working on, so it sounds good.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
I hope to be alive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look, floods in one part of the country, fires in another part as we&#8217;re recording this, I should mention. But yeah, I totally get what you&#8217;re saying.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
I hope to be alive. But if I am alive, I&#8217;m going to tell you this, Maurice, I&#8217;m be fucking&#8230; Excuse my language, sorry. I&#8217;ma be put my foot in people&#8217;s behinds and making sure like these things come to fruition, one way or the other. One way or the other, who&#8217;s to say, five years from now, maybe I&#8217;m working for one of these places, I don&#8217;t know. But if I am, it&#8217;s not going to be this soft-shoe dancing around the topic of diversity, it&#8217;s going to be like, &#8220;No.&#8221; It&#8217;s going to be Timberland boots.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
And we&#8217;re going to be like in town stomping, making this stuff happen at the end of the day. Because the days of like the soft-shoe tap dancing around has got us nowhere. It has got us absolutely nowhere. It&#8217;s got us absolutely nowhere, but it&#8217;s also made a lot of people extremely wealthy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
This is true.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s a matter of thinking about, okay, obviously, there&#8217;s a worry from a certain group of people that, &#8220;Oh, well, there&#8217;s not enough room at the table.&#8221; That&#8217;s okay, because you know what? You, me, a bunch of other people, we can go to Home Depot to get some plywood, build some chairs, build extensions to that table and make the table bigger. Because it&#8217;s not about taking away from anyone, it&#8217;s about just making more room at the end of the day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Obviously, kenithacker.com, look pretty easy place to find about work with Keni Thacker LLC. But then also, 100 Roses from Concrete, it&#8217;s 100rosesfromconcrete.com. On Twitter, we&#8217;re 100RFC. Yeah, 100RFC on Twitter, but 100 Roses from Concrete on Instagram. And me, just same way on Instagram and Twitter, just K-E-N-I-T-H-A-C-K-E-R on both. No secret cool handles or whatever the case may be. That&#8217;s the easiest way to find out what we&#8217;re doing and what I&#8217;m doing, and things coming up, and things of that nature.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
We&#8217;re working on some new stuff for the G.R.O.W.T.H. Initiative that will probably launch in January. It&#8217;s to have secrets, so I can&#8217;t really talk about it right now. I am going to say that, with the G.R.O.W.T.H. Initiative, we have mastered helping young people, so now it&#8217;s a matter of thinking about how do we help other people through the umbrella of growth and 100 Roses from Concrete. So that&#8217;s going to be something that people are going to need to look for.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
Probably in the next couple months, We&#8217;re definitely going to start grinding down that idea that I have for the organization to help more people at the end of the day. Because I always tell people, I was like, &#8220;The one thing whenever this COVID stuff is done, a couple things that will still be around is going to be racism, ageism, sexism, xenophobia, ableism, and all those other isms are going to outlive COVID whenever COVID it&#8217;s over.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s really about not taking our foot off the gas about those things that are important to us, but also those things that are going to make our creativity better, make our pockets better equitably, but also make people feel like they belong and feel like they&#8217;re a part and they can be successful within these organizations, where lot of faces don&#8217;t look like theirs at the end of the day.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
So if there&#8217;s anything that I can do to teach people how to show up in these challenging spaces where creativity and commerce often meet and humility falls short, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good, man. Well, Keni Thacker, I want to thank you so much, so, so much for coming on the show. Thank you for really, putting yourself out there and stepping out on your own and being a voice in the advertising, and creative industries, as it relates to pulling together opportunities for really diverse talent. It&#8217;s certainly something that throughout the time I&#8217;ve done this show, I&#8217;ve been trying to beat that drum to let companies know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s good to tell off to somebody out there that&#8217;s also really putting his foot on the gas and making sure that this happens so the next generation can really come up and have the opportunities that they need to succeed. Thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Keni Thacker:</b><br>
As one of my professors, Dr. T, actually at Lincoln used to say, it&#8217;s been a privilege and a pleasure.</p>

<p>Summer is over, y&#8217;all. As we head into a new season, it&#8217;s a perfect time to pause and reflect, gain some clarity, and reassure yourself about your purpose. That&#8217;s exactly what this week&#8217;s guest Janessa Robinson is doing, particularly now that she&#8217;s at the beginning of a new adventure &#8212; moving to Los Angeles!</p>
<p>Our conversation began with Janessa talking about the recent move, and she spoke a bit about her day job as a content creator. We also dived into the backstory behind her company Artistry Land, and Janessa discussed how she works as a creative with Asperger&#8217;s, and how she cleverly uses design thinking as a way to manifest success in her life.

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I am Janessa Robinson and I&#8217;m an artist and an entertainer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So how are things going for you right now? What&#8217;s on your mind?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Oh, well, things are going great. I just moved to Los Angeles a month ago, actually drove down here from San Francisco.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It was an interesting experience. That&#8217;s the first road trip that I&#8217;ve taken by myself before. It was amazing because as I pulled into Los Angeles, it really hit me that I live here, that I&#8217;m moving here as a resident. Each other time that I came to LA, it was to visit. I stayed with a cousin once who lived in east LA, she&#8217;s a screenwriter. Every time before that, it was like I came through LAX Airport on my way somewhere else. So I just wanted to stay. I&#8217;m very happy that I&#8217;m here. It&#8217;s a very significant change for me because I spent three years living in San Francisco. And ever since I was a small child, I&#8217;ve always wanted to live here, and not just live here, but be a leader in the community here to contribute something. I just saw that my life is here. So it&#8217;s an amazing experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. It sounds like you&#8217;ve had a pretty transformative year then, especially with this move.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I would say COVID is interesting. There&#8217;s a lot of change for everyone. For me, I went from, oh gosh, spending four hours in traffic, just commuting between San Francisco and Santa Clara to staying at home. And me being like, okay, great. Well, now I can spend all the time I want on my art because we were essentially confined to our homes in the beginning. I decided that I would start dancing every day. I was recording myself and posting these videos on Instagram. I actually made a very intentional decision that I would turn my Instagram page into like a television channel. It&#8217;s like a show. It&#8217;s like an entertainment show. I called it Variety Nessa. [inaudible 00:06:08] dancing and rapping and singing and just shooting really interesting content in ways that would engage people since we were at home. I was like, &#8220;Hey, check this out.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
That led me into doing music actually. I was producing, writing, singing, taking singing and song arrangement lessons, piano lessons, mixing and mastering my own music. I used an algorithm actually to master my music. Yeah, it was really interesting. And sharing it on Bandcamp. My first project, I actually worked with a producing partner where he did the mixes and masters. So I just spent the last year growing tremendously, artistically, getting in FTs and graphic design, just blossoming, just honestly blossoming. It&#8217;s an amazing, amazing year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now you&#8217;re also breaking a bin into Hollywood too, right?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yes. Yeah. I actually literally live in Hollywood. That&#8217;s my community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
That&#8217;s where my home is located, which is really cool. Yeah, I am training at two Hollywood acting studios right now. One is Shari Shaw Studio, which is physically located in Hollywood, although I haven&#8217;t gone there yet because of COVID. And then the other is Leslie Kahn &#038; Co. Both of these studios are very special to me. The instructors there, my classmates, the energy and the way that we all invest into each other, it&#8217;s just very special to me. Then I&#8217;m very happy because for me, Hollywood, physically, and more metaphorically, the Hollywood community, which is spread out across the world. There&#8217;s Hollywood the location, and then there&#8217;s Hollywood the industry, which is just, it&#8217;s a bunch of us who are very, very fond of entertaining and see a lot of value in it.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
For me, something that over the last year I was really reminded of is my family history in Hollywood. I have a great, great grandmother named Eva Wheatley Jones who danced with Josephine Baker. She&#8217;s one of the first &#8220;tan girls.&#8221; Meaning that she&#8217;s light-skin, brown, but not dark-skin brown, but at that time it was considered progress, I suppose.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I guess they all just call it colored back then, right?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. I think that didn&#8217;t even come on mind. Yeah. She&#8217;s one of the first tan girls to dance with Josephine Baker. She is married to a comedian and he was a part of a comedy dance duo, same as Butter Beans. Then I have a great uncle, Arthur, who played in a jazz band for Al Capone at the Copacabana in Chicago. There&#8217;s just a lot of people in my family that have really contributed to make the Hollywood entertainment industry what it is today. The inclinations that I have for all of these different forms of art, I just love art, I just love design. For me, it&#8217;s about the process and the experience. Whatever the tools are, I&#8217;ll just use them to just make something magnificent. I don&#8217;t really care what the tools are. I want to do cool stuff.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It occurred to me when my mom was sharing all this information with me, that was shared with me in my childhood, but this is now, I&#8217;m in my adulthood, and now it resonates more to understand, oh, I see. These are the giftings that my family, that my ancestors, recent and much further back, that they&#8217;ve bestowed on me. So I feel very, very blessed and very grateful and appreciative to be in the position, to know that, to see that, and to activate on what it is that they have deposited into me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. It sounds like it&#8217;s literally in your blood to be an entertainer. You come from that lineage. That&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah. It is. It&#8217;s in my blood. That&#8217;s what my mom says. She goes, &#8220;This is who you are. This is in your DNA. These are your genes.&#8221; That&#8217;s what she tells me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So let&#8217;s talk about one of the things that you&#8217;re currently doing. You&#8217;re a content creator for a company called News Break. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting. So, News Break is a news publication that is available as a website, newsbreak.com, and as a downloadable mobile application. So people can go visit their App Stores or Google Play Store and download News Break. It is interesting because it solves a problem. It solves the problem of gathering local news over, gosh, I don&#8217;t know, the last, you could say 20, 30, 40 years. It depends on how far you want to go back. But we know that for some time, there&#8217;s been a trend of investment into local news dwindling. News Break prioritizes local news on the app and the website based on the geolocation of the user. It also pulls in national news. But the thing is that national news, it&#8217;s pretty repetitive. [crosstalk 00:11:37] the news wires. So it&#8217;s the same story over and over. It just has a slightly different, it depends if. It&#8217;s a news wire, it&#8217;s just going to be the exact same thing.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
But in most cases, it might be a slightly different tone based on the writer&#8217;s style or it just has a different mass head that it&#8217;s under. But national news, now that we have Twitter and YouTube and all these things that help us communicate one story to billions of people instantaneously, it&#8217;s just pretty repetitive. So local news is pretty cool because it&#8217;s specific to what&#8217;s happening in your community, in your neighborhood. Like what&#8217;s going on. I first started writing for News Break just as I was leaving San Francisco. I was writing stories there, and then as I moved here, I switched to writing local stories about Los Angeles. Honestly, I like to report on really interesting people, local businesses. I love reporting on food. I&#8217;m a pescatarian and I&#8217;m allergic to dairy. So I like to go out and see, well, where are the best seafood tacos? Because I love seafood food tacos. Where can I get a really good salmon sandwich? Just write about that. Also, I like to eat those things.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I like to be in that moment and just allow my palette to be dazzled and then take all of that energy in and write about that so that I can recommend to people where to go. I&#8217;ll say that LA is LA. There&#8217;s no place like Los Angeles. Reporting here has been very interesting. I just did a story on a luxury experience service company called the [inaudible 00:13:27]. I hope that people do not, the French people do not criticize French accent, but I do speak a bit of French. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s mostly accurate, but yeah, I got to report on this luxury experience company and meet the owner who&#8217;s a very private person. So I&#8217;ll respect his privacy.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s the fact that I&#8217;m talking about luxury experience company that we will, if I say, Hey, I wanna fly to Monaco for a private shopping trip tomorrow, they&#8217;ll put that together right now. They&#8217;ll have a driver come pick me up. They&#8217;ll have a private jet waiting for me. There&#8217;ll be food, snacks that are on the way, all these things. It&#8217;s just this amazing company that in comparison to my time in San Francisco, it&#8217;s not to say that that doesn&#8217;t exist there, it&#8217;s just maybe not as ingrained into the culture like in San Francisco. It&#8217;s more like, where&#8217;s the best vegan place to eat or what&#8217;s a really good mountain to climb, is what draws people there more so than LA, which is how fabulous can I live?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds very LA, something like that.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
LA was the last city that I visited before all this pandemic stuff. We did a live show there back in Jan&#8230; Well, it was January or February. It was February. Yeah, it was February of 2020. We did a live show down in Leimert Park. That was pretty good. I didn&#8217;t get to see a ton of LA. I just remember LA being so big. I stayed in Koreatown and the event that we did was in Leimert Park. Then I was in another part of town, not too far from Koreatown. Because I was also there for a work conference. People that were there were like, &#8220;Oh, you should go to the beach.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, but it&#8217;s going to take about an hour to get there.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, that doesn&#8217;t really sound like something I want to do if it&#8217;s going to take that long to get there.&#8221; It&#8217;s still in the city, I guess I didn&#8217;t realize the enormity of Los Angeles until I actually got there and was like, this place is huge, really spread out.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It is, it is very large, honestly. First of all, I hope that you come, that you return to LA and do another live show so that I can be on it. What I was going to say is that before I moved here, the last time I visited was just before the pandemic. I don&#8217;t know if it was around the same time that you were here, but it was just before the pandemic, where the Los Angeles Clippers flew me out here for an interview. I was interviewing for a job there and they flew me down from San Francisco. And oh my gosh, when I got to LAX, I had about, I think like maybe 45 minutes or an hour between landing and the time of my interview. I was like, oh, that&#8217;s plenty of time [inaudible 00:16:27]. I was like, oh my God, am I going to make it? What is going on?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It was just so stressful and I almost missed my flight on the way back. Because I was in those interviews all day and then I was like, I don&#8217;t think they know what time my flight [inaudible 00:16:47]. No one&#8217;s paying attention. So apparently I have to tell them, &#8220;Hey, I have to go catch this flight.&#8221; I almost missed it. When I was in the process of traveling back to San Francisco, I was like, wow. Yeah, it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve lived in a city that&#8217;s really large. I&#8217;m from Chicago. I lived in New York for a bit. Then I started to wonder, I was like, a city with eight million people? LA, do I want to do that? I don&#8217;t know. But then I do. I was like, I don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;ll deal with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right, right.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
So now it&#8217;s like, sure, it&#8217;ll take an hour to get to Santa Monica. That&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;ll just listen to some good music and chill in the car. It&#8217;s no big deal.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was surprised by how much traffic there was. I live in Atlanta, which is notorious for traffic, but Los Angeles has Atlanta beat it hands down. The traffic that I would see, or that actually was stuck in on the one on one was hellish. It was ridiculous.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s tough. I&#8217;ll say, I don&#8217;t have my only comparison points for being in traffic or me being a passenger because this is the first time in my life that I&#8217;ve ever driven regularly. This is the first car that I&#8217;ve ever owned. [inaudible 00:18:03]. I don&#8217;t know. When I was growing up, everyone drove me around for the most part. Even when I got a license, that was still the case. And then when I graduated high school, I went to undergrad. I studied at St. John&#8217;s University in New York, where very few people drove regularly around there.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Then by the time, I transferred and graduated from Tulane University in New Orleans, so by the time I did that, Uber was a thing. It was not yet an app, it&#8217;s text-based, but you could just text this number and a black car would pull up. I thought it was sketchy at first. I was like, [inaudible 00:18:47] kidnap me. Who&#8217;s in the car? But yeah, so then I just Ubered around for almost eight years. Now I own a car and I&#8217;m like, oh, traffic, this is what it&#8217;s like to drive in traffic. So yeah, it&#8217;s interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I missed those early days of Uber when they just had the black cars. But for what I remember, I would take them in different cities, but the one thing that I remember is how much the drivers hated it. Because for them, they&#8217;re used to, I guess if you&#8217;re a black car driver, like a Lincolnton car or something like that, there&#8217;s a certain, I think, clientele that you&#8217;re used to in terms of decorum and all that stuff. Now they&#8217;re picking up drunk kids at the bar and driving them three blocks and then having to clean up vomit from the back seat.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember talking to, I did it for an article, this was back in the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Jesus, maybe 10 years ago, I think. God, wow, [inaudible 00:19:48] services have been around that long. But I remember talking to some drivers and them being like, &#8220;Yeah, I hate it. I don&#8217;t know what this Uber thing is, but it&#8217;s some extra money. But I don&#8217;t like the fact that we have to pick up these folks and they give us attitude. And it&#8217;s just a different thing.&#8221; Now of course, ride sharing is a pretty, I think, common thing because now folks can even use their own cars. But I remember in the beginning though, just taking those black cars and it just felt so official. Like, oh, this is nice. I felt wealthy.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah, it is. I would agree. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re used to a very specific persona for clientele. I remember when I was in D.C., I was out with some friends and we ordered, this is when Uber was an app, but I think we got Uber black, because it was so many of us and we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get a SUV or whatever.&#8221; I had this friend who was giving the Uber driver directions, which is already like, I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re doing this, he has a map, what are you doing? He tells the driver, he was like, &#8220;Yeah, bang a right right here.&#8221; And the driver drove straight through the intersection.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Whoa.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
He doesn&#8217;t know what bang a right means. He was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what that is.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;Bang a right, what is this?&#8221; And just kept going straight. I think also, he maybe didn&#8217;t like that this guy was leaning over the seat, giving him directions. But yeah, there was some clear maybe mismatch of energy there. So, those funny.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to talk to you about this term, content creator, because it&#8217;s certainly one that I think has popped up, I don&#8217;t know, maybe with over the past two years or so. We&#8217;ve been seeing this generalization of people that maybe before have done specialized stuff, like they&#8217;ve been writers or illustrators or whatever. Now it&#8217;s just this generic term, content creator. When I hear it, I feel like it&#8217;s mostly associated with video. But I&#8217;m curious, when you hear that phrase, content creator, what does that mean to you?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Honestly, I don&#8217;t know what&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. It could be in a lot of things. I have Asperger&#8217;s. One of the characteristics of that is a person might see a word or a phrase and their mind starts to run through the multiple meanings or ways that it could be used, the etymology, at least for me because I&#8217;m a linguist. Honestly for me, it&#8217;s like a placeholder, just some words, just some letters, some syllables that go there to describe the way that someone moves through the world. It&#8217;s used in a lot of ways, I agree. Like sometimes it&#8217;s used for writers, sometimes it&#8217;s used for people who run podcasts, sometimes it&#8217;s for video people. I think in the context of News Break, it&#8217;s [inaudible 00:22:45]. I think it&#8217;s because they use content creator because in a lot of cases, they&#8217;re looking for someone who&#8217;s more than a writer.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Being a writer is great. It&#8217;s an excellent skill. But in the digital space, when you&#8217;re developing articles, unless you have a full editorial staff where you have photographers and art directors and video producers that are their own individual team, then the writer, the journalist becomes the person who wears all those hats. So I&#8217;m that person. I do interview people. I develop sources and relationships, I interview them. I shoot photography, I edit photography, I shoot video, I edit video and I polish it all up and I drop there. So for me, I guess that&#8217;s what I associate with now, is if I&#8217;m a content creator, I&#8217;m someone who I create any kind of content.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s like the same thing where I&#8217;m like, yeah, I can make my own music from end to end. Whatever the content is, it&#8217;s something I can create. It&#8217;s [inaudible 00:23:48] the way that I see it, but I don&#8217;t know. I think it can be one, is that now going to be the expectation. Our specialties no longer going to be as prized being a really excellent writer. I think for some people that might be maybe all they want or maybe they only want to do photography. I don&#8217;t know. I feel good about it because I can do all those things and I like doing all those things, but what about someone who doesn&#8217;t want to do all those things? But if they have a very strong interest in one area, I hope there&#8217;s still space for those people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It sounds like it&#8217;s a new way of looking at Jack of all trades. That&#8217;s how, I guess, it used to be called, where you did a lot of different things. You just brought a lot of different skills to the table. I had a friend that, actually, he really explained it to me in a way that made sense. It&#8217;s like, he says, &#8220;Content these days is water and whatever the medium is or the platform is the container that content can fill.&#8221; So for example, let&#8217;s say, oh, so there&#8217;s this guy, he&#8217;s a chef. His name is chef John Kung. He was mostly doing stuff on TikTok, I think. But the concept is him cooking, which can be extrapolated to any number of different platforms because he&#8217;s using video.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So in that video format, yes, it could go on TikTok, but it could also go on Instagram. It could also go on YouTube, but you could see how these different platforms would have different audiences, different levels of engagement, et cetera. But someone could also take that and take the video out, and now you just have the audio and that could be a podcast. Or someone could transcribe that audio, and now that&#8217;s an article. Or someone can take that article and make images of it, and now it&#8217;s an infographic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So content ends up being this, it&#8217;s the idea and then whatever that medium or platform is, is how it can trickle down and filter down. But yeah, that&#8217;s if you want to do all of that stuff. For example, I consider myself a podcaster, but I have had people call me a content creator because I can do video dah, dah, dah, dah. I mostly just do podcasting because that&#8217;s what form this particular idea is in. But yeah, Revision Path could be video and articles and all this stuff. I choose for it not to be, but it could be. I hear that term, content creator, and it&#8217;s like, I was bristle at it a little bit because I&#8217;m like, be specific. But then maybe that&#8217;s just me being older thinking it has to be in one of these finite categories or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
That&#8217;s interesting. I think I like it because it is flexible and broad. For me, today I might want to write articles, tomorrow I might want to shoot a film. I don&#8217;t like figuring out the way to label myself in regards to the way that I contribute artistically. I don&#8217;t know. I end up with a lot of words. If you go to my website right on Janessarobinson.com or artistryland.space, there&#8217;s an area in both places to read my bio. And it says Janessa Robinson is a publish journalist, a writer, an actor, a photographer, a this, a that. There&#8217;s so many, what would I call this? I was like, I don&#8217;t know what to&#8230; I like when there&#8217;s something that&#8217;s flexible or broad enough. The word artist, I love it because you could be a performance artist, you could be a singer, you could be a poet.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s flexible enough in a way where someone who creates art at this point is not just a singer or not just a poet. If you&#8217;re an artist, it means that you have a particular artistic vision, artistic gaze and artistic process and you apply that to whatever medium. The medium at that point isn&#8217;t as relevant as it is to maybe whatever the message is that you want to communicate. The question that becomes, is this the best medium or is this the proper medium or the best way to reach people? What&#8217;s the goal? So with content creator, I like it because otherwise, it&#8217;s like, well, am I a writer, video producer or this? And it&#8217;s like, it becomes this long list. In Hollywood when someone is multi talented that way, we used to call it a triple threat. Like Jamie Foxx, he&#8217;ll sing, he&#8217;ll act, he&#8217;ll produce like comedy, whatever. You call this person a triple threat. Today, we call it a multi hyphenate because triple is not true.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
At that point, it&#8217;s less about the specific activities, like what it is that someone&#8217;s doing and more about who they are and what they bring to whatever they touch. That&#8217;s how I identify. It&#8217;s like if you give me a camera, I&#8217;m going to start shooting things. If you give me a microphone, I&#8217;m going to start singing. It&#8217;s more this artistic energy. So with content creation, I feel very similar. Whereas my content creation might be NFTs and graphic design today. It might be videos and editing, cutting together audio the next day. I like that.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
When I formed my company, Artistry Land, you have to fill out this business paperwork and articulate, well, what are the products of the services? One of the things that I put is digital and physical content. Then I put some examples. I said, including but not limited to, because it&#8217;s Artistry Land, it&#8217;s a land of art. It&#8217;s just going to be whatever I need it to be. I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m figuring that out every day. I love that exploration. I think that&#8217;s amazing. I get to learn a lot and connect with people in ways that are relevant and timely to the present.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about Artistry Land. This is a company that you started a few years ago. Tell me more about it. What are some of the projects and things that you&#8217;ve done through Artistry Land?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah. I was already operating as an entrepreneur since maybe 2014. I began freelance writing and I was gaining all of these opportunities to be published in really great sources and publications like Huffington Post and Salon and Ebony and WAC, [inaudible 00:30:21], The Crisis Magazine and The Guardian. I just thought that was a cool thing to do on the side. And then maybe two years ago, I think, it was occurring to me that I could formalize this business. I could formalize this business into something that grows beyond just freelance writing. My father is an entrepreneur. He&#8217;s been an entrepreneur for a long, long time. He actually is a former professional basketball player. He was drafted to the Utah Jazz and then he went to play in Europe for about eight years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah. Then when he came back, he did some sales stuff while he still had entrepreneurial things going on, and then I just grew up with watching him build businesses. So I thought to myself, well, you know what I really like about my dad&#8217;s entrepreneurship, that it allows him to live, to be fully human, to not be tied to someone else&#8217;s schedule, to make his own decisions about where he needs to be, and when particularly as it relates to him living his purpose. So with Artistry Land, I did these brainstorm exercises and I was like, well, what is my business? What does it do? Who does it serve? Before I came to a name, by the time I went through my research, I was like, okay, well, who&#8217;s Janessa? Janessa does love to write, but Janessa is so much more than that. Here I was dancing on Instagram and I was like, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
At this point I had also had a short film. It&#8217;s a 30 second film featured in Time Magazine and Ava DuVernay&#8217;s Optimist issue, [inaudible 00:32:10] Optimist issue video project. I was like, I do love film. I studied cinema and I grew up in theater and I did do some acting classes in college. I was like, here I am, I want to do music. I was like, well, what is this company? So I just formalized it into Artistry Land as I developed my own artistry. I operate a blog at artistryland.space, where I do produce content. It&#8217;s mostly written, something I started doing. But this year, I think in the summer, was just highlighting artists because Artistry Land is really focused on the intersection of art and wellness. I see these things as so intrinsically tied together. I don&#8217;t know a single artist whose mental health or physical or otherwise holistic health isn&#8217;t impacted by their art or their ability to produce their art or the reception of it.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Every artist I know has some health related experience to practicing their art. And for many of us, I&#8217;ll speak for myself, art is healing. I love the idea of artists who are doing well and living well. And that&#8217;s exploring what that means, what it means to do well for yourself and to do good in the world and to live well. What are the practices that you do that cultivate that experience? I&#8217;ve begun interviewing artists who do good in the world and they live well. I ask them questions about what artistic projects are most meaningful to them, what art they practice?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I interviewed a friend of mine who&#8217;s an opera singer. She lives Japan. She&#8217;s a black woman. She&#8217;s an opera singer. It&#8217;s the year 2021 and she lives in Japan. She&#8217;s a rarity by definition. She talks about her time studying Buddhism, particularly while living in Japan. For just discussing how important it is for her to be a black woman, opera singer in this very old, traditional art form, I get to learn a lot. I think it&#8217;s really important that artists continue to learn from each other. There&#8217;s a lot of folks who talk about the need for artists to support each other, which I agree 100%. I just find that it is maybe more motivating if it&#8217;s clear in terms of what we&#8217;re learning from each other. If I&#8217;m learning something, I&#8217;m going to show up. If you just go, &#8220;Hey man, you should support me.&#8221; I&#8217;m going to be like, &#8220;I would like to, but this is like you&#8217;re asking me to hug a porcupine right now. You&#8217;re not being super endearing about this.&#8221; So if you go, Hey, this is what we&#8217;re learning together, then I&#8217;m very motivated to show up.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
That&#8217;s my approach with Artistry Land, is to say, well, I want to learn from you. I hope that people, by reading your interview and being introduced to your art, by following you on Instagram or Twitter, or checking out your website, that they learn from you as well. I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s really important. Something else that I&#8217;ve done with Artistry Land is I&#8217;m developing relationships with clients. I do design work under Artistry Land. Graphic design, brand strategy, brand design work. So I have some business to business clients. One of them is called, Where is My Meeting, which is a digital video production company. I think most recently they ran a press conference for Muriel Bowser in D.C. about COVID and vaccinations. But they also did, I partner with them on this, it&#8217;s like a virtual talent show in February, which feels like a really long time ago. I was like, is that last year? It was definitely [inaudible 00:36:07]. It is called Celebrate Black Voices Talent Show. Where is My Meeting did the video production for, and we gathered all of these black artists to spotlight. So there&#8217;s poetry and there&#8217;s rap.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I shot and edited my own music video and aired it in that talent show, which is really cool. Then I also, I&#8217;ve just been searching for organizations to partner with and invest in. One of them is, oh, you probably know this, it&#8217;s the Queer BiPAP Design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. [inaudible 00:36:47].</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Exactly. I saw what they&#8217;re doing in terms of promoting design, thinking, empowering queer BiPAP people with resources to be designers professionally. And I said, &#8220;Oh, I would love to contribute.&#8221; So I decided to donate after our call that I had with Steve to just learn more about who they&#8217;re serving, how they&#8217;re serving people, what the offerings are. And then another organization that I decided to donate to is one that I used to, it&#8217;s a theater that I used to train at when I was in Chicago, it was called the Chicago Beverly Arts Center.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
When I was in high school at Morgan Park High School, I participated in an off-campus drama program at the Sphere. Because every Thursday, I was done with classes, maybe like, I think halfway through the day. Then I would go to the theater and we&#8217;d be in class all afternoon to the evening. It was me and a small group of students. The staff at the Beverly Arts Center trained us one theater. They took us into the theater onto the stage, which is not the first time I&#8217;d been on stage because I did do stage plays in elementary school. But they go, &#8220;This is downstage. This is upstage. This is what happens behind the curtains.&#8221; And then we went and we started to replays and then they had us write our own play, produce it. Do costume design, then we get to act in it.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It was the most amazing experience ever. I called the Beverly Arts Center a few weeks ago and I said, &#8220;Hey, do you still have this partnership with Morgan Park High School?&#8221; The artistic director at the time said, &#8220;Yeah, I actually need to write a grant for scholarships.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; So I donated some money for that purpose so that students there would have a scholarship to help cover their classes at the Beverly Arts Center, because it now dawns on me that someone did that for me at some point. I didn&#8217;t know. I just was there having fun, but I didn&#8217;t know that someone paid for it. Now something that I&#8217;m exploring with the Beverly Arts Center is as someone who has Asperger&#8217;s and has learned in my adult life in the last maybe year and a half, two years about it.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
When I look back, I see how much growing up in theater camp and drama class really helped me understand social settings, social norms and expectations and experiences. Because when you&#8217;re reading a play, whether it&#8217;s a table reading or you&#8217;re performing, you could be off book, whatever, you have this concept of setting and characters and relationship and subtexts under the dialogue and action. It just broke down things to me that were somewhat confusing. So I thought, Hey, maybe I can talk to the Beverly Arts Center and see if they&#8217;re interested in doing something that focuses on empowering people on the autism spectrum through this particular medium, through theater and acting.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s something we&#8217;re having a conversation about. It&#8217;s something we&#8217;re exploring. I hope that we&#8217;re able to come up with something because I just know the impact of that on my life. People have all these conceptions about, if they&#8217;re aware of autism or Asperger&#8217;s to begin with, then they might have conceptions about the way that it presents itself or what the person looks like. Generally speaking, people seem to think that I don&#8217;t &#8220;look like someone with Asperger&#8217;s,&#8221; which is like, whatever. [crosstalk 00:40:32]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, what does that mean?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know. I cringe, but then I&#8217;m like, I just listen. Thanks for sharing that. Thanks for being open and honest, but I agree. There&#8217;s not a look. And then the second thing they&#8217;ll say is, well, also I can&#8217;t tell. You don&#8217;t seem awkward or whatever. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s interesting. Because, one, I studied communication. I work in that field. So I was like, this is a very intentional set of choices of media. And two, I&#8217;ve spent my life in acting and theater and speech class and all these things that I guess at this point, people, they have no idea. But when I was a child, I remember being sent home a lot because I would go play with friends and then something would happen.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t really know what it is, but they would send me home and be like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, sometimes she&#8217;s not getting along with the children. She won&#8217;t apologize.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What would I be apologizing for?&#8221; I just didn&#8217;t understand. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Are you sorry?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;You&#8217;re supposed to say you&#8217;re sorry.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Why would I say something I don&#8217;t mean?&#8221; It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t have a problem with remorse or regret. I&#8217;m a human. It&#8217;s just that whatever the social norm or expectation that I broke, I didn&#8217;t understand the concept of it. I was like, what is it that you&#8217;re expecting? Because you haven&#8217;t stated it directly to me. And if you haven&#8217;t expressed it verbally to me or in writing, that&#8217;s preferable. If you put it in writing, then I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on. I was like, I just don&#8217;t&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Simple things like&#8230; A friend was mentioning to me the other day, he knew a child on the spectrum and he sat down as a child on the sofa and started talking to him and the kid was just locked gazed on the television and wouldn&#8217;t look my friend in the eye. And I was like, even that, I don&#8217;t get that. If you came over to sit down next to me and I&#8217;m watching television, you&#8217;re now disrupting me. I was like, [inaudible 00:42:38]. I don&#8217;t understand. So anyway, I like Artistry Land because it gets to explore these different aspects of art in the way that it shows up in people&#8217;s lives. It&#8217;s typically connected to someone&#8217;s early childhood experience or some transformative life change that they&#8217;ve made in their adulthood, but people that I talk to feel drawn to it.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I see Artistry Land as a publication by an artists for artists and also this house, this art house of content that I am developing as I grow my business. At some point I want to hire people. I&#8217;m just trying to figure out how to go about that. The whole thing about being a business owner with employees, that seems intimidating, but it&#8217;s really important because I want to employ artists. So I&#8217;m figuring it out along the way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I think LA certainly is going to be a great city for that. To me, I always see it as this destination location for people that are trying to strike out on their own. I think that&#8217;s just part of the, how am I going to say part of the American story of moving out west, manifest destiny, going into parts unknown and that sort of thing? But LA in particular, when it comes to creativity, it&#8217;s one of the few cities people really look to make a name for themselves. They&#8217;ll do that in LA or they&#8217;ll do it in New York. It&#8217;s one of those two places.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I agree, 100% agree. So funny you say that because what led me out here at this point in my life is a series of very mystical metaphysical experiences that drew me to say, I was working in policy in Washington, D.C. at the time, which is if you work in DC, you pretty much work in policy. What else are you going to do there? Yeah, I enjoyed the work in that it&#8217;s so impactful. I worked with an environmentalist organization, human rights organization. I met community leaders and organizers from Guatemala, from Brazil. People were literally fighting for their land rights, for their homes, for their access to food and water. Yet as an artist, I was not being fed. I don&#8217;t know what the bounds are of this podcast, but I&#8217;ll just mention that I did [shrooms 00:44:59].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Okay. It was a very, very interesting experience that led me to being reconnected with these aspects of myself that weren&#8217;t being fed. So art and being an artist is one of those things. I had all of these moments in meditation, where I saw myself living in Los Angeles as an artist and doing so in a way that&#8217;s incredibly meaningful. Because I had built up all of this awareness about politics and the intersection of race, gender class. And these are all things that I was writing about. Yet we were looking at Hollywood at that time like, why is it not getting what&#8217;s going on in the world? Why does Hollywood not understand that some of these pictures are not going to do well or that some of these narratives are no longer acceptable?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Basically, it just came to me that I&#8217;m going to be moving here and I&#8217;ll be someone to contribute something of significance in the area of progress. It all happened very quickly. I found myself quitting my job. I was in a relationship, breaking up with my boyfriend, breaking my lease and just all in two weeks, everything changed. I actually traveled around the country for a bit at that time. I visited LA, where I stayed with my cousin in east LA and I spent time walking around. I visited Vegas and Arizona and I went to concerts and then I spent all my money and I had to go back to Chicago.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I had to go back to Chicago. I actually went to take care of my grandfather because he was in his late age at the time. And then I worked at my father&#8217;s basketball program called In the Paint Basketball. I had to go back to Chicago, not just because I ran out of money, because I had $70,000 in student loan debt at the time. So I needed a lot of money, and that&#8217;s where I rebuilt myself. I spent about eight hours in meditation per day just getting to understand what most fulfills me and allowing my subconscious to open itself up to my super conscious mind so that it became very clear to me about what to do and how to do it. So I went through the process of job seeking. I did some temp work for a little bit and I was interviewing.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Then I landed a job at Greater Good Studio in Logan Square on the north side of Chicago. It was a really amazing experience because when I got there, I was introduced to design thinking. I had been curious about it, heard about it, but when I got there and I learned about design thinking, I learned that there are some elements of it that I had already been using, which helped me find that job, like this idea of developing product features. So sometimes designers will write whatever product is or what it&#8217;s meant to do at the top of a page or they&#8217;ll use a board and use post-its or whatever. And then they&#8217;ll write down its features. Like what does the product do? How it does it feel like physically? What color is it? If it makes sounds, what are the sounds it makes, what do those sounds indicate? Where&#8217;s the product use?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
You have to think about designing this. And it could be a physical product or it could be software, it could be artistic project. But I was stunned because I had already written down on a sheet of, excuse me. I had already written down on a sheet of paper, &#8220;Janessa&#8217;s ideal work environment and Janessa&#8217;s ideal job.&#8221; Then I wrote down all these characteristics, which as a writer, is the word that [inaudible 00:48:55]. Like these are the characteristics that make up this experience. As a designer, you go, these are the features. I wrote down that it has to have sunlight and people were really kind. I wanted something that had an industrial feel and it was open air and I needed it to be near places I could eat at. So when I showed up for my interview at Greater Good Studio, I was like, this open air office with exposed brick had these huge windows and across the street is this vegan place. I was like, &#8220;Oh my God, this is the place. This is so cool.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I got to work with people that were very artistically and creatively inclined, as well as people that are very research driven. I worked on a project where our client was the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. And the name of the project is called Raising Places. It&#8217;s basically a community design project where we went to communities across the United States, those six communities from the west coast to the east coast, and we taught them the process of design. So we had workshops and design sprints and research fronts. We just helped them map their community challenges. Some of the challenges that came up were street lighting and safety, safety for bikers on the streets, like people who are bicycling across the road and they want to feel that there&#8217;s enough space for them, food security.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I spent time on a native American reservation, it&#8217;s Crow Nation, reservation in Montana, and they have one grocery store on the reservation and it didn&#8217;t carry very many fresh foods and vegetables. And there are so many systemic reasons about what created those conditions. We could look at policy, we could look at legislation, we could look at the land grabs from native Americans, colonization overall. These were very, very heavy, serious conversations. Yet there was a lot of fun because the people are, they&#8217;re just families, they&#8217;re just people.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
We got to get to know people and share a bit about ourselves and do as best as we can to empower them through that process. It was a very good experience. It was a lot of traveling, is what I&#8217;ll say. I did 18 trips in six months across the country. Some of those flights were from Jersey to LAX or [inaudible 00:51:35]. And it was like, when I got on the plane, I was eating dinner. When I got off the plane, I was like, should I eat breakfast? Because I don&#8217;t know if my food is digested. It was very confusing. It was just [inaudible 00:51:49], but it was an amazing experience. I hope that there is some lasting impact overall that really improves the conditions that people experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a post that you had up on Artistry Land, where you wrote about using design thinking to help manifest. I&#8217;m curious, how has that practice helped you as a creative? Because I&#8217;m pretty sure our listeners might be able to learn about how they can do that themselves.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting. Some of that gets into the example I gave with Greater Good Studio, where I was as a writer, writing down characteristics. I was like, oh, Janessa really loves politics and photography and writing and she loves traveling. I was just writing down all of these lists of things about myself. I was doing that as a manifestation tool. So I meditate in a space that&#8217;s very open and honest and vulnerable. That might be physically, it could be anywhere. I just mostly sat on the bed or laid on my bed or sat on a yoga mat. But when I closed my eyes and began to breathe very intently, I did so with the intention of being vulnerable and being honest and being true to myself. Because previously living in Washington, D.C., I ended up there because I basically decided not to go to law school.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I&#8217;d spend all this time applying to law school again and got in to Loyola in Chicago, decided not to go and move to DC. Wasn&#8217;t really happy with my life there, and it&#8217;s because I wasn&#8217;t being honest with myself. I didn&#8217;t really want to go to law school either. I wasn&#8217;t being honest with myself. So I had to sit down and go, what do I want? And find this intersection of what do I want with what is very meaningful to contribute to the world? Because the thing about manifestation is sure, people can manifest objects or experiences. However, I believe that the point at least for me, is to do so in a way that is contributing to my purpose. So I&#8217;ve come here with a life assignment. So I would just visualize what is most meaningful to me. I have allowed these visions to pour into me.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Sometimes they&#8217;re very sharp and clear and sometimes it was like a little bit of light in a room full of darkness. And in any case, I&#8217;ll be come out of meditation and then go and write those things down on a sheet of paper. Then as I was job searching or apartment hunting or meeting strangers, I just found that the things that I have written down on a sheet of paper with a pen, it&#8217;s not like, no one can see this, just me, just me in the universe. Those things manifested before me. It just happened. So there&#8217;s a particular frequency that I was operating on that is beyond myself though. I think that&#8217;s really important to say that the intention for me was to move beyond my own ego. Because if it was just ego, it would have been like, I probably would have gone to law school because lawyers make a lot of money. [inaudible 00:55:01].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Pay up those student loans. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah, done. But that would have made me happy. I think the issue with that is that it not making me happy means that my contribution to the world wouldn&#8217;t have been from a place of love. So even as an attorney, I may have thought that I would have been helping people, but how much would I have been helping people if I wasn&#8217;t operating from a place of love and compassion because I wasn&#8217;t being loving and compassionate to myself? So finding some balance between, this makes Janessa happy and this is what Janessa contributes that also makes people happy and is compassionate. So it decreases their suffering. There has to be balance there. So yeah, the design studio, I became more trained in design and I&#8217;ve since worked in Silicon Valley and completed a product design bootcamp in addition to that. Now I use design thinking and manifestation. I don&#8217;t know, they&#8217;re the same thing to me at this point.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
What I do is I&#8217;ll write at the top of a page the year, like 2021, and then I&#8217;ll sketch things that come to me. At one point I sketched a studio, and in the studio there&#8217;s a microphone and a camera and a whole desk set up. Then maybe nine months later, I realized that I was living in a place that I sketched on that book. And I didn&#8217;t even [inaudible 00:56:30]. I didn&#8217;t go out and say, oh, let me match this sketch. It was just, it happened. So I think that when it comes to design thinking, design thinking is about understanding a problem and you apply these phases of design thinking to the process. So there&#8217;s a point where you&#8217;re only focused on the problem. And for me, that was, well, I just blew my life up. I was like, I really need to understand what&#8217;s going on here.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
So I spent months just focusing on that. It doesn&#8217;t have to be months, but you do have to focus on the problem so that you can be clear about what solutions you can develop. My solutions were, it&#8217;s pretty simple, what area of my life do I want to focus on? Personal life, family relationships, intimate relationships, career, home. I can find solutions in these three areas. And those solutions would be, well, what is that balance between Janessa&#8217;s happiness and increasing happiness in the world? Going to work in a design studio is one of those things. Because I knew I&#8217;d learn a lot of things that I could use in other aspects. Moving to Los Angeles, moving to California in general, it&#8217;s very sunny and there&#8217;s a lot of nature and I&#8217;m surrounded by people who also value those things.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Then also, it is important to me to have economic security and to develop wealth because in order to do the things that I see myself doing, where I see myself contributing, I have to have some resources. So for me to say, Hey, I want to donate to the Beverley Arts Center because that place helped make me who I am, I have to have money to do that. I can donate my time too, that&#8217;s a thing. But I was specifically wanted to donate money because that&#8217;s what got me the time to be there in the first place when I was in high school. Well, someone somewhere got a grant or developed a relationship with a funder, and that pulled me to the Beverly Arts Center. So for me, it is really important to look at the intention behind whatever is desired to manifest and to be very clear and honorable in that intention.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Once there&#8217;s clarity about that intention, I use design thinking as a way to align my physical reality with my metaphysical reality. I think sometimes with manifestation, I&#8217;ve learned that someone might be seeking to manifest something and they&#8217;ve created, say a vision board. Maybe they stop there. So they&#8217;ve gone to the metaphysical reality by using intention and finding things that represent these experiences or objects they desire. And in the physical world, they&#8217;ve gathered magazines or cut them out. But then they stopped. Where I think it&#8217;s important to look at is to say, well, how do you continue to align your present physical reality with the metaphysical? And metaphysically, all things exist simultaneously. But the way that we experience them in a physical reality is a bit different. We have this perception of time or limitation. Metaphysically, there are no limitations. Everything is infinite.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah, sure. In infinity somewhere, there might be a version of you that has whatever you put on this vision board and this reality, what are you going to do? What steps are you going to take to actualize that? Now, design thinking can say, let&#8217;s research it. If you want to manifest a trip to Paris, well, let&#8217;s research that. What does it take to get to Paris? I would add, and this is my secret sauce in manifestation and design thinking, is who do I need to be? Who is that version of me that&#8217;s living in Paris? What am I doing there? Who am I meant to meet? Whose life am I meant to contribute to? What lessons do I bring back with me? Those are the things that make it very clear about what I meant to do. If I know that I&#8217;m living in Paris one day and I&#8217;m there as a filmmaker, and I&#8217;m telling the stories of people who otherwise might go unheard, then I know, okay, I need to be someone who is somewhere contributing to a community that needs me. Otherwise, I don&#8217;t become that person.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
So, design thinking can say, okay, let&#8217;s research it and let&#8217;s ask questions about, well, if it could be very basic, what do you need to get to Paris? Passport, all these things. But what types of people visit Paris? What are the choices those people make? What are the problems they&#8217;re looking to solve or the solutions they bring if they&#8217;re business people? What person might be an expert there? How do I become that type of person? What version of myself is that? And it becomes very clear once you&#8217;re doing persona-based work, what the decisions are that someone&#8217;s making, but it&#8217;s important to be clear about the desired outcomes.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
So is it just to live in Paris? Oh yeah, I would love to live in Paris. Is it to cultivate a sense of culture there so that I can translate? Because I do speak French and I want, personally, I&#8217;d like to increase my proficiency so that I could be a translator in a way that&#8217;s very diplomatic and I can particularly communicate amongst French-speaking countries and English-speaking countries across the world. I think it&#8217;s really important to think big and to be specific about what can I do for where I am right now? So if I want to be a translator, a diplomat who translates and deals with issues and builds alliances between French-speaking and English-speaking countries, well, where can I learn more about French-speaking countries? I can research that for my computer. It doesn&#8217;t stop me from doing that. That&#8217;s simple.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s something that I use in a way that at this point it&#8217;s very intertwined. I think I need to find my own name for this approach because design thinking is a very specific thing and manifestation can show up in a lot of different ways. There are folks who do have approaches and particular rituals and ceremonies that they use. A vision board is a great example. It&#8217;s just that it has a title and I don&#8217;t have a title for my process yet. So I&#8217;ll add that to my list of things to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? I know you&#8217;re, it seems like throughout your creative career, you&#8217;ve been on this never ending Odyssey in a way. And now you&#8217;re here in Los Angeles, you&#8217;re about to start off with this new, really this new chapter of your life. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want to accomplish?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I see myself as continuing to lead innovation. I don&#8217;t just mean from a technical standpoint or innovation and business. Innovation and business, of course, innovation in the way that we experience our human lives. That would be leading in Hollywood in the area of diversity, inclusion, equity. I&#8217;m looking at things that would create system change and practices change, particularly when it comes to people on the autism spectrum. But also people generally, that identify to have disabilities, people of color, queer people and women. Because when I was in Silicon Valley, I got to lead, I got to advocate for and develop the existence of employee resource groups at a publicly traded company. And then I became the co-chair of a specific employee resource group or employee belonging group is what they call it there. So I want to apply those learnings to Hollywood and develop ways of working with people to grow our consciousness awareness and to shift our habits and behaviors to reflect our values.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Then simultaneously, I see myself continuing to build relationships more broadly across the business to make it more collaborative and to make it more reflective of a community oriented mindset. That may be the millennial in me, where for me what&#8217;s really important is to collaborate with people and yes, be inclusive. I think that competition is somewhat innate to us as humans, as human beings. There is some sense of an animalistic side where there&#8217;s competition. I don&#8217;t think that we need to over-rotate on that, particularly given the circumstances of climate change or a public health pandemic. I don&#8217;t think that we need to over-rotate on being competitive. I think it&#8217;s a time where it actually behooves us to be more collaborative. That&#8217;s something I see myself approaching through content development, through my choices in who I partner with business-wise, through working with different organizations to see how do we embed those values into the way that we practice our work, whatever that is?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I&#8217;m interested in seeing Hollywood be more dynamic in the stories that we tell and how we tell and what we do with those results. And when I say results, I mean monetary results in this sense. I would like to see that Hollywood is contributing to the communities of the stories that we&#8217;re telling and that we&#8217;re telling stories that are broad enough to represent all communities because people show up. Well, most of theaters are closed or limited, but people show up to the theater to watch stories. They&#8217;re watching those stories either in their own community or in a community that&#8217;s adjacent to them, but someone across the world or across the country might&#8217;ve produced that picture. I would like to see that all of the parties that are participating and contributing to that picture are compensated well. Additionally, that the communities, it&#8217;s not enough basically to have black folks in your movies. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I want to see that these communities who are having their stories told are, one, having those stories told in a way that&#8217;s justified and respectful. And two, that they get to benefit in some way economically from having their stories told. I don&#8217;t know exactly what that looks like, but basically it&#8217;s to say it&#8217;s not enough to commodify someone&#8217;s story and be like, oh, but I told your story. It was like, okay, yeah, you walked away with all of the material benefits of that. I want to see that communities are being reinvested into, and that people have the chance to develop their own content and their own stories. And that the way that the system operates is in a way that&#8217;s more integrated and collaborative. That may be, I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a new idea or a repackaged idea. I&#8217;m not sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
The audience can find out more about me at janessarobinson.com. They can find out more about me also on social media. So on Instagram @JanessaE.Robinson, it&#8217;s here I&#8217;m often hanging out, is on Instagram. And then folks can also find out more about Artistry Land at www.artistryland.space.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Janessa Robinson, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you for really, one, describing where you&#8217;re at right now in embarking on this new journey in your creative career, But also really diving deep into how the sum total of your other experiences, whether it&#8217;s been traveling or working in other industries and such have brought you to where you are right now. I hope that when people listen to this, they take away that they can have these divergent paths that can lead them towards what their goals are, Because it certainly seems like you&#8217;re doing that for yourself. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Thank you for having me, Maurice. Thank you. I love your show. I love the work that you&#8217;re doing and I&#8217;m very excited to be a part of it.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re going international this week to talk with a super talented visual designer &#8212; Elsa Amri. I first learned about Elsa via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM2UQSQStQI" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">an Adobe Live presentation</a>, and I had to reach out and learn more about her and have her share her story and her message with Revision Path!</p>
<p>Elsa talked about how she&#8217;s grown over the past year, including doing work with Adobe, and she spoke about growing up in Tanzania and studying abroad in the United Kingdom and discovering design. We also talked about her time teaching English in Japan, returning to Tanzania, the Tanzanian design scene in Dar es Salaam, and the power of networking over the Internet (and how it has helped boost her design career). I love how Elsa&#8217;s ingenuity, drive, and determination have contributed to her design success!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yes. My name is Elsa Amri. I am a visual designer from Tanzania and currently I work as a junior visual brand identity designer with an agency in Canada, actually. So more of a remote role, but I also do freelance work as a visual designer with clients here in TZ and also a few outside of TZ, so more international clients. I was until recently a student at Humber College, a school in Canada studying user experience design, but I graduated, technically I completed my course. So up until recently, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing education-wise and now primarily I kind of just work as a freelancer and designer with a company in Canada, but that&#8217;s a bit about me and what I&#8217;m doing right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Congratulations on your recent graduation.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious, what&#8217;s been on your mind lately? How are things going in general?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
It&#8217;s definitely been a bit of a switch up. I was doing the course since January. So I kind of got used to the whole schedule of learning for a couple of hours, kind of working on group assignments and now it&#8217;s like I have all this free time. I technically still have work, but it&#8217;s a lot more free time than I was used to for several months. So I think I&#8217;m still in the process of trying to adapt to all this extra time I have and trying to use it more productively, building myself up more as a designer. But it&#8217;s kind of a limbo period for me right now that I guess will go away soon, but that&#8217;s kind of how I&#8217;m feeling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I&#8217;d say maybe aside from you just graduating, how have things changed over the past year? Have you grown and improved in any ways? What&#8217;s been a big change from this year to last year or from last year to this year, I should say?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
I definitely would say that I have grown and improved because at the start of the year, I told myself that I wanted to really push myself in terms of promoting my work and creating more work. So actually creating content that I can promote and just really putting myself out there in ways that I didn&#8217;t do last year. And I&#8217;ve seen kind of the outcome of actually doing that and taking on that challenge.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
So there have been opportunities and roles I&#8217;ve gotten that I would&#8217;ve never thought I&#8217;d get to do at this point in my career, but I have been able to do simply because I was a lot more open and a lot more forward in terms of really reaching out to people, connecting with people and just sharing my content and not being afraid to do that. So I&#8217;d say this year I&#8217;ve been a lot bolder in that sense and I&#8217;ve seen that it&#8217;s paid off in a lot of different ways, which has been pretty awesome. And I&#8217;m just hoping to keep that up and do even more as the year goes on as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That is awesome. One of my favorite sayings is, fortune favors the bold. And you have to shoot those shots. You have to be bold and forward because the worst thing that anybody&#8217;s going to say is no. So you kind of have to, especially if you&#8217;re, I think just starting out as a designer or you&#8217;re starting to get your footing as a freelancer, you have to take those big wild shots in order to even grow and progress. Because no one&#8217;s going to hold your hand and tell you which way to go or anything like that.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Exactly. No, I agree with that. You have to kind of put yourself outside of your comfort zone, which can be scary, but likely you&#8217;re going to benefit from it in some way. You just kind of have to take that first step.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And speaking to those big opportunities and we talked about this before we started the recording. You&#8217;ve been doing some presentations with Adobe over the past few months or so. How did you first get involved with them?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Oh gosh. Let me try to think back. I think Adobe, the main design program I use for interface design for website or app design is Adobe XD and that&#8217;s kind of been my go-to for a while. So I was always using the product and over time, I guess you could say around last year or maybe even end of 2019, I became more involved in the actual community. So on Discord and stuff, they have challenges and they have these different channels that you can participate in. So I started becoming a lot more active within the community and even though they didn&#8217;t help directly, I think it kind of put me on a path towards, like you said, doing the Adobe stuff that I&#8217;ve been able to do this year.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
So around the start of this year, like I mentioned previously, I decided to kind of put my content out there more. And I made a Twitter specifically for my design stuff, which was kind of an interesting decision because I didn&#8217;t think Twitter would be effective at all. I had a personal Twitter but I didn&#8217;t tweet at all. So I didn&#8217;t even have any followers or anything. I kind of just used it to catch up with what other people were saying but somebody recommended to create a design Twitter. And I was like, &#8220;Okay, cool. Let&#8217;s try this out.&#8221; Apparently the design community is pretty awesome, which it is. I ended up discovering, but I would share a lot of my content on Twitter and I would follow all these other accounts, also Adobe accounts as well and particular designers within Adobe that I admired and look up to.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
And in terms of the Adobe Live opportunity, that really came by chance. I can&#8217;t even say that it was directly me. It was more like I posted something cool or what other people thought was cool. And it got a lot of reach and engagement and then somebody tagged one of the senior designers in Adobe. So his name is Howard Pinsky, to check my content out and he did and he liked it. And then that same person recommended that I should be an Adobe Live. And for some reason that was more than enough because Howard asked me if I wanted to be an Adobe Live after that. And I said, &#8220;Yes, I definitely want to be on Adobe Live.&#8221; So that&#8217;s kind of how that happened. So it kind of by chance, but I think it wouldn&#8217;t have happened at all if I didn&#8217;t obviously create a Twitter and put more of my content out there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, it sounds like initially you found a way to kind of get on Adobe&#8217;s radar by doing things that are in the community properties that they manage and things of that nature but then also you had this separate Twitter. So you were really doing a lot of brand marketing with getting your name out there and getting your work out there, which I think that&#8217;s a really smart thing to do. I&#8217;ve worked for some SaaS companies that they try to do community, not in the best way, but it&#8217;s interesting the way that people get on our radar or the way that we know who our fans are or who other people that really like the work, is through the community stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, especially if you&#8217;re using something where all your users are just usernames and they don&#8217;t have profiles or anything like that, it&#8217;s hard to really kind of know, well, who are these people? You just sort of see them as this aggregate set, but if you&#8217;re participating in our support forums, if you&#8217;re on a Discord, like you said, or even Twitter or something like that, that&#8217;s how we ended up finding like, &#8220;oOh, these are the people that really like the work that we do. They&#8217;re tagging us, they&#8217;re talking to us.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I would, for designers that are listening that want to sort of, I would say get in the good graces or get on the radar of companies that they admire, reach out to them through their community efforts and platforms. That&#8217;s really the best way to do it. Not just to complain. A lot of people complain about Adobe, of course, but if you&#8217;re doing work with that platform and you want them to just kind of know about it, that&#8217;s the best and easiest way to kind of get noticed and seen. So that&#8217;s really cool.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yeah. I agree. Because you might be surprised how many brands do appreciate that and we&#8217;ll respond in some way. So there&#8217;s another brand as well called Voiceflow, I don&#8217;t know how many people have heard of, but it&#8217;s kind of a platform where you can implement voice features in whatever product you&#8217;ve designed. And I made something that included their product with one of my class projects and I posted it and I tagged them and they were so, I don&#8217;t know if grateful is the right word, but they responded so positively. They shared what I said. They followed me. They promoted the post that I published. So a lot of brands do respond positively to you tagging them or sharing your content with them, telling people, &#8220;Oh, I made this with this particular program.&#8221; It&#8217;s typically seen in a positive light. So people should always kind of be forward and doing that kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. They really should. And I&#8217;m telling you from the company that&#8217;s worked in those marketing departments, it makes our job so much easier. And we can see the community talking back to us and letting us know because then we don&#8217;t have to try to hunt and find down, well, who are the people that we should focus on and spotlight on? Especially, especially people of color and especially women. It makes all the difference if you&#8217;re reaching out to the company and letting them know about this kind of stuff that you&#8217;re doing because it makes our job easier. And it helps us help you because a lot of these companies are really, especially software companies, and I&#8217;m kind of giving a bit of inside baseball here, but a lot of software companies have zero idea how to approach community, zero.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The most that they will do is put up a Twitter account, maybe a Discord account or Discord about something, that&#8217;s about it. They&#8217;re really depending on people to talk to them because these are generally, and I&#8217;m generalizing here, these are software developers that do not have social skills. I&#8217;m being completely honest here. It is so, so, so beneficial to just reach out to us and let us know what you&#8217;re doing because there&#8217;s a saying, closed mouths don&#8217;t get fed. A lot of these companies that have these community efforts are struggling to find ways to do things better for their users because they want their users to be rabid fans. They want this tool that they&#8217;ve spent hours, weeks, months, years building to take off and be really profitable. And the way that that happens is if they have a community of people behind them that love the tool and the product. So reach out, talk to them. Trust me, they want to hear from you because otherwise they really don&#8217;t have much to go off of. I&#8217;m just being totally honest there.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
I agree completely. We&#8217;ve got [inaudible 00:14:45] inside from you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I see on Instagram, you&#8217;ve been doing this little personal series called, Introverts Talk. Tell me about that?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yeah. And also a good reminder that I need to kind of create a new post to that series that I started it initially because I do describe myself as an introvert. Typically, because I do like my own space and my own me time, which is, I guess, your typical introvert and I thought, &#8220;Oh, okay. So I&#8217;m an introvert and I work in design, which typically is a collaborative kind of environment.&#8221; You&#8217;re working with other people, other designers, sometimes people in different roles, engineers, et cetera. So you do kind of have to know how to work with people in different ways and accommodate yourself to their situation or vice versa. And I thought, &#8220;Okay, this is interesting. I&#8217;m in this industry, I&#8217;m working as a designer, but I&#8217;m also an introvert. So what are some things about both those aspects of my profession or aspects of my personality that would be interesting to talk about?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Because I knew other introverted designers, but I had never really come across content from the perspective of an introvert designer. So I was like, &#8220;Okay, why not share my perspective, my stories, kind of what I&#8217;m experiencing on a day-to-day basis and maybe other people would relate to it in some way.&#8221; So initially that&#8217;s kind of why I started it. It was more of a personal thing. I wanted to take a bit of a break from just typical design stuff and put out more personal content. And a lot of people did resonate with it, which was extremely surprising more than I thought would, but it was reassuring to kind of see that all these people were in somewhat similar situations and related to some of the points that I mentioned. I was like, &#8220;Okay, there are a lot of us and a lot of us kind of have those similar experiences and we should definitely talk about it more.&#8221; I feel like that&#8217;s not talked about enough except occasionally, but it should be a point of discussion a lot more often in the design industry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I agree with that. I mean, one of the interesting things about sort of what this past, gosh, I&#8217;d say two years now has done, even with this pandemic is, it&#8217;s in a lot of ways kind of flattened communication across different parts of the design industry. I know prior to all of this, the people that really were out there that were getting seen and doing stuff were the folks that were always at conferences and doing podcasts and they were outs being visual, not being visual, they were out really in a very big way in the community, you could see who they were. And now that everything has kind of been condensed to online, it&#8217;s made people that maybe aren&#8217;t as social or don&#8217;t want to be a social for whatever reason, have an avenue to also now be seen and talk about their work in a way that maybe prior to this they wouldn&#8217;t have, because it would involve stepping outside of their comfort zone in that way.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you are in Tanzania, which I don&#8217;t know how much of our audience really knows a ton about Tanzania. Is that where you grew up?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yeah. That is where I grew up. I moved right before I started uni. So essentially 99% of my life has been here in TZ and that&#8217;s kind of where I am now as well, but that&#8217;s totally where I grew up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Were you exposed a lot to art and design growing up through your family or anything?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
No. I actually wasn&#8217;t. The only exposure I had to, let&#8217;s say in art, was learning art in school and that kind of art was either music. So growing up, I did play the piano or it was drawing. So the typical painting classes that you would have at school. And that was kind of what I did, but neither of those were stuff that I thought I was great at. I was decent at the piano but it wasn&#8217;t something that I wanted to do full-time or anything like that. And when it came to literal arts or drawing and that kind of thing, I never thought I was that good at it. So growing up, eventually going through high school, I kind of lost interest in both those things.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
When it actually came to the type of design I do today, so graphic design or website design, app design, we didn&#8217;t do that at school at all. So it was never something growing up that I was like, &#8220;Oh yeah, this is interesting. I want to do this.&#8221; But I also think back then it was also just not popular or not a thing yet. Graphic design, maybe to a certain extent, but definitely not user experience or user interface design at all. So my path to actually becoming a designer started way later. So towards the end of university, because I didn&#8217;t really have that exposure to art or a similar kind of art growing up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Well, let&#8217;s talk about university. You went to the University of Leeds and you majored in communication and media studies. What was your time like there?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Leads was awesome. I was there for three years. Yeah, three years and it was such a great experience. Whenever I think back to it. I&#8217;m always like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m definitely glad I went to Leeds.&#8221; Because it&#8217;s interesting, when I applied to go there, I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to do like I&#8217;m assuming most high school graduates. You don&#8217;t really have an idea of what you want to do as a career for the rest of your life. It&#8217;s a lot of pressure to kind of figure that out at such a young age. So when I did apply to Leeds and a couple of other schools, I didn&#8217;t have a solid idea, but I thought, &#8220;Okay, I like media.&#8221; And at the time I liked studying media representations, I thought that was interesting. So I was like, &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s apply for communication media at the university of Leeds.&#8221; And that&#8217;s what I ended up going to do.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
In terms of my actual experience at the university, the course itself was very theoretical. So not what I wanted exactly or what I learned, I didn&#8217;t want to do. I didn&#8217;t want to be writing essays and doing research for the rest of my life, but everything else outside of it was an experience that I think really helped me grow as a person. So the city itself, I fell in love with. I think, Leeds is an awesome city. I guess you could say not super busy if you compare it to places like London, but also not boring. There&#8217;s a ton of stuff to do. So I found that I became a lot more outgoing and a lot more open and social during my time there because it was such a new experience, very different from the city I grew up in. And I was able to kind of do a lot more stuff that I never had the chance to do.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
The university was huge. There were so many, societies is what they were called, I guess maybe in the states you might call them clubs, after school activity type things, that you could engage in and participate in and I did so much. So I felt like during my three years there, I picked up all these new skills and met all these great people and it just helped me grow and develop as a person. So I kind of always looked back on it as, &#8220;Okay, it was an awesome experience.&#8221; Maybe in terms of the course I took, it wasn&#8217;t the best but everything else outside of that was awesome. It kind of helped me grow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And Leads is kind of, I mean, here in the states we call it a college town, but it&#8217;s a town that has several universities. So you always have kind of this vibrant throng of students and culture and everything that comes through, I think every year.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yeah. You would always run into young people or you said students, there were quite a few universities there. So exactly, it always felt vibrant. There was always something going on, something that you could do. So in that sense, it was just such a great city to really kind of branch out in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. And so while you were at Leeds, this is when you kind of first saw and looked at design as something that you wanted to do, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yeah. I guess you could say kind of. So in my final year I took an optional course where, it was called mobile design and it was mostly theory. So studying concepts about mobile design, but we had an optional assignment where you could actually design a mobile product. And I remember I took the option of doing that assignment because I thought it might be interesting to kind of do more of a practical concept piece. That I would say is the first time that I really designed anything at all. And that whole experience was new to me, but also exciting because it was the first time I was doing a school assignment and I wasn&#8217;t bored. I was actually interested in what I was creating. I didn&#8217;t mind spending hours and hours and hours of my time building this product.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
I even remember back then I was using Sketch, I believe, that was the first UI/UX design software that I came across and I downloaded it and I used it to build that app. Looking back on it now it was not a very well-designed app, but at the time I thought, &#8220;Wow, this is amazing. I&#8217;m really good at this.&#8221; But the whole point was it really ignited something in me for the first time and really made me think, &#8220;Oh, okay, this is interesting. I kind of really liked doing this. Maybe I should look into what kind of career might involve this type of work more.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s go a little bit deeper into that. When you describe that feeling, how did it fulfill you? In what ways do you feel like doing that project sort of made design really click for you in your brain?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
I think it was because I enjoyed every single moment of it. So we had a problem that was presented to us and had to come up with a solution. So obviously involving brainstorming and then actually creating that solution. So ideating building a prototype or a design or a sketch, and then having your final product that you then presented. And it was the first time that kind of, I enjoyed each and every single step involved in the whole process. I think with previous things I had done it was more about the final product. Like let&#8217;s just do this, get all this out the way and create something that we can then submit and be done with it, but there wasn&#8217;t any sense of attachment to what I&#8217;ve actually created.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
That was the first time that I did feel attached to what I made and I felt proud of what I&#8217;ve made and it was a feeling that I wanted again. I wanted to be able to create and design products at the time, really. I just wanted to design more apps because I thought the process was fun and also I was proud of what I kind of was able to come up with in the end. So it was that kind of pride. I don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;d describe it. Maybe I&#8217;ve described it well and you kind of understand what I mean, but it was that feeling that I had.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I think Pride is a good way to describe it because sort of as you alluded to earlier, when you&#8217;re in those young ages, let&#8217;s I say, 17, 18, 19, et cetera, and you&#8217;re going off to school, there is this really strong expectation, I would say, particularly among black folks. There&#8217;s a strong expectation to really kind of figure out what it is that you&#8217;re going to do, especially if your family isn&#8217;t really supportive of the arts, that it&#8217;s something that will make money. They want to make sure that you&#8217;re going to be doing something that will provide for you and that you&#8217;re not necessarily just kind of like chasing up a hobby, I would say. I don&#8217;t know, maybe it&#8217;s different in different cultures throughout the diaspora, but I think once you find that thing that you get really excited about it and you feel proud about that&#8217;s a feeling that inevitably you continue chasing because that is what will fuel you and kind of guide you through your career.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yeah. No, I agree completely. Growing up my parents have always been supportive regardless of what I wanted to do. They just kind of wanted me to figure out what I wanted to do because for a long time I didn&#8217;t know. But like you said, there is that pressure that whatever it is that you decide to do, you want it to be something that you can use to support yourself in the future. You don&#8217;t want to be completely reliant on your parents forever. So there is a pressure and that expectation. And at the time when I was building that project for the class assignment and I had that feeling, I wasn&#8217;t even thinking about, &#8220;Oh, I can earn a lot of money from this.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t know how much designers earn from designing products at the time. It was just more of, this is something that I think I love doing and that&#8217;s the first time I felt that way, so why not explore that field?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Yeah. So you finished up at Leeds. What was sort of your early career once you graduated? So you&#8217;ve gotten this feeling like, &#8220;Oh, I designed this mobile project. I love it. I want to keep doing stuff like this.&#8221; What were sort of your first early career experiences after that?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yeah. So I graduated from Leeds and initially it&#8217;s very, not necessarily complicated, but in direct pathway to what I&#8217;m doing right now, but initially I wanted to go for my masters and I wanted to study front-end development, which is a bit different, but at the time I thought, &#8220;Okay, I like design.&#8221; So I like the visual aspect of designing something, but also I had taken a class on coding and I kind of liked that too. So I thought, why not pursue front-end development and see if that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;d want to do, but that didn&#8217;t end up working out.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
So plan B was to find a role in like marketing or PR in Leeds, more of a temporary type position that I do while I figured out everything else, which also didn&#8217;t end up working out. So I went to plan C, which is very left field and that was going to teach English in Japan. So my first job outside of university wasn&#8217;t anything design-related. I was in Japan for a year and it was teaching English, but it was awesome and amazing. And I think that&#8217;s also where I also kind of built my interest in design more on the side, but that&#8217;s kind of what I started out with first.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me about what it was like teaching English in Japan?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
It was amazing. I would definitely say of all the places that I wish I could go back to most Japan is number one and probably will remain number one forever. It was just such a different experience. Before going to Japan, it was on my list of places I wanted to visit. I&#8217;d met a couple of Japanese students while I was at lead, so exchange students, and gotten to know them really well and become good friends. So the whole experience for me was, for one thing, I could reconnect with those people and link up with them again, but also I could explore this country that I&#8217;d been wanting to visit for such a long time. And for me for the entire year that I was there, initially I knew it would be very new and very different from anything else I had before. So putting aside the language barrier, just adapting to a whole different culture, but it wasn&#8217;t as hard as I thought it would be. I wouldn&#8217;t even say it was hard as all.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Right from when I first arrived, I stayed with a friend for a couple of days and then eventually I kind of started orientation for my job and everything, but it felt so smooth and easy. And everyone I had met both internationals on my program but also local people, were just really nice and accommodating. One thing I&#8217;ll always say is that the Japanese people, well, actually it wouldn&#8217;t be right to generalize, but everyone I met while I was there was very accommodating and very polite and very helpful in a way that was so different from anything else I&#8217;d experienced. People would go out of their way to help you in any way possible.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
So it was just so surprising to kind of be met with that politeness and be met with that type of sincerity and people&#8217;s actions and the community that I lived in. So I lived in a small town that was kind of near Kyoto and Osaka and it was a really small town, but community-wise, the people I met there were just so, they brought me into their community in ways that I initially wasn&#8217;t expecting. So I&#8217;m Christian. So I went to church even while I was there and the church community in particular, I guess you could say even adopted me.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
They were just so accommodating and so helpful and so nice and really went out of the way to include me. Because it is easy to feel alone and to feel like you don&#8217;t really have anyone, especially in a small town way out in Japan, super far from Tanzania, but the community in particular was just, they went out of their way to really make you feel like you were at home and you were with people that cared about you. So that was something that I really grew to appreciate during my year there. Just getting to know different people and learn more about them and feel accepted by them. And that&#8217;s something that I miss as well from my time there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Very cool. I&#8217;m curious, what&#8217;s the one thing that you really kind of remember that sticks out aside from the anecdote that you just mentioned, but is there a food or a piece of culture or art or anything that really sticks out to you when you think back to that time?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
I would say, I&#8217;m trying to trace my memories of the very many things that stick out. I would say, I will mention a couple. So for one, just how much you could do, which sounds a bit weird, but where I live now, so TZ or the specific the city I live in, it&#8217;s great. There&#8217;s a lot to do, but in comparison to Japan, obviously not in any way comparable. So living in Japan just really put me in a situation where you can be like, &#8220;Oh, this weekend, I&#8217;m going to go to Kyoto and I&#8217;m going to do X, Y, and Z.&#8221; I remember I went to Kyoto for new years on my own for just a couple of days, exploring different temples and stuff like that to celebrate new year&#8217;s or next week and you can be like, &#8220;Oh, I want to go to Osaka and I want to go to USJ and go on all these rollercoasters.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
So it was such a new experience in terms of being able to do anything and everything whenever you wanted and that really allowed you to have a wealth of experiences in such a short amount of time. So that&#8217;s one thing that I really remember, having the opportunity to have all those different experiences. And the second I would say the food, I loved the Japanese food a lot. I would say my favorite was sushi. That was number one. The first time I had sushi in Japan and it was amazing. And then a couple of others that I really grew to love takoyaki which is, oh I forgot what even it is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Octopus. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
I didn&#8217;t think I would like it at first, but [inaudible 00:32:14] one of my favorites. I absolutely loved it. I mean also Okonomiyaki, was one of my favorite stew. I ate that a lot. So I really grew to like the food as well. I didn&#8217;t pick up any recipes, sadly. I wish I could. I would have been making them here. So the food and also just the opportunity to have different experiences were the two things that stood out for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Very cool. So you finished up teaching English in Japan. Did you then go back to Leeds or did you go back to Tanzania?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
After I was done in Japan, I finished end of 2019 and I actually came back to TZ. So the plan was to go back to school and do my masters. And at the time it was because as much as I liked teaching in Japan, teaching wasn&#8217;t something I wanted to do as a career forever. I always knew that I wanted to go back to design. So I thought the best way of doing that would be to go back to school. At the time, that was kind of my thought process. Go back to school, get another degree, and then you&#8217;ll become a designer and that was kind of my plan coming back home. So that&#8217;s kind of what I immediately worked towards applying for different schools and eventually I went to Humber College.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. And you mentioned just now that you just finished up there. Can you tell me about what you were studying and kind of how the program was?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yeah. It was a short program. So technically a year, more under a year, and I was studying user experience design. So it was a pretty comprehensive course in the sense that we got to learn about UX research methods, which is great, but also practice actual visual design skills and visual design processes. So it was a good combination of both aspects, the UI and the UX part of it. And I would say that the professors we had and the projects that we did, really helped me kind of grow and refine my skills as a designer. So when I came back from Japan, I was applying to school but in the meantime I was also working. So I had these jobs as a graphic designer and as a junior art director at different companies. So even before I started my course, I had design experience from these different jobs that I have, but actually taking the course helped me really develop the research aspect of my skills. So how do you conduct UX research? How do you become an empathetic designer, which is something that people do talk about a lot?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
So it was a really good course in terms of developing those kinds of skills and the great thing is that we also had an internship that we were supposed to do after you were done with your study. So right now I&#8217;m completing my internship. I&#8217;m done with my classes, but I&#8217;m finishing up the actual design internship that I&#8217;m doing and then I&#8217;ll technically be completely done with school. But overall it was a really great course, not that long and I managed to learn a lot. Everyone I studied with, I think helped me learn and grow in some way as well. I worked in some really dope projects, one of which I&#8217;m working to add to my portfolio right now, but yeah, it was overall a really great experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you think your prior experiences, both teaching in Japan as well as studying in the UK, how do you think those things helped you out as you were studying UX at Humber?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
I think they kind of helped me become quick to adapt in terms of working with different people. So our course had a lot of group assignments. Most of our assignments were group assignments. We&#8217;re working on projects with different people. And that was really easy for me because both during my time at Leeds and in Japan to a certain extent, I was working with a lot of different people from a lot of different backgrounds. And I would say for anyone in that kind of environment, you have to be patient and you have to be flexible in a lot of different ways. And I felt like doing this course, it was a lot easier for me because I did have that experience, even in terms of time zone.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
So a lot of the people that I was working with, so the other students on my course, lived in Canada. Canada is seven hours behind my time, I think. So even in terms of adapting to working in the evening or late at night, my time, which was easier for them because that was early in the day for them, was just something I adapted to as well. So I think it just made me a lot flexible in terms of just working with whatever it is that was working with and bringing out each other&#8217;s strengths and just kind of working collaboratively to achieve the same outcome. It just made it a lot easier for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Overall, what appeals to you? What about UX design really appeals to you?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
I think for me it&#8217;s about kind of creating a solution that benefits people in some way, except it&#8217;s more of a tangible solution or a solution driven by technology. So I always had an interest in technology, but when it came to UX, it helped me look at it in a new kind of light. So we&#8217;re not just building products for the sake of building products, like designing a website just because you want to or building an app just because you think, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;ll be fun.&#8221; It&#8217;s about kind of building these products in order to address a problem from an innovative point of view and I thought that was always really cool.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
And after I started my course in Humber, it was more about learning, how is this process driven by looking at users and looking what problems they&#8217;re experiencing from an empathetic point of view and really trying to put yourself in their shoes and understand what it is they need or what it is they expect from this solution, from this product, from this service, and really trying to frame your mindset and frame your thinking as a designer in that kind of way. So I always thought that was really interesting. That&#8217;s kind of the designer I want to be. I want to be someone that can take on these issues, working in a team to address these issues in ways that helps a specific user base in some manner. And that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m also still working towards, but ultimately that kind of became a goal of mine and really is what solidified my interest in UX design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, throughout your both educational as well as professional journey, who are some of the mentors or people that have really helped you out along the way?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, I always say my first mentors are my parents, not from a technical perspective, obviously they&#8217;re not designers, but more from an emotional and supportive perspective. I think I mentioned a bit earlier, they&#8217;ve always been very supportive in terms of whatever I wanted to do. And there have been times when things have not been going well or I felt that this wasn&#8217;t a career path that I would be good at and they&#8217;ve really been the main people kind of holding me up and pushing me forwards. So I always kind of label them as my first mentor, so to speak in terms of life lessons in general.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
In terms of this design industry, I have a few mentors that have really guided me in my path up to where I am now. So the first is a designer based here. Her name is Lillian and she&#8217;s kind of head of design at an agency here called AIM Group. And she was my first official design mentor. She actually ended up becoming my mentor because I applied for a role at her company and I didn&#8217;t get it, but I guess here&#8217;s also another tip, I didn&#8217;t kind of let that be. I reached out a couple of weeks later and I was like, &#8220;I know I didn&#8217;t get the role, but I would kind of love your feedback on my portfolio or on a specific case study and see what I could improve.&#8221; And she was completely for it.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
So that was kind of my first experience getting insightful feedback from someone in the industry. And she kind of became a mentor for me and still is. So she&#8217;s just somebody that I always go to for advice whenever kind of different things in my life happen in terms of my career. So she would be my first mentor and a mentor that I still have, and I&#8217;ve managed to acquire a couple more mentors.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
So there&#8217;s a platform called ADPList that I&#8217;ve recently became an ambassador of and that I use often. And that&#8217;s really made it a lot easier to find mentors in different companies all over the world. So through ADPList I&#8217;ve managed to connect with mentors like Rihanna, who is a designer in the states. And she&#8217;s been helping me a lot in terms of really refining my portfolio and adapting it to improve. And it&#8217;s just kind of been a really great way to talk to people and a lot of different companies and learn more about what they expect from hiring designers and getting their feedback and getting their insights.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
In terms of people that maybe I haven&#8217;t spoken to as much directly so on a one-on-one basis but I still credit as inspiring me when I was younger. One I&#8217;ve already mentioned Howard Pinsky, who is a designer at Adobe. I would always watch his videos and kind of be inspired by his design work. Andrea as well. He used to be Creative Resident at Adobe, was also somebody that inspired me a lot. Others, Brandon, who is, I think, what is this exact role? There&#8217;s so many different roles, but I think he also kind of works in collaboration with Adobe and has his own community. I remember when I joined his community, that kind of really motivated my desire to design, not just from a professional perspective, but also just for fun as well. So those are a couple of people that I&#8217;ve learned from in different ways over time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you said Brandon, do you mean Brandon Gross?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow. I had Brandon on the show a couple of months ago, actually. Look at that, small world.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
He&#8217;s always awesome. Yeah, I know. Joining his community was just so awesome. I&#8217;ve never experienced something like that before, but he&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now people here in the states may not know a lot about Tanzania just as a country. When I think of Tanzania, I know it&#8217;s, and honestly this is mostly coming from my grade school education, from watching, Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? But I know it&#8217;s a country near the equator. I know it&#8217;s between Kenya and Mozambique and the Serengeti is there and Mount Kilimanjaro and you have the island of Zanzibar. If you were to sell or I guess just speak simply about Tanzania, how would you describe it to folks?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
I would say it&#8217;s a place brimming with culture and experiences that are probably unlike anything you&#8217;ve experienced, if you&#8217;ve, for example, if you&#8217;ve lived in the states and had a chance to visit. From a cultural perspective, it&#8217;s really a place where you can really kind of learn a lot of different things in terms of different cultures and different practices and traditions. So I know sometimes people, that&#8217;s kind of one thing that they really look for in visiting new places, learning more about the culture, and there are a lot of ways that you can do that here.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
So obviously there&#8217;s one aspect in terms of the wildlife, which is great. Serengeti, all that stuff that you can definitely do. You can also kind of immerse yourself more in specific local cultures. So something a lot of people do is kind of embrace themselves or other immerse themselves in the Maasai cultures, actually living within these communities for a certain amount of time and just kind of experiencing their different traditions and customs or even if you were kind of just visiting more of the mainline area.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
So for example, the city I live in Dar es Salaam, there are a lot of different ways that you can really kind of just have a different experience from what you&#8217;re used to. Walking along the street, kind of looking at different artistic products that people have created, sculptures, paintings, handsewn objects, all that kind of stuff. And really just getting to learn more about what it is that they&#8217;ve created. Taking the initiative to kind of take those products for yourself as well as mementos. In terms of food as well. Just kind of getting to walk around and experience the culture in some way.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
I think for me, the one thing that I really do like about TZ and that I missed when I was abroad is how chill it is. And I think that&#8217;s something that a lot of people will say that it&#8217;s just a very laid back place. Some might say too laid back at times, but I think sometimes when you compare it to other places that are extremely high paced and stressful, when you come back to Dar es Salaam or come back to TZ, everything slows down a bit. People aren&#8217;t in so much of a rush. There isn&#8217;t that feeling that&#8217;s around you all the time. So that&#8217;s something that I do appreciate a lot that it does feel laid back and it does feel a lot more relaxed. And that&#8217;s something that growing up I became used to and when I&#8217;m away from TZ that I missed a lot. Just a very relaxed, accommodating, welcoming place whenever anyone would like to visit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Before we started recording, I had sort of incorrectly said that, &#8220;Oh, you live in the capital.&#8221; Dar es Salaam is not the capital of Tanzania is-</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
A lot of people think that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; it&#8217;s the largest city though.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yeah. Dodoma is the capita.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Dodoma, okay.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yeah. I live in Dar es Salaam.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is like&#8230; Are there specific elements to Tanzania in design? If you had to sell, I&#8217;m asking you to sell the country, but if you have to sell when you think of Tanzania and design, what jumps out to you?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
I would say maybe the uniqueness to it and that might be something that&#8217;s maybe applicable for a lot of different countries. But when you do purchase a product from here made by people local to here, there&#8217;s a certain uniqueness to the design. So whether it&#8217;s a sculpture or a painting, there&#8217;s this essence to it that feels very Tanzania or feels very, at least for me, it feels very home and so that&#8217;s something that I think stands out for me. It can be something as simple as a small sculpture of a man, but a lot of times tells a story from whatever it is that the sculpture is taking inspiration from.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
And I think that a lot of artists here are able to convey those stories and convey those emotions within whatever it is that they create. So there&#8217;s a lot of homeness to what&#8217;s created here, which I guess maybe is a perspective unique to me or unique to people who are from here that maybe people not from here might not get to experience. But I do think that a lot of the stories and a lot of those emotions and feelings are conveyed in the art that people make.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was doing a little bit of research earlier and I saw there&#8217;s this unique kind of painting style to Tanzania called Tingatinga?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Can you talk about that a little bit, as much as you might know about it?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yeah. We actually have, I think there&#8217;s an arts museum as well, close to where I live, Tingatinga Arts Museum, but that&#8217;s kind of an example of the kind of work that I think people make that does convey a story or convey some kind of idea in a colorful and unique way. And for me, Tingatinga products aren&#8217;t something that I bought a lot growing up just because I feel like when you live someplace you kind of tend to neglect embracing the art of where you live as much as you should in comparison to where you travel elsewhere. But for me Tingatinga has always kind of just been an art style that is unique and that is able to kind of convey those different stories in really dynamic and colorful ways.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are there any Tanzanian designers that you know of that maybe we should know about or we should be on the lookout for aside from you, of course, are there any that you though of?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yeah. There are a couple that I do typically follow and that I do, I guess you can say, quote unquote, admire or their design work inspires me in some way. Most of them are if not product designers, it&#8217;s graphic designers, because that&#8217;s more of the area that I&#8217;m involved in, but a couple that I&#8217;ll name, I guess. There&#8217;s one called Rafael. He is a brand identity designer. He designs a lot of brand identities and logos for clients and he&#8217;s someone whose work that I&#8217;ve seen a lot, even before I actually started working as a designer, I would see his work often and I still find myself being inspired by his work every day. Even though I don&#8217;t typically want to become a brand identity designer, but what I admire is how he&#8217;s able to kind of take what the client is asking for or expecting and really create these unique identities for these clients. So I think his logo work, his identity design work is awesome. He&#8217;s somebody that I found that I learned from a lot.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Another designer is a female designer, her name&#8217;s Edna. She&#8217;s actually an animator, but we connected on LinkedIn. And occasionally I see her work on my feed and I&#8217;m always a big fan of coming across other female designers or female creatives who are from where I&#8217;m from, because it isn&#8217;t something that&#8217;s super popular or that you come across often here, unfortunately hopefully that changes over time. And that&#8217;s an example of somebody whose work that I genuinely do appreciate whenever I come across it. I&#8217;m not super great at animation and motion graphics. So it&#8217;s just always really great to see somebody who is and see some of the great concepts that they&#8217;re able to come up with.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
In terms of another person, I guess I would say Jackson is one. He is a director at a company that I can&#8217;t quite remember the name of, but I&#8217;m inspired by some of the work he recently shared. It&#8217;s more of creative work created for a specific company located here, but I kind of just thought it was a really creative interpretation of the idea they had. So it was kind of this connection between a telecom company here but branding it from the perspective of something ecological or it was more of a sustainable type of project. And I found that the creative products that he was able to create were really unique.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
And as somebody who has worked in that environment before, so junior art director at an agency, I know how hard it is sometimes to really come up with creative executions and concepts that the client actually likes and wants to move forward with. So I kind of just thought that his work was really dope. I mean, it&#8217;s something that I should learn from as well. So those are just a couple of names, but there are definitely a lot of designers out there within the industry with different roles that I&#8217;ve gotten to know a lot this year in particular. So I&#8217;m super grateful to always be learning from them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to any designers that are listening that want to get more into UX design in general?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
I would say a couple of tips. The first one being, I kind of already talked about this, but putting yourself out there. I know in the beginning in particular, you are so much more self-conscious about your work and what you&#8217;re putting out there because you think it&#8217;s not good enough. And we live in a day and age where people are always sharing their work online. We have so many different platforms dedicated for that kind of thing, especially from a creative point of view. There&#8217;s Behance, there&#8217;s Dribbble, there&#8217;s Instagram. There&#8217;s so many different platforms where people are sharing awesome work and it&#8217;s easy to feel intimidated by that and feel like what you&#8217;ve made is not good enough.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
But I&#8217;d always say regardless of what stage you are at in terms of your career or your progress towards becoming a designer, don&#8217;t be afraid to put your work out there and share it and people are more than likely going to provide positive feedback in some way or form. I think there are very few people out there that are going to see something you&#8217;ve made and judge it harshly. People tend to be very accommodating, very welcoming, especially for newer designers. I&#8217;d say Twitter is one of the best platforms for that kind of thing. So first step is to put your work out there.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Second tip would be to always find ways to learn. So my ways of learning was to take a post-grad course in UX design, but you don&#8217;t have to do that. I mean, you can learn a lot of different ways. I think with online platforms these days, there are so many different ways that you can really pick up new skills. So there&#8217;s YouTube, but there&#8217;s Skillshare, there&#8217;s Udemy. There are a lot of different platforms where you can take actual courses that will teach you specific skills or alternatively, you can just learn by involving yourself in different communities. There&#8217;s Design Buddies, there&#8217;s the Adobe creative community, there&#8217;s Brandon&#8217;s community. There&#8217;s so many different design communities out there that you can really become involved in and that&#8217;s a great way of really learning to become a designer, but also building friendships and building relationships with these different people that can help you on your path.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
And then my last tip would be I guess, to kind of find what your motivation is. I think, especially when you are transitioning from a different field, that&#8217;s something that a lot of people have been doing lately, which is awesome, but sometimes it&#8217;s really easy to lose sight of what&#8217;s motivating you to pursue this path as a designer. For me, my motivation was I wanted to build solutions that would help people, especially on a community level. That was kind of the main thing that kept me focused on my goal up until this point. So I think for anyone at the start of their career that&#8217;s something that you need to identify so that when things do get tough and when they do get hard, especially when you are applying for full-time roles, it&#8217;s not easy at all. For most of us, you do need to have that source of motivation that keeps you going regardless and that you can hold onto even during those tough times. But those are kind of three main tips I&#8217;d give to people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say you are obsessed with lately?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Obsessed with Netflix.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
No, not Netflix. I think my obsessions haven&#8217;t changed in the past few years. My main obsession, I think is anime and manga. That&#8217;s kind of, if I&#8217;m not designing, that&#8217;s typically what I&#8217;m consuming in some way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What shows or what titles are you checking out?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
A lot of them, I guess, mainstream ones that most people are. So like My Hero Academia or the slime, one whose title, I can&#8217;t remember. It&#8217;s way too long. Haikyu, the volleyball one. So typically I&#8217;ve been watching anime and reading manga since I was in high school. So quite a few years now. And it&#8217;s just something that I always go back to because there&#8217;s never a shortage of good content, ever. There&#8217;s always some things that will peak your interest in a lot of different genres, really any kind of content. So up until this point, I kind of have kept going with that and that&#8217;s typically what I use for entertainment, I guess you could say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Have you seen Cowboy Bebop?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve seen episode one of Cowboy Bebop.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I was going to ask if you had heard about the live action. I think it&#8217;s a movie or a show that&#8217;s coming to Netflix.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. I have heard of it. Yes. I have heard it looks good, is what I think people are saying.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m interested to see what it is. I&#8217;m always a little wary about live action adaptations of anime because it&#8217;s one thing to convert from animations to alive action but there&#8217;s so many cultural things about animated that are intrinsically Japanese, that when you are converting it to English and English speaking audiences and cultures, it just doesn&#8217;t mesh well for some reason.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m thinking specifically about the Ace Attorney series from CAPCOM. It&#8217;s this lawyer, Phoenix Wright, that&#8217;s what the American title is, but the Japanese title is Naruhod≈ç something, I forget his last name, but anyway, there&#8217;s certain very Japanese things that they try to convert over to American. Like instead of them eating ramen they eat hamburgers and the fan community calls the city that they live in Japan Angeles, because it&#8217;s supposed to be in Tokyo but they&#8217;re actually in Los Angeles in the US or whatever. The Cowboy Bebop, I&#8217;m interested to see what that&#8217;s going to look like in live action. The cast looks great. I wonder how they&#8217;re going to really capture that feeling. I remember reading an interview with John Cho and he was saying that he wasn&#8217;t going to sign on unless Yoko Kanno, who&#8217;s the composer of the theme and much of the music throughout the series. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;If she&#8217;s not on board, I&#8217;m not on board.&#8221; So that gives me hope that it&#8217;s going to be good, but we&#8217;ll see, we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
I see what you mean. Live action adaptations do not have a good rep at all. I don&#8217;t know what the good ones are. A lot of them people typically say suck. The most common example, so I don&#8217;t think Avatar is necessarily anime, but people always trash the live action of Avatar because it&#8217;s awful. So I personally haven&#8217;t seen any live action adaptations yet, but if the Cowboy Bebop one is good, I might just have to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hope so. I think anime fans everywhere wants, I think they want it to be good. I mean, no one wants to go into seeing these things and they hope that it fails because there&#8217;s such a rabid fan base behind it. So they want it to be successful, but what the fans want and what Hollywood gives you are two different things, two entirely different things.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Well, I hope I am working in a company as a full time product designer, just because that&#8217;s something I haven&#8217;t gotten an experience of doing so yet. So I&#8217;ve been working as a freelancer for quite a while now. And although that&#8217;s great and has its merits, there&#8217;s also a lot of value in what you can learn working in a company environment or even working in an agency. So right now I do work with an agency but more of on a part-time basis. So I definitely see myself kind of working as a full-time product designer, hopefully even in a senior role as well.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
I think I have high expectations for myself in terms of kind of how I want to improve and progress career-wise. So I don&#8217;t want to be stuck in the same position I&#8217;m in right now a year down the line. I want to be able to look back and see, &#8220;Oh, okay. I went up this many levels, figurative levels.&#8221; So I kind of see myself, yes working as a product designer, but hopefully in a more senior role too, I want to kind of be at that point, but I also want to be able to look back and really feel like I&#8217;ve made an impact in some way.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
So I talked about this a bit before, but I&#8217;m really interested in kind of how you can create solutions for the communities you belong to. And there are a couple of projects that I have in mind for my own community. Just kind of based on my experience, being back in TZ since 2019 and what I&#8217;ve experienced here so far. And there are a couple of things that I really look at and I feel like we could have a solution for this, but we don&#8217;t yet. Why is that? And how do you approach those problems to create solutions for those problems?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
So I hope several years down the line that I have participated in creating solutions for some of those problems as well on a community level. I think that&#8217;s something that I really strive towards creating as a designer as well. Yes, you are a designer and you have successfully worked on this many global projects, but also what impact have you had on your own community? I think that&#8217;s something important for me too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;m on a lot of platforms. So the main ones that I use Twitter, @elsaaamri, so that&#8217;s a bit confusing. It&#8217;s Elsa and then another A and then Amri, so three A&#8217;s in the middle. I&#8217;m also on Instagram, @elsaedwardamri. I&#8217;m on LinkedIn a lot too. You can find me there. My name is Elsa Amri, so same as always. Am on Behance as well. I always love following other creatives on Behance and checking out the cool work that they do. My username there is also Elsa Edward Amri. So you can find me in all those different platforms. I also have a portfolio website, elsaamri.com that you can check out and all my social media contacts are there as well. So that makes it a lot easier if you want to find me on a different social media platform too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Elsa Amri, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you for really sharing your journey as a designer and how you really kind of came into your own and really were able to use the experiences around you from going to school in the UK, teaching in Japan and really bringing that to your work. I really hope that this interview will help more people not just learn about you and about Tanzanian designers, but also just about the ways that they can put themselves out there and really be seen and be recognized for the work that they do. Because I think what you&#8217;ve done, certainly just from what you&#8217;ve described and from what I&#8217;ve seen has been something that I would love to see more designers do to try and make a name for themselves. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Elsa Amri:</b><br>
No, thank you so much for inviting me. This was super fun. I&#8217;ve never done something like this before. So I was kind of nervous going into it, but it was really fun to just kind of talk about my experiences and for anyone who does listen and if they do learn something from my own experience so far, that&#8217;s awesome and that&#8217;s really all I could ask for, but it&#8217;s been super fun as well.</p>

<p>Our back to school theme continues this week with a conversation with Dr. Christina N. Harrington. I first met Dr. Harrington as a contributor to the first volume of <em><a href="https://recognize.design/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">RECOGNIZE</a></em>, and now she&#8217;s an assistant professor in the <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/christina-harrington" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">HCI Institute</a> at Carnegie Mellon University and the director of their <a href="https://ehilab.cdm.depaul.edu/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Equity and Health Innovations Design Research Lab</a>! Impressive!</p>
<p>After a brief pandemic check-in, Dr. Harrington talked about some of the design research work she&#8217;s doing at Carnegie Mellon, and spoke about how her past teaching experiences helped prepare her for this opportunity. We also talked about  how she got into design via engineering, the utility of design Ph.Ds, and some of her latest obsessions. I&#8217;m glad we have educators like Dr. Harrington who can expand the concepts of design for the next generation!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
All right. I am Christina Harrington. I am a Southern, black, queer creative technologist. I have backgrounds in both engineering and design. I&#8217;m a tinkerer. I&#8217;m a crafter. I&#8217;m an inquisitive, how does this work, inside mechanics, logic type person. Right now I am in the space of higher education academia. I&#8217;m an assistant professor at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And I teach at that intersection of design and HCI, where we think about people and what people need when they engage with technology, why people engage with technology the ways that they do, the ways that technology can better support black and brown folks, folks that may not have the infrastructure to interact with the newest or coolest tech or gadgets or whatever, but that could really benefit from tech being ubiquitous in their everyday lives. I&#8217;m a writer a little bit, in terms of talking about design and figuring out ways to have these conversations about design outside of the walls of academia.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Speaking of writing, you were one of the first people that we published on Revision Path when we did our recognized design anthology back in 2019?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
2019. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Yeah. You scared me with that one. It&#8217;s crazy because going through school, it was almost like you were told you can either be really good at math and science, or you can do the humanity side of things. And I always wanted to write, because I just felt like sometimes expressing ideas is just as equally powerful through text as it is through sketching something.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
When I saw that Revision Path call, I was like, I&#8217;m just going to jump out there and see what happens. And I was super, super, super nervous, which is crazy because I had done like a whole dissertation and conference preceding papers and journal articles, but I was like, I really, really, really want to get into this anthology. And I really want to do writing that has a little bit more of my voice and a little bit less of like academic, technical jargon. Very, I don&#8217;t know, polished speech. It was really, really cool. Thank you for that opportunity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, thank you for submitting it. Unfortunately we had to, I don&#8217;t know if I mentioned this on the show, but I certainly had wrote about it. Unfortunately, I kind of took a hiatus from Recognize this year. The pandemic really did a number on, honestly like the number of people that were submitting, which sort of made sense. I mean, folks were just trying to survive out here. They weren&#8217;t thinking about trying to write stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But then the things that we would get, people just wouldn&#8217;t write to the prompt. They&#8217;d write what they wanted to write. To give you an example, the year that we did the first anthology, and the theme was space, a lot of people wrote about Nipsey Hussle. I&#8217;m not super familiar with Nipsey Hussle. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s like a space theme in his rap or anything, but I was like, why are so many people writing stuff about Nipsey Hussle. This has nothing to do with space. Or maybe it does, I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Is that the year he passed?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that was the year he passed.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I mean, I imagine that might be part of it. I don&#8217;t know anything about Nipsey Hussle either.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. If people are listening and want to clue me in, please do, because I was like, why am I getting all these &#8230; It wasn&#8217;t just that people were writing poems, people were submitting artwork. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No, I just need an essay, I don&#8217;t need something in Photoshop. I don&#8217;t need to see something you painted. Thank you, I guess.&#8221; I plan to bring Recognize back at some point in the future. I just think right now, probably the timing&#8217;s not great for it, but hopefully in the future, with more support, I&#8217;ll try to get it back out there.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
That&#8217;s one of the things about thinking about how we stretch design. Saying that you got so many people that we&#8217;re submitting artwork and Photoshop, and it&#8217;s like, designers are afraid to write sometimes. I&#8217;ve literally heard running jokes, designers, engineers, computer science folks that are like, &#8220;I&#8217;m an engineer or I&#8217;m a computer scientist, I don&#8217;t write.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Wait, wait, wait, how do you communicate what you&#8217;ve done? Or how do you communicate your ideas behind what you&#8217;ve built or what you&#8217;re envisioning?&#8221; There&#8217;s so much space for that, yet folks shy away from it so, so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s certainly something that I was trying to put forth through Recognize, is to have more people just write because it helps you, like you said, formalize your ideas. If you&#8217;re an entrepreneur, it helps with writing better proposals, writing better proofs, just communication in general, it tends to be really helpful. I mean, we even had a writer, actually a couple episodes ago, had our first writer on the show. I think in his background, he called himself a verbal designer, which I thought was really interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He&#8217;s a writer, and we talked all about how writing is, at least nowadays&#8217;s, such a crucial part of the design process. It was good just to have someone who&#8217;s a writer come on and really talk about like, yeah, I&#8217;m a writer and this is how I work within design teams and on design projects and giving feedback to designers about what they could do to either strengthen their writing or improve their writing, or even see the importance of writing in the whole design process.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Yeah. Definitely. Definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, aside from the new appointment, how&#8217;s the year been going? What&#8217;s been on your mind?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
The year has been transformational and also kind of like, you feel like you&#8217;re sludging through mud at the same time. I think the world is like a really crazy place right now. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s like, oh, all of these things are going on, and 2020, 2021 is like this unprecedented time in life. Or if it&#8217;s like, no, the world&#8217;s always kind of been crazy, but as you get older, you have more of a connection to why.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Politics have always been wild in the United States, but for some of us, it&#8217;s not until we get older that you start to really see how like, oh, the ways that we&#8217;re voting are impacting like, I don&#8217;t have healthcare. I can&#8217;t go to the doctor and take care of myself. I can&#8217;t do the things with my body as a person who identifies as a woman in the United States that I want to, because of the state that I live in.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think that all of those things on top of a global health pandemic are happening at the same time. I&#8217;m like, am I becoming an empath in my old age that it just &#8230; I literally have days where I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t today.&#8221; Because everything feels so heavy and it feels pointless to be writing a journal article or to be writing a conference paper. And these are things that I like to do, but there are some day ease lately where I&#8217;m just, I don&#8217;t have the motivation.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve been seeing a lot of memes and all of these articles that are talking about how black women in particular are just like, we are collectively burnt out. And I think it goes to earlier, the question you asked about the things that have happened in the last year in terms of really intensified racial moments. And it&#8217;s like, we dealt with a couple of months of white people coming out of the cracks of the sidewalk, asking us how we&#8217;re doing and apologizing for things. I don&#8217;t even know you. All of that contributes to this like just community exhaustion, I&#8217;m kind of feeling, from a lot of my friends and a lot of folks.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
So on the one hand with this new job and with this new role, it&#8217;s really exciting. It&#8217;s a blessing to be here. My career in terms of academia has shot through the roof to places I don&#8217;t think I ever would&#8217;ve imagined, but I am very tired. I&#8217;m very tired with just holding all of the emotions of what&#8217;s happening in the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I think that&#8217;s been a general sort of feeling that I&#8217;ve gotten from talking with a lot of black creatives, just a lot of black friends of mine. It&#8217;s been like, we&#8217;re just tired. It&#8217;s like a lasagna of fatigue. There&#8217;s tiredness of just like, you being a black person in this country, and then on top of that, whatever other identities you have on top of that, whether you are queer or trans or what have you. Then on top of that, just like this whole pandemic and coronavirus and these variants. And then on top of that, there&#8217;s the government like forcefully pushing people back out into the world like, no more masks mandates, get back out there. Even the whole, and I don&#8217;t mean to get super political, but the insurrection was this year. So much has happened.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Time is so warped right now. Time is so warped right now. There&#8217;s no concept of time because it feels like things are back to back. And it also feels like there&#8217;s so many intertwined struggles that you can&#8217;t parse out something to say, this is what&#8217;s upsetting me, because everything&#8217;s connected.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think that when we think about the moments that we had the uprisings that we had last summer, and it&#8217;s like, you&#8217;re mad about that. You&#8217;re angry about that, because collectively, black lives have been proven over and over again to be disposable in this country. But then at the same time, within those conversations, we have to talk about how black, queer and trans people are treated when they also too are part of those black lives. And what does it mean to have to have those conversations among other black folks who are telling you, we can&#8217;t talk about that right now. Don&#8217;t be divisive right now.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And watch the number of black trans women being killed continue to rise. Watch people not mention the names of the black trans men or the gender non-binary folks who have also been murdered at the hands of the state and police. Watch folks not want to talk about the rates of homelessness and just all of these things. And it&#8217;s like, whew, you can&#8217;t touch on one part of it without feeling that thread and the whole sweater unraveling. So, yeah, it&#8217;s a different type of &#8230; I think I ask my social media once every two weeks, what&#8217;s the word for past exhausted? What happens after you&#8217;re exhausted? What is that called?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I don&#8217;t know. I feel like we&#8217;re all at some point trying to persevere through whatever that state might be called, but it&#8217;s there. Now, we&#8217;ve jumped in like both feet in this discussion. I do want to bring it back to your work and what you&#8217;re doing. You mentioned your assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon at the HCI Institute. Can you talk about what that is and what you&#8217;ll be teaching?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Yeah. So the HCI Institute, it&#8217;s kind of like a dream job for me. It&#8217;s like this collection of, they joke like a collection of almost misfits of people across computer science, human-computer interaction, design, folks that are interested in that intersection of people and technology, technology and environment, people and environment, and anything that has to do with the ways that we interact with the digital world is kind of that area of human-computer interaction.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think what&#8217;s so dope about the HCI Institute at Carnegie Mellon is it&#8217;s one of the few, if not the only spaces designated purely to human-computer interaction degrees. You could study human-computer interaction in schools of computing, sometimes in schools of design within the United States, but to find a space where they&#8217;re like, we know exactly what this is. It&#8217;s kind of thus become like the leading institution for how HCI is thought about. To be at the place where it&#8217;s kind of like, this is &#8230; Some of the work that&#8217;s come out of this institute, this university, is what we&#8217;ve based other research on, is definitely cool for me.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think a little larger than that, being at Carnegie Mellon, where they also have a really high ranked school of design. And folks that work across that so seamlessly, because they do go hand in hand. I think that that&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s really, really, really exciting for me. And a lot of what I&#8217;ll be teaching is everything from foundational courses and introduction to user experience design or human-computer interaction. I like to say that I&#8217;m a methods girl. I love design research methods. Or engaging with students around how they learn about the people that they&#8217;re designing with or for. How they engage people in design and all of that is like design methods.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
You could go your traditional research route of just doing an interview, or you could be doing like card sorting, or role playing, or artifact analysis. Like all of these really cool things that designers have in their tool belt. I will be teaching any one of those things, but also hopefully introducing courses that consider design equity and design justice and thinking about design where design has not been talked about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I first got exposed to HCI, wow, I&#8217;m dating myself. This was 20 years ago. Oh, my God! It was 20 years ago. I was an intern at Marshall Space Flight Center, right outside of Huntsville, Alabama. It&#8217;s normal, Alabama&#8217;s a city. I remember my mentor at the time, he was studying HCI, as it related to like haptic interfaces. And it was so funny because he was like, &#8220;In the future, we&#8217;ll have like a computer that&#8217;s just like the size of a sheet of paper.&#8221; Basically he was talking about a tablet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And this was, my God, this was 2000, 2001, something like that. But talking about like learning how we interact with haptic interfaces. I think it was still very new at the time. I mean, I find that a lot of innovation that tends to happen sometimes through NASA, eventually trickles into consumer stuff. Because that was also where I saw my first 3D printer, was back then, because they print the nose cone of the space shuttle is made out of this substance called Marco. It burns up on reentry when the space shuttles reenter the atmosphere. They print that out every time. They literally like print it out, a big machine, and replace the nose cone every time. And I was like, &#8220;Oh wow!&#8221; I was like, &#8220;So you&#8217;re printing in 3D.&#8221; I mean, that was what? 1920 at the time. It blew my mind, like you&#8217;re printing in 3D.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
It still blows my mind. I didn&#8217;t know that. Definitely learned something. HCI has been around for a while. I mean, definitely since the late nineties, just from like the academic texts that I&#8217;m familiar with. Actually let&#8217;s say, I can think of papers in the mid to late nineties that have talked about human-computer interaction because the minute we started talking about computers, we had to talk about how folks are interacting with computers. And I think initially that was done in like the human factor space. Thinking about work and cognition and like mental load and task load and what it takes for a computer to remember chunks of information and memory and how that is likened to the human brain and then what the person can be expected to be able to do and task and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And then human computer interaction came along. And then somewhere down the road, design kind of like attached itself in a very particular way, because we started talking about, how do we develop the tools that we&#8217;re either building computers with? How do we develop the code? How do we create the housing of the computers? We&#8217;re talking about new phones and we&#8217;re talking about new tablets or iPods. When Apple came along and started doing that so, so, so, so well, and not to say that this was the initiation of it, but it&#8217;s always my go-to example because Apple is just kind of like the Mecca of design for me, when you&#8217;re talking about technology consumer products. Then I really think folks started having conversations about the way things looked in the technology space. And the way things were experienced in the technology space. I think it&#8217;s a cool place to be, in terms of like the work that I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now with HCI, are you focusing on hardware software or both?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Neither.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I am the anti-technologist technologist. I&#8217;m focused on how we think about everyday technologies in people&#8217;s lives. I am not necessarily trying to design the software of the phone and I&#8217;m not necessarily trying to design the casing of the phone, but I&#8217;m trying to think about how the phone can be used as a tool for health information, for folks who might not have access to medical professionals on a consistent basis.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I&#8217;m the researcher that&#8217;s trying to consider, well, in what ways can we embed public displays? How can we get community health information out there for people who don&#8217;t have wifi in the home or computers at home, such that they&#8217;re not behind &#8230; When we think about the pandemic and how out a lot of that information that was coming out from the CDC, I was seeing it on Twitter. I was seeing it on Instagram. You&#8217;re getting alerts. Like the CDC just made this update, here are the places where you can get tested and things like that. How do we get that information to people who aren&#8217;t so heavily reliant on their phone? And do we do that through computers and public libraries? Do we do that through health kiosks that are at the Walgreens or the CVS? That&#8217;s the level at which I&#8217;m thinking about technology?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Actually, that makes a lot more sense too, to think about it in that way. I think it&#8217;s because now, I mean just thinking about haptic interfaces and everything like that, I mean, everything that we utilize with technology, it feels like it&#8217;s through some sort of a touch interface or an audio interface or something like that. Thinking about how it works within the context of our lives and spreading information and stuff like that is really crucial.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good point that you mentioned about with the CDC stuff, because my folks are in rural Alabama. Basically I was passing the information to them on the telephone because they don&#8217;t have an internet connection. They don&#8217;t have a computer, so they&#8217;re not going to get that information in the way that it&#8217;s going out, especially because, one, they&#8217;re in the rural south, but two, broadband is not everywhere in this country. So it&#8217;s not a public utility in that way, like the plain old telephone services.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Yeah. And unfortunately, the reason I focus on digital access and design equity is because is I&#8217;ve been the poem and the quote like, [inaudible 00:24:30] on the moon. Like we&#8217;re trying to get information to our folks in rural areas, but we have communities that are literally shipping off to Mars to escape the realities of what&#8217;s happening down here. And it&#8217;s like, there&#8217;s such gap. There&#8217;s such an imbalance in the ways that technology is utilized between certain communities.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s like at some point we have to say, hey guys, we can&#8217;t keep building new, new, new, new, new, while we have communities that are still like, wait, what&#8217;s a Google Home? What&#8217;s Alexa? Oh, I could use that to track my doctor&#8217;s appointment? Like, what? That gap, that dissonance is something that I feel like I&#8217;m always going to have an area where my work is needed because we have folks that are so focused on creating these technologies for the year 2032, and we are still trying to get some folks caught up to the year 2005.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. A lot of those futurist innovations really just like, they just completely blow by a lot of communities. I mean, even with smart speakers, I think I got my mom a smart speaker, I don&#8217;t know, a while ago, probably back in the early 2010s or whatever, when they first started coming out, and Alexa couldn&#8217;t recognize her. Couldn&#8217;t recognize her accent. So it&#8217;s like, well, that&#8217;s not good. She ended up giving it to me. I don&#8217;t even still have it anymore.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But to that point, like, yeah, you&#8217;ve got these other interfaces and stuff like that. The tech tends to be so focused on the next big innovations when like there&#8217;s still so many issues right now that need solving. And I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because these are not like flashy, sexy news making issues that need to be solved, but it&#8217;s a huge chasm between the work that needs to be done and the work that&#8217;s being done.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
It&#8217;s also why you don&#8217;t have a whole lot of people focusing on it, because it&#8217;s not sexy, innovative work. I get hit with the same question, oh, do you do hardware? Do you do software? Are you in AI? Are you in machine learning? Are you in VR? And it&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m in this space of information because folks are still trying to understand the full features of what your phone can do, to support your everyday living. To jump to, here&#8217;s a headset that can make it seem like you&#8217;re pumping ice cream at McDonald&#8217;s in Kansas. It&#8217;s like, okay, that&#8217;s cool, but we&#8217;ve skipped a whole area for certain folks. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That reminds me of what I saw on, I think it was maybe last week or this week, I think, with Good Morning America Facebook debuting these virtual reality work rooms. And like everybody&#8217;s got on a $300 VR headset to meet in a virtual space to have meetings. I&#8217;m like, this is the most ridiculous shit I have ever seen in my whole life. I mean, it&#8217;s one thing that we can&#8217;t get together because of the pandemic, where like now I have to buy a $300 peripheral just so we can sit in second life and talk about status updates? It&#8217;s ridiculous. You&#8217;re also heading up the Equity and Health Innovations Design Research Lab. Talk to me about what that is and like what some of the projects are that are coming out of the lab.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, the EHI lab is literally just that. I came through both my masters and my PhD in heavy lab cultures. I was involved in the research in ergonomics and design research lab at North Carolina state. And then I worked with the Human Factors and Aging Lab at Georgia Tech. Becoming a faculty, literally the first thing I wanted, and I don&#8217;t know why I was so obsessed, but I was like, &#8220;I need a lab.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I want a lab where I can curate projects, but not just for namesake or ownership of a space, but more so, one of the things I&#8217;ve really been trying to do is kind of like kick open the doors of academic research to the communities that we sit in. So I wanted something where communities know like, okay, if we&#8217;re trying to do something, if we&#8217;re trying to build something, we can come here and collaborate and build and work and voice concerns or discuss some of the things that we&#8217;re trying to do.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Most all of my work is community-based participatory design. What I call CBPD, which stems off of community-based participatory action research that you&#8217;ll find in public health sectors, where it&#8217;s like letting the community define the need, define the project, define the scope of what we&#8217;re doing, which in academia sometimes means flipping on its head, what the project outcomes are. How can we do a design research project and put something in the hands of community before we ever publish a paper or present at a conference or do a poster or whatever? And that means creating zines.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
One of the projects that we&#8217;ve been working on for almost a year now is the creation and the development of a speculative design toolkit for communities to be able to brainstorm without the leadership of a formal design researcher or a professor or academic PI or whatever you want to call it, to say, we want to brainstorm our own solution to this thing that we&#8217;ve been working on, whether it be re-imagining what to do with an abandoned building on a particular block, or we&#8217;re trying to get safety cameras put in at the basketball court, so that parents feel safe. So that with their kids being out there late, or we&#8217;re trying to get broadband access in a particular neighborhood, how can we think about that through a design lens? How can we brainstorm that? How can we iterate on what solutions might look like?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
So we&#8217;ve been developing this toolkit that we&#8217;ve been calling Building Utopia, and we&#8217;ve been working with community design practitioners who do just exactly that type of work. So, Jen Roberts, from the Colored Girls Liberation Lab. An amazing, brilliant end day who works with Black Womxn Flourish Collective, which you may or may not be familiar with. They&#8217;re one of the co-founders of that with Denise Shant√© Brown. And they and Jen have been collaborating with my lab on the development of this toolkit, and we&#8217;ve been testing it and refining it and hoping to launch it maybe sometime this year, early next year.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I told myself that I wanted to do projects that I cared about. So what are the projects that matter to black and brown folks? I think what you mentioned about your mom is actually a really great example because that&#8217;s another one of the big projects I&#8217;ve been doing is looking at health information seeking with voice assistance for black elders. And how do we meet the needs of them being able to ask health-related questions of these devices that right now, for all intents and purposes, don&#8217;t want to understand our voices, our accents, our dialects, the words that we use that may not be formal language. And so that&#8217;s another one of the projects that&#8217;s coming out of my lab at the moment.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And we&#8217;ve been looking at, how do we redefine more ideal conversational assistance? How do we define what the conversational dynamic black elders want to see looks like? And we&#8217;ve been doing that in a very community-based participatory manner. I kind of let the work that I&#8217;m doing lead me, like doing this project, and when you hear enough, people say one thing and it&#8217;s like, okay, here&#8217;s that defines what the next project is. When the toolkit literally came out of us exploring speculative design with folks that are like, yeah, this is all well and good, but what are we doing when the academic researchers are gone? And the students have finished whatever project and studio classes are over, and we&#8217;re still trying to think through some of these things?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s like, oh, well, what if we worked collaboratively with folks to develop a toolkit that is kind of like a resource for folks to do that work without the need of having to engage with universities or industry designers? So, yeah, that&#8217;s kind of what the EHI lab is about. And the things that I&#8217;m open to doing is really just closing that gap that I was mentioning earlier between the ways design has been used in communities of privilege and of fluency. And the ways that design can impact communities that are not defined in that way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
As you&#8217;ve been going through these things with the lab, it&#8217;s interesting that you said that the problems or the things that you all are working on, kind of uncover themselves as you start talking to people, as you start using the things that are coming out of the lab more. It&#8217;s almost, I don&#8217;t know, self-generating in a way. Like you&#8217;re finding new ideas as you get out there and talk with other people. I mean, I think that&#8217;s a good thing. That&#8217;s how labs are. Labs are for experimentation.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now, prior to this, you were teaching at DePaul University in Chicago for a number of years. When you look back at that time, what do you think you learned that really prepared you for what you&#8217;re doing now?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Several things. Definitely I think DePaul, being one of the few formal schools of design that had a PhD, that also was open and starting to define design in this very like social good, social impact way. DePaul, A, I&#8217;d say is known very well for like games design, graphic design. And then you had folks that were also starting to define this sector of like Dr. Sheena Erete&#8217;s lab, the technology for social good and this area of social impact.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think it was a great home for me to start off and define my own research interests and my own research agenda, and how I was going to maneuver through some of these projects in an academic space. And I think Chicago was a really great city to do that because Chicago is kind of like this very, I don&#8217;t want to say social impact, when you&#8217;re talking about things outside of academia. But Chicago has this movement activist, equity driven lens just inherent throughout a lot of the work being done in the city. So I think engaging with outside organizations and then seeing how other faculty were engaging with the city and different organizers and community partners is definitely something that rubbed off on me.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And then I think DePaul as a university, being a place where you really get to harness teaching students. I&#8217;ve been in this research thing since I started my master&#8217;s program. But teaching is very rarely something they teach you how to do. Like how do you effectively develop course objectives and evaluate students in ways that&#8217;s not just throwing a 300 question exam at them? And I think I was able to learn a lot of that at DePaul.</p>

I want to go general, like more into your background, because you have an extensive educational background and everything. Let&#8217;s start from the beginning. You mentioned at the top of the show that you&#8217;re Southern. Where did you grow up?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I am from Fayetteville, North Carolina, born and raised. At some point my parents moved to Richmond, Virginia. And then when my parents split, my mom&#8217;s side of the family and my dad&#8217;s was still back in North Carolina, but we had the closest relationship with my mom&#8217;s side. We literally were in Fayetteville whenever she was not on the clock at work, because that&#8217;s where her support system was. So North Carolina is very ingrained in me, but I did a lot of my schooling during the week in Richmond, Virginia.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Were you exposed to a lot of tech and design growing up?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
What I would consider the tech and design that I know now, no. I went to the math and science center. I was one of those kids in middle school, I went to the math and science center in middle school. I forget how I got into that. I was always a tinkerer, even in like my younger elementary school days. I was always trying to take things apart, put things together, build things from scratch. I remember one year when I had the concept of like what a birthday is and you get people a gift. I tried to build my mom these shoes by taking one of her pair of shoes and tracing it on paper and then foam. And then the stuffing of the foam that comes out of like a packing box.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I&#8217;m trying to build up these layers so I could build her a more comfortable pair of shoes, because she was always working. Because design hadn&#8217;t really reached a lot of high schools and middle schools, it was like, okay, you&#8217;re doing that, so you&#8217;re supposed to be an engineer. There was no concept of like, you&#8217;re supposed to be a designer. I never heard the word design or like designer. I literally was told you&#8217;re good at math and science, you&#8217;re tinkering, go be an engineer.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I remember telling my high school guidance counselor. I was clearly doing well. And I was in gifted honors classes, and this, that, and the third. So I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to go to college. Here&#8217;s where I&#8217;m applying.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;What do you want to do?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;I want to build electronics. I want to create electronics.&#8221; And he was like, &#8220;Oh, go to school for electrical engineering.&#8221; And then my uncle was an electrical engineer that graduated from North Carolina A&#038;T.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I went to college for electrical engineering, and it wasn&#8217;t until I did a summer bridge program at Virginia Tech, that&#8217;s no longer there, but it used to be called Aspire, but it was for incoming black, Latinx. And I believe at that time, even Asian students to take these summer courses at Virginia Tech, the summer before you started your fall semester as a way to promote retention, because minority students had low numbers of finishing in these degrees at institutions like Virginia Tech.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I did this program. And so you then came into the fall semester of your freshman year with this cohort of folks. I became really close with some of the guys, because it was mainly guys. And I think it was like maybe six girls out of like 40 students. But I remember two of my guy friends that did that program with me. They were mechanical engineering students. They were getting a minor in this thing called industrial design. And I was like, &#8220;Boy, one day, I&#8217;m going to go to class with y&#8217;all.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I went to one of their industrial design classes. I think it was Mitzi Vernon teaching design research at Virginia Tech. And I like fell in love with it. I was like, &#8220;What is this thing?&#8221; And I literally left that class and I went into the College of Architecture&#8217;s front desk office, and I was like, &#8220;How do I sign up for this minor? I want to do this too.&#8221; And then I went to my undergraduate advisor and was like, &#8220;Okay, now how can I make my senior thesis integrate industrial design?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I changed my whole senior thesis to like, instead of just electrical engineering project, it became designing a sensor and designing a hardware of the sensor that could detect vehicles that were coming at joggers and bikers at a certain speed for like safety. I&#8217;ve always been about like safety and designing for impairments and things like that. I just fell in love with design, taking this design research class and then taking this sketching classes. I forget the other classes that were needed for the minor.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And as I moved through that minor and then going back to get my master&#8217;s in industrial design, I realized that like, that&#8217;s where I want it to be, because engineering, and this is no slight to the engineers, but I just felt like engineering put me in a cubicle where I didn&#8217;t get to talk to people. And I didn&#8217;t get to understand people the ways that I wanted to. And design was like, okay, you&#8217;re designing the thing. You&#8217;re also thinking about the core guts of the thing, but you&#8217;re also understanding the person that&#8217;s going to be interacting with the thing.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And the period between when I graduated from undergrad and before I started my masters, I worked at Motorola as an RF systems engineer. I was sitting in a cube, eight, nine hours a day, designing radio packages for the government. I never talked to anybody. I never went out. And I hated it. So when I went back to get my master&#8217;s in industrial design, it felt like some clouds are opening up. So I was like, oh, this is where I want to be. And the further I explored that, the better I defined like exactly what design meant to me and also realized how limited a lot of folks are in being exposed to design, because I could have been doing that the whole time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I think an interesting kind of trend that I&#8217;m seeing here that is what you&#8217;re continuing in your work is that you have the idea that in terms of going into your education, you knew that you were good at these things, but you only had a very limited view of what that could look like, which in turn ended up being engineering. I empathize with that too, because like when I went into school, I wanted to do web design. This was in like late 90s, early two 2000s, and I remember my computer science &#8230; Well, no, first of all, I was told, &#8220;Oh, you should go into computer science, to design a website.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And at the time I enrolled in this computer science, computer engineering dual degree program, you do three years at Morehouse. You do two years at Georgia Tech. You get out with a master&#8217;s and a bachelor&#8217;s. And I was telling my advisor, I wanted to design websites, and he just laughed in my face. &#8220;The internet is a fad. This is what you want to do? We don&#8217;t do that here.&#8221; I switched my major and went into math because Morehouse doesn&#8217;t have a design program. I do think about now how different my career might have been if I ended up going into more of that design route.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m bringing this up because what it sounds like for you is that you started out doing this engineering and then as you learn more information and saw these other paths that were open, that then shifted you more towards design. So like it&#8217;s that thing about access and I guess equity in some respect, but just access to knowing that this is an option that you can take.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, definitely. I think hearing your story fuels that point of, how often are young black and brown students being pushed towards these degrees or this area? You don&#8217;t necessarily have to have a degree to be a designer. I think design is like a skillset. Design is also a way of thinking that a lot of people inherently have or what we all inherently have, it&#8217;s just whether or not we express ourselves in that way. I wonder how we are exposing like black and brown kids to exploring that as a potential thing to do to harness your creativity or to make a living or whatever it is you want to do out of life.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s not a lie. I think that there&#8217;s so many reasons why design is an expensive, especially like a master&#8217;s or a PhD in design, it&#8217;s an expensive area because design proper doesn&#8217;t fall under a lot of the NSF and the fellowships that are going to pay your way. Oftentimes people that are going back and getting post-baccalaureate degrees in design are paying out of pocket or loans. That&#8217;s already going to curate a particular type of folk that&#8217;s able to do that, and not feel financial stress.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And then I think now people have more of an understanding and a vocabulary around design. But 10 or 15 years ago, when you say, I want to be a designer and it&#8217;s was like, well, are you going to make any money doing that? And I think black and brown students are oftentimes limited in having that as a constraint when they come out. If they go to school, it&#8217;s like, I got to pick a major that I&#8217;m going to do a job that makes money. We&#8217;re not always afforded the opportunity to say, I want to do this thing regardless of what the return of investment is going to be.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And so all of these things contribute to, we push, in the past at least, our communities have been pushed to do certain things, to study certain things, and design has not been one of them. And so then it becomes this like elite thing that people think I can&#8217;t do design. [inaudible 00:46:38] doesn&#8217;t think in that way. And it&#8217;s like, if you had a problem at home this morning and you no longer have it because you figured something, you created some type of work around, or you Jimmy rigged your door to no longer creak. Or you&#8217;re trying to go in and out of your bedroom to get watermelon in night, like whatever, you&#8217;re doing design.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s reframing how we think about what design is and how people think about what they can do with design. I think we&#8217;re starting to see that more now. You have designed this trickled out throughout so many sectors. You have literal government agencies that are now wanting to hire people talking about design, to address city infrastructure problems. To address urban planning problems. All of these things, there&#8217;s so much value now. And people considering design as a lens to just think through things. It might not even have to be about problems. It can just be about the process of ingenuity and creativity. But I think for my generation at least, that&#8217;s just such a new thing, because when I was coming out of K through 12, people were not talking about [inaudible 00:47:54].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And I&#8217;m going to just put this out here and folks can quote me on that. I attribute a lot of that, I think, new thinking around how folks approached design to the fact that the people that are talking about design, like you look at just the general makeup, has gotten a lot more diverse than it has been in previous years, because you&#8217;ve got more black and brown people, more queer people, et cetera, bringing their perspectives, which are a mix of education and lived experience into what design is, that it&#8217;s helping for a lot of people to expand what the definition of design looks like.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I remember in like the two thousands, I mean, I was out of college. I was like early in my career and everything about design, at least around like web stuff, because it was still pretty early. It was just all about web stuff. What&#8217;s the latest framework. And it wasn&#8217;t about, how are we solving problems? Like UX wasn&#8217;t really a &#8230; I want to say UX wasn&#8217;t a thing. It certainly wasn&#8217;t as prevalent as it is now. People did UX stuff, but it was not as, I think, known or accepted, I want to say, as being like a hardcore frontend person or backend person or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I mean, it&#8217;s amazing the titles that you see, the type of work that you&#8217;re able to do in design that is, in large part, I think there&#8217;s just more diverse people are out there talking about it, sharing their experiences and really showing other people how design is not just something that&#8217;s done like on a computer or with a pen and paper or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
But even to your point, those tools have also helped to break down the barriers to design. One of the reasons I love what people on social media and the ways, I don&#8217;t know if you saw like, it was like a couple of years ago, and someone created a movie poster, like coming soon for Set It Off 2. And it was so real that I got upset, because I was like, no, leave, Set It Off alone. We do not need a Set It Off 2. There&#8217;s nothing you can do with that. I think it had Teyana Taylor on the cover and somebody else, but it was because someone got in Photoshop and was so sick with Photoshop, that they created this thing that looked like it came out of somebody&#8217;s media company. Like it was actually happening.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
We&#8217;ve gotten so sick with our Photoshop and illustrator and just our creative skills because of these digital tools, that you have so many people that you don&#8217;t need the four year degree to be like, I&#8217;m an illustrator. I&#8217;m a designer. I create flyers. I do the promotion for this restaurant. You know what I mean? I help this photographer clean up their prints. There&#8217;s so many different ways to do it now because of digital tools.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And I think that that&#8217;s the dope thing about design, because we&#8217;ve now started to see it literally infiltrate corners where folks never would have thought about doing that type of thing. And again, like I said, that then starts to bleed back into one of designs origins of political propaganda, because now I can literally build a career doing the social media promotion for Elizabeth Warren, or I can literally build a career doing a design for Black Lives Matter direct action.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think now when you&#8217;re seeing organizations and collective designers protests and design justice network and all of these people that are coming to use design as a lens with all of these different mindsets and backgrounds like, oh, I studied social work, but I now lean heavily into design for ways to really communicate my work and to get things out there and to make change. It&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s what design to me is and how it should have been talked about for all of this time.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Design, it&#8217;s not just this insular, oh, I am in design studio for eight hours a day, studying at this university. And I have this portfolio of these very specific pieces, and now I&#8217;m a designer. Design is so many different things, so many different people coming to the table or literally the streets and moving in so many different ways. And I think that all of these things have built for us to get to this moment. I just think that that&#8217;s so, it&#8217;s dope. It&#8217;s dope, where we&#8217;ve been able to get it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, absolutely. And one thing that I have to mention, you shouted out some of your peers earlier, Dr. Dori Tunstall Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel. Raja Schaar is a doctor also, right? I know I&#8217;ve heard her name. I don&#8217;t recall if she&#8217;s a doctor or not.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Raja&#8217;s not a doctor. But Raja is actually one of my academic mentors, because Raja was teaching at Georgia Tech when I was a student there and gave me my first teaching gig. I always have to shout that out. Raja is the first person that let me teach the class, when I was like, please somebody, let me teach. I need to know how to teach for what I want to do. Raja let me do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is it like being a black woman at the top level of design education in this way?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
That&#8217;s an interesting question, because I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever thought about it like that. The design PhD in general in the United States is not widespread. We&#8217;re still trying to figure out what&#8217;s the utility of it. Like why do you need a design PhD? In the United States, you get a master&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the terminal degree you can teach. You can go into industry. You don&#8217;t even need a master&#8217;s to have your own firm or your own consulting, whatever. Well, you can teach in certain design programs.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Having a design PhD is, in my perspective, literally because Lesley-Ann, Dori and myself, we all do a particular level of writing and research and getting grants and things like that, to move in the ways that some of the other sciences do. I think about it less than the framework of like, oh, I&#8217;m one of the few black women that has a PhD in design.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Although I think that if I stopped and thought about it, that is kind of like, oh, that&#8217;s &#8230; Whoa! I&#8217;ve thought myself as another black woman academic. Still few. Still few and far between. Like if you looked at my department right now, it&#8217;s not like, oh, I&#8217;m the only black woman with a PhD in design. I&#8217;m the only black woman in my department. Differentiating myself in that way is not something I oftentimes think about, but I do hope, and I do see, coming on the horizon, if not already here, maybe not myself. It&#8217;s just because I don&#8217;t always put myself in that equation. It&#8217;s kind of like an imposter syndrome thing, but I definitely see where the Doris and the Lesley-Anns are shifting design.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And I think last year was a moment to put that on grand scale, because more people were coming to them, but their work was already at that nexus of like, y&#8217;all, the way Lesley-Ann thinks about design, the way Dori is talking about design, what Dori is doing at OCAD and bringing in all of these black faculty and design. And even Raja, I don&#8217;t think a PhD really matters, because Raja is one of the people that is &#8230; I mean, you want to talk design, to me, the first person I&#8217;m going to mention is Raja Schaar. I think it&#8217;s more so the impact that they&#8217;re going to have in the field of design because of the types of work that they do, not necessarily because they have PhDs, but I guess they&#8217;re probably synonymous or maybe I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, we spoke about this a bit before we started recording and I really want to talk about it more now. Last year, a lot of organizations and companies really stepped out there to talk about how they support black folks across a number of different fields, design included. And we talk about sort of what it looked like to have that influx of interest and support. Do you still see that support now, a year later?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Yeah, like I said, I don&#8217;t, but I also am not particularly looking for it, because I don&#8217;t think anybody was naive to what that moment was. As I mentioned, there were literally foundations that came and were like, we want to put you on an advisory board so that we can start to think about the equity within our products and our projects. They were also, again, throwing out the same names that I mentioned, you, Lesley-Ann and Dori and Raja. I haven&#8217;t heard from them. I couldn&#8217;t tell you what&#8217;s going on with that project.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
It&#8217;s one of those things where it&#8217;s like take from it what you needed to take from it and continue with the work. Don&#8217;t let that be the sole motivation for the work. Don&#8217;t let the die down of that make you feel like the work is any less important or necessary. Because for a lot of us, we&#8217;ve been talking about these things and we&#8217;ve been doing this type of work, way before anybody was slapping our faces on flyers or panels or whatever. And we will be long after folks no longer care we are. And I think that that&#8217;s what energizes me. I think about like a Chris Rudd, who has been talking about anti-racism and design. That&#8217;s the whole reason that he ever started working in design. And how in the moment of what happened last summer, I&#8217;m sure he like other folks, folks became really familiar with who he was and was speaking on panels and this, that, and the third.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
But he&#8217;s been doing that. He&#8217;s been doing that work. He&#8217;s been so invested in the community in the south side of Chicago. That is his whole lens to design is equity and anti-racism and workers&#8217; rights and thinking about design from a lens of, what would a less racist Chicago look like? What would more equitable Bronzeville corridor look like? He&#8217;s been defining those things. I hope that the moment of last year doesn&#8217;t overshadow the fact that folks have been talking about these things.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
A lot of the organizers with designers protests, Brian Lee has been doing this area of design. A lot of folks just came to know him in the moment of what happened summer of 2020, but he&#8217;s been organizing in this way. He&#8217;s been talking about design in this way. To me, I didn&#8217;t really even see the companies as much as I saw my friends and colleagues and people that I knew from afar and looked up to, kind of pushed into people knowing their work as people should.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
The companies and all of the organizations and all that, all that was like kind of noise that I knew would fall off anyway. That was never my focus. It&#8217;s more like, okay, great. Now we have folks knowing the name of Chris Rudd, of Brian Lee, of Dori Tunstall. That&#8217;s kind of what came out of that moment for me. I don&#8217;t even really think about the fact that in 2021, those organizations or whoever, are not still knocking down, at least my door, I don&#8217;t know about other folks. And the folks that I&#8217;m mentioning, they&#8217;re still doing the work. They haven&#8217;t stopped doing the work because whoever is no longer showcasing 31 days of black on their social media page or whatever, they&#8217;re still doing the work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
To piggyback off of your response there, you&#8217;re a hundred percent right. I think what last summer did is that it did help to, I think, amplify a lot of the work that those of us have been out there doing. It sucks though, that that support hasn&#8217;t been continued or sustained. Like you can very much tell it was just like a, in some respects, kind of like a flash in the pan kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ll share the anecdote, I won&#8217;t name the company, but I&#8217;ll share the anecdote that I share with you before we started recording, that there was a certain, very large pharmaceutical company that I spoke at last year. That definitely was like, yeah, we really want to help out and do this, that, and the third and whatever. It had just becomes sort of very clear, because they were asking like, is this going to be like a continued thing? Do you think that there&#8217;ll be more support out there that people know about this?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Ask me next year.&#8221; Because right now, I mean, for those of us, like I said, I have been doing this for a while. We&#8217;ve seen these kind of like spikes of support that come along as it relates to, it could be a societal issue or it could be an industry issue or something like that. And you get that little spike. That&#8217;s great when it happens. If you can sustain that, that&#8217;s even better. But a lot of that support I know of from last year did sort of just like dry up. Or the company got selective amnesia about what they said or what they promised. It&#8217;s been all sorts of stuff. It is what it is. How can the listeners get more involved in the research areas that you&#8217;re a part of?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think a lot of the organizations that I mentioned. I mean, I think that there&#8217;s always going to be like that shameless, you want to do a PhD, come to death row type comment of like, come work with the kid. You could definitely do that. I also know that academia is not the only avenue to do this work. I even push some of my students to be a part of design justice network, be a part of do the check-ins with designers protest.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think that a lot of the collectives that I&#8217;ve come to learn about, when we did the Denise and Designer project, which it started before the pandemic even hit, but we weren&#8217;t able to put things out until I think like late last summer. It kind of overlapped with, we were talking a lot about this area of design and then it was like, oh, the timing just kind of coincided of us starting to put out the zine and the website and highlighting folks on social media.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think following the Denise and Designer project on Instagram and some of the folks that we highlighted, like looking into their work, looking into the collectives that either they lead or that they&#8217;re a part of, or some of the projects they&#8217;re doing on their own, I think that there are so many ways now, as we talked about equity and design justice is becoming more widespread. There&#8217;s so many ways to get involved. I think that people can tap into any one of those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you think you would&#8217;ve done if you hadn&#8217;t went into academia?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Real answer, I wanted to go to culinary school. I wanted to go to culinary school. I wanted to do a bunch of different things when I was a kid. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s like some sagitarious type stuff. But there was the point in time, pre 1998 when I was like, I&#8217;m going to be the first girl in the NBA. And then there was, I want to go to culinary school. Cooking was so sexy to me. I don&#8217;t know why I just thought I wanted to cook. And then I think when I got to undergrad and I was grounded a little bit more, and even then barely, because I remember end of my sophomore year under my freshman year, calling my mom and being like my, &#8220;I hate electrical engineering. I hate it here. I want to get my degree in Africana Studies and be a writer or something.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And my mom being, &#8220;No, you&#8217;re not [inaudible 01:04:08].&#8221; I wanted to do so many things and it was like engineering oddly was my safety net, because I was smart in math and science. It could have been a number of different things. And it still might be a number of different things, because I don&#8217;t believe that we are fixed to what we do in terms of our productivity or making money in this light. I don&#8217;t think we have to be fixed to that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I still might end up opening a smoothie shop and being the old black lesbian in the neighborhood that&#8217;s just making smoothies and minding her business on the porch. That&#8217;s just my character and how I see the world of just wanting to do what feels good and what makes sense in the moment. I think this past year has showed me that I don&#8217;t want to die working myself to death and stressing over a job. So what that looks like in the next 15, 20 years is very up in the air.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Woo! You hit me with like a shot to the heart with that one. Woo! I know exactly what you mean when you say that. Stress will kill you. And if you happen to be black, if you happen to be anything else on top of that, it&#8217;s a lot out here. I don&#8217;t blame you. I think a lot of people are starting to come to their &#8230; I won&#8217;t want to say come to their senses, because that implies some form of like brainwashing. But I think a lot of people are realizing like, to be quite blunt, fuck these jobs.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The work is always going to be there. I think I had to come to terms with that a few years ago myself, when I really saw that I was really overworking myself. The work will always be there. I may not. Someone else can easily sub in for whatever, but like I don&#8217;t want to burn myself out trying to &#8230; You don&#8217;t get a medal for being a workaholic.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Yep. I think last year I was talking to a friend about this. I mean last year literally showed us whose job was essential and whose wasn&#8217;t. And the ways that we need to let go of some of that internal guilt of taking rest, of taking time off, of going on vacation. I know at least like black, queer, trans, non-binary folk in the academia and the academy, we tend to carry that. Like, I got to work harder to get where other people are, and so, no days off. I also have the invisible labor of holding space for all of the students who don&#8217;t see themselves typically on campus and all of these things. And it&#8217;s like, we also tend to statistically die younger because of it, and not last, and still not get tenured.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think the last year has taught me, I&#8217;m going to rest. I am going to take time. I&#8217;m going to take vacations where I&#8217;m not touching my laptop. I think as burnt out as I was starting to feel with academia, one of the beautiful things that I quickly realized coming into CMU, there&#8217;s a faculty by the name of Jessica Hammer in the HCI Institute, who is all about that. Making sure that you&#8217;re working efficiently, such that you can unplug and take care of yourself and have that balance.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And I think that that&#8217;s just the place that I&#8217;m kind of in, because we watched the world go topsy-turvy, and a lot of us didn&#8217;t know how to put down productivity. We didn&#8217;t know how to not be defined by that. It was kind of sad and a little scary, watching folks scramble to do what felt like normal, but what felt like normal was work, at least in the context of the U.S.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Shout out to the Nap Ministry. I first heard about them last year. I think it might have been right around the summer of last year. Shout out to the Nap Ministry, rest is resistance. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Shout out to the Nap Ministry, shout out to Pleasure Activism, shout out to any messaging that is just like, take care of you. We have to be reminded of that. I think Denise is a great example in the way that they&#8217;re operating Black Womxn Flourish is like, hey y&#8217;all, we&#8217;re taking a break in a couple of weeks. And I&#8217;m like, that is like such a symbol, but I&#8217;ve never thought to just be like, no, it&#8217;s not a holiday, but I&#8217;m just going to go to the lake for a couple of days and not answer my email, and y&#8217;all will be okay. We know the jobs that are essential now. We know what we need to literally survive as a society. More than likely my journal article isn&#8217;t part of that, so I can take a break. I can take a nap.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I love it. I love it. What are you obsessed with at the moment?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
So many things from Real Housewives of Potomac, do not shame me, but I love them. I&#8217;m obsessed with that. I am upset with, in terms of design, like this concept of futuring and speculative design, but through a lens of Afrofuturism. I&#8217;m obsessed with the concept of like, there are black people in the future. I think it&#8217;s become ingrained in everything I see and everything I do, from like TV shows. I like a lot of like sci-fi and those psychological thrillers or like those, the world has ended as we know it and now it&#8217;s 2442 and here&#8217;s what civilization looks like. You watch those shows and you&#8217;re like, wait, so in 2442 there&#8217;s no black people? In the casting call, you don&#8217;t even think to put one mixed girl, nothing?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s like that concept of like us, the longevity and what our futures looks like has become something that I&#8217;m super obsessed with. I&#8217;m obsessed with art, of course. I think that that&#8217;s what attracted me to design because I was introduced to design as like this mesh of engineering and visual art. So the visual art is always going to be something that like aesthetically &#8230; Like I love collecting art in my home. I love going to museums and learning the history of, especially like political art, what people were trying to say through their art. I&#8217;m obsessed with my travel bucket list. That is part of my selfish Americanism of like, when am I going to be able to just roam the world again and feel safe? Safe to the extent of being like black masculine presenting queer woman on this earth, as safe as we feel anyway.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I will admit this, but if you see me in person, I&#8217;m not going to want to engage in it in person. I&#8217;m not a LeBron hater, but I follow his career. So I&#8217;m slightly obsessed with how long is this man going to play in the NBA? It&#8217;s not even like a Vince Carter. Like where Vince was like, he&#8217;s old. He might go in for like five minutes and do a dunk and then you can see him kind of limping off the court and he&#8217;s done. LeBron is still playing as like the centerpiece of the team, going into what? 35, 36. So I&#8217;m kind of obsessed with like what that moment is going to be when he &#8230; Is that going to come? I mean, he&#8217;s conditioned his body so well, and I think he&#8217;s obsessed with proving to people that he can still do it. As an avid basketball fan, I&#8217;m kind of obsessed with seeing how long he goes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think I&#8217;ll still be doing similar work. I mean, I have great interest in doing more like civic technology fellowships, where I&#8217;m taking a year and focusing on a project that sits outside of the academic institution, like the walls of the academic institution or consulting with folks that are thinking about larger scale problems. I think that that&#8217;s the next direction that I feel like I want to go in at some point. I don&#8217;t know what capacity that&#8217;s going to look like. Because like I said, I tend to let the work lead me, but I would love to do some type of fellowship that was focused on like a larger scale problem that was dealing with digital access or design equity somewhere.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
So my personal website, christinaharrington.me, although it&#8217;s not, I mean, that flashy, it&#8217;s somewhat updated of like my travel and where I&#8217;m speaking, my research project, the papers that I&#8217;ve published and things like that. You can always follow me on Twitter @adapperprof. I&#8217;m always ranting about academia, design, The Real Housewives of Potomac, rest, productivity. I have pages on LinkedIn and stuff like that. I don&#8217;t use them as much, but I&#8217;d say that those are the two places.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Christina Harrington, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I know when we first met, actually it was a few years ago, we met at black and design, which they are having again this year. So I think by the time this episode comes out, people will start hearing some of the advertisements around the events. That&#8217;ll be happening in October, again, virtually this year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It was just so good to talk with you and to learn about the work that you&#8217;re doing around design equity, your new role at Carnegie Mellon. I just feel like we&#8217;re going to hear so much more from you in these coming years about the work that you&#8217;re doing, because it&#8217;s really super important. I think now that so much of our world has been driven online because of the pandemic in terms of interactions and just general socialization that a lot of the work you&#8217;re doing around design equity and stuff like that is going to be super important. Thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Thank you so much for having me. This is really exciting.</p>
