Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
My name is Brent Rollins, and the short answer is that I&#8217;m a multi disciplinary designer, the long answer would be that I&#8217;m a creative who collaborates with people, organizations that are passionate and sort of driven in their mission to kind of spread their ideas and positivity to the world and to sort of create guiding paths for people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How is 2021 been for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
You know what, man? 2021, I&#8217;m ready to go. 2020 was actually the year that I was like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s do this. Weird. I&#8217;m ready to make some stuff happen.&#8221; Well, we know how that sort of ended up. So I think it&#8217;s been&#8230; I think a lot of people, including myself have been kind of bubbling and if you&#8217;re driven and if you have ideas and you&#8217;re creative, you&#8217;ve been using this sort of sabbatical or this time or this kind of slower period to think about things and formulate things and come up with ideas and plan. Like the people that have passed unfortunately, I know a few people that have been affected by the virus and stuff. So my heart goes out to them, but for those of us who are alive, this is a moment for us to be alive and to embrace that, and to really like&#8230; This is a blessing in that sense, if we haven&#8217;t been devastatingly affected. This has been a blessing to have this moment, to think about what we want to do and what we want to accomplish into what&#8217;s a forced introspection.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And I hope rather that people kind of use it to better themselves. So, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m about, man, I can&#8217;t wait for this year, unlike I&#8217;m ready to go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I have talked to a lot of people that are saying that this is going to be like the new roaring 20s in a way?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Oh, man. Is it ever? This is going to be yo, roaring 20s, baby boom, it&#8217;s going to be crazy. I think, come June, July, this is going to be wild, bro.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, No. And I think even now, there&#8217;s this sort of like, I can feel this renewed energy in the air, especially as people are starting to get the vaccine. And even as some places are starting to relax restrictions, things are starting to open up again. So, people are anxious to get back out there and experience the world, whatever that may look like.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah. Some people unfortunately continue to experience the world and they didn&#8217;t really care, no shots, no judgment. But for the rest of us hopefully like I said, we&#8217;re sensible enough to kind of use it to our advantage and kind of make plans and sort of think about things. And it&#8217;s really funny because at the top of 2020, I distinctly remember thinking, I can&#8217;t tell you where it was, but I can distinctly remember thinking. I was like, &#8220;Man, the world is moving really fast. This thing needs to slow down.&#8221; It was like I felt just how much stuff was going on. Because I live in New York City, and I see construction going on everywhere. And I see all this stuff happening. And it just felt like things were kind of out of control. And so it was&#8230; Like I said, it&#8217;s been a weird, mixed, I guess, [inaudible 00:07:08] and kind of blessing that this thing sort of forced everyone to slow down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What does a typical day look like for you now?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny, because I was never a very structured person, and I&#8217;ve become a little bit more regimented. And I actually really enjoy it. Or I feel like I need that. So, typical day for me right now is I&#8217;m in this kind of like new cycle. So, I&#8217;m actually implementing kind of new sort of regimens that I didn&#8217;t really do. So, I don&#8217;t know how typical it is. It&#8217;s only like maybe four months old. It seems like this has been Rollins&#8217;s day. But I typically go to sleep late, just because I&#8217;m a night owl. And I don&#8217;t get much sleep. So, I sort of wake up maybe about five or six hours later. And kind of like I want to read and sort of see what&#8217;s going on in the world and fix myself a little pot of coffee, and maybe take a little walk, get some air, get out the house, kind of just sort of take in what the environment has to offer, and start working on one of the multiple sort of projects that I got going on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And what are some of those projects? I mean, as much of them as you can sort of talk about at liberty.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s really funny like&#8230; Because I was thinking about before this interview, I was like, &#8220;Man, you know what? I can&#8217;t really talk about the things that I&#8217;m working on right now.&#8221; Not because they&#8217;re secret, but I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of myself. A few of the things that are maybe like projects for people, again, like people that are doing sort of very interesting, sort of passion projects, or things that have sort of a larger good, I think that&#8217;s the kind of stuff that I can maybe talk about, as far as there&#8217;s this brother Waajeed, who is a DJ based in Detroit, who is pretty well known. And Detroit as you know, has amazing music history. And so, Waajeed has got this fantastic opportunity to open. I don&#8217;t want to call it a school, but he is spearheading this project to create a&#8230; I think it&#8217;s called underground music academy. It&#8217;s sort of a place for people to sort of engage in musical creativity. And it&#8217;s on this Boulevard in Detroit, that has a lot of insane Detroit musical history. So, I&#8217;m working on the identity for that. And I&#8217;m very excited about that.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Some of the other projects that I&#8217;m working on, are really entrepreneurial projects that have been in the works for the past year. One of them, I had to put the brakes on because of COVID, but is still moving and I&#8217;m super excited about it. And I really can&#8217;t wait to sort of show the world what that&#8217;s about. But the short story is that it&#8217;ll be a sort of a restaurant or cafe or something. And then the other project, there&#8217;s another entrepreneurial project that I kind of don&#8217;t want to talk about. But I&#8217;m also very excited about. Other than that, yeah, everything else is really working on stuff for people for short films and some album covers and things that&#8230; Or people that I&#8217;ve creative history with, people that really want to kind of put something out into the world that&#8217;s a little bit different. I&#8217;m at the point in my sort of life or career, or however you want to talk about it, or however you want to think about it, where I just want to be a little bit selective, and I&#8217;m okay.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I need to figure out&#8230; Everything has to&#8230; You have to make a living. But I can be a little bit selective about things because I don&#8217;t want to depend on those projects for the things to make a living, I&#8217;d rather have the entrepreneurial things be the things that I use to make a living.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And that way, I have more control over the creativity, because it&#8217;s my projects. And then if I&#8217;m working with anybody, it&#8217;s going to be because I really believe in what they&#8217;re doing. There are people that have hit me up via social media. Man, people are like, &#8220;Yo, I&#8217;m doing this, would you do an album cover for me?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Number one, you don&#8217;t talk to people like that.&#8221; You know what I mean? I also am like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not getting your hustle, but I&#8217;m also&#8230; I want to lend myself to projects that I feel that I understand and I feel have some sort of worth and value, and prove it to me.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting how Twitter&#8230; And I guess you could say social media as a whole. But it&#8217;s amazing how Twitter has kind of almost flattened the&#8230; Like it&#8217;s flattened the hustle in a way. People will talk to you on Twitter in any kind of way. They don&#8217;t know who you are, and to that respect, I guess it&#8217;s that way with social media in general, they&#8217;ll just approach you on like some, &#8220;Hey, can you do this for me?&#8221; I get so many people that will&#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t even say that they write to the show, they tell the show, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why you haven&#8217;t interviewed me yet.&#8221; Who are you? Person with no website and I can&#8217;t tell what kind of work that you do and you have 100 followers?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting how social media kind of flattens out in a way. People just don&#8217;t approach you with the same kind of not necessarily gravitas, but just the same sort of urgency. It&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Hey, do this for me.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, I mean, people don&#8217;t&#8230; I can get into my old man, I&#8217;m going to put my old man pants on right now. It&#8217;s a little bit of number one, you should just learn if you&#8217;re going to&#8230; Like I said, if you&#8217;re going to approach people, show some respect, if you really like their work, at least be like, &#8220;Hey, I really like your work, this is what I&#8217;m trying to do,&#8221; and come with some humility and be like, &#8220;I&#8217;m doing this thing, would you be interested in it?&#8221; Yes, no, if not, I understand. I don&#8217;t really appreciate this sort of informality. I think social media enables people to be in contact, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
But it doesn&#8217;t mean that you should abandon sort of what has been traditional decorum and sort of like, just respect in terms of like how you approach people. I wouldn&#8217;t talk to any of these kind of design heroes that I have, as though they were my peers, they&#8217;re not my peers. Those are people that I look up to, and they&#8217;re deserving of that respect. And you&#8217;re right, yeah, as far as flattening, I think most of the people or a large amount of people that are using social media, it is flat, because they&#8217;re all peers. So, they can sort of approach people like that, but then there are other people that are within that space that are old like myself, that are like, &#8220;No, man, this is not how you run up on folks.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t run up on people like that. I was very-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Respectful?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah, respectful. But whenever I&#8217;d meet people that were in a particular state, I would just approach them [inaudible 00:13:57]. You know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I think that that&#8217;s&#8230; Not that I&#8217;m suggesting, &#8220;Yo, I&#8217;m better than you,&#8221; but I&#8217;m just kind of like, &#8220;Come on, man, I&#8217;m a grown man. Don&#8217;t talk to me like that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. And also, it&#8217;s clearly when someone&#8217;s approaching in that way, it&#8217;s one way transactional. Like, &#8220;What can I get?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8220;Can you do something for me?&#8221; Not like, &#8220;How do we help each other out in that kind of way?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. But you know what? I mean, if you&#8217;ve been doing anything for a moment, and you&#8217;re worth, you&#8217;re like us all, you can filter out who&#8217;s real and who&#8217;s not.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And even the people that are not, maybe they haven&#8217;t found their tribe yet, but you can tell that, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re looking.&#8221; If you can identify the people that are like the junior use.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, no, I get it. Yeah, this person, they&#8217;re definitely on that vibe. And you know what? I&#8217;m going to put you under my wing because I can see that in you, and come along for the ride homie.&#8221; So, yeah. Oh, man, people hacked up on social media.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, you&#8217;ve mentioned all these different kind of projects. First of all, I have to say I love the way you kind of just slowly was like, &#8220;Yeah, this is DJ in Detroit Waajeed.&#8221; You&#8217;re not talking about what Waajeed from slum village.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
No, no, no. Not at all.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Just like, &#8220;Yeah, this guy, he&#8217;s starting a school.&#8221; Doing the thing like, okay, all right. But when it comes to all these different projects that you do, what does your creative process look like when you&#8217;re starting a project?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
That is depending on the project, but I think that&#8230; I do a little research depending on what it is, one of the things that I try to tap into where&#8230; It&#8217;s really funny, because I have a great appreciation for sort of like, very learned kind of design approaches. But I think I&#8217;m really like a designer that came from an art background, I think, or more so just the act of creativity itself. And so I approach things in a way that&#8217;s more about emotion. And oftentimes, what is the feeling that I got when I encountered X? And so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to tap into in terms of like that sort of intuitive sort of feeling. I&#8217;m sure there have been moments in your life where there&#8217;s been some baby&#8230; I&#8217;m going to just use music, because it&#8217;s such a common denominator. When you&#8230; There was like maybe a club that you were just like, &#8220;Oh, man, that club was just&#8230; That was it. Because the DJ, the music was just right, and the vibe was right and the crowd, and the this and the that, and the&#8230;&#8221; All those kind of things.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a feeling. And if it&#8217;s done right, there&#8217;s a visual component to it as well. And so what I look towards is tapping into that visual trigger. That&#8217;s the thing because that&#8217;s my language. So, that&#8217;s the thing that whenever I was in any of these kind of environments, that&#8217;s what I latched on to, as my sort of like, this is my flotation device, this is what&#8217;s going to keep me up in this space. And I&#8217;m going to use this design thing or this visual thing and I&#8217;m going to sit back on my floaty and chill, while I&#8217;m observing the rest of the stuff that&#8217;s going on. That&#8217;s kind of like how I go. The creative process is about tapping into that vibe, that thing, that emotion that people get that is very subconscious. If you&#8217;ve been to the Caribbean, or certain countries, I don&#8217;t want to say third world countries, but just developing countries or something. There&#8217;s like the smell of like gasoline and burning jungle foilage. I was exposed to it as a young age.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And then as an adult, I go back to those places and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, whoa!&#8221; It&#8217;s like automatically, it&#8217;s something that I totally forgot about, like, boom, it just triggered me. And I was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m back here. I&#8217;m ready to roll.&#8221; So, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to try to reach for, is to think about those kinds of things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So yeah, you try to tap into a certain&#8230; You said like a visual trigger or a vibe, or a feeling and then you kind of build out from their sounds like?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, it&#8217;s really funny man, the emotions and the memories. Like I said, people don&#8217;t necessarily&#8230; Sometimes people don&#8217;t remember them. But when they see them, they get excited. Like, I love remembering things that I&#8217;ve totally forgot. Sometimes there&#8217;s a thing that maybe happened to me as a child, or that maybe I went to, and someone else will bring it up and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, whoa! Oh, man, I totally remember.&#8221; I love that. That&#8217;s like the best feeling ever, because you&#8217;re taken back to something that you had kind of pushed in the&#8230; It&#8217;s like in the back of the storage room. It&#8217;s like if you have stuff in storage, and you kind of go through things, and you rediscover them. Like recently, I was going through my parent&#8217;s garage sort of cleaning things out. And kind of came across two boxes of old comics that I had left behind when I left Los Angeles from New York. And I hadn&#8217;t thought about those comic books in 20 plus years, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
It&#8217;s not that I&#8230; I knew that I had comics, but I had got to the point where I just sort of disassociated and attached myself to those as possessions. Comic books are really important to me, the stories and the illustrations were&#8230; Some of the artists were very significant to me, and rediscovering those comic books in the back of my dad&#8217;s garage, and kind of going through it, man, I got a little teary eyed because I was like, &#8220;Oh man, a few comics.&#8221; I was just like, &#8220;Oh, man.&#8221; Because I decided to sell them because I haven&#8217;t looked at these things in so long. What&#8217;s the point of keeping these things? I just sort of resolved to sell them. I was going through some of the comments, I was like, &#8220;Man, do I really get rid of this? Oh, this is so awesome.&#8221; And it was like, yeah, I reconnected with something that I completely forgot about.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
So yeah, when I do&#8230; So, take it full circle. So, when I do design, there&#8217;s a tinge of nostalgia I guess, in some of the things because I think that&#8217;s what people are relating to, in some cases. And then other cases it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, I want to do something completely new.&#8221; And how do you do that? Even when you make something new, it&#8217;s rooted in something because if you do something that&#8217;s too new, you lose people. So, you want to put a little bit of something familiar in it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting you mentioned that sort of tinge of nostalgia, because I feel like there&#8217;s&#8230; We&#8217;ll get into the work that you&#8217;ve done with Ego Trip and Rap Pages, et cetera. But there&#8217;s a very temporal quality to your work that is kind of evocative of the 60s and the 70s in different ways. I think one, there&#8217;s this sort of like collage, mixed media kind of thing that I see you do sometimes. But then there&#8217;s also&#8230; And maybe I&#8217;m thinking of the more visual stuff that I see on television, but it&#8217;s also like a nod back to projectors. And there&#8217;s an audio element of a film reel, or noise grain that you see on film and stuff like that. And then just even the playful way that you use typography, it&#8217;s almost like you see those old school horror movie title cards or something. I get what you mean about that kind of tinge of nostalgia. But I think that&#8217;s a pretty big theme in your work though.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah. The thing about using that as a device, it&#8217;s funny, because I don&#8217;t know what&#8230; I really want to talk to some younger designers now and kind of get where their head is at, because when I would resort to those options, it&#8217;s because that&#8217;s what I know is familiar to people. And the idea of design, in my world design meaning kind of visual communications, graphics, that type of design. It&#8217;s really about I want to communicate with you. What&#8217;s our shared language? What are our shared memories? What is our shared sort of commonalities? And when I pull from those kinds of things, this is very conscious. Those are things that I want to trigger you. I want you to be like, &#8220;Oh, I get it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I think there&#8217;s the idea of design as ornament and sort of fireworks, where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yo, I&#8217;m doing something new and this is [inaudible 00:22:39].&#8221; And you&#8217;re going to get about five people that understand what you&#8217;re doing, which is cool. I&#8217;m not against that. I love that kind of stuff. But the idea of design, my foundation, or my understanding of design is rooted in the old idea of what a graphic artist was, which was communication design. Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
So the idea of, I&#8217;m trying to reach you, I&#8217;m trying to talk with you. And for me, the shortcut is shared experiences. For me, the shortcut is what I&#8217;d surmise as being the things that we grew up with. And that&#8217;s how we begin to talk to each other. That&#8217;s kind of where I&#8217;m coming from. When I was doing that kind of stuff, it was based off of&#8230; It&#8217;s not the nostalgia because it looks&#8230; Sometimes that nostalgia can be about the kitsch factor or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm, okay.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I could&#8230; Man, I can go [inaudible 00:23:33].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was actually careful not to use the word kitsch. So, I&#8217;m surprised you brought that up.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s sort of like the idea of&#8230; Well, when I say kitsch, I think&#8230; Let&#8217;s talk about the 70s for instance.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And when you see things that are about the 70s and particularly black culture, it&#8217;s always expressed in these very kind of superficial, simple&#8230; It&#8217;s like the lettering is groovy, whatever that means.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hobo standard kind of&#8230; I know what you mean. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah. You think of afros as kitsch. It&#8217;s a little bit kitsch, right? People don&#8217;t look at afros as&#8230; They don&#8217;t look at afros as what it was, which was like this assertion of black identity and being sort of proud of kinky hair and all this other kind of stuff. They look at it as being a style. Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And how big it was, or how large your afro was. And sometimes there&#8217;s this sort of&#8230; There&#8217;s definitely like a silliness to some stuff from the 70s. I think that&#8217;s the sort of kitsch thing and it becomes like this kind of joke. I think about that movie, Black Dynamite, which avoided it because it was&#8230; That movie wasn&#8217;t&#8230; It took place in the 70s, but it wasn&#8217;t about afro jokes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
It was, but it wasn&#8217;t. It was really like a very loving, sort of understanding about that sort of aesthetic. But it was deeper than an afro jokes. I don&#8217;t like afro jokes. I don&#8217;t like afro jokes&#8230; [inaudible 00:25:10] my fist on the table. Yeah, it&#8217;s not about the kitsch today, kitsch isn&#8217;t about&#8230; It&#8217;s about like, &#8220;Oh, I remember that vibe.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to tap into.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you mentioned Los Angeles, where you&#8217;re originally from. Tell me what it was like growing up there.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Oh, man, what a weird place! I have a love and hate relationship with Los Angeles, because it made me who I am. So, I can&#8217;t hate on it. And there&#8217;re some really beautiful things about the city. There are some other things that I didn&#8217;t like, because I grew up around the entertainment industry. And so it was just sort of like a preoccupation that&#8230; Yes, it generates money and it generates attention. But sometimes I have to wonder why people sort of got into that world. But the world that I grew up in, was a middle class, black neighborhood called Windsor Hills, which I love to say, the Issa Rae&#8217;s character on Insecure, she&#8217;s from the neighborhood that I grew up. So-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Uh-huh (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
They got to her and when that show came out, I was just like, I just couldn&#8217;t believe that anything was shot in my neighborhood. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, my God, they&#8217;re shooting there, they&#8217;re doing a scene there or some other place.&#8221; And it just blows my mind. So, I have to admit, it&#8217;s like a place that I&#8217;m very proud to come from, even though ironically, when I was growing up, I wasn&#8217;t. It was very conflicting because it was a neighborhood that in the 60s, I would say was probably&#8230; It was&#8230; I think my understanding was predominantly white, predominantly&#8230; A lot of maybe Jewish people who lived also in the neighborhood of Windsor Hills, View Park, Ladera Heights, Baldwin Hills, that area. And I think as black people started&#8230; I like to say or not like to say, but I kind of refer to the 60s as being like when black people actually arrived in the United States.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
That was when actual opportunities started opening up in the same way that other immigrants sort of arrived in the United States and they have to kind of scrapped their way, they&#8217;re at the bottom, but they still have this sort of legitimate way to sort of move on. In some ways, the 60s was kind of like that, finally being able to participate. And so a lot of folks who had been able to get like civil service jobs, or other types of sort of middle class jobs started buying into the neighborhood that I grew up in. And so, I think that was great to see. Some things I didn&#8217;t necessarily like, because I don&#8217;t&#8230; I had problems with sort of the kind of class segregation that was apparent and less about money, but more about social segregation. And the idea that&#8230; The idea society was something that I kind of struggled with. I grew up around people that&#8230; I want to make it very clear, I&#8217;m not knocking something like Jack and Jill or those kinds of organizations.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I think at the time, I wasn&#8217;t part of those things and I didn&#8217;t understand them at the time. So, my limited understanding was, this was just a weird, boujee, kind of whatever, I understand it, or have a better appreciation of it now in the sense of&#8230; The way I like to think about it, is if your parents, regardless of the situation that they come from, they want something better for you. And so, that sort of situation exists because they want their children to succeed, or they want their children to have a guaranteed better life. But I didn&#8217;t understand that at the time. And so even though my father worked in or rather was trying to make his way in entertainment during that time, we ourselves were not probably as well off as maybe the people that were around me. So, that kind of gave me a different sort of perspective on things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). I remember Jack and Jill growing up, but I didn&#8217;t think it was just some boujee black people. Like, seriously. But then I grew up as folks who listen to the show know. I grew up in Selma, Alabama, and it&#8217;s like at the end of the day, we&#8217;re all poor black people in the country. I think when I was looking at it from sort of as like from a teenage perspective, and I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s this way for all of Jack and Jill, but it certainly was this way back then in Alabama. It was by sort of social class of course, but then also by skin color. Pretty much everyone in Jack and Jill was light skinned and I am not. And it&#8217;s like I would have people say, &#8220;Well, you would be so good at Jack and Jill, but you know.&#8221; So, if you were just a few shades lighter maybe and this other thing that we had, we&#8217;re like&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And this was in high school, I don&#8217;t know if this is even a thing or if this was just a thing endemic to our high school, but we had these high school fraternities and sororities that were based off of black fraternities and sororities. So, you had the mini Alpha Phi Alpha, we&#8217;re the African Knights, and like the mini AKAs, Alpha Kappa Alphas we&#8217;re culture Rama, and the mini Delta Sigma Theta, were delta teams. And I never understood any of it. My mother was in a sorority, my mother&#8217;s a delta, but I didn&#8217;t get it. Like, &#8220;Why are we doing this? This doesn&#8217;t make any sense. You&#8217;re just sort of lording this imaginary social position over someone else for what?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s funny, I don&#8217;t&#8230; Again, I don&#8217;t really understand the motivation for that. I could say that as I&#8217;ve grown older, I don&#8217;t want to say I&#8217;ve grown more boujee. I&#8217;m not going to say that though. I&#8217;m not going to say that I don&#8217;t like nice things. Let&#8217;s put it that way. But I don&#8217;t really quite understand that point of view. An interesting thing that&#8230; And I don&#8217;t know how this connects, really. But what comes to mind is, I got the opportunity to work with Don Cornelius.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow!</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And one of the things that he said to me was, black people don&#8217;t recognize class.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And which sort of defies what we&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
But in some ways, I understand what he&#8217;s saying because at the end of the day, in the United States, we&#8217;re all black people. We&#8217;re all structurally, socially, second class. And so, that&#8217;s our commonality. And I don&#8217;t know, I just thought it was a really interesting statement from him. I think we are people in general, I don&#8217;t know. Sort of seek to separate ourselves. But at least in the United States, there&#8217;s still this thread, that we&#8217;re all on the same boat.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I think in the south, certainly there was probably just an additional&#8230; There may have just been an additional element of wanting to&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, maybe have what white people had in some way?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I wonder if that&#8217;s part of it. For example, like I mentioned the high school fraternities, we had both a cotillion and a beautillion. I had a beautillion that was stupid. But like you-</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Thank you. But you&#8217;re like-</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Black tie.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re a distinguished man of a certain age.&#8221; And it&#8217;s a whole thing with like, they do a cakewalk and you have to be in a suit. A tux actually, be in a tux and you do the waltz. It&#8217;s so stupid, I don&#8217;t know if any other&#8230; I hope they don&#8217;t still do that. Because when I think back on, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;This is like some midnight in the garden of good and evil kind of shit. This is weird.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I&#8217;m going to offer the inverse of that. I think that there&#8217;s an opportunity to create expressions that are highly developed. And I don&#8217;t necessarily have a problem with that. I think that, to your point, when it becomes about emulating the surface aspects of white culture, then that&#8217;s where it becomes problematic. But if you&#8217;re celebrating the things that are great about your culture, I think that&#8217;s a different point of view. And maybe that&#8217;s not the way we&#8217;re going to solve this problem, or be able to put a suggestion box to Jack and Jill, but maybe that&#8217;s how it transforms, or maybe there&#8217;s some other organizations or people who are less about that sort of take on things. And more about, &#8220;This is what&#8217;s beautiful about black culture.&#8221; And we should celebrate those things. And we should aspire to those things. I think that that&#8217;s the thing.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
There should be a quality and execution and decorum level that a lot of cultures have that are had been sort of codified and sort of expected like we were talking earlier about like, I go to Japan or something like that. I expect Japanese design to be kick ass. Or even like Scandinavian design. I expect it to be pretty damn good. And so that&#8217;s okay to me to be like, &#8220;Are you at that level?&#8221; No. And when you reach that level, dope, we&#8217;re going to knight you. You know what I&#8217;m saying? It&#8217;s like, you did it. We have a sense of that with music in terms of it doesn&#8217;t matter necessarily what genre it is. And even if you don&#8217;t like it, you might be like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m not really necessarily feeling this particular take, but I can tell that it&#8217;s the person behind it, they put a lot into it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I think music is like one of the things that black Americans do very well, and is worldwide considered to be of excellence. And we have grown up and been exposed to something of excellence, that when it&#8217;s time for those who decide to participate into those avenues, even when they&#8217;re doing something new, they&#8217;re trying to shoot for a particular bar.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right, right.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And I think that having those kinds of standards, absolutely. I think that I see no problem in that sort of higher culture participation. Does that make sense?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That makes sense. Certainly, I get what you&#8217;re saying about when you&#8217;d look at another nation&#8217;s culture for example, there&#8217;s a certain expectation there. And I think that&#8217;s because that play that particular aesthetic, similar to what you&#8217;re saying with like black people in music, it&#8217;s been distilled and exported in a way where you already have a presupposition of what it&#8217;s going to be before you even know what it is. Like if you order&#8230; I&#8217;ll give you an example. I ordered some pants from, I forget what the&#8230; It was something I saw on Instagram, that was probably my fault. But I saw some dope pants on Instagram and I was like, &#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re like some Japanese, Myketo pants. So I expect when I get them, they&#8217;re going to have a certain flattering cut or something different than maybe you wouldn&#8217;t see with American apparel or something like that. Not the brand, but just apparel in general.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And like for black design, I think that&#8217;s a moving target in a way, because it&#8217;s going to depend on your experiences, where you grew up, where you pull inspiration from. I just had a German American designer on the show, Julian Williams, who is currently in Amsterdam. Young kid, 25 years old, has done design work for Karl Lagerfeld, Nike, Tommy Hilfiger, has this very distinct, bold graphic type of graphical design. But then he also pulls inspiration from voguing and the ballroom scene that he&#8217;s a part of. And so it&#8217;s all a part of his general design aesthetic. Is that black design? Because he&#8217;s a black designer? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Absolutely. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I&#8217;m saying like it&#8217;s like a moving target, because then you could look at your work, and your work is definitely very steeped in like I said, these kind of references from the 60s and the 70s, and this tinge of nostalgia. And a lot of what you have done has kind of set the&#8230; I feel like has set the visual cornerstone for an entire culture when people think of hip hop design, it comes down to a lot of the stuff that you did with Eagle Trip, a lot of the stuff you did with Complex, these very interesting graphic styles. That also is black design.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s the goal. Like I said, it&#8217;s not one&#8230; What you&#8217;re alluding to, it&#8217;s not one thing, it&#8217;s not one particular genre, but is when you enter that space, it&#8217;s going to be executed at a particular level. It&#8217;s going to be&#8230; It&#8217;s going to cover specific things. And there are sort of expectations that you get. Like jazz is totally different from R&#038;B and is totally different from Samba, is totally different from reggae, is totally different from dancehall, but it&#8217;s all black music, right? It&#8217;s totally different from the blues, it&#8217;s all black music, they all sound different, right? But there&#8217;s this thread of expression and commonality. And when these genres develop themselves, the execution is you can&#8217;t deny it. So, that&#8217;s a goal, is to create things that even though they&#8217;re not in one particular space, or they may jump from place to place, which is what&#8217;s going to happen, you want them to leave a mark.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I will say speaking about how kind of having black design being internationally recognized in a way similar to how black music is, a lot of your work has been exhibited in group exhibitions, both here in the US, as well as internationally. What does it mean to have your work kind of shown in that kind of fashion?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
When my stuff is recognized internationally, it means a lot because a lot of it was pre-internet and that means that the people that decided to talk about design or whatever, they&#8217;re seeking, they&#8217;re looking for. They&#8217;re looking for content like anybody like anything or anybody now, but they have a certain standard in mind. And there&#8217;s a filter that they have in their head. So, what I&#8217;m most proud of, I guess, is publications and people that have reached out to me. Yeah, like I said, particularly before the internet was popping. Because they were like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve seen this, I&#8217;ve seen a few of these things. I really was affected by this, or this was a music artist that really meant a lot to me. And I see that a couple of other artists that mean a lot to me were represented visually by this guy, Brent Rollins. And so let me look into it.&#8221; That&#8217;s a good feeling. And to know that people around the world who are on the same wavelength as you, and who are seeking out things, find you. That&#8217;s incredible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
That makes me feel good. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, we&#8217;ve talked about Ego Trip, just kind of briefly touching on it. But I want to go more in depth about that. You came on as our director, you&#8217;re kind of one of the co founders of this group with some titans in the industry, Sacha Jenkins, Elliott Wilson, Jeff Mao, take me back to that time. What did it feel like sort of coming together and building something like Ego Trip and the work that you all were able to do?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Oh, sure yeah. And we have to remember the one titan who is always like never wants attention, was Gabriel Alvarez. Yeah. I mean, Ego Trip was kind of like&#8230; We were like a band. And in some ways for that world, we were like a supergroup. And I got to know&#8230; I started working with Gabriel Alvarez when I was working at Rap Pages, got the gig through very awesome, incredible woman named Sheena Lester. And Rap Pages was an early sort of competitor to The Source Magazine. And-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Larry Flynt.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Larry Flynt, my man. Yeah. Enough respect to that guy, rest in peace. What a person to work for. I didn&#8217;t work for him specifically, but just to know that he was in the building, what a&#8230; Very bizarre to be early 20s and working for a pornographer. But yeah, he had started this magazine, Rap Pages basically to kind of reap some attention that The Source was getting. And Sheena had taken it over, after maybe a few issues, I guess. And we wanted to build an editorial team. I was one of the later people to join, and one of my compatriots, there was Gabriel Alvarez. So, between myself, Sheena, Gabe, Blau, Dorothy, and I apologize if I can&#8217;t remember Hannibal and some other folks that&#8230; Nikki, incredible person. We kind of were a little kind of a group who kind of wanted to take on The Source. At the time, that was like the main kind of hip hop music magazine. It was the first and undeniably significant. But we sort of had our take on things or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
But we had hired freelance writers, and among them was Sacha Jenkins, and Elliott Wilson, and I&#8217;m not sure if Mel&#8230; I believe Mel may have been hired as well, as a freelance writer, but that&#8217;s how I got to know those guys. Or that&#8217;s how I made first contact with them. And after a few years of working at the magazine, Gabe had moved to New York to work with Sacha, on Ego Trip. And Sacha Jenkins, who for people that don&#8217;t know, I would say in recent years, he&#8217;s probably known for producing these documentaries called, I believe it&#8217;s called Fresh Dressed, which is about hip hop fashion. He also directed this Wu Tang documentary on Showtime. And so he&#8217;s been&#8230; And he&#8217;s also in a punk band and all this other kind of stuff. And Sacha has always been doing all these kind of great self-started initiating things and had this sort of fledgling magazine, or zin rather, called the Ego Trip.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And Ego Trip was&#8230; It was coming from the perspective of mainly, mostly writers of color to talk about hip hop, with a love and reverence, but also an irreverence towards the subject matter, and also had interest in other music such as punk rock, indie rock, what have you. And so, as Sacha would say, it was like Rolling Stones, but the inverse. So Rolling Stone would mostly cover rock, and maybe occasionally do hip hop. And so, Ego Trip was the flip side of that. And so that&#8217;s how I got to know those guys, and I eventually moved to New York in 1997, because of having some contact with Sacha. Sacha had sort of said, &#8220;Hey, we need to step up our magazine visually,&#8221; sort of invited me to join the team for no money, but more just out of like an outlet to do something creative.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I looked at myself, as the Terry Gilliam to everybody else&#8217;s John Cleese, and the rest of the Monty Python crew. As far as being the visual person, I understood editorial, and I also wanted to do sort of humor. We were doing a lot of funny, goofy stuff. And so I had my take on how to express that. And eventually, that became the collage. There were&#8230; The magazine itself was instrumental to me in terms of my creative development, because it was very DIY, it was like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s just take&#8230;&#8221; We used to do precursors to memes called Ego Trip Ads. So we would find these funny images from Jet Magazine or, or Ebony or something like that. Just older magazines, like ads of black people in Burger King ads and write funny captions to them. But the captions were always like hip hop lyrics. And then we would kind of put the little slug like Ego Trip.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And so basically, they became ads to fill in the unused ad space in the magazine. But they were fun. They helped us sort of develop our creative voice and make the magazine more individual and sort of unique. And so, that&#8217;s how I kind of got down with them. I had myself this irreverent take on hip hop and sort of making fun of hip hop, but loving it at the same time. This was the vehicle for it. And so, once we got together, yeah, Sacha was working, I think at Vibe Magazine. Elliott was working at The Source, Jeff was writing for a lot of other music magazines and Gabe, he&#8217;s the glue and like I said, he doesn&#8217;t get the credit that he deserves because he&#8217;s very much behind the scenes, he doesn&#8217;t want the attention, but he is the funniest MF around the planet, and super creative.</p>

And so, collectively, yeah, we kind of just became like Voltron, like superhero group and looked at the magazine as a vehicle to express just how we&#8230; Just things that we were interested in, and also to try to put it to&#8230; Like every issue, I only did like the last three issues, but it felt like making an album. And each issue got more and more personal. Like there&#8217;s running&#8230; It&#8217;s a magazine literally with like running jokes. Because if you turn the pages, you&#8217;ll see a reference to something that came earlier, and we made it this kind of like goofy puzzle. And it became semi&#8230; Everything in Ego Trip became this&#8230; It started blurring the line between music, journalism and autobiography.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. How was it received at the time?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I think you&#8217;d have to ask a lot of journalists maybe how they thought about it. I guess at the time, no one was doing what we were doing. And I don&#8217;t say that to sound like arrogant, I just mean in a sense-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No. Hey, talk your shit.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
But I&#8217;m not [inaudible 00:48:30]. It wasn&#8217;t usual for people to get together to be like, &#8220;Hey, we want to talk about this with this particular voice. That isn&#8217;t straight ahead. So, when we got together to do that stuff, we just had fun. We would just goof around and just make jokes and it was like one of the&#8230; Those guys were like my brothers, brothers that I never had. And so, like I said, it&#8217;s kind of like we were sort of a supergroup. Yeah, we used to do some stupid things. In my head, I&#8217;m thinking about this time we kidnapped this journalist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wait, wait, wait. What?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. So, there&#8217;s this journalist who writes for the New York Times now named John Caramanica.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, my God! Okay. No, I&#8217;m sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Wait, do you know&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know of him because of some of his shitty reviews. But no, go ahead.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
So, I can&#8217;t remember what he was interviewing us for, maybe it was for our first book. I can&#8217;t remember probably. But we were like, &#8220;Okay, this is how we want to be legendary.&#8221; So at the time, we used to have this one office on 16th Street in Chelsea Market, and we used to have this really dope&#8230; The fourth floor, we had almost all to ourselves. We were sharing it with this graffiti brand named Bullets of Brooklyn, but they were never there. So, we kind of just had the run of the space. And then for reasons that I won&#8217;t get into, we had to vacate that space. And so we ended up moving into the basement of the building. So, we wrote our first book in the basement of this building on 16th Street in Chelsea. And so, there were pipes of bolus than you&#8217;d hear like toilet flushing, and you&#8217;d just hear all this sewage going by and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And then we have this room in the back&#8230; We only have like two rooms, we have this one room that was where, if you see the cover of our book, the book of Rap List, that was the room that we shot this in. And we were like, &#8220;Okay, I guess we&#8217;re going to get interviewed.&#8221; I think it was probably for the New York Times, and we&#8217;re going to get interviewed and we can&#8217;t just do a normal thing, man. We&#8217;re like, &#8220;We&#8217;re Ego Trip dude, we&#8217;re [inaudible 00:50:49] this shit.&#8221; So we told them to meet or show up someplace in the Chelsea Market, which is like this kind of food court now. This glorified food court in Chelsea. And we had this really cute girl who was a friend of ours, go meet him and she was like, &#8220;Are you John Caramanica?&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Come with me.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
We wanted him to have a story to tell. So, she leads him&#8230; I can&#8217;t remember if she&#8230; We weren&#8217;t there. So, I can&#8217;t say exactly. But I believe she probably blindfolded him at this venue, and probably walked him outside across the street and then walked into the building took him downstairs in the elevator. He shows up, he&#8217;s blindfolded, we walked in [inaudible 00:51:39].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve still a thought of the fact that he just went with this woman and got blindfolded, just went with her.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah, man. It&#8217;s like, what is he going to do? Is he going to say no?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah. He did it. So, it was just funny.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, you say kidnapping, I&#8217;m thinking like somebody got shoved in the back of a panel van or something. He sounds like a willing participant in this case. Well, go ahead. Go ahead.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I can imagine that for someone in his position, it must have been definitely strange. He thought he&#8217;s going to an office to talk to somebody, he&#8217;s being blindfolded by some attractive young lady and brought to who he doesn&#8217;t even know where he&#8217;s going.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
This white van as far as we&#8217;re concerned. She takes him into the back room and we have the lights down low. I remember exhaustion now, Jeff and I we&#8217;re back there. So we had turntables in there. And I remember because I was in the other room. I just remember Sacha had something&#8230; He had some record on the turntable, and he kept looping it. So it was just super creepy. He was just scratching it, [inaudible 00:52:50] just back spinning it. Super creepy thing. And then we instruct Caramanica to take off his blindfold. And then the guys proceeded to talk with the flashlight under their heads.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow!.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And then they do the interview. And finally, it&#8217;s time to leave. I do remember Jeff going like, &#8220;It&#8217;s time to go.&#8221; And I do remember Jeff now going like, &#8220;Hey, thanks. Thanks for coming by, you know what you got to do now, right?&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; So we asked our friend to&#8230; The young lady to blindfold him again. We span him around a few times, and he exited the building. And the rest is history.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow! That&#8217;s a wild story. That&#8217;s a wild story. So, Ego Trip eventually evolved from this magazine to a book, to several television shows. I mentioned prior to us recording how I remember watching those shows on VH1 as a teenager, the White Rapper Show and Miss Rap Supreme, and Race-O-Rama and everything, and just being so&#8230; Well, maybe not so much the reality shows, but certainly, the visual elements from like Race-O-Rama and stuff like that being so enamored with&#8230; I had never seen anything like that before talking about black culture, hip hop culture, that kind of thing. I&#8217;ve never seen it done in that way. And it blew my mind. It was really&#8230; I have to say it was kind of an early design reference for me, I wanted to make stuff like that. I wanted to be able to kind of have that sort of tongue in cheek irreverence towards culture in that way, in a way that felt familiar, but also felt kind of new and fresh, unlike something that you haven&#8217;t really seen before.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Oh, man, thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I think that was again, the&#8230; For me, that was a little bit of a Terry Gilliam in terms of all the crazy animations that you would see from Monty Python. That was my inspiration in the sense of the humor of stuff. And how do you express that stuff visually. And everything that we were doing in Ego Trip was really&#8230; It&#8217;s funny, because I&#8217;d like to think that we&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say that we originated things, but there definitely wasn&#8217;t any sort of bigger reference. And it&#8217;s funny how meme culture has years later sort of assumed some of the similarities to what we were doing. So, was it a human thing? I don&#8217;t know. But it was in terms of like pairing these references and music lyrics to things and doing so like tongue and cheek, but I don&#8217;t know, but we definitely did it early. And so yeah, for Race-O-Rama, each episode, or there was three series, I&#8217;m sorry, three episodes in the series.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And Race-O-Rama was this kind of fun house idea. And the idea that looking at race through this sort of voyeuristic lens. And so each of the shows was blackophobia, which used sort of the visual language of horror films, and pulp alien invasion movies and stuff like that. In Race We Lost, which was pulling from the visuals of like&#8230; I mean, I love this time square CD, porno theater graphics and all that kind of stuff. And the other one was, &#8220;Dude, Where&#8217;s My Ghetto Pass?&#8221; Which was kind of like this we call an urban safari. So this idea of cultural sort of, not necessarily appropriation, but this sort of&#8230; Everything was about the voyeurism of race, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
So, once we started thinking about those kinds of things, it was just like, it was just super fun to kind of riff off of them, because our take on on discussing race or presenting race was about the idea of not so much making fun of it, but at least making it less about some of the typical things or things that people would immediately associate when you&#8217;re talking about race. Particularly at that time, that series was based off of&#8230; Well, that series sprang from a book that we wrote called The Big Book of Racism. And that was a book that Dana Albarella, our beloved editor, who also produced our Ego Trip&#8217;s, Book of Rap Lists, she had moved on from St. Martin&#8217;s Press to HarperCollins, which was headed by Judith Regan, who was kind of a big shot in the publishing world, particularly at that time. And so we had the opportunity to do that book called The Big Book of Racism.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And our thing about that book was that it was about race, because that was our secondary preoccupation after hip hop, the title and the premise kind of started off as a joke. And then we actually kind of started really getting into it. The thing about that book was we wanted to talk about race in a way that people could relate to, because generally, when people talked about race, they talked about sort of the history and we&#8217;re talking about the history of race from the arrival of slaves in America, up until the civil rights era. And so&#8230; And it tended to be very academic. And our lens as far as how we related to each other and joked with each other, was always through the lens of popular culture. And so the idea of doing a look at race through the lens of popular culture, was an interesting challenge. It was a crazy challenge for us.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And on top of that, to bring attention to things and to make fun of it, or to joke about it, in that sort of sarcastic sort of coping mechanism kind of way. And it was really hard because we wrote it during 911.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh!</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Which really&#8230; Yeah. There was a point where we had started writing that book, The Big Book of Racism, and then 911 happened and we were just like, &#8220;Man, we don&#8217;t hate anybody, we&#8217;re critiquing things.&#8221; But it was very difficult. But we kind of decided if we&#8217;re going to do this, it&#8217;s going to be&#8230; If we&#8217;re going to fail, it&#8217;s going to be a magnificent failure. We were just like, let&#8217;s&#8230; Man, I&#8217;ve never doubted myself as much. I don&#8217;t edit and perhaps I&#8217;m speaking for the rest of the guys when we were doing that thing because we were just like, &#8220;Should we do this at a time when people needed unity?&#8221; And we&#8217;re just writing, not so much a divisive book, but a book to sort of in our minds, illustrate why people of color feel the way they do based off of the treatment that popular culture has presented. And so that was always my interest personally, was understanding how popular culture affects the perception of people. And so like I was saying, a lot of the academic books spoke to a very specific audience. And our goal was to be anti-academic.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Chock full of information and intended to be sort of ingested sporadically wherever you want to enter it, but also for you to walk away to understand like, &#8220;Oh, damn, this country is built on race, there&#8217;s so much race in this country that people want to not acknowledge. And here&#8217;s our sort of listical way of doing it with jokes.&#8221; With comedy, but trying to make it apparent. That&#8217;s the role of an artist, is to make you see things that are right there in front of you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Wow! During 911. Yeah. That was certainly a very interesting. I think that was definitely a pivotal point in the country as it relates to race relations. Because aside from that, you got the formation of the TSA and how that has changed. Just so many things around screening in airports and stuff like that. But it really turned the dial on how race relations were in this country.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah, there was a lot of internal examination going on. And that tragedy. Tragedy sort of expose what you&#8217;re made of, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Even just the recent craziness that we, as a country have been going through the past few years, it&#8217;s ultimately I guess, a good thing because it&#8217;s being brought to light. And then you see where people are trying to reach out and where people are trying to find those commonalities, and that common ground, and where they&#8217;re not. And so that just reemerges.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know that you have worked with Ego Trip for a number of years, but during that time, you also were the creative director at Complex for a while. What were some of your memories from that time?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I was creative director after Ego Trip, we had sort of kind of fizzled and disbanded.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, okay.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah. So there was a period where I was kind of back to sort of doing&#8230; I was always kind of working on independent projects concurrently while doing Ego Trip, when Ego Trip was in sort of in full rev, that&#8217;s where I spent the most focus on. But there were always opportunities to do album covers, or things like that during that time. But complex kind of came about because actually our former Ego Trip intern, Noah was an editor at complex and he sort of, he needed, I like to call myself a substitute teacher, because the previous art director had left, and they needed to finish a few issues. And so that&#8217;s when I kind of came in to work on the magazine. And then what was interesting about working there, was I came in and sort of helped finish the issues. And I was like, &#8220;Okay, cool, this is fun.&#8221; Got to work with some younger designers, and really start to exercise my kind of delegation, and start to teach in some ways or pass along whatever information that I could and knowledge that I could to other people, and to learn how to shape things.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Because when you&#8217;re creative, you tend to keep it to yourself and you do things that you don&#8217;t need to do. Like you don&#8217;t need to scan, you don&#8217;t need to&#8230; If we&#8217;re talking about graphics, you don&#8217;t need to do the silhouetting. You don&#8217;t need to do that stuff. Maybe you do it sometimes out of necessity, and maybe you might get really good at it. But the bigger thing is just really putting all those pieces together. So it was a great exercise to learn how to orchestrate a symphony. And that&#8217;s kind of what I refer to myself as a creative conductor, because at a certain point, it&#8217;s less about my actual hands and more about my actual thought and how do you put all those elements together. And so Complex became from a magazine, and this is during start of the decline of print as a popular media form, and the ascension of the web as the dominant media form. And so Complex, all the business heads behind it, were very perceptive in terms of growing that business.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And so that&#8217;s what also kept me there, was learning. I learned about media when we were doing stuff with VH1, but the opportunity to work with teams of people and to build a business really, was exciting. That was an exciting opportunity because now, I&#8217;m dealing with for the first time in my life, a generation of people whose references are different than mine. And I&#8217;m now in this position of also learning from them. So, I like to learn new things. And I get excited by new stuff. And I&#8217;m always looking for that new drug. Like, &#8220;Yo, I need to get high again, give me that design crack. Give me that culture crack.&#8221; That was an opportunity to stay plugged in and to learn new things. And also to be able to work with people. And also Ego Trip as &#8220;successful&#8221; as we were, we hit a wall in a sense, and going to Complex was an opportunity to sort of flex some different muscles and to see&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Ego Trip was patronizing in the sense of that we had the VH1 give us money. VH1 gave us money and before that the book publishers gave us money. But we were not successful in the sense of able to generate money ourselves. So, Complex was an opportunity to sort of look behind the curtain and then kind of step behind that curtain and see how business, or how entrepreneurial minded business grows and develops and becomes like this media titan that it is today. So, that&#8217;s what kept me there, was to learn from the younger designers, to help shape them also, to pass on that information and that knowledge, and they would also show me some things or helped me&#8230; I used to say they helped me think. Because they would try different things and I&#8217;d be like, &#8220;No, no, no, no, no.&#8221; They would create these different options&#8230; I&#8217;m a good critic, I think. As a graphic designer or a communication designer, or that kind of visual designer, you&#8217;re taking these kind of existing elements, and arranging them versus an artist necessarily who kind of create something from scratch.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
So, they would create these things from scratch in some ways, or create these options and then I can look at them and be like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, no, no, no, no, no, this is not communicating, or this is not tapping into that feeling that we were talking about before. This is not communicating this thing.&#8221; And helping to shape them. So, that was immensely satisfying. And working with celebrities is interesting and fun. And traveling around the world is great. And so, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you define success now?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Success is kind of about satisfying the need to create projects that actually propel ideas and culture. And I guess that&#8217;s maybe always the idea of success for me. I think the idea of monetary success, yes, I&#8217;m not going to say that that&#8217;s not important. But I&#8217;ve come closer to this understanding of when my time is up, for me, what am I putting forth in the world, or what&#8217;s my legacy? And so I can&#8217;t do everything myself, there are things that I&#8217;m working on that are about personal vision, but as a group, we can accomplish a lot of things. Ego Trip as a group, we accomplished things that we didn&#8217;t think we would ever accomplish. Working in Complex, we accomplished things that were in that&#8230; The metrics for that world, we surpassed them. And so for me, when people tell me that they&#8217;ve been influenced by something that I did, or they show some sort of appreciation for the things that I&#8217;ve done, and even more so when these things are attached to something that has some sort of cultural importance, man, that&#8217;s a great feeling.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I want to keep doing that. For me, that&#8217;s the metric of success. Again, know how to make money, [inaudible 01:08:48] money, love me some money. But we&#8217;re put on this world to do things. And so I&#8217;m happy and fortunate that whatever mark I&#8217;ve made in the world, I&#8217;ve been able to do. I think the thing about it is, it&#8217;s also fleeting, and it&#8217;s also like you got to keep doing things. Success is also somewhat short lived. You know what I mean? I&#8217;m happy to inspire people, but I&#8217;m also like, I want to inspire more people and I need to keep doing to continue to be relevant, not because I&#8217;m trying to be the cool of the week, but because a large enough body of people are viewing and affected by the things that I work on. Right now, that would be the marker of success to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. That&#8217;s a very interesting answer.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I guess because I&#8217;ve been kind of dropping these little pins like throughout the interview like your work, and the work that you did with Ego Trip, the work you did with Complex, is really like been a cornerstone in the design style of when people think of hip hop culture, a lot of that boils down to work that you have done, whether that&#8217;s been magazines, we didn&#8217;t even touch on the album covers that you&#8217;ve done. I feel like a lot of people are inspired by your work, but they may not know that it&#8217;s from you, maybe.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. It&#8217;s funny. The thing about [inaudible 01:10:15] is because it&#8217;s still kind of being done in the service of whoever. And I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to work with people who more or less are like, &#8220;Hey, Brent, I like your style.&#8221; I had to develop a style because the more you do something, the more people recognize it. And then if they like it, then they come to you. But in some cases, yeah. There&#8217;s been the suppression of Ego in the sense of, it&#8217;s not about me, it&#8217;s about I&#8217;m doing this for someone else. And so yeah, there&#8217;s been things that I&#8217;ve done that maybe people don&#8217;t see that thread, I have a good friend, Phil McMillan, who he was another designer. And he&#8217;s&#8230; Some people are really in tune with it. He&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;I saw this and I was like, yo, I think Brent did that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
So he sees it. And so whatever is the essence of me creatively shows up in those things and he&#8217;s in tune with that, and he can find that. And there are other people that can do that too. And so that&#8217;s a much more honest relationship, when you can work with those people, because that means you guys are on the same wavelength. And so that&#8217;s&#8230; I found that those have been the best projects for me, is when people come to me because they do know, because they are familiar with the things that I&#8217;ve done, and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;That&#8217;s the vibe that I want.&#8221; And it&#8217;s freeing because it lets me be me. I&#8217;m a designer in the sense that I&#8217;m problem solving, but I&#8217;m also an artist in the sense that I&#8217;m trying to express something emotionally and I connected with those people. And so, yeah. Ramble, ramble, ramble, ramble.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, is there a dream project that you would love to do one day? I feel like you&#8217;ve done television, you&#8217;ve done magazines, you&#8217;ve done album covers, you&#8217;ve done a book. What&#8217;s next? What do you really want to do one day?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
There are many dream projects that I want to do. There&#8217;s personal projects that I&#8217;ve finally started initiating. One is really getting into furniture design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah. And so I had gone to Italy in 2019 to start that. I&#8217;m working with a friend of mine over there. And then just the nature of the project really meant that I couldn&#8217;t restart it until the warmer months. Totally happens and dashes those dreams on the Mediterranean rocks. That&#8217;ll still happen. And then I have a sort of a creative&#8230; The dream projects, yeah. I mean, it&#8217;s really more about when does Brent start putting his own voice forward more? Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
My voice has been forward in people&#8217;s projects, and mostly because I&#8217;d never&#8230; I would probably say that there&#8217;s one critique with myself, it&#8217;s like I devalue what I think I have to say. I have an idea&#8230; I actually started this project during the pandemia, I&#8217;m going to is like Black Star Wars, and let people kind of go from there. But I started some stuff in making models, telling friends who are also creative, and they got super excited about that stuff. And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, man, I wanted the soundtrack.&#8221; And you got to have this character do this, and you got to do that. And it&#8217;ll happen. And I&#8217;m not afraid to say it. I thought about like, &#8220;Should I even talk about this?&#8221; But hall yeah. But really, just more personal projects are exciting. My father was a phenomenal creative person who passed away recently.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And my mission I guess, is to let the world kind of see what this guy who inspired me, what he did, and with the hope that maybe he also inspires other people, so that&#8217;s also another project. Man, I got a lot of projects. God, I got a lot of things. Yeah. Like I said, 2021 let&#8217;s go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I hear you. Well, Brent, just to kind of wrap things up here. Where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I guess online you can look me up Brettrollins.com under my website that really needs to be updated. You can follow me on Instagram, my handle is Brentronic, B-R-E-N-T-R-O-N-I-C, and then at that point, by the end 2021, hopefully you&#8217;ll be seeing my name in a lot more places when you won&#8217;t even try.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Brent Rollins, I have to thank you. Just thank you so much for coming on the show. I guess prior to us recording about how much of a design influence you&#8217;ve been to me seeing your early work, and it&#8217;s been just such a pleasure to one just introduce you to the Revision Path audience, I have a feeling that people are going to listen to this. And they&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Wait a minute, he did that!&#8221; They&#8217;re going to now know that you are the person behind so much iconic work out there. It&#8217;s just been a joy to talk to you, it&#8217;s been a joy to hear about the work that you&#8217;re doing. And I want to see what comes next absolutely, because I have no doubt it&#8217;s going to be hot. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Man, thank you so much. And I know other people will say the same thing to you, man. But dude, you&#8217;re doing God&#8217;s work. Thank you so much for doing Revision Path.</p>

<p>One of the things I love most about Revision Path is talking shop with design educators like Kaleena Sales. Kaleena is an illustrator, a design educator at Tennessee State University, and the author of <em><a href="https://papress.com/pages/extra-bold" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Extra Bold: A Feminist, Inclusive, Anti-Racist, Non-Binary Field Guild for Graphic Designers</a></em>. Kaleena is one of many Black design educators that are helping make the design canon more elastic for students by allowing Black culture and aesthetics to be a part of the conversation.</p>
<p>We talked about teaching design virtually at an HBCU, and Kaleena talked about growing up in Nashville and how she thought about pursuing a career as a fine artist before putting in time working in the advertising industry. She also spoke about what drew her back to her alma mater, as well as the many ways that she has seen design education change since she started teaching. Kaleena is also active with AIGA Nashville, and even shared some info about her upcoming book! With educators like Kaleena, I think the future is in good hands.</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Hi. I&#8217;m Kaleena Sales. I&#8217;m a design educator, illustrator, researcher from Nashville, Tennessee. I teach design at Tennessee State University where I&#8217;m also serving this year as the interim chair of the department. I also serve on the steering committee for AIGA&#8217;s design educators community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. How&#8217;s 2021 been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
You know what, it&#8217;s been good so far. It&#8217;s been really, really busy. 2020 was busy and then I feel like 2021 is just sort of a continuation of that. Lots of really cool opportunities have come up. There have been a couple of book projects and conferences and some speaking engagements and things that have kept me really busy. That&#8217;s been really nice and it sort of like serves as a good balance for me between my teaching role at TSU.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is it hard kind of trying to balance the teaching along with these other opportunities?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
It can be, yeah. I mean, this year&#8217;s been weird anyway just because of all of the virtual instruction and then having to figure out how to deliver content to students in addition to taking on this interim chairs position for the first time and learning how to serve in an administrative capacity. That&#8217;s been a lot of really like a new space for me. So doing a lot of the the book projects and sort of my, I guess field work has really started as a really nice balance. So it keeps me really busy, but I really like being able to do all of the extra projects. I feel like it really gives me the context that I need to be a better educator.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s dive into more of the work that you&#8217;re doing at Tennessee State. So your interim chair of the, which department is it again?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
It&#8217;s the Department of Art and Design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Art and design. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah, studio and design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. I would imagine with sort of this, I guess, hybrid&#8230; I don&#8217;t know is it sort of a hybrid thing now that students are getting vaccinated and such or is it still all virtual?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, we have a few hybrid courses, but this past year a lot of the delivery has been virtual. So we&#8217;ve been trying to stay away from each other as much as possible. But there have been some classes, the more studio-based courses. So like ceramics or sculpture and those types of things that are difficult to teach just online. Those have been meeting a little bit in person. For my design classes, I&#8217;ve been all virtual though.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has it been trying to teach design virtually?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
It&#8217;s not terrible. I mean, obviously with design, we have the benefit of using the computer as our main tool. So it&#8217;s been fine in that way. One of the challenges though is I&#8217;m used to like a lot of other design educators and just educators in general like I&#8217;m used to walking around the classroom and assessing student&#8217;s work and sort of being there with them as they&#8217;re navigating through some of their challenges and helping them to see things as they&#8217;re working.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So you lose some of that within the virtual space because students are either working offline or they&#8217;re not sharing their screens with you while they&#8217;re kind of going through those processes. So that assessment and kind of critique process really has changed quite a bit in the virtual space.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s the part that&#8217;s tough and I think that the students are having a hard time with that and that feedback loop is a little bit difficult for some of them. But again, I&#8217;m thankful though that we do get to just use our laptops for the most part to do our work. There have been some issues though with just access to laptops and software for some of my students. So a lot of the students that I teach typically rely on using the computer lab to do a lot of their work.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So we have seen a drop-off in enrollment because some of the students who just don&#8217;t have the materials to do it just didn&#8217;t enroll in classes this semester or this past year. So that&#8217;s been really unfortunate and I&#8217;m hoping that in the fall we&#8217;ll see that turn back around.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was listening to this podcast series from the New York Times called Odessa and they have been following this&#8230; Really, it was this high school girl and her class. Her band actually, marching band. And it struck me just like it has to be so hard for students right now everywhere. Regardless of the grade because school is such a vital social function as well as a societal function. And when something like the pandemic kind of strips that away and turns into a virtual experience, it&#8217;s not just so much about, &#8220;Oh, you can&#8217;t commune in public,&#8221; but it takes away something from like the whole society.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I can only imagine trying to focus and learn, and you can only do it on the computer and you can&#8217;t really collaborate in person or knock ideas off of other people in real time in that way. It&#8217;s really tough.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah, it is tough and a lot of the students&#8230; Everyone&#8217;s wired differently. So you have introverts like myself who are completely fine like being at home and away from people. But we have a lot of students who really, really do need that social component and they&#8217;re missing it. Then all the other activities that you have with just college life in general, outside of just your classes. And on an HBCU campus, one of the big draws to an HBCU for a lot of students is the community and it&#8217;s that sense of being around your peers. So when you&#8217;re back isolated at home, you&#8217;re missing out on a big part of why you even attended college in the first place.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s very, very true. Overall though, I&#8217;d like to know because I mentioned before we started recording that I&#8217;ve had a lot of design educators on the show just really this year, but what&#8217;s the experience like teaching design at an HBCU. What makes that special?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a really I think a kind of specific experience that happens when you&#8217;re learning design at an HBCU. And I&#8217;m sure it varies depending on which HBC you&#8217;re attending and all that. But a lot of the students that I teach, they come from cities like Memphis, and Atlanta, and Chicago. They are really from like black parts of town and then they come to a college that&#8217;s predominantly black.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So your cultural kind of experience is very kind of specific and that comes out in your design work at least in my experience it has for the students. So when we&#8217;re teaching about international typographic style and Bauhaus, and all of that, the students are engaged to a certain extent, but they&#8217;re very much interested in expressing their culture through design.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So I would say that&#8217;s a really big distinction between learning or experiencing design and learning designing in HBCU versus at a predominantly white institution is because you&#8217;re surrounded by black people, black culture all the time and you&#8217;re not really in the minority yet. So the students that I teach often don&#8217;t really see a need to create work that fits the mainstream necessarily.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
They&#8217;re not really pulled to do that or compelled to do that the way that I see black students who are in predominantly white institutions doing. So that&#8217;s really interesting to observe and it actually kind of is what created my personal research interest in general. So that&#8217;s one of the biggest observations I&#8217;ve made.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I would also imagine because you being a black design educator and it&#8217;s at an HBCU, you don&#8217;t dissuade students when they try to do that, right?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
You know what though, it&#8217;s been a journey for me because I&#8217;ll be honest and say that when I first started teaching, I was teaching very much the way that I was taught. So I was teaching very much like, again, international topographic style, and sans serif, and flush left, and these are the rules. I started teaching really like when I was 27, so it&#8217;s been quite a few years ago now.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So I wanted my students originally to fit into the mainstream. I felt like that was going to be their path into the industry. And it very much still is to be honest, but I&#8217;ve changed the way that I feel about that and the way that I teach about that now. So instead of wanting them to squeeze into the mainstream. There&#8217;s a really good quote by an AfriCOBRA artist that says something about making the canon&#8230; Instead of fitting into the canon, making the canon more elastic. So that&#8217;s sort of like how I approach it now versus the way that I taught in my really early years.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So now, I&#8217;m encouraging them to consider the ways that their identity might show up and the way that their social economic kind of status or upbringing might even influence their design work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting. I&#8217;m thinking on how that would look like. I don&#8217;t know. Can you give an example of what a student&#8230; And you don&#8217;t have to like call-out a student by name or anything, but what&#8217;s an example of something that a student would do in that instance?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
I actually write about this in the book Extra Bold, but one really kind of specific example would be just even the way that we all view wealth or money for example, right? If you think about if you grow up wealthy or in a family that&#8217;s pretty well off, your view of money is normalized. So if you were to ask to design a logo for a bank for example, you might represent that in a really sort of corporate way. It&#8217;s like simplified typography and that sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
If you grew up like I grew up, which was like inner city and not very well off, your ideas of what wealth looks like is very different. It might be a little bit flashier and it might have gold as a representation or some other kind of symbolism that matches that type of thinking. So I see my students choosing fonts, and colors, and textures that really speak to the visual landscape and the culture in which they come from.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So there&#8217;s a lot of, I think, influences from hip-hop and just very like urban design. They don&#8217;t shy away from that and I don&#8217;t want them to. So those are kind of some things that come to mind when I think about that specific aesthetic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The first thing when you said that what came to mind was&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if you remember seeing this, but there&#8217;s this black bank called One United Bank and they have this visa card with Harriet Tubman on it doing the Wakanda salute.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I saw it on Twitter and people clowned it, but leave it to a black bank to do that. You know what I&#8217;m saying? You wouldn&#8217;t see that at Wells Fargo. That ain&#8217;t happening.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
That&#8217;s funny. That sort of pushes it into sort of a space where those symbols&#8230; And I don&#8217;t want to criticize that design, but those symbols sort of take on a little bit of a stereotype or they don&#8217;t mean as much. I think that it&#8217;s hard to talk about black aesthetics and black design sometimes because I think sometimes we feel that we&#8217;re being or we&#8217;re describing like a monolithic viewpoint or like a monolithic experience when we do that.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s certainly not ever like what I want to suggest. I think it&#8217;s true for everyone&#8217;s experience. I think we just are all influenced by just the things around us and the media that we consume, and the way that we grow up. Even our fashion choices respond to our culture as well. So those are really the things that I see.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And your research focus, I mean it plays into this about black culture and aesthetics. How did you end up deciding on that as a focus?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Well, exactly sort of what I was just describing, which was I started to notice that my students were making some choices. So for example a lot of my students were liking like the Old English typeface. I was getting so frustrated and I thought, &#8220;Oh my gosh. Why do you guys keep choosing this?&#8221; I stepped back and I tried to be less critical and I was like, &#8220;Well, why do they like this particular typeface and why do I see certain color palettes repeating like red, and black, and white and really bold color combinations?&#8221; I started to study a little bit about the mere exposure effect and subliminal exposure. I don&#8217;t know if you are familiar with that or not.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No. I haven&#8217;t heard of that.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So it just simply says like the more you see something, the more you like it. The subliminal exposure effect essentially just says that even when things are repeated subliminally and you don&#8217;t notice that you&#8217;re seeing something over and over again, you still end up having a sort of a preference for that. So it&#8217;s sort of similar to, if you grew up in a household where people smoke cigarettes and then maybe as an adult, the smell of cigarette smoke is actually sort of calming to you because it reminds you of home.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Or if you grew up in New York City, and it&#8217;s busy and loud, maybe a very quiet kind of experience is discomforting to you. It&#8217;s sort of that kind of thing. So when we see things, textures of the city, the sounds of the city, even like fashion choices depending if you&#8217;re into sneakers or if you&#8217;re into certain kinds of shoes those color palettes and things, they stick with this.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So I see that in the research that I&#8217;m doing. What I started to do in my research was pull examples of my students work and compare it to the visual landscape of urban environments and I saw a lot of similarities between the two. So for graffiti lettering and then an interest in that kind of typography style or even textures from a city like walls or landscape and then the textures that students are choosing in their design work.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So I just think it&#8217;s kind of interesting and fascinating. Although, I specifically am interested in like the black experience and particularly the urban black experience, I think that this can certainly be true for people who grew up in rural areas and that sort of thing. So that&#8217;s sort of where that research interest comes from. It&#8217;s directly from my students experience and in my experience observing them while teaching.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Now, I want to switch gears here a little bit. I know we&#8217;ve been talking about the work that you&#8217;re doing at Tennessee State. Of course a lot of the work you&#8217;re doing with your students. Did you grow up also in Tennessee?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
I did. I grew up in Nashville and I went to Tennessee state university for undergrad. So that&#8217;s home and Nashville is home.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I would imagine creativity and art were probably a big part of your childhood and your environment growing up.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
You know what, not really. I would say I wasn&#8217;t exposed to a lot of art. My parents were military parents and my dad was in the army. My mom was in the army for a while. It wasn&#8217;t really a very artistic kind of household. I was sort of the oddball in my family in terms of having an interest in that, but it was always supported though. When I did decide to pursue art as a career path, I was lucky that my parents were supportive of that. I know I teach a lot of students who say that their parents are sort of unsure or not supportive of that when they first decide to choose that as a major.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So growing up in Nashville, I&#8217;d imagine Tennessee state was probably just always in your backyard?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah, it was. It was the only college honestly that I even considered going to. When you grew up in Nashville, especially I went to like a black high school and was in the band. So you get used to that, that culture. So we would march in TSU&#8217;s homecoming parades. So it was just always there. I think about this sort of in hindsight sometimes because I didn&#8217;t even know of any art schools back then. When I was thinking about going to college, I just had never heard of like MICA or RISD. They were completely foreign to me. So I think about that too in terms of exposure. I wonder if I would have known what choices I would have made.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny you say that about going to a black high school and sort of being close to another historically black college. So for folks that know that have listened to the show, I grew up in Selma, Alabama and the nearest&#8230; Well, we have a HBCU there. We have Selma University, but it&#8217;s a small college. We don&#8217;t even have a band. Nobody really pays attention to it. But Alabama State University in Montgomery was always like the school that we kind of, I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily say, emulated, but we also would march in their homecoming parade and stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So that whole culture of all of that is just so rich. Oh. See, now you got me thinking about marching band and memories of all of that is so rich. But it&#8217;s interesting though about not really knowing about the possibility. I mean, when did you sort of know that you wanted to study design to go to Tennessee State and to study it?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So I had an art teacher in high school and the class that we were in was called commercial art. I didn&#8217;t know what that meant, but for some reason I really liked the way it sounded. So I used to draw a lot. I didn&#8217;t know anything about computer graphics or what commercial art even meant, but for some reason I really grabbed a hold to that title. So when I was choosing a major, I chose art.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
After the first year or two of studying as a studio art major, I realized that I liked painting and all of that, but I really did not&#8230; I was sort of afraid of pursuing a career as a fine artist. I didn&#8217;t want to have to&#8230; I&#8217;d had this weird vision in my head that I would be standing on the corner trying to sell paintings for a living. I was afraid of that lifestyle and I was just like, &#8220;I need to find something that has like in my mind more stability.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
I was reading a magazine, I think it was like essence magazine or something like that and I came across the titles in the beginning of the magazine and it listed like art director and all these other&#8230; And I thought I don&#8217;t know what an art director is, but that sounds like something that I want to do. So I really clung to that and I started researching like early internet days. I started researching art direction and found the VCU&#8217;s Brandcenter. It was called the Adcenter at the time, but found that program online. And that&#8217;s what took me off in that direction.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. And VCU&#8217;s Brandcenter, I mean is well known, I think internationally well known. We&#8217;ve had another guest on the show, Brandon Viney who also went. I think he grew up in and around Virginia, but he knew about VCU. So certainly their program definitely cranks out people that can perform at a top-notch design level. How was it when you were there?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
It was amazing to be honest. When I discovered the program and I set my sights on going there for grad school, I&#8217;ve sort of like obsessively stalked their website and tried to emulate the work that I saw coming out of that program. When I got accepted and I went, it was all that I was hoping it would be like it was intense and rigorous. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s really meant for&#8230; I mean, I have thoughts now about how it sort of does exclude people who could not go through a program like that because maybe they had to work or had other kind of obligations. But for those of us that were privileged enough to not have other obligations and could do that, I really learned a lot about how to just think and how to solve problems and how to process ideas.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So I feel like although I&#8217;m not working in the ad industry anymore, it definitely has affected every part of my career since then in terms of just me being able to think about things in more of a problem-solving and strategic viewpoint.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I know you interned for JWT for a while and then you worked for several years at Doe-Anderson which is an advertising firm. With that whole experience, how did it sort of bring you back to Tennessee eventually?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
When I worked at Doe-Anderson, I worked there for a couple of years right out of grad school. It was a good experience, but 2008 right when the country was going through a recession, we lost a big client and I got laid off. I was like, &#8220;What? What is happening?&#8221; I had just won some awards and I thought everything was going great and it was one of the early shocks in my career that things could be turbulent and things could not go the way that you think they&#8217;re going to go.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know why I was one of the ones that was let go and honestly, it&#8217;s sort of a side note. I do think that it&#8217;s possible that there was some cultural fit issues. But that&#8217;s what made me move back to Nashville. I thought, &#8220;Okay. Well, I&#8217;m out of work. What do I do?&#8221; And I started freelancing as a graphic designer.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
That was really the first time that I really started to think about my skills as a designer a little bit more seriously than when I was doing the art direction thing. So I got pretty serious about learning craft and investigating typography a bit more and that&#8217;s sort of kind of is what paved the way into me teaching design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, the ad industry though is notorious for being like&#8230; It kind of chews people up and spits people out so that could have been for the best.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah. At the time, it felt really crappy. I was like things happen for a reason and I&#8217;m so happy with&#8230; In hindsight, I&#8217;m happy with the direction that my career has taken since then. But it&#8217;s a tough industry to be in. I mean, so many ups and downs. So many people that I know that still work in the industry that have just been uplifted so many times and moved. I think it&#8217;s great if you have a passion for it, if that&#8217;s your thing and that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re really interested in and that&#8217;s rewarding. But I think my forceful exit was what I needed to refocus on the things that I really care more about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve mentioned you&#8217;ve been teaching for a number of years. We won&#8217;t do the math on that, but how have you seen design education change since you started teaching?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Oh, man. I think that one of the biggest ways is that the conversation surrounding diversity and the canon and decolonizing design. I don&#8217;t know if I was just disengaged or if those conversations just weren&#8217;t really happening when I first started teaching. So that&#8217;s been one of the biggest ways that I&#8217;ve seen a significant shift in terms of pedagogy and just the ways in which we are considering what we&#8217;re teaching to the point where if I do teach things that are traditionally in the canon.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
I make sure that I&#8217;m providing context whereas early in my teaching days, I wasn&#8217;t doing that. So that context might be the reason why we&#8217;re learning about this person is because there are other people that were excluded that could not be a part of this conversation. And the reason why we&#8217;re learning about this particular design style is because other design styles aren&#8217;t in this book at all that we&#8217;re using.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So I see that across the board. It&#8217;s not just something that I&#8217;m doing. There&#8217;s tons of design educators that are revamping curriculum and really trying to respond to some of the changes that we&#8217;ve seen socially over the past few years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. it has really been interesting how&#8230; I didn&#8217;t go to school for design so I can&#8217;t really speak on it from a historical standpoint, but certainly I know since I started doing this podcast back in 2013, it&#8217;s amazing to see how educators have really started to come together not just in, as you say kind of elasticizing the canon or like teaching outside of the canon, but also even coming up with other curriculum or even opening up their class to talk about these sorts of things because students, like you said, you teach at HBCU.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So students are coming with these questions or they&#8217;re coming with these viewpoints and to not shy away from them and to be able to speak to them and place it in a modern context and place in a cultural context. I mean, it&#8217;s amazing just how much that has changed. Really, it feels like within the past maybe 10 years or so, it feels like it&#8217;s really started to grow around that. I&#8217;m seeing it even from mostly white art institutions. I&#8217;m seeing the same thing start to happen. I&#8217;m glad that it&#8217;s starting to take shape in that way.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah. I think that a lot of people recognize the opportunity to make these changes and are feeling some of the responsibility. I think as educators we are certainly sort of on the front lines of reshaping the next generation of designers and the way that they approach design. So I&#8217;m really happy with a lot of the conversations that I&#8217;ve listened to or been a part of even over the past couple of years that are really starting to push things forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I guess the pandemic maybe might have accelerated this a bit, but now you&#8217;ve been seeing more events around this. I remember 2015, Harvard&#8217;s graduate school, they have an African-American student union there and they put together this conference called Black in Design. And the first year that they had it was in 2015. I remember trying to get people that I knew like peers and friends to go like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go. It&#8217;s at Harvard.&#8221; The tickets were less than $100. It was super cheap.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But they were looking at the program and the thing was it was called Black in Design but it wasn&#8217;t digital design. At least for the first year, they have the conference every other year. And for the first year, the theme was around the concept of space like the city, the neighborhood, the region, et cetera. So people are looking at that and I&#8217;m trying to get people to go and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;But they&#8217;re not talking about Photoshop. They&#8217;re not talking about illustrator. Why would I go to a Black in Design Conference when they&#8217;re not talking about digital design?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m like, &#8220;How many black design conferences have you been to in your career? None. Let&#8217;s just go. It&#8217;s cheap. Let&#8217;s just go.&#8221; I&#8217;ve been fortunate to go every year that they&#8217;ve had it. I&#8217;m interested to see how they pull it off this year because I went last in 2019 for their third installment and I want to see how they do it this year. I mean, last year for example and this year as well, there was State of Black Design that went on. There&#8217;s Where are the Black Designers? I&#8217;m seeing even other colleges doing small little designs speaking events and things like that. So it&#8217;s really starting to blossom. It&#8217;s wonderful to see.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah. There&#8217;s been a lot of really great programming. The State of Black Design, the one that you just mentioned with Omari Souza. I mean, incredible. So I love it. I think the more that these types of things pop-up, it&#8217;s just going to further the conversation, get more people involved and engaged and really just recognize that this movement is happening and it&#8217;s not just like a fluke.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
I think when there&#8217;s just like one conference here, maybe some people will catch it, but when it&#8217;s happening over and over and all around us, at some point you can&#8217;t avoid it. So you have to kind of decide whether or not you&#8217;re going to engage in this change, in this movement.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you seen any sort of pushback against it, I&#8217;m curious like from a student standpoint?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Not directly. My students have not pushed back against it. They&#8217;re all about it. They&#8217;re excited to learn about, again, black culture, black history and whatever discipline that comes from whether it&#8217;s in their art history course or whether it&#8217;s in one of my design classes. So not directly with my students. I have seen questions maybe from design educators surrounding how do we engage students who aren&#8217;t interested in this?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So I would imagine at predominantly white institutions where this might seem like it&#8217;s sort of like breaking from the norm of what&#8217;s being taught. There may be more pushback, but I think overall even at predominantly white institutions there&#8217;s a lot of excitement or a lot of recognition that these are important areas. So yeah, I mean overall it&#8217;s going in the right direction.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, that&#8217;s good to hear. That&#8217;s good to hear.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
At least in my experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What would you say your students teach you?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Oh, man. Well, I think just they taught me to be a better professor and to understand context more. They also taught me how to give feedback. I think when I first started teaching one area where I struggled was how do I communicate the things that I would like for them to focus on in a way that they&#8217;ll understand it and in a way that doesn&#8217;t feel subjective and just a personal opinion.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So I had to learn that and I had to sort of read them and read their responses and figure out what was landing and what was not landing. So I certainly have learned that from them just based on the ways in which they respond back to me when we&#8217;re in class. They also have really great ideas. I just sat in on a bunch of meetings today and yesterday where our seniors were presenting their senior thesis projects and they&#8217;re choosing such interesting topics that are sort of blowing my mind.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
One student is interested in fashion and she was addressing ways that the pandemic has changed our outlook on clothing and fashion. Another student was thinking about the ways in which bias and stereotypes can be addressed through animation and cartoon. There&#8217;s all these like topics that they come up with that I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s really interesting.&#8221; I love to see like the way that they&#8217;re processing how to use art and design in those ideas. So I&#8217;m constantly learning from them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s really interesting. I don&#8217;t know. I mean, of course kids now have just so many different experiences that they&#8217;re pulling from especially during this current time. That part about the fashion though, I mean I can just personally attest. I&#8217;m looking at my closet and I want to get rid of everything. I want to adopt like a minimalist capsule wardrobe at this point. I look at my slacks and my suits and stuff, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I want to get rid of all of this.&#8221; Because I haven&#8217;t had to wear them. I haven&#8217;t had to go anywhere with it.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
That&#8217;s exactly what the student was sort of suggesting. We&#8217;re liking this comfort thing. Let&#8217;s get more of that, more yoga pants and sweatshirts. Then even just sort of like this particular project for example. The student was even questioning, &#8220;Are we learning more about sustainability? Are we not comfortable being as flashy anymore?&#8221; So she was just really posing some really interesting thoughtful questions and those are the things that are really refreshing to hear especially from really young designers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That is a great question. Now, that you&#8217;ve mentioned that I&#8217;m just thinking like when I scroll through Instagram, that is exactly what I see. I see so many tie-dyed sweatshirts. I mean, of course there&#8217;s like muted color palettes. There&#8217;s talk about sustainability and organic and all this stuff, but everything is very beige.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
That makes us feel like we&#8217;re being socially conscious because beige is the color of being socially conscious.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ve been talking about design educators kind of touching on that earlier, but there&#8217;s also been this kind of pretty regular conversation in the design community around maybe the lack of black design educators. What do you think contributes to that?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
I just think that we&#8217;re underrepresented across the board in the industry. In design and in education, higher education, and the end of higher education, I mean most accredited&#8230; Well, I guess depending on if your state school or how your funding works, you have to have a terminal degree to work as a college educator. So that&#8217;s the MFA in most cases. So that already pushes a lot of people out of the possibility of pursuing this.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
I know a ton of amazing black designers that went to college for it and would be incredible, but like a lot of other designers, they&#8217;re working. They&#8217;re doing their practice and so they didn&#8217;t go and get that MFA teaching degree. So that&#8217;s one of the ways that I see that it&#8217;s limiting because it begins to be really expensive. Obviously, the more education you&#8217;re pursuing. So those advanced degrees you&#8217;re having to decide on do I want to get student loan debt? Is this worth it? Is the college teaching job going to sort of offset the cost of all of this?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s a really big consideration depending on who you are and where you&#8217;re from and what sort of like&#8230; Maybe even generational wealth you might or may not have. So I think that can contribute to the lack of diversity in education in general, higher education in general. But then even as designers, there&#8217;s just so few still, so few black designers working in the space that it just gets narrowed even further when you add in another criteria. So it&#8217;s black designer and educator. The numbers just get real slim. So, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I could see that. I mean, I think visibility is sort of one part of that as you mentioned. You just don&#8217;t really see that many. Although now, I think you&#8217;re seeing more and more with these events and speaking and things like that. But also I wonder if students as they&#8217;re learning, are they also being enlightened about going into design education as well?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah. Probably not as much as we should. Actually, just before joining this call with you, I was listening to Jacinda Walker do a presentation about the work that she&#8217;s doing and she pointed out that there are, I think 300 and something black design educators across the country. That&#8217;s a really tiny number and she actually just mentioned something about to your point, we sort of need to do a better job of advocating for our career and talking about it and communicating to younger students what it is that we do and some of the things that we enjoy about this.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
I think that there&#8217;s still, I guess, a little bit of a misconception in terms of what teachers do. A lot of people, I think there&#8217;s still a little bit of that idea of like if you&#8217;re&#8230; What is it saying? If you&#8217;re good, you do and if you&#8217;re not, you teach.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. Like those who can do and those who can&#8217;t teach.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah. So I think that can sometimes, the mindset of a lot of creatives. So if you&#8217;re in a creative field, you really do have that itch inside of you to do the work, right? You want to practice. So teaching feels like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not going to be able to do the work. I&#8217;m going to be in this box where I&#8217;m not really practicing.&#8221; But what I would love for people to know is like when you&#8217;re working in higher education as a professor, research component that a lot of us are asked to do allows for us to grow our practice and really do a lot of personal projects that we wouldn&#8217;t otherwise be able to do if you&#8217;re working in the industry. So I&#8217;ve seen my personal work grow since being an educator.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now is that sort of how you came across doing the book?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Extra Bold?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was trying to give you a good segue into it.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Well, yes. I actually met Ellen Lupton. She came to Nashville, I think it was 2019 and she was AIGA Nashville. I served on the board for AIGA Nashville and we hosted her. she was actually doing a presentation for one of the really early iterations of the book before it took the shape that it is now. We took her to dinner. The board of directors for AIGA Nashville took her to dinner and we sort of chatted and just touched base and kind of do what you do when you&#8217;re at dinner.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
She followed up and asked a few questions. Then eventually I was going to be a contributor for a small part of the book along with so many other amazing contributors. That was where it was for a while and then I got an email last year sometime from her where she invited me and to be a co-author and do some more writing in the book. So that&#8217;s how that took shape.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s been amazing to be a part of that collaborative project. And what I love really most about that book in particular is that it involves so many different voices and perspectives and narratives. You hear from people like me who I don&#8217;t think typically has this sort of platform. So I love it. I feel like I&#8217;m learning so much from the other co-authors and the other contributors in the book.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, when does the book come out?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So Extra Bold will be released on May 11th, and so really soon. It feels like it&#8217;s been in the works for quite a while now, but just a couple more weeks. At least from the time we&#8217;re recording the podcast. I don&#8217;t know when it&#8217;ll be released, but May 11 is when the books will be on the shelves.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah. So I&#8217;m excited about that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. By the time this airs it&#8217;ll be out.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Oh, good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah. So that&#8217;s exciting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So about your work with AIGA Nashville on the board, what is it like sort of serving a chapter that&#8217;s in a city like Nashville? I&#8217;ve had other people from Nashville on the show before and even other people from Tennessee, but I don&#8217;t know if people might think of Nashville as being a really sort of design hub or a design city of any sort.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah. Nashville, we&#8217;re known for our music, country music. But we do have a pretty good design community in Nashville. What&#8217;s really interesting about the board and what I love about AIGA&#8217;s national board is it&#8217;s extremely diverse, much more diverse than the industry is. We have maybe 50% black designers and lots of women designers. It&#8217;s just a very welcoming kind of place and community to be a part of. It was really the first organization that I took on any sort of a leadership role. I was the director of education for a while and then I transitioned over into being the director of diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
And just by being involved, I have met so many other like wonderful designers. I didn&#8217;t realize that I was missing out. I think that naturally a lot of artists, designer types are kind of in our own little like circles or worlds. When I joined the board, it sort of forced me to grow and be a part of the larger like Nashville design community. And I certainly feel like I&#8217;ve benefited from doing that. I love just being a part of the events and figuring out content that will service the community there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are some upcoming events and things that you all are planning to do this year?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Well, we always participate in Nashville Design Week. So we&#8217;re brainstorming some ideas for that. It&#8217;s not released yet, but we typically invite in some inspiring guest speakers. Last year, we did a panel with Mitzi Okou from the Where are the Black Designers conference and Forest Young, and Bobby C. Martin. We just had an amazing conversation about the experience that they&#8217;ve had working as black designers in the field.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
This year will hopefully be like a continuation of those types of conversations. We also do a lot of programming. I don&#8217;t serve in the educator role anymore on the board, but we do a lot of programming for students. So we do a lot of like portfolio reviews and meetups for students. So that&#8217;s always fun to help them get their foot in the door.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I kind of want to switch gears here again. We&#8217;ve been focusing again a lot on your work and the things that you&#8217;re doing, but I&#8217;m curious what is it that sort of keeps you motivated and inspired to really continue this work?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
The more that I work and the more that my work sort of shifts, I really want people to feel seen and I want to value the different experiences that black and minority designers have in this industry. So that might be again looking at the ways in which there might be some differences in the ways that the portfolios from an HBCU might look versus again a predominantly wide institution and advocating for us to remove bias in our review practices.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So it motivates me to talk about that and to share students work and students experience. And it motivates me to continue to have conversations about just diversity and design in general and sort of like the implications of the lack of diversity on our experience when we&#8217;re working as designers, how does that affect our confidence? How does that affect our mental health? How does it feel to be the only black designer in a creative department? Similar to when I was working at the ad agency and sort of it motivates me to talk about that so that other young designers who are black and are in those situations can feel seen, feel understood and sort of recognize that they&#8217;re not doing anything wrong. It might just be the industry needs to catch up to fully appreciate their point of view.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you want to accomplish this year?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Aside from launching the book, I should say.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a big one. But I want to actually write more, but I really would love to find a way to connect my illustration interest with design. I feel like right now they&#8217;re still living very separate lives. I do a lot of like illustration work and portrait drawings and things, but also obviously, I have a really big passion for design and writing. So one thing I&#8217;d love to do is find a way where they can sort of&#8230; Like these things can co-exist. So I do a lot of experimentation and I&#8217;m trying to figure that out. So I&#8217;ll feel really satisfied if I can get to some sort of a solution on that. And especially if it continues to elevate black voices and experiences.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
I was serving like I said as the interim chair. So the next year I&#8217;ll be the chair of the department. I think I&#8217;d like to be still in that position in five years. So that&#8217;s a lot of administrative work for the department. But what that looks like for me is like revamping curriculum and thinking about ways to get more of our students working in art and design spaces and facilitating that experience for them. So again, changing curriculum, getting them connected to mentors in the industry and just doing all of that sort of work on behalf of the students that I teach, but more from an administrative role and capacity.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s where I see a lot of my time being spent. I would also love to do illustration work for some&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I want to take it away from just sort of something I&#8217;m doing on the side and maybe do more commission work in that space.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have like a dream client or a dream project that you&#8217;d want to do?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Sort of. There&#8217;s not a specific client. I think that I would just&#8230; I sort of believe that if I continue to work on my craft and then refine it, that whatever&#8217;s meant to happen will happen and that right opportunity or that right client will find its way to me. So we&#8217;ll see. I would love to do some sort of partnership. But I don&#8217;t know what that exactly looks like. I&#8217;m really open to wherever that goes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So I am on all the social media channels on Instagram @kaleenasales. On Twitter @kaleena_sales. I think that&#8217;s right. And I&#8217;m on LinkedIn. I would love to connect on LinkedIn to whoever would like to connect and stay in touch that way. I&#8217;m on social media. My website is kalinasales.design, if you just want to kind of check that out and read a little bit more about what I&#8217;m up to there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. And we&#8217;ll also put a link to the book in the show notes.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yay. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Kaleena Sales, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you for really helping to teach the next generation of designers. I mean, it floored me the first time when I heard a teacher tell me that they actually use this podcast in their class because for people to know, I do this at home in my bedroom. And the fact that it has this kind of reach where I know educators are teaching it around the world, I think also speaks to this greater elasticization of the canon that you&#8217;re speaking about. I&#8217;m just glad that you&#8217;re there to help really guide and shepherd the next generation, and also keep them true to their cultural identity as they do it. That is super important. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>

<p>I spoke to Joseph fresh from his move back to New Orleans, and he spoke on how the city feels now in the midst of gentrification and other new developments. We also spoke on his work with The Black School and the school&#8217;s principles, the unique studio model that helps fund the school, and how he works to center Black love in such a unique learning space. Joseph is truly building upon a family legacy to help educate the next generation and beyond!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
My name is Joseph Cuillier and I&#8217;m an artist, a designer, and the founder and co-director of The Black School.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How are you holding up these days?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Good. I am good. I just recently moved from New York City. I lived in Harlem for about five years, and Brooklyn before that for about five years. I just moved to new Orleans after 10 years in New York, and I think I&#8217;m much better because of it for a lot of reasons. There&#8217;s been a pandemic and people have been trapped in small apartments, in cold climates, and it&#8217;s good to get away from that. It&#8217;s good to be closer to family, I see my family a lot even though I lived in a different part of the country from them. I would come home holidays and summers, and that was difficult not being able to see my family. Being closer makes it so much easier. And trees and sunshine man, that&#8217;s a long way. That&#8217;s long way, and good food, and good people, and good music. Everything that makes New Orleans great is healing me at the moment, at this traumatic moment for all of us.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I want to go to new Orleans so bad.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Come through and let me know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I will as soon as all this pandemic mess is over, and I feel comfortable jumping on a plane I want to go to New Orleans.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Yeah. Hopefully sooner than later.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know you&#8217;ve been away for 10 years, but does the city feel different to you now?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
It is very different. To be clear, I moved to New York from Houston. I was living in Houston at the time, but both sides of my family are from new Orleans so I would always be here. Holidays, summers, things like that or whenever, a birthday party, it&#8217;s family reunion, just to come down and see family. I think new Orleans is going through a lot of the things a lot of black cities and black communities around the country are going through. There&#8217;s gentrification, there&#8217;s new things happening in this city for better or worse. And I think a lot of people feel frustrated because they&#8217;re not being included in the decision-making of the new thing.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Or the new thing is coming and that means you have to leave which is messed up. There&#8217;s a lot of displacement in New Orleans, and in a way it&#8217;s a little bit more kind of celebrated due to the aftermath of Katrina, and the displacement that man-made disaster created. It is very different but in a lot of ways it&#8217;s still the same. There the blackness, there&#8217;s deep love, there&#8217;s deep creativity that is just baked into the city that I don&#8217;t think gentrification is strong enough to ever change that. Natural disaster or anything I don&#8217;t think is strong enough to change that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has it been kind of working and moving through this pandemic? Was that a loaded question?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a layered question. A layered question. What does that mean to me as a husband and a father? What does that mean to me as a designer or an artist? What does that mean to me as a person that creates platforms? A person that brings people together to exchange knowledge? First it&#8217;s been difficult but not insurmountable. Our family, we found ways to make the best of it. We found ways to still have romance between me and my wife. We have our indoor dates or our out in the park dates. We found ways to meet with folks, meet up at the park, chill on the porch, chill at the patio, things like that. And as a kind of artists and designer it&#8217;s been a shift. For me it&#8217;s been less about making work and showing work and more about purpose, more about spirituality, more about laying foundations.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
And before the pandemic we were rolling, I talk in the we because I don&#8217;t do this work alone. My wife is my partner in life and in our endeavors, our ventures in the world. Shani Peters, she&#8217;s an artist very much in her own right doing really big things. And also just the work I do is very collective, I bring people together to work on issues and problems much larger than one person could address or transform. This slow down gave us the opportunity to refocus and think about the long-term vision for the work. The Black School was in New York, it was functioning as this kind of school that was mobile in architecture, so we would attach ourselves to host other schools, would be high schools, middle schools, youth organizations, art institutions, and we would do programming and collaboration.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
And now we couldn&#8217;t really do that, we couldn&#8217;t get people together. I mean we shifted some stuff to Zoom, but it&#8217;s only so much that could shift and keep going the way the world was turning. We shifted to thinking about where we wanted to take the organization. After all these years of programmatic success doing the art school, doing The Black Love Fest, doing the design apprenticeship, we felt like we really needed a space of our own. That meant sharing that idea with the people and be like, &#8220;What do you think? Is this something you would support?&#8221; The response we got was overwhelming yes. Folks came out of the woodwork, we ended up raising 300K to build the community center in my hometown of New Orleans. We&#8217;ve raised money for staffing the school, we&#8217;ve made all these connections of people who want to support in any way they can.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Long answer, the shift, the slowing down, the re-jiggering we had to do to work in this moment meant that we had to do some deep thinking, and some deep listening, and have some deep conversations to really think about, &#8220;We&#8217;re standing still, how do we see the future? How do we want to see the future?&#8221; Because we have a moment now to really think about the future. And for us that meant moving to New Orleans and trying to build a school, trying to build a radical black art school in the Seventh Ward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s jump more into The Black School, because I&#8217;ve been hearing about it for years now from different folks who I&#8217;ve had on the show. I was a mentor at&#8230; Well, I guess you could call it the mentor. I don&#8217;t know. I think they called it mentorship at NEW INC in New York City. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s where I first heard about it, but I definitely heard about it during my time kind of mentoring and helping advise folks there. I really want to learn more about in essence what this radical black art school is all about. For those who are listening who may not know, can you just talk a little bit about the school and its mission? And we can sort of dive in from there.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
The Black School is an experimental art school that teaches young folks and old folks black history, design, activism. And the idea is radicalizing our people to envision a future where we&#8217;re not just tolerated, but a future that we create, that we build with our own hands so it&#8217;s a radical black art school.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now there&#8217;s a lot of different principles that the school follows, among them self-love, prison abolition, environmental justice, LGBTQIA rights. How are these principles reflected to students?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Well, the principles were developed by students. The first workshop we did was we did this community engaged research. This high school in Brooklyn, we went around the surrounding area and within the school. And we asked folks what you love about your community? What you want to change about your community? And what The Black School should teach? And based off of that feedback we got from folks we did this principle, this platform creating exercise, where we just went through the things, the issues, the ideas that folks are raising. And then we distilled them down into these overarching principles. And we&#8217;ve continued to add as we go, especially looking back to ancestors, the history, the things that were laid down for us before we even got here. And we took those kind of principles and built this larger kind of I guess rubric to learn from.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
And that includes self-love, it includes black love more specifically, and includes all the guiding principles of many different black radical organizations. We took inspiration from all these different ways black radicalism has popped up through feminist initiatives, queer initiatives, art movements. And that&#8217;s kind of how we came up with the principles, and we share those back in our card deck, we share them back in our website, we share them back in the topics that we explore in the school. Maybe a workshop will be based on this one principle or these two principles. We are making sure our young people know what we stand for, know something that possibly they can stand for, and are aware of a political language to describe the experiences that are happening in the world.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
They may see white folks from out of town moving into their grandmother neighborhood, they may see the cost of living in their neighborhood going up, they may see the bodega start to sell different things, but they may not know what gentrification is. And they may not know the history or the tactics that folks have used in the past to fight those issues. It&#8217;s our idea that we create learning tools, and learning opportunities to share that back with folks so they can know what to do, so they can know that they don&#8217;t have to recreate the wheel every time they see a problem. They can just build on what&#8217;s already beneath them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now the interesting part about the school is that it also contains a design studio, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Yeah. The Black School studio is full service design firm. We do client work. I&#8217;m traditionally trained as a graphic designer. It was a matter of seeing the teaching that I&#8217;m doing. Since I graduated that&#8217;s not just something I do on the side, but at the center of my practice. And the studio allows me to do that to the greater extent. We do client services, we have experienced upper level designers, but we also have apprentice. And the design apprentice are young folks, high school age who have no experience in graphic design. We teach them the basics, the fundamentals of graphic design, typography, image making, grids, all of those fundamental things. And then we teach them Photoshop, Illustrator InDesign. And then once they know just those basics, then we put them on actual client projects so that they&#8217;re learning on the job from seasoned designers.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
And we&#8217;re collectively creating too, because I mean what company doesn&#8217;t buy and sale, or trade on black cool? What company doesn&#8217;t use black youth culture to move their message forward or sell their products? It&#8217;s our idea that instead of having all these people coming into our community take the things we create and sell them back to us, how about we talk to our community? How about we communicate with each other in the ways we know how? And how about we harness the power and energy of black youth culture, a culture that has made it all around the globe and back? And right now black youth culture is the culture, so how about we harness that power? And that&#8217;s the idea, that&#8217;s the vision behind the design school being rooted in a school&#8230; I mean, that&#8217;s the vision behind the design firm being rooted in a black school.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And how do the studio and the school work together? Does the studio help fund the school or what are some ways that they work together?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the vision. When you&#8217;re doing this type of work it becomes very easy to become very reliant on grants, donations. And that may be fine but what happens when funding trends change? Right now black people and black liberation is kind of a hot topic but 10 years ago it wasn&#8217;t, we were in a post-racial society. What if we go back to a post racial society quote unquote, and these foundations start funding other causes, other issues more aggressively. I mean is what we&#8217;re doing really self-determined? If that&#8217;s the case, in my opinion the answer is no. Not to say the money we get from foundations isn&#8217;t cool, that&#8217;s our money, that&#8217;s the money, the wealth our great grandparents have generated for this country. But being realistic we need our own.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
I believe in black nationalism. I think we need our own everything, but we definitely need our own sources of revenue if we&#8217;re going to run a sustainable organization. The idea from the design firm is the design firm can generate income, earn income and fund the school. Now it&#8217;s two years old so we&#8217;re not there yet. We&#8217;re still kind of trying to figure out how it works, how it functions but that&#8217;s the idea. But the school and the design firm they&#8217;re kind of tied together. And we have students from the art school that come through the design firm. Students that show a little bit more interest, students that maybe want to learn more about graphic design specifically, students that may need opportunity to make some money, need a job, or a seasonal job or something.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
This is our way of generating income for our community. Because it would be irresponsible to go to black youth and be like, &#8220;There&#8217;s economic future for you in art.&#8221; Because honestly I&#8217;m a professional artist, my wife&#8217;s a professional artist, and it&#8217;s hard to make money out of art. It&#8217;s hard for us. We do all these other things and generate income in all these other ways, so I wouldn&#8217;t feel comfortable setting some young people that come from disadvantaged backgrounds, that are economically oppressed. I would be irresponsible to tell them, &#8220;You know what, you can make a living in art.&#8221; I mean you can, but I need to give you the tools, I need to give you the map, and the pathways that I found to make a living in art. And design is one of those pathways.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. I mean, that makes sense, you want to definitely&#8230; Especially with kids at that age, they see a lot more than I think we think they do in terms of picking up on patterns and behaviors and stuff like that. And it is one thing to say, &#8220;We&#8217;re the black school and we want to do these things.&#8221; But then also&#8230; Or even as you&#8217;re saying, making money as an artist but then having to do these other things. You don&#8217;t want to lie to them essentially.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Yeah. I don&#8217;t want to send them out in the world unprepared like what we call real art schools do. Sending their students out in the world without necessarily the tools to do the most basic of things, sustain their lives. It wouldn&#8217;t be a radically black art school, it would be just an art school if we did that. We do pay our students. It&#8217;s a very different way of looking at schools. We pay our students to learn because we believe our students need it. If you&#8217;re not flipping burgers or stacking grocery sales, how are you going to generate income for yourself, for your household, if we&#8217;re asking you to come spend this time with us learn about black politics, learn about home design, learn about the nexus, where they meet. We have to be realistic about what the needs are of our young people while they are in our care.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then this might&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, this might be a silly question. I think basing some of this off of my personal experience, but as you&#8217;ve been doing this have you been getting a lot of black community support financially?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Yeah. We did a crowdfunding campaign to go fund me. I mean, everybody supported, black, white, Asian, Latinx. Everybody supported, saw the vision, but a lot of our support was from black folks. Monetarily, just connections we made. The black folks at Adobe reached out, folks that work there. We found ourselves in very different places, and we find ourselves with a lot of resources that the story being told about us is like we all come from a lack. But there is a lot of resources in our community. [inaudible 00:25:25] showed up with those resources, made what we do even possible. If it wasn&#8217;t for the black community there would be no Black School.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, as we&#8217;re recording this, and it&#8217;s interesting because we were supposed to do this a while back. And I know you were moving and everything, had a bunch of stuff kind of going on. But I had written back then&#8230; And just so people who are listening, this was&#8230; When was this? About the fall last year I think we were supposed to record initially?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I wrote down about how several major cities in the US have been protesting against the death of black people at the hands of police. Fast forward to now, same thing. And then you of course have all these companies that are committing themselves to at least saying black lives matter. Although it&#8217;s now been shortened out to BLM and I feel some kind of way about that, how quickly people just sort of roll it off the tongue. How are you talking about these things at the school?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
That&#8217;s funny that you say it because there is this linguistic activism, insane black lives matter. I never thought about that, shortening it to BLM defeats the point. But you&#8217;re right, you got something there. But I&#8217;m sorry I was distracted by what you just put on me there genuinely. Say again the end of your question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. How are you talking about what&#8217;s happening now? I guess I could say two black people, but there&#8217;s a lot of shit happening to black people right now. But I&#8217;m speaking specifically about people protesting against the death of black people at the hands of police, companies that are now kind of coming on and giving their support and saying that they support black lives even if it&#8217;s just for show. How are you talking about these sort of metacultural thing at the school?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
How are we talking about it? It&#8217;s hard for me to say specifically to this moment, but generally it&#8217;s been a while now that the light bulb came on for me. And I realized that history is a cycle, and you say from fall to now we&#8217;re in spring, this cycle has turned over once more. And our folks are in the street, and companies are pandering pretty much to the movement the same way it happened this past summer. This happened when I graduated from Pratt around the same time while I was at school. I was in graduate school for design and Trayvon happened and it was there&#8230; It wasn&#8217;t there that happened. Everything that&#8217;s happening now has happened to a lesser extent. It&#8217;s more intense now but it was happening. Then Eric Garner happened a couple of years later.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Well, I&#8217;m referencing George Zimmerman getting off, because that was a moment for me because I didn&#8217;t see him getting off. If I&#8217;d only looked at history, of course he was getting off. There was no way he was going to jail if I looked at history. But we get into these moments where we just forget about history, everything&#8217;s out of the window, we live in a new world. But history tells us this cycle of black people being brutalized comes to a boiling point and black folks said, &#8220;No more.&#8221; And white folks say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s figure this out, let&#8217;s make this right.&#8221; Then time passes, white folks stop caring, black folks continue to be brutalized, boom cycle continues. That&#8217;s why The Black School exists, to be 365 know.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Every day of the year to yell that we need our own. How many times are white folks going to have to tell us no before we realize the answer is no. You want your freedom, you want your justice, you want economic opportunities, the answer has always been no. We ask they say no, we ask they say no, we ask they say no. And the cycle happens where the no&#8217;s are replaced to, &#8220;Maybe.&#8221; The no&#8217;s are replaced with, &#8220;Okay. Give us some time.&#8221; The no&#8217;s are replaced to, &#8220;Later.&#8221; But always behind all of that facade it&#8217;s always no. This moment still weighs heavy on my shoulders, it&#8217;s not like it doesn&#8217;t affect me anymore. But I know that this is just a cycle, I know they&#8217;re not going to stop killing us.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
I just know it and it&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m a psychic, history tells me. 400 years in this country tell me, if I opened up the books they wrote it&#8217;s going to tell me. I just got to take that note and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to build with my people. And my vision and what I would love to see in the world is a black nation for Black Americans.&#8221; Of course there&#8217;s a lot of black nations in this world, but a nation for Black Americans, that&#8217;s my goal. And if that&#8217;s not the answer, cool, but that&#8217;s the direction I&#8217;m walking in. We need all of it, it needs to be ours. What that looks like I don&#8217;t know, but we need our own.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does it look like to center black love in a learning space?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
I think it looks like we all have seen it in our own experience. Maybe it&#8217;s learning from your mother over the kitchen table, or maybe it&#8217;s learning from a grandfather out in the garage and the driveway. There&#8217;s all these ways we learn in our community that are rooting in love, and rooting in care, and rotting in blackness. I think we can look to that, go back to history, we look at our personal histories and what kind of learning spaces felt loving, and felt effective? What kind of learning spaces worked for me? You&#8217;ll probably think of your living room, you&#8217;ll probably think of your kitchen, you&#8217;ll probably think of your backyard. That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re taking inspiration for the architecture of the school. Whether that be bricks or just how we&#8217;re structuring the curriculum, how we&#8217;re exchanging when we&#8217;re in this space, how we&#8217;re talking to each other, how we&#8217;re laying out the desks.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
We don&#8217;t even have desks, because when I think about the ways I like to learn it wasn&#8217;t in the desks. It was maybe over a work table, maybe it was an artist studio and it was over a work table, maybe it was in a circle on the floor. It&#8217;s all these other ways that are not being showed or even explored in the conventional school. One way is asking folks what they want to learn, not walking into a space with any assumptions. Before we start a workshop we ask our students what you love about your community? What you want to change about your community? And we may show up with screen printing supplies, or collage materials, we may show up with part of the workshop. But the rest of it, what we&#8217;re making, why we&#8217;re making it, who we&#8217;re making it for, that comes from the students.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
We are sharing the skills we have and the resources we&#8217;ve been able to generate and acquire, but it is an exchange. They are sharing their experiences, they&#8217;re sharing their needs, they&#8217;re sharing their passions, and that&#8217;s the learning community. It goes both ways, it&#8217;s not a teacher at the front, students lined up at the back. They are empty vessels, I have the knowledge, I put the knowledge into the empty vessels, they go out into the world [inaudible 00:34:30] repeat. It&#8217;s not like that. It&#8217;s really about you know about this very specific thing in the world, I know about this other very specific thing in the world, let&#8217;s put it together and what could we build?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now there&#8217;s a third part to The Black School. I know we talked about the actual school itself, we&#8217;ve also talked about the studio. There&#8217;s this sort of third component to the ecosystem which is events. How have you been able to keep that going even with this sort of pandemic that&#8217;s keeping people apart?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
We haven&#8217;t kept it going. We have done workshops which is events, but specifically Black Love Fest, our music festival we do, we just paused it. Right now it&#8217;s going on the second year. We do it every summer, so last summer we didn&#8217;t do, this summer we&#8217;re not doing it. When it comes back it will be in collaboration with the New Orleans African American museum so it will be in New Orleans. The past three years it was in New York city two years, and then Houston at Project Row Houses.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
If you&#8217;re into the black school and the work we do check out Project Row Houses if you haven&#8217;t already, because they are the precedence that we&#8217;re working off. They&#8217;re the antecedent, they are the ancestors when we&#8217;re talking about ancestors that have done it, are still doing it. We essentially paused it, which was needed, we were tired anyway before the pandemic even came. And there&#8217;s no sense in getting people together and potentially hurting the people that the whole intention of the festival is to care for our people. It would just be a contradiction. And honestly I&#8217;m Zoomed out. I&#8217;m Zoned out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hear you.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
No more Zoom so we&#8217;re not doing a Zoom festival. I don&#8217;t think the intention behind the festival would even translate to Zoom. The intention is a barbecue, a cookout with some guiding principles behind it that we&#8217;ve talked about already. We can&#8217;t recreate everything in the digital space, we can&#8217;t create the real barbecue that we&#8217;re trying to create in a virtual space. It just makes sense to pause it, again do some deep listening, some deep thinking, some deep compensation. And then bring it back when we&#8217;re ready, when the world is ready for it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, when we started doing&#8230; Or we were going to do a live tour in 2020 with Revision Path. I had been talking to a couple of AIGA chapters, and we had started the tour. I started in February in LA, did a show out there in Leimert Park with a local architect. It was great, standing room only. And when we&#8217;ve done past events&#8230; And I get what you&#8217;re saying, it&#8217;s the actual space itself that becomes this crucible for fellowship that you just can&#8217;t recreate over a Zoom call. Even when we&#8217;ve done events in New York, we&#8217;ve done events here in Atlanta. And for me the best thing about the event is when it ends, and people are still staying around talking for an hour, hour and a half, the venue-</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Stacking up their plate metaphorically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; Right. The venue&#8217;s kicked us out, we&#8217;re standing outside and folks are like, &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s go to a bar and keep talking, or let&#8217;s go to a restaurant or something.&#8221; That kind of fellowship you just can&#8217;t do the same thing over Zoom. When the lockdown sort of first started happening and the chapters were getting back to me like, &#8220;Oh, well we can do a Zoom call and we can do this.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do that. I&#8217;m already Zooming enough for work and I don&#8217;t want to have to try to do the same thing over Zoom.&#8221; One, because it&#8217;s just not the same. What I think the audience gets out of it aside from listening to the people, is to actually meet up with other black creatives in their city that they may not even know about. The fact that the event exists means that people are coming to it, and without that actual physical event then it&#8217;s just not the same.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Yeah. There&#8217;s a lot of things the internet can do, what you&#8217;re describing ain&#8217;t one of them. We haven&#8217;t figured that out yet with the internet. I think the intention is to love up on each other, the vision is to create this movement that will get us to where we need to go. When we&#8217;re doing the festival in Project Row Houses, Fox News actually came by. The local Fox chapter not the Fox News, but the local Fox station came by. And they asked me, &#8220;What is this about? What are you doing?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;This is a movement. The purpose of this is to start a movement for black love, and to center black love at the center of what this country is.&#8221; Don&#8217;t we deserve it? Don&#8217;t we deserve to not just be tolerated, but to be loved after all we&#8217;ve done to literally build this country, to expand the freedoms and the rights of this country, to fight for them, die for them.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
I mean I was a little more and more crass. I was like, &#8220;The intention is for America to pay reparation, and dissolve, and reconstitute under black love.&#8221; I told Fox News that, they did not air it but that&#8217;s at the heart of what we&#8217;re trying to do. And we&#8217;re using the vessel that is the cookout, that is the street art, the public art, that&#8217;s some part of our culture, that is the performative nature. You dress up, we sing, we dance, we do all of these things that is just natural to our way of being, our blackness. And I think that it&#8217;s worth the wait, if it takes two years for the pandemic to subside it&#8217;s worth the wait. So we&#8217;re just going to wait.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now kind of switching gears here a bit from the school which we&#8217;ve talked about for a good while now. You mentioned being in NYC, but you&#8217;re originally kind of between Louisiana and Texas. You kind of mentioned you kind of went back and forth a bit. Being in that sort of part of the South, I&#8217;m pretty sure art, music, and design were kind of a big part of your growing up, right?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Yeah, for sure. I mean, it didn&#8217;t look like graphic design or fine art, but it&#8217;s definitely been with me since day one. The story I tell growing up in Baton Rouge, where I went to elementary and middle school. And my family we would go to Southern University football games, and it&#8217;s a HBCU so we had tailgate. All day before the actual game in the evening, we would barbecue or have a seafood boil. And this was every weekend which is crazy. The amount of food that we would buy, cook, eat with people, it&#8217;s crazy that we did this every weekend. I&#8217;m realizing that as I&#8217;m been growing up, and I am doing seafood boils now, I&#8217;m hosting them or I&#8217;m hosting a barbecue. But the funny moment that I always remember is maybe the week before the season started, my mom came home with a handful of clothes like the Polo&#8217;s and the Tommy&#8217;s. The things we were wearing at the time. And the other brands like the Sean John, and all that, and the FUBU.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
And it was such a moment of joy. I can see now that I was being brought up and cultivated into fashion design. I was being made a connoisseur of design. That may have been the intention consciously, or maybe an intention subconsciously, to have just a big stack of fresh clothes just thrown on my bed like, &#8220;Here, now you&#8217;re set for the whole season.&#8221; And as long as I can remember I&#8217;ve loved fashion, I&#8217;ve loved clothes, and I think that kind of introduced me to design. But when it came time for me to figure out what do I want to make myself as opposed to not just being a connoisseur but a creator. And I tried fashion, I tried street art, I tried a lot of different things, but graphic design was the thing that I don&#8217;t know, just came the most natural to me. And learning about it, learning the history of it, it was fascinating to read about the Bauhaus, read about the International Style, read about the shifts that were happening in art and design in a world that was creating these new ways of thinking, and these new ways of making.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
And technology too, also being so [cordially 00:44:20] in term with it. And that kind of put me to graphic design to study that. But even with that, the medium, the form making was interesting to me, but I think of myself as the designer that doesn&#8217;t really care about design. I know about the Bauhaus, I&#8217;ve been to the Bauhaus, I&#8217;ve been invited to the Bauhaus but I don&#8217;t care anymore. At the time I did, but right now I&#8217;m way more interested in learning about Orishas. I&#8217;m way more interested in learning about my family history, and how that relates to New Orleans. I&#8217;m way more interested in learning about black radical politics. The work I do is me just taking those ways of making and those ways of seeing, and just imply my interest to it. And as a result I think I look a bit different than most designers. Like my career, the things that I make, the things I put out and produce with these skills, in a lot of cases may not even look like design, period.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
But I think that&#8217;s my approach and it comes from those early influences, those early cultivations that my family placed on me. I come from a line of educators. My grandfather Joseph Cuillier, Sr, has a school named after him in New Orleans on the West Bank. There&#8217;s reasons for me to approach art and design from the lens of a educator. And it was kind of put into me before I even realized it was there, it&#8217;s been there. Growing up in Houston, being around Project Row Houses at the time that I was discovering fine art, it kind of put in pressure in my head like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s fine art.&#8221; I learned about fine art in a city that took a very different approach to art. Thanks to the folks that Project Row, and Rick Lowe, and all the artists, and collectives that came together to create their vision. To be clear, Project Row Houses is a organization that started from this artists being challenged by young people in his community.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
They came to the studio, the folks from a local high school, and they saw what he was painting and they were like, &#8220;We don&#8217;t need you to paint about issues happening in our community. We know the issues. Who is this for because it&#8217;s not for us. You&#8217;re a creative person, how about you do something about it? How about you use your creativity and try to apply that to the issues and see if you could get some moving and shaking.&#8221; To have that down the street while I&#8217;m in college, and I&#8217;m just starting to go to galleries, and just starting to go to art spaces, it kind of made me think, &#8220;Oh, this is fine art.&#8221; When really it&#8217;s this ghetto eyes pushed it aside version of fine art that hasn&#8217;t really been supported in the same ways like an object maker is supported in the fine art world. Someone who makes paintings and sculptures. Long story long, the way I came up and where I came up has everything to do with the type of artist, the type of designer I am and I&#8217;m grateful for it. I couldn&#8217;t imagine doing it any other way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. There&#8217;s been this thing that&#8217;s been going around lately around this concept of decolonizing design, where I think the notion is that you&#8217;re sort of introducing different sort of design cultures or things. It&#8217;s a person&#8217;s teaching practice or design practice in order to break them out of particular I would say just Eurocentric design sort of standpoint. Would you say that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish with The Black School? Is something similar to that?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Yes. And I&#8217;m just trying to decolonize not even in a metaphorical sense. I&#8217;m literally trying not to be a colony anymore. My wife was talking on this call and she was talking, and it was a group of folks from around the world. I don&#8217;t remember the country. Or I would&#8217;ve know the callers to even know the country. But it was an African sister and she was saying that decolonization has nothing to do with America. Africa we were colonized, what y&#8217;all got over there is something different. But really the opposite is true. I mean, not the opposite but we are still a colony. The colony never ended, we never decolonized. I feel like design, the tools we have to transform are tools that we can use to just de-colonize, period.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
I do believe decolonizing design is a part of that. We got to learn about the contributions of black folks to the design discipline. But we also have to learn about the contributions of black folks, period. We got to learn about the contributions of black folks to revolutionary thought. We&#8217;ve got to learn about the contributions of black folks to cultivating land, to building economic engine systems. And I think that will help you as a designer of course, but I think it will help us to the eventual goal is liberation, freedom, justice, these bigger ideas. Because I think design has that power. I have a deep faith in art and design, not the art world or the design world, but the actual mechanisms, methodologies, the act of creation.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
I think we can not only make it look sexy as far as revolution. I think we can make it look good because we have the skills to do that, but I also think we can do it if we use design in ways that are decolonized. It doesn&#8217;t have to be all about client services, that can generate revenue, that can generate income, that could generate economics in a community, but it also can be about&#8230; There&#8217;s an issue of gun violence, maybe we can design our way out of that, and it&#8217;s not going to be about typography. But there&#8217;s this certain set of perspectives and approaches that we use in design that can translate to bigger problems we see in our communities.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is it that keeps you motivated and inspired these days? I mean, I feel like&#8230; And just for people that are listening to this, we&#8217;re recording this the week of April 19th, we don&#8217;t really know&#8230; Both Joseph and I don&#8217;t really know kind of what may transpire the next few days, that by the time you listened to this podcast might&#8217;ve already set some shit off. But it&#8217;s a rough time for black folks right now, which is an evergreen statement these days. But what keeps you motivated to keep going?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Family for sure. Baby got to eat so got to get up and do what you got to do to make sure that happens. I just got this book and I just came back from Jackson, Mississippi. Freedom, by Edward Onaci, I think he pronounced it. And it&#8217;s inspired by another book of the same name, Dr Imar Obadele. And Obadele was a part of this black radical organization called the Republic of New Africa. And their vision was to take the southern states of the United States, so from Louisiana to Georgia and build a independent black nation. Which is one of the most creative, imaginative visions I&#8217;ve had or I&#8217;ve witnessed for black liberation. I&#8217;m super inspired by the work of those folks. At the moment that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been reading about. I just came back from Jackson, Mississippi, where they tried to get it going. And we obviously don&#8217;t have a black nation in the borders of the United States, but they got&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Or folks inspired by that movement have bought all of these properties in West Jackson. We&#8217;re staying at this co-operative for New West Jackson that owns 67 properties in the hood. And they&#8217;re building farms, they&#8217;re building housing, they&#8217;re building economic engines in the space to employ people, to bring money to the space that has been all but abandoned. Isn&#8217;t crazy. Jackson is the capital of Mississippi, and if you drive around Jackson you come away with a clear idea that white folks in Mississippi don&#8217;t care. They do not care that it&#8217;s their capital, it&#8217;s like 90% black. And all you got to do is roll through West Jackson and you can see how much folks do not care. You would think, &#8220;Oh, this is a image of this state that we are projecting out to the world.&#8221; That does not matter, not to the white folks in Mississippi. And this cooperative has&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Like you turn the corner onto a block and it&#8217;s like just walking into a oasis after walking through hundreds of miles of desert. It&#8217;s beautiful, the houses are beautiful, the land is beautiful, the people what they&#8217;re doing, and their vision for the world is beautiful. That&#8217;s one of the things that is inspiring me. I&#8217;ve really been into kind of reconnecting Afro spirituality, Afro spiritual practices like the hoodoos, and the voodoos, and Orisha based Yoruba kind of religious concepts. That&#8217;s been super inspiring to me today, I mean for the last couple of years. But right now it&#8217;s something I wake up thinking about, going to sleep thinking about, and it&#8217;s a lot of different things. My mind goes and gets pulled in a lot of different directions. Like yesterday my tufting gun arrived in the mail. You know what a tufting gun is?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a rug creating machine and it looks kind of like a gun, but the gun shoots yarn through a back in fabric you would use to make a rug. That&#8217;s one thing that I&#8217;ve been super inspired by. In that instance, buying that comes from my still love and interest in fashion. And it&#8217;s showing up in my practice as like I&#8217;ve been making these textile art works lately for the last few years now. I&#8217;ll create a collage, and Photoshop, print it out on fabric. And then sew it together, or make some new kind of construction out of it, some new kind of architecture out of it. That&#8217;s super inspiring to me, riding my bike is super inspiring to me, my wife and daughter. I lack no shortage of inspiration which is a good thing and a bad thing, because it distracts me from finishing one thing. Get super excited about something, then move to the next thing, then move next, but I&#8217;ll always come back.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Has there been a piece of advice that has stuck with you over the years as you&#8217;ve gone through life, as you&#8217;ve built out the school and everything?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
It&#8217;s hard to call anything to mind specifically. I think there&#8217;s lessons learned that may not be succinctly wrapped up in statements of advice. With certain lessons you&#8217;re damned if you do, you&#8217;re damned if you don&#8217;t, which sound depressing. But it&#8217;s taught me that you might as well just do what you want to do, because either way you&#8217;re going to end up at the same place. You might as well just say F it and be who you want to be, do what you want to do. Because I mean you could fake it, and be unhappy, and still not reach where you&#8217;re meant to reach.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Or you could just live in that thing and deal with the initial discomfort of just being in your skin, and being who you are. But I think eventually you will end up where you need to be. I really believe in purpose right now more than ever, because I&#8217;ve been forced to sit down and think about that a lot. I believe what&#8217;s meant for you is meant for you, can&#8217;t nobody stop or take that. But it takes time for folks to really figure out their purpose, and it&#8217;s not just like a goal, it&#8217;s a moving target. I say figure out what that is for you, and live that unapologetically. Just go hard.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing? How do you want to&#8230; I imagine of course you&#8217;ll still be wanting to build out the school, but what does 2026 look like?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Whoa, I think I need to put some pen to paper about that very soon. But hopefully the school&#8230; Not hopefully. What it looks like is the school will be built, will be functioning, doing art and civic engagement initiatives with our local community. That may look like our design workshops, or apprenticeships, or a community garden where we&#8217;re feeding ourselves food from the land. Hopefully it looks like me still creating, making things. I think of myself as a person who does two sorts of things, or artist or designer who does two sorts of things. I make things, object making, and I make experiences, platforms, producing and sharing knowledge.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
And I see those as two different kind of sides of a coin and hopefully I have a balance. Right now it&#8217;s real tilted towards the platforms, the community building, but I would love to spread it out a little bit more evenly. Hopefully The Black School is up and running to a degree where it&#8217;s second nature. We have our rhythm, we have our stride so it allows me, frees me up to do all the things, follow all those inspiration, and passions, and pursuits that kind of make me happy, and fill me with joy and fulfillment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you, and about your work, and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
On Instagram, you can follow me at Joseph Cuillier first name, last name, or at The Black School. On the interwebs you can go to my website, josephcuillier.com or theblack.school. Not .com, not .org, .school, so theblack.school.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Joseph Cuillier, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Really thank you for talking about the school, and really how you&#8217;ve built it out, what you&#8217;re trying to do in the community. I&#8217;m glad that we were able to spend a lot of time really diving into what it&#8217;s about, and its structure, and of course what you&#8217;re trying to do in the community. I think it&#8217;s something that is super important and I really want to see kind of where this goes from here. Thank you for coming on the show, I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Thank you, brother. Appreciate you, appreciate what you do. You&#8217;re building this platform for folks like us to just share knowledge, share experience, share space, it&#8217;s super appreciated.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t think of a better way to start off the month than by talking with author, professor, and strategist Douglas Davis. Longtime fans of the show will remember our initial conversation from 2016, so it was good to catch up and talk and get an update over what he&#8217;s been doing.</p>
<p>What follows is less of an interview and more of a general conversation that ranges a number of topics: creativity during the pandemic, design equity, social justice, the value of remote design education, relevance vs. belonging, AIGA, fatherhood, and a lot more. Hopefully this conversation gives you some food for thought and starts some much needed conversations around our place in this current world as designers! </p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
So, Maurice, thank you so much for having me back on Revision Path. My name is Douglas Davis, and I&#8217;m a strategist, I&#8217;m an author, I&#8217;m a professor and a for the last, about three years, I&#8217;ve been the chair of the B.F.A. in Communication Design at New York City College of Technology. We are the design program at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge. And what I love about being the chairs that I&#8217;ve been able to make our mission an extension of my own personal mission, which is to increase the variety of voices making a living with their imagination.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2021 been treating you so far?</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
2021 has been a blur. I still remember March last year when we stopped having in-person classes. And I pulled my team together for our last in-person strategy session, where we just audited all the normal functions of a semester what had happened within this formal timeframe last year. And from there, I was able to diffuse the operations among my 15 person team so that I could focus on forecasting new systems design. And so it was a really important move because it helped me to set the tone that would bring us into a year later.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
Now we&#8217;re in April of 2021, but most of that has been a blur, but that, I guess, I can say it&#8217;s been a blur because of those reasons that I&#8217;m glad that we were able to pivot because I saw what the problem was, immediately, we were able to identify how we needed to redesign our own systems, communications or just how we actually carried about the normal day-to-day so that I could focus on finding the constants in this variable environment so that we could actually make decisions that would basically bring us into this point. So it&#8217;s been a blur, but I will say that we have a little boy, he turned two during the quarantine. And so it&#8217;s been, I think the best thing was to be here every day to see him. So I will say it&#8217;s been a blur, but it&#8217;s also been a joy because I would have never been able to watch my son grow in the ways that he has. So I&#8217;m grateful for that part of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In a way, it sounds like the blur has been a blessing.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
It has been. I think that&#8217;s a great way to put it because not only has it allowed me to for this last year of being chair, usually, whenever you are elected chairs for three years and you decide to renew that or not, I&#8217;ve decided not to, but after the first two years, I had already accomplished all of my goals. So this third year in that pivot has been about reinventing what it is that we offer. And it&#8217;s been difficult because usually, you can walk down the hall, you can bump into your coworkers and ask them what&#8217;s going on or observe yourself. And you&#8217;re there, you can watch, you can experience the environment, but I&#8217;ve been flying this plane blind because the only place that our offering exists is in Zoom rooms, right? So we&#8217;ve got to, in this year, we had to figure out what is it that we offer? Where&#8217;s the value? And how do we even talk about it?</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And so we had a two year run of quite a lot of positive press releases and quite a lot of awards. And we were nominated for an Emmy twice and we won the Emmy. And I told my dean and the provost and the president not to expect any of those things from us, because I don&#8217;t even know what it is that we&#8217;re attracting students to.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And so until I can figure that out by talking to literally every single person, we have about maybe 80 adjuncts and that 15 member team, I make 16, and just talking to them and asking them questions, what&#8217;s working, what&#8217;s not working and why in order for me to figure out, maybe even what shouldn&#8217;t come back from online, what should stay there because we can still get a level of quality, but what is hurting? What is not actually what we would want if we had a choice, things like advanced studio photography, for instance, who&#8217;s learning apertures and f-stops and lighting with the camera phone, right? Or things like figure drawing. If you&#8217;re really about learning the aesthetics of line shape, form, space, color, value, texture, all the things that they teach you in our school traditionally, can&#8217;t really do that at a distance.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And so we&#8217;ve been trying to figure out how exactly we can offer our students the best value at a distance during this time the whole world is shifting in addition to the fact that right now, I like to say that the most important students are my staff, the professors, because it&#8217;s almost like Thanos snapped his fingers in an instant, how exactly you went from freshmen in college the first day on the job totally changed along with what you do on that job, how you do that job.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And so I think it&#8217;s really important to invest in the people who spend the most time with the talent that we&#8217;re developing for the industry. And if we are not tapped into what those shifts are, if we&#8217;re not useful to our own clients in the boardroom, then what I have to teach you in the classroom, especially whenever you&#8217;re attempting something that I&#8217;ve never done myself, like you&#8217;re entering the industry, you&#8217;re finishing college in a pandemic on the couch. And so I think it&#8217;s just really, really important for any educators out there to really think about that, that in an instant, institution&#8217;s competitive advantage that was built on an in-person experience was flattened. And any of the competitive set, I think it&#8217;s arguable now, whether those go-to &#8220;schools&#8221; that most recruiters recruit from, it&#8217;s arguable whether they still can produce the same level of quality when no one was prepared to make this shift.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
So I think that is a big opportunity for the challenger brands like us, but it all depends on what everybody did with their time. It&#8217;s been a year, but in that year, that pivot and how you can take your resources, redesign your processes and think about what your new priorities are and then invest around those new priorities so that you can focus on that forecasting, focus on new systems design, focus on decision-making, decentralized decision-making, focus on operations. Those are, I would argue, the newest central skills as a result of the pandemic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, a lot of things have changed with the pandemic, as you mentioned, I think for educational facilities, whether it&#8217;s a college or even something like a bootcamp or something, it&#8217;s how does that value translates? I know here where I&#8217;m at, I live near some HBCUs here, Morehouse College, Spelman, et cetera. And I know for a while they transitioned into doing only online learning. I think some of the schools have said now that I think the vaccine is out there, that people are going to start transitioning back in the fall to try to do either some sort of hybrid model or like fully on campus instruction.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I think what is the tricky thing about it is people are going to have to almost be re-introduced in a way back to society. There are so many people I know that are just workers that are like, I don&#8217;t know about going back into the office. I like working from home, where they&#8217;ve gotten used to, or they found a way to compartmentalize being able to work from home and still have a home and not feel like they live where they work and that sort of way. So there&#8217;s a number of different considerations and factors that go into it. And yeah, I can definitely see for college, because it&#8217;s so expensive students are like, well, what are we paying for? I mean, yes, it&#8217;s the education, but we&#8217;re not going to a building or sitting in a lab or using facilities, we&#8217;re all at home. So should it be less expensive because of that? There&#8217;s a number of questions that go into all of that.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
Well, that&#8217;s the challenge. Again, I mentioned earlier that in the blink of an eye, not only did the industry change in terms of what your job is and how you do it, but how you actually enter this industry changed. We went from being the most experienced people in the room who could say, you know what? Do what I do because I&#8217;ve done it and I can help you do it, to I&#8217;ve never done this before. None of us have. You don&#8217;t have any more experience than I do, I don&#8217;t have any more experience than you do. We&#8217;re all doing this together. And I think that&#8217;s a better place to be, but only if everybody in the room can actually admit that.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
But I think that what you&#8217;re pointing to started before the pandemic happened. I think that there has been price pressure on universities and colleges because of the fact that credentialing and how much tuition costs and how it&#8217;s continued to go up. And as Clay Christensen, the late Professor Christensen would say, this particular category, the education space had not been disrupted in what? Three. It never, pretty much been just like this for hundreds of years. And I think that the fact that that overhead is also factored into that tuition. And again, that competitive advantage, that brand is charging you a premium, not just for the brand itself, but for the caliber of professor that they&#8217;re attracting, that then is also factored into the tuition along with the network that you&#8217;re around, like the people who you&#8217;re going to leave with, that&#8217;s factored into the tuition in addition to keeping that brand, whether it so it can continue to attract those types of people so that they can keep charging you that much money, but that is under attack.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s funny because I said to my dean the other day and the provost, I said, &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it have been interesting if the disruption would have happened in a complete different way being that, what if the experts that are online right now that teach in these very entertaining, short videos for free or for a little bit of money? What if those experts had to buy expensive real estate in order to create a physical campus? What if they had to build the buildings on that real estate? What if they had to go and get their PhDs and make sure that anybody who taught on their platforms had their PhDs? What if they had to approve their curriculum through the state? I mean, think about the decades of a headstart that traditional universities would have had. The problem is that the opposite happens.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
So right now, we&#8217;ve been pulled into their space. And this is a space where production value matters because we&#8217;re competing for students&#8217; attention. You can&#8217;t just stand there and speak your two hour lecture in person online in front of the camera. It&#8217;s not going to work. You&#8217;re going to be bleeding people who don&#8217;t have the attention span in the first two, three minutes. And so I think as a result, that price pressure is something that I think for us, I like to say with the public path to a creative career, because even though we are about four to five times larger than our private school competition, we have a fraction of their resources and we also cost a fraction of what they cost. And yet, our students are competing for the exact same opportunities because we have an accredited BFA just like they do.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
So I think we&#8217;re really well positioned, we&#8217;re a commuter school, but I think, though our tuition and our revenue model is not under the same pressure as like a division one or R1 research institution that has dorms and meal plans and all that kind of stuff, it still is a competition between us as a traditional four year path into the industry and these low end disruptors that charge you a lot less money, but that offer this practical advice about entering the industry.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And there&#8217;s some really quality players out there. My friend, Chris Do, the Futur, or General Assembly, there are a lot of places that you can go to learn skills. And I&#8217;ll give you one better, because if you rewind back to 1999 and you&#8217;ll appreciate this because you work at a startup, but back then, if you think about it, and this is when I entered the industry with all the dot coms and digital advertising, nobody had a degree in web design, you couldn&#8217;t study, it didn&#8217;t exist. And what that was about was the fact that these people, whatever they studied, they got that opportunity, including myself, because we were willing to learn a new language.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And I think that if you fast forward to right now, we&#8217;re back to a point where I think in 2017, Microsoft and Apple and Google, they relaxed the requirement of having to have like a college degree in order to enter their ranks. So we&#8217;re back to skills being the thing. I think the challenge, though, is that when you think about black and brown folks like us, oftentimes, we have to go to college to get the degree, to get the confidence to even apply to those places.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And so I think overall, the challenge there becomes, we&#8217;ve got to understand how, oftentimes, a student will say, well, Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard. And so I don&#8217;t really need a school, I&#8217;m going to drop out too. And I always have to remind them that that&#8217;s not you. I don&#8217;t know what family Mark Zuckerberg was born into, but maybe his mom was on the board of XYZ company and they already have the capital, they already have the connections. And if you don&#8217;t have any of those things, if you don&#8217;t have a network of all of those elements, it will be a mistake for you to do what Mark Zuckerberg do as a black man or a woman. And so I think overall, those are the things that have to be thought through in order for us to figure out exactly what the value is now and how we can extract what the value and the opportunities are right now.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s a bigger question of the education space and how we&#8217;re going to continue to compete if we all know how Blockbuster versus Netflix ended up. And so I think that if we&#8217;re not careful as the traditional university space changes, if we don&#8217;t think about how much we&#8217;re charging, if we don&#8217;t think about developing those new skills, and if frankly, our presidents rely more on their PhDs than they do their people skills, the pandemic has really required all of us to change and to develop new skills.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And I think that presentation skills, marketing skills, the things that our clients pay us for, we are uniquely positioned as creative people to deal with these pivots. And if that PhD or the things that used to be the ticket into these exclusive spaces, if that still continues to be the yardstick with which people deem that you are smart enough to handle this problem, or if that&#8217;s the thing that they keep requiring for you to be on a problem, versus just thinking about what the skills are that are needed, what is the issue and how do we deal with it, then we&#8217;re going to be in trouble. And so I think some things need to shift.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And I think we&#8217;re already seeing some companies, honestly, I mean, I think every company is still trying to figure it out, but with some places, they&#8217;re definitely trying to skip back and forth between saying one thing and something else to see what is going to work the best. So for example, last year, when the pandemic has happened and everyone was forced to go remote, a lot of positions then opened up to become remote positions because you can&#8217;t go into the office to do an interview, you can&#8217;t go into the office to work. So you&#8217;ll have to do all your work distanced over Zoom and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And companies, at least companies, I know that I&#8217;ve encountered, we&#8217;re still trying to kick the can down the road to figure out how much longer they were going to be doing this until they could get back to what it used to be. So you may apply for a position and they say it&#8217;s remote, but then they&#8217;ll say, oh, but when we&#8217;re back in the office, you have to move here. Is that okay? And it&#8217;s like, well, they&#8217;re not going to offer relocation. They just expect you to pick up and move because you&#8217;ve got a job there, which is not realistic at all. I mean, pandemic or not, that&#8217;s not realistic.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the misalignment, right? Where looking backwards versus focusing forward and understanding that there&#8217;s an aspect of what we used to do, walk around maskless, breathe in each other&#8217;s maskless air will-nilly, shaking hands, and hugging each other and being in tight spaces and watching movies and stuff. There&#8217;s an aspect of our culture that may not return. And I think that waiting to base what you&#8217;re going to do based on what used to happen or how quickly we will be back to that versus focusing forward in and understanding that there are some new priorities here, I think that that&#8217;s the classic thing that&#8217;s going to determine who wins and who loses in this new environment.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
I think that if we&#8217;re talking about companies and if we&#8217;re talking about people, I think it really does boil down to two things, relevance and belonging. I think if you&#8217;re an institution or if you&#8217;re in a leadership position or if you&#8217;re a brand, if you&#8217;re a college, it doesn&#8217;t even matter, but if you&#8217;re not really asking yourself as a brand or a company or an institution or an employer are we relevant, if you&#8217;re not asking that question and if you&#8217;re not then basing your answer yes or no, based on how many people or groups can come to you and say, I belong and therefore, I&#8217;m going to stay here in this culture, then you&#8217;re in trouble. That relevance, belonging metric, I like to say, it&#8217;s a column response because whether you&#8217;re a person, individual and you&#8217;re going to a college or a certain brand to be employed, and you&#8217;re in some ways asking in your everyday interactions with that company, whether they&#8217;re good or bad, you&#8217;re making a determination if you belong or not, you&#8217;re asking, do I belong?</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And so if you end the interactions, whether that&#8217;s just the culture of how things are set up or if it&#8217;s customer service, if it&#8217;s how you are or not invested in, if you determine in your aggregate that you don&#8217;t belong because of those experiences being bad, then they&#8217;re going to leave. And we&#8217;ve all left places because we&#8217;ve deduced that the way you&#8217;re being treated is not what you want to continue to experience.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And so I think, again, companies and people, or the college that you&#8217;re going to, you&#8217;re asking yourself, do I belong? And the way that that brand treats you is what&#8217;s going to help you to arrive at your answer, but then if you&#8217;re that employer, if you&#8217;re that institution, if you&#8217;re asking yourself, are we relevant and you&#8217;re basing that on how many people can conclude that they belong, then you&#8217;re in a good place.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
But if you&#8217;re tone deaf or if you&#8217;re looking for diverse candidates in the exact same way that you&#8217;ve always been doing it and you&#8217;re going to the exact same schools that you&#8217;ve been going to and you&#8217;re not really thinking about right now that the pandemic might be preventing some of the best talented people who you could have from even applying because of the new barriers that the pandemic has put into place, then you&#8217;re going to miss it. You&#8217;re going to miss that human potential, you&#8217;re going to miss that diverse team, because you&#8217;re basically looking for diversity as if I&#8217;m a black, white person. That&#8217;s the only way that you can conclude that there aren&#8217;t any diverse candidates or you can&#8217;t find any, you&#8217;re looking for black people with the same process and at the same places that you look for white people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s something that I know I&#8217;ve talked about in my Where Are the Black Designers presentations before, but I mean, it&#8217;s something still, which is coming up, like for example, Revision Path as a job board. And we&#8217;ve gotten more companies that have posted to the job board, which is great, that&#8217;s wonderful. But it&#8217;s interesting, because then they&#8217;ll turn around because maybe they don&#8217;t get the response that they thought they would get from it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s interesting. I think just because you put a job out there doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that black and brown people will flock to it. I think a number of companies know either to post to these sorts of boards or they know that if they put these kinds of listings out there, they&#8217;ll attract certain people, but I don&#8217;t know, it feels like it&#8217;s almost over-indexed in a way, every position you put out there is not going to have a bunch of black and brown people clamoring for it, especially if the position that you&#8217;ve written is written in a way that might exclude them or they may not be familiar with your company or it&#8217;s not remote or like there&#8217;s a number of different sorts of reasons.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like I had, I&#8217;m just going to give an example, but I had a school that was in the middle of nowhere in the Midwest and they posted a position and then they came back 30 days later and they were like, well, no one applied. Can I get my money back? And I said, no. But it was also sort of like, well, how many people of color are going to live in the middle of nowhere in the Midwest to teach at your college?</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
Well, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re saying, it&#8217;s about the culture. And I think some part of what you&#8217;re identifying is that everything that employers are dealing with in terms of diversity or in terms of race or in terms of just dealing with whether it&#8217;s the Asian hate that&#8217;s going on right now, that terrible, despicable Asian hate, or whether it&#8217;s just what black people have had to endure from the beginning, we&#8217;re talking about American society&#8217;s issues. And it&#8217;s obvious that those issues would show up in your company, because we&#8217;re talking about whether people belong or not.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And Maurice, when you really think about this, if we&#8217;re still in 2021, and I say this every year, because change is not happening fast enough, but it&#8217;s 2021, and when we can continue to say the words first and black in the same sentence and we were born here, it&#8217;s clear that we&#8217;re not woven into this society that we are a part of. And there&#8217;s still so many different barriers and I mean, that&#8217;s not even to mention the barriers that COVID-19 is presenting. It used to be, hey, wear a suit to your interview. Now your bandwidth is how you present yourself, just like that suit in person. If you&#8217;re going to college, because you want to change your socioeconomic situation that you were born in, but you live in the projects, you don&#8217;t even choose your bandwidth because you don&#8217;t actually buy your internet service.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
So again, thinking about our professors as the most important students, if I am a classic design professor and I want to show you the highest resolution image, but I don&#8217;t know how to teach online. And so I&#8217;ve got all these high resolution hogging, bandwidth hogging images in my Zoom and I keep kicking you off because your bandwidth can&#8217;t handle my presentation or my videos. This is really about making sure that the environment that you&#8217;re trying to attract that diversity too, is set up to actually handle that diversity.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s why I give a lot of respect to companies like Google and Microsoft. And I say that because they saw us at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge, they see our diversity, they know that we have about 140 or 150 different languages spoken in our student body, they know that we represent about that many countries around the world, just in our student body because of the fact that there aren&#8217;t any barriers to our program. And they flew out from the West Coast and they set up shop.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
Microsoft actually interviewed our students in a two-day series of either giving workshops or interviewing our students to ask them, is it our tool that makes it the barrier? And to ask that question was wonderful. They observed our classes, they embedded themselves within the department. They conducted maybe like 15 or 16, 45 minute interviews where they really did ask. They asked a highly diverse group of young creatives, is it our tool that is preventing you from coding? I mean, that question alone and flying out from the West Coast and really investing in trying to figure out what the answer was. And they went to several other schools as well, but they made it a point to come to us. And so same thing with Google and showing up at our school and sending maybe seven or eight people from their office in order to recruit. And we also had this pilot where they had a group of students from California State Northridge University, as well as our program at City Tech. They met with and sort of paired our students with Google Alert.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And so they checked in every week. And basically what and I really love about this. This was the equity engineering team, Jason Randolph, big shout out to him out on the West Coast. But the program was to introduce our students to the same problems that you would find if you were interviewing for a job at Google. And so that&#8217;s how they&#8217;re reaching into the pipeline, but also making sure that the environment itself, they&#8217;re asking the hard questions about their own tools and about their own decisions they&#8217;re willing to listen.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And they&#8217;re willing to make sure that regardless of who you are, that they&#8217;re tailoring, how exactly they come and find you. Those are the examples that I want to hold up and I have a lot of respect for them because it&#8217;s not just that they&#8217;re saying that diversity is important. It&#8217;s not just that they&#8217;re saying these things, but there are press releases or appointing very high C-suite level diversity people. And yet the numbers keep staying the same. They&#8217;re really trying to do something about it. And so they earn my respect in that way.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
But again, it&#8217;s not just about saying the right things or putting a posting in the right places. It&#8217;s about understanding that again, I&#8217;m not a black, white person. You&#8217;ve got to really think about if you want me to feel comfortable in your environment, in your culture, you got to make sure that you&#8217;ve created a culture that we would feel comfortable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And now a couple of years ago, I know you were a co-chair for AIGA&#8217;s Diversity and Inclusion Task Force. I was also on the task force several years ago. What do you remember about that experience?</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
First, I want to say that Antoinette Carroll and gosh, Andrew Bass, gosh there has been so many people who were investing in the work long before me also Jacinda Walker. And so it was great to show up at the AIGA and say, I don&#8217;t think you guys are actually telling the story or having the impact that you could have. And so I just offered my services as a strategist. And since I was about to have a baby, I was about to become chair. I was applying for full professors, a lot of things going on when they asked me to chair the task force, I said, yes, if I could have a co-chair. And so Phim Her was my dynamic co-chair, she&#8217;s a wonderful, wonderful person. And I know you know her, but it was just really great to work with her.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And I think that the challenge with the AIGA as an organization at that time was just that in being an organization that had been around for so long, but that was so late to the conversation about diversity, double digitally in so many ways that in communicating that to them that the belonging idea that we talked about earlier, that when people show up and they keep hearing the exact same thing over and over again. And they don&#8217;t really know what the value is of the money that they&#8217;re paying. They&#8217;re not going to stay if their needs are not getting met. And we&#8217;re not the only organization having conversations about diversity because there&#8217;s so many other places where that conversation is being had and where change is happening. And just for instance, thinking about the advertising space, and again, the caveat being that in design, it&#8217;s not this aggregate profession, right?</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
You&#8217;ve got all these individual, design firms and you might do a logo for different brands or identity or websites, but in advertising, you&#8217;ve got holding companies and agencies that have accounts. So in a sense they&#8217;ve been sued as an organization, Human Rights Council of New York, making sure that black people were represented as a certain number of the population within the ranks in these holding companies, even though that hasn&#8217;t happened. The point though, is that it was attempted, and it was attempted in a way where New York city was willing to sue.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And so as a result, a lot of these C-suite level organization and titles came out of that. And so knowing the history of those things, and again I&#8217;m going through it pretty quickly, but knowing the history of where the diversity conversation was in the advertising space, I just was trying to communicate that we are aware, really arriving very, very late to this conversation, even though there&#8217;ve been some really amazing people who&#8217;ve had some progress and who&#8217;ve pushed the conversation forward within AIGA to then take that mantle up and try to push things forward.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
We did as much as we could do, but I think that the culture itself, there were a lot of changes and bunch of turnover and just the structure itself, I think needed some change. And so after about a calendar year, I realized that it might be more helpful if we sort of stepped aside because as much as I like to try to push things forward and really win change, it wasn&#8217;t possible with that title and in that organization. So wonderful, wonderful people. I have some wonderful friends who&#8217;ve been able to find progress in that space. I just needed to redirect my own time and no love lost, but I didn&#8217;t need to focus forward. So it was a good experience. I think that we were able to show a different way to lead, but ultimately we were not effective. That&#8217;s how I remember that experience. And, I do hope that as the conversation about equity and black lives and just all the things that we&#8217;re dealing with right now continues to evolve. I do hope that not only AIGA, but many other organizations and many other professions, I really hope that we can sort of look at like what places like Canada is doing-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Place like RGD?</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
Yeah. And not just even RGD, but like also their colleges and universities out there. OCAD U there&#8217;s a woman out there she&#8217;s the Dean of Design name is Dr. Dori Tunstall, she&#8217;s been doing some wonderful things like cluster hires of like black faculty. She was able to hire five black faculty members in a space that had no black tenured faculty for over a hundred years. And she hired five black people on tenure track lines. And she&#8217;s in the middle right now of an indigenous cluster hire where they&#8217;re looking for indigenous faculty members to join in that way, but she&#8217;s been making some real change. And so there are far beyond the diversity and inclusion conversation that America has been sort of steeped in.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
They&#8217;ve moved towards anti-racism and decolonization and so I think that looking at countries and people who have moved far beyond where we&#8217;re at and really taking note of what they&#8217;ve been doing, and then figuring out what that looks like within the American space and within our own companies or our own universities, is what our hope happens as a result of just being able to mention it and bring it up within the context of this conversation. That&#8217;s where I hope we are able to go because they&#8217;re further along.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Even thinking about like this year, for example, I&#8217;ve met a lot of design educators on the show. I usually try to have a good mix of design educators and stuff, but even thinking like how you said before, how teaching has changed and how different organizations are changing. One thing that sort of struck me last summer was a lot of these different companies and such putting up black squares and saying that they now are in on all lives matter. And we&#8217;re going to, I mean, that all lives matter. Sorry, all black lives matter and we&#8217;re going to start celebrating Juneteenth and things like this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All of that is clear virtue signaling, first of all. But I remember getting just asked from other people and such like, how long is this going to last? And I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t know, like few months maybe like as the next extra judicial killing crosses the airways, like things happen to come at such an interesting nexus point with this pandemic and there not being any sports and not being able to travel and such where people were sort of forced to now see it in a way that I guess they had been privileged enough to ignore it for years and years and years. It&#8217;s kind of astonishing to me how many people were just sort of woken up last year because of this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But like even that whole habit of like black squares and such like around that time, I was also looking at old issues of Ebony and Jet magazine around the time when Dr. King was assassinated and the same types of things were happening. Companies were posting like an all black square for an ad. Like what does that accomplish except using up a lot of ink?</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
Exactly. Well, I think we&#8217;re in marketing, right? So the fads and trends are something that advertising agencies and design firms are going to really, I think just be attracted to because what we do harness is culture. I always like to say that creative people are the spoonful of sugar that make business and marketing objectives palatable to the public, but they can&#8217;t go public without us. And so if you think about advertising and the fact that like the authors and drivers of American culture, not just black culture, American culture. And I&#8217;m saying this off the heels of last night&#8217;s versus, Earth, Wind and Fire versus the Isley Brothers. So the full glory enriches of black people were on display last night for the world to see. But we&#8217;re the drivers of American culture we&#8217;re the authors of American culture we&#8217;re the influencers of American culture and fashion.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And again, I&#8217;m not saying that no one else does anything. I am saying that there is an outsize contribution to that from black people. And yet, if we are not represented within the same proportion of the population, there&#8217;s something wrong. Because if our industry is built on crafting messages, building relationships, brand values, customer relationship management, if we&#8217;re built on that, and if we&#8217;re built on crafting those messages and targeting groups, if I&#8217;m excluded part of the authors and the influencers of American culture in this country, if I&#8217;m excluded in a profession that targets and craft messages and brings them to people, then it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s on purpose. And I think that we can sort of get caught up in the moment of like basically being embarrassed if you&#8217;re not posting something that&#8217;s pro-black, which I think a year later, if you look at someone&#8217;s actions as an organization or a country, or even as individuals. If you look at the misalignment if you look at the mixed signals that exist in America right now, you had literal people carrying blue lives matter flags, having an insurrection on the Capitol, beating police officers with it.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
Like there&#8217;s so many mixed signals within our country. There&#8217;s equal justice under law on the top of the Supreme Court and yet we&#8217;re watching right now, George Floyd, his character is basically on trial for his own murder right now. And so there&#8217;s all these mixed signals that exist in everyday life in America. And so it makes total sense that if in the moment, if the trend is sort of pointing towards black lives and black people being in fashion and being pro-black about a specific issue, if that&#8217;s in style, then of course. If we&#8217;re in this profession, if we&#8217;re being honest, then yeah, you&#8217;ll be embarrassed if you&#8217;re not about it. But if you even look at the laws that are meant to suppress voters right now in Georgia, and the fact that these companies they hire lobbyist, they knew what was in those bills before they were passed.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
They were pressed on it from black corporate leaders, as well as black employees at those places because black dollars are ones that they want. And so at the end of the day, even those companies which I&#8217;m glad that they&#8217;re speaking up, but they&#8217;re speaking up too late and we still are in a situation where we don&#8217;t have what we need. And so I think overall, it&#8217;s great to have that black square. It&#8217;s amazing to have that hashtag, but that&#8217;s easy. I think, again, going back to what I can say from what I&#8217;ve seen and what that experience has been with Google and Microsoft choosing to help us because our partnerships are how we have more impact than what our resources can produce. And so I think at the end of the day, when you have partners who understand that there&#8217;s different problem in order to engage different people think about the internship sort of structure and if it&#8217;s not paid, who can afford to do that? You got black and brown and talent just asking themselves, can I afford to be a designer? My work has to pay for my existence.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And so if you can&#8217;t afford to get that experience, then you&#8217;re going to work somewhere, but that&#8217;s not going to be a part of your career because you got needs. Whereas someone else is getting the experience that they need because they don&#8217;t need the money. And so I think that being able to have that diverse team, being able to see the socioeconomic differences in attracting and retaining different groups and making sure that you can build your culture in a way that says that you&#8217;re relevant because you got white people, black people, Asian people, Indian people, and gay people, trans people, you got everybody there because they do feel like they belong because you thought about how to actually have company that&#8217;s not like you.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
I think that that takes work. And I think at the highest levels is going to take some incentives changing. It&#8217;s going to take the laws changing, and Maurice man, it&#8217;s exhausting. I can say to you that this year has been a blur because of the pivot that&#8217;s been going on with the pandemic. But it&#8217;s bigger than that, right? Like we&#8217;ve been watching ourselves get shot or hung or killed, or the mysterious circumstances where a routine interaction with police turns deadly because you&#8217;re unarmed and black. And I always post on social media next time it&#8217;s going to be me, one day it&#8217;s to be me. My mom hates it, my family and friends hate it and they say, &#8220;God forbid.&#8221; And I say, &#8220;You know what? That&#8217;s exactly what George Floyd&#8217;s family said God forbid. It happened to you. But it happened. We&#8217;re no different.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And so until all these things are factored in, of course, we&#8217;re bringing this to work. Of course, these are all the challenges that we have to fight through in society at work. If we&#8217;d literally just now had to pass laws where you can&#8217;t discriminate against me because of my hair. I&#8217;ve had to cut my hair to get jobs before. Who has to do that? What if a white woman had to do that to get a job? The condition is you cut your hair. That&#8217;s crazy. And we don&#8217;t even think about it like that because we&#8217;ve always had to walk in a space that wasn&#8217;t designed for us. We&#8217;ve always had to walk in a culture that wasn&#8217;t designed for us. We&#8217;ve always had to navigate a criminal justice system that wasn&#8217;t designed to give us equality. And so I think it makes complete sense that these things show up in the companies that we are going to work for. And it also makes sense that the trends towards whether it&#8217;s social justice or even just mentioning black lives matter, because you couldn&#8217;t even say that for a while.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
You were look at like you just said, hail satan or something crazy. And it was like this radical sort of thing versus like, no my life should matter. And I&#8217;m so angry that I got to say that. And yet it&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been able to navigate because we&#8217;re still here and we&#8217;re going to be here and we still drive culture. And we still are the authors of American culture. And in so many ways that are very creative and just whether it&#8217;s poetry or whether it&#8217;s music or whether it&#8217;s fashion like we still are a great source of America&#8217;s competitive advantage if it would just love us back. That would be nice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That would be nice. It would. Is that fair?</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
Fair? Ooh. There&#8217;s so many&#8230; If we were going to wait for fair Maurice and you know I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;re talking about this so that people can sort of understand that this is what we have to go through. But you know what I realize is that there&#8217;s two sides to what could be seen as fair. Think about the imposter syndrome. Think about all the different social issues that we just talked about and then think about how much confidence you do or don&#8217;t have in doing your job. Think about all the internal turmoil that you have to deal with in addition to all the social issues that you got to walk into work with. All the barriers, all the different tests or things that were set up to give you a certain score on the SAT based on like asking you questions that have nothing to do with your culture. And some people actually believe that outward measure of what their potential was. I didn&#8217;t believe it.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
I took the SAT like three times, my guidance counselor in high school didn&#8217;t have one conversation with me about college. And so I said to myself if I don&#8217;t go to college, I wanted it to be because I chose not to go. So I went to summer school myself. I took my extra math. I took my extra foreign language. I took the SAT three times. And you know what, after those three times I probably got like a 780, my highest score. So by that measure I&#8217;m stupid, Maurice. But if I looked at that, that number and let that number tell me what I was capable of then I wouldn&#8217;t have an Emmy. I wouldn&#8217;t have two master&#8217;s degrees. I wouldn&#8217;t have gone on to write a book, I&#8217;ve done anything because I&#8217;d have been too busy moping.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
But that fairness, if we&#8217;re talking about fair think about how you have to be deliberate and determined in a way that white people don&#8217;t have to be in order to make it. And then there&#8217;s the opposite side, right? So as I mentioned, I&#8217;m chair of the program and there&#8217;s about 650 students, about a hundred people on my staff. And it&#8217;s one thing to have to fight through any of the imposter syndrome. Thank goodness I didn&#8217;t suffer from those things but you do have to see yourself as worthy to be a leader, worthy to make decisions in order to perform in that job, you got to be focused on the fact that you are qualified and that you can do it as well as anybody else. But then there&#8217;s the opposite side to that fairness. White people have to see you as a person who they can follow. They have to see you as a person whose decisions that might affect their choices as something to respect. They have to see you as somebody who they&#8217;re willing to give a chance, because if they don&#8217;t then no, it&#8217;s not fair that the decisions that you&#8217;re making with all of the training with two master&#8217;s degrees, having written a book about strategy, having proven that your tactics and the way that you move in the world do well.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
Having won an Emmy, having brought all of the goals that you said that you had set out to bring, having done those things early, but still having people question whether you know what you&#8217;re talking about, still having to say the same thing for a year before you&#8217;re even heard. All of those things, if we&#8217;re talking about fairness, it&#8217;s like this double-sided coin where you have to see yourself as capable and worthy and why not you, but then even if, and when all those things are true about you and you are capable and you are worthy and you do make it. If people don&#8217;t see you as worthy or capable and don&#8217;t trust you or don&#8217;t follow you, or they&#8217;re insubordinate for the sake of being insubordinate, even with all the accolades and that&#8217;s not your issue, even though you got to deal with it.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And no, that&#8217;s not fair, but that&#8217;s the same issue as having that routine parking or traffic violation or traffic interaction with a cop and having those two master&#8217;s degrees, being an author, being a global speaker, and yet being an unarmed black man, and having them look at you and deem that you&#8217;re a threat and deciding to shoot you for no reason other than you&#8217;re unarmed and you&#8217;re black and you&#8217;re a man. I mean, how many times have we seen that?</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
So, no, it&#8217;s not fair. And yes, it&#8217;s exhausting and yes, we see it in American society. And yes, then we have to deal with it in the companies that we go to work for in our everyday interactions in this system that wasn&#8217;t set up for us. And yet we&#8217;re still bringing a level of contribution to all of it that America wouldn&#8217;t be any other what it is without our contribution. So it&#8217;s thankless, it&#8217;s completely thankless and you&#8217;re not only not wanted, but at the same time, what would America be without us? And we all know the answer to that question. And so, no, it&#8217;s not fair. And no, we don&#8217;t even get the equity that we put into it. And yet you can&#8217;t stop us.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
If anybody had any question, I&#8217;m a dark skinned red bone on the inside. If anybody had any questions, but I do believe that things will change over time, but is it just on the surface that it changes or will we be able to as creatives, as black creators as the people that we are, will we be able to affect change and influence brands from within? Will we be able to step up to those leadership positions and make the decisions that will shift the culture or the places that had locked us out or that don&#8217;t call out to people? How are you going to leave the space that you walked into? How are you going to push it forward?</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And I think that if all of us could just look at pushing it forward just a little bit. And I think lastly, I would just add onto this, that again, like a lot of the topics that we talked about are heavy, a lot of topics that we talked about proceed both of us, our grandparents and great-grandparents were talking about these same things and nothing&#8217;s changed, or it hasn&#8217;t changed enough that if they were still alive, they might be confused that we weren&#8217;t in their time in 2021. So progress is slow, progress may not sort of shift and move into the place that we would like it to in our lifetime in our kids&#8217; lifetimes, who knows. But I think that overall, we have to also take care of ourselves, right? Who&#8217;s to say that you want to actually be a part of the places that don&#8217;t want you? Who&#8217;s to say that those places they don&#8217;t deserve you?</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And so I think that it&#8217;s important for anybody listening to really understand your own worth. They need us as well. And so you can determine who benefits from your presence as well, that is within your control. And, again, we all have to balance the fact that we have to eat as well, but I think it&#8217;s very important to understand how much we are worth and how much our contribution is worth. Is not just checking a box, having a black face, being able to give the company some cover to say that they are about diversity because you&#8217;re there at the table. We all know that doesn&#8217;t work. But I think really understanding that where things are shifting in a way that there is more control in our hands, there is more opportunity because of the internet, even though there are some barriers that come along with it. Because we can go straight to the world, straight to the public with what we have, things will and are changing.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
So again, I think about Timbaland and I think about Swiss Beats doing verses it makes total sense that that came from two musicians from us, from our culture and look at what they&#8217;re doing. Look at what the D-Nice has been doing Club Quarantine like our creativity cannot be stopped. And so there&#8217;s this love-hate relationship that America has with us and it can&#8217;t get along without us. And yet I&#8217;m hoping that it can learn to embrace us in a way that we can unlock the potential of little black boys, little black girls, minority black, brown, queer boys and girls, so that we can really move and be and have that outlet that we&#8217;re going to get out there anyway. It&#8217;s going to happen anyway, that can&#8217;t be stopped, but it&#8217;d be really nice if there wasn&#8217;t such resistance or so many barriers to fight through. That would be fair, but stay black and die and pay taxes, right? That&#8217;s it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One big change and I think we&#8217;ve probably all heard it in the background as you&#8217;ve been talking, as you became a father over the past few years, as we had you on the show, how has fatherhood changed you?</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
Yeah, my son, Jonathan, it&#8217;s changed me in a lot of ways. And I&#8217;m sitting here smiling as I think about how exactly I can share in the amount of time that we have, how it&#8217;s changed me. But it&#8217;s been transformative in the way that now I understand the fear that my mom had when I would leave the house. And when I was rebellious and when the cops would harass and I was this outspoken young kid who was not about to hold my tongue, no matter what. Now I get that terror because now I have a son who is a light of our life and who is something happened to him it would be devastating. And now I know what that feels like to have so much to lose, but to have so much potential. And I guess, I&#8217;m speaking from the standpoint of how it shifted me. I think it&#8217;s made me more aware that at some point my son will go from being this cute little kid that everybody looks at on social media when I post.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
At some point he&#8217;s going to go from being cute to a threat. I mean Tamir Rice was a little kid, Trayvon was a little kid. And so I think the way that it&#8217;s changed me is it&#8217;s made me hyper aware of how blessed I was and why when at whatever point, because I didn&#8217;t discriminate, but why, what, at whatever point I had a white girlfriend, my family was uncomfortable, but they still embraced that person because they loved me. And so I think that the challenge at different points is that that change is what you then become your parents. You can see from their perspective, you understand the fact that to protect your son, that you have to sacrifice in different ways that if it was just you maybe it wouldn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And so I think the way it&#8217;s changed me is that it&#8217;s made me even more aware of all the things that we&#8217;ve been talking about. And it&#8217;s made me really question whether I want him to have to go through all of this. Again, if we&#8217;re going back to fair. I can&#8217;t lie to you and say that we haven&#8217;t thought about and really entertained leaving the country. I can&#8217;t say that we haven&#8217;t entertained thinking about what zip code we might want to live in so that when we call the cops they actually come. And that sucks, man. Like it&#8217;s exhausting because I would much rather be focused on the fact that he loves Dora the Explorer and that he loves to say, &#8220;Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. Delicioso.&#8221; And that he&#8217;s running and jumping around and we&#8217;ve got to tell him to stop and get off that and take that out of your mouth. Like I would love to focus on just that. And for right now we&#8217;re safe, but Breonna Taylor thought she was safe too when she went home and locked the door and went to sleep.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And so I think there&#8217;s no way to escape America and the weight of America. And so it&#8217;s changed me by making me even more aware of how precious life is and made me even more aware of the responsibility that we have to change things so that at some point we can just be. Because I want my son to just be, he waltz around the house, his toys everywhere just like any other kid and yet we can see him recognizing patterns and stacking his blocks in certain ways that they look like a sculpture garden as you walk through room to room to room, you know he&#8217;s been there. And being able to be here in a pandemic to have the privilege of being the boss during a time when I can make the decision as to whether we are or not going to go back in person. And I can make the decision as to, you what I don&#8217;t want it on my conscious that I put mixed signals out there to attract students back into a situation where they could get sick or I don&#8217;t want to put my staff in harms way, or I&#8217;m not going to ask anybody to do anything that I&#8217;m not willing to do myself.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And so, you know what, a year ago I decided we were going to be on this couch. We will be remote for the whole school year. And I&#8217;m glad that I could say that because not only did it help me to make sure that I didn&#8217;t put anybody else&#8217;s baby in harm&#8217;s way, it allowed me to be home and actually help my wife to raise mine. And so I think this just goes back to, in some ways, the call for anybody who is thinking about leadership or taking more responsibility, I want to encourage you to take that step. And yes, it&#8217;s a burden. It&#8217;s very difficult and yet if you can learn operations, if you can learn new systems design, if you can learn strategy forecasting, if you can learn decision-making and negotiations, if you read Creative Strategy and the Business of Design it can help you with the strategic part of things.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
But if you learn those things and take on more responsibility you can help to create the environment and make the decisions that not only benefit the people who you will be responsible for, but it also help you to benefit your own family. It is still a sacrifice, but at least it&#8217;s you making those decisions versus somebody else making those decisions for you, and we need more of that. I believe we need more of that. I&#8217;m probably the first black boss that my staff has worked for and I&#8217;ve worked for as many black bosses as my staff has worked for. It&#8217;s crazy, right? But in some ways becoming a father has helped me to really just be more responsible with that.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And just full disclosure and for accuracy sake I had a son when I was in Hampton I was like freshman year. So I was probably about 18. So my oldest son, his name is Douglas and he&#8217;s down in South Carolina. I had a son back then though, it was a very different interaction in terms of I&#8217;m a kid and he&#8217;s a kid. It&#8217;s one of those things where right now is very different because I&#8217;m an adult and being in a pandemic and being able to have two sons, but just to have a little one here with me, it has changed so much. And both of my sons thank goodness are healthy, but it really does when you become a father, makes you think about what your decisions are and what the impact of those decisions are. So it transforms you, definitely does.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you define success now?</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
Well, I mean, that&#8217;s a really interesting question because as I mentioned I&#8217;m not going to have chosen not to continue on as chair. Because I&#8217;ve been able to accomplish the change in our culture and raise our visibility, win those awards, do all the things that I set out doing. And on July 1st, when I&#8217;m not chair anymore or when my term ends I won&#8217;t even be 45 yet. And so in that I can say that success is not accomplishing all these things even though I&#8217;ve been able to accomplish those things and go to Hampton and then go to Pratt and get a master&#8217;s and then go to NYU and get another master&#8217;s and travel the world and write a book and speak globally and do these things. Success is keeping your word to yourself. Success is doing what you set out to do.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And I always define success as that, because things come and go. You can be on the top of your game one day and be on the bottom the next day. And so if it&#8217;s just about what you&#8217;re able to accomplish or what your paycheck is, then that definition is a bad definition because it always puts you in a situation where you&#8217;re always looking at the material or you&#8217;re looking at what people pay you to be creative. And I need to be creative because that&#8217;s how I live and breathe. I need to do that for free because that&#8217;s who I am. I need an outlet because it&#8217;s inside of me and it needs to come out. And so success is keeping my word to myself. Being able to say, I&#8217;m about to go do this. I don&#8217;t know whether I&#8217;ll be able to accomplish it. I&#8217;m scared even, but you know what, that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m about to go do.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m thankful that that&#8217;s the way that I see it because when I went to Hampton it was great to be taught about work ethic because it continued to build on the same lessons as my grandfather or my grandma or my mom when they tell you, when you cutting the grass down south and it&#8217;s real hot, you know this you got to be inside before 10:59 in the summer, you cutting that grass or else you going to be faced down in the grass. And so knowing that I was taught by people who were doing things and who had integrity and who said, if you&#8217;re going to cut the grass and cut it right. If you&#8217;re going to sweep the floor, sweep it right. But to know that when I went to Hampton that those foundational lessons from those people in my own family and community, to know that that was the beginning of my education in my family.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
To then go on to Hampton and be taught if they ask you for five, then do 55 and choose the best five. That lesson had already been laid. It was just built on to then go to New York and wonder whether I could compete. Even though I graduated Hampton with a resume, I had a Disney internship, also worked at Hampton University had a microgravity collaboration so I was able to work with NASA and the Smithsonian several times, but I knew I still needed more. So then when I went to Pratt, not knowing whether I could compete in New York being scared to death. I&#8217;m moving to New York and then being like I&#8217;m moving to New York, both that was excitement mixed with fear because New York has everything you&#8217;ve ever wanted and everything you&#8217;ve never wanted rolled into one.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
But knowing that, you know what, I&#8217;m going to go test myself on the biggest stage that I could find as a Southern boy from the country. Can I do it? I don&#8217;t know. So let me go test, let me go see. And to know that I didn&#8217;t know whether I could, but I did know that I wasn&#8217;t going home. And to know that all you have to do is say that to yourself one time, but you got to spend every day meaning it and being able to keep your word to yourself despite having to fight through alcoholism and drug abuse. I think I learned the importance of what success is and how I define it because I didn&#8217;t have control over my own, what I said my choices. And I knew that when I got so far into addiction that I couldn&#8217;t keep my word to myself. I said, I&#8217;m not going to drink anymore. I said, I&#8217;m not going to get high. I couldn&#8217;t keep that promise to myself. That&#8217;s when it scared me.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s when I realized that that&#8217;s what success is. If you can make a promise to yourself or say something to yourself and then follow through with that, that is successful. And if you can define it that way, then you&#8217;re not as a creative person looking right and left and being afraid of people who are talented as well. You&#8217;re looking right and left and you&#8217;re being inspired whenever you see somebody do their best, because you understand that you&#8217;re competing against yourself. You&#8217;re trying to be better than you were last time. You&#8217;re trying to beat your best time the last time. You&#8217;re trying to get higher.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And when you know that it&#8217;s you competing with you, then it&#8217;s very easy to understand that that&#8217;s what, in the way that I&#8217;ve found what success is and how to define it. It&#8217;s not about what I&#8217;ve been able to achieve. It&#8217;s not about fact that I own my home in Brooklyn, it&#8217;s not the fact that I&#8217;ve been able to become chair and I&#8217;ll be able to lay that down before I&#8217;m even 45. It&#8217;s really about just being able to keep my word to myself. That&#8217;s success.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? Like after, hopefully this pandemic is a thing of the past and whatever sort of new world or new reality we end up coming into. Like what kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good question because I think knowing that those new skills that I&#8217;ve been able to develop in this pivot operations, new systems design, forecasting, decision-making all of those things are a part of what I&#8217;m going to write about. Because I think on the one hand as creative people, we have to keep changing what we learn in order to keep doing the same thing. So I like to look at the timeline back in the day you learn Flash and then you could even learn ActionScript. And then now none of that is even there anymore and so I think the fact that we have to keep learning to typefaces, you got to learn how to do Basecamp, you got to learn Slack, you got to learn all these different ways to do the exact same thing. Strategy and marketing, all those skills or things that we needed to add in order to be a better creative person in my perspective, that&#8217;s why I wrote the book.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
But I think that now in this new world, learning how to make decisions, my son is so funny, learning how to make those decisions, learning how to lead and developing those skills I want to write about that. I want to continue to develop a body of thought leadership around that. But I think obviously I also want to put those skills into practice. But I think just going back fundamentally, I want to turn my book back into an online class. That&#8217;s how Creative Strategy and the Business of Design started, I wrote a four lesson online class for how design university is not even there anymore. But it did really, really well and so I was able to leverage that into writing a book. But now since things are shifted, I want to turn the content back into an online class because I never want to lose touch with teaching people, reaching students, whether they&#8217;re professionals or whether they&#8217;re pursuing some sort of credential or degree.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
So I want to always be able to say, do as I do versus do what I say, whether that&#8217;s to my sons as an example, or whether that&#8217;s to my students. I want to be able to reach them through reason and reach them through understanding that I&#8217;m never going to waste their time. And so in order to be useful in the boardroom, in the classroom or at home, wherever, I want to always do the things that I&#8217;m asking people to do, I want to lead from the front. I want to show them that I&#8217;m not going to ask you to do anything that I&#8217;m not willing to do, or haven&#8217;t done for a client. And so I want to make sure that I can continue to be a teacher, continue to be an example. Because even though I went to Hampton, there was no black design professors when I went to Hampton University, HBCU. There was no black design professors at Pratt. There were no black strategy professors at NYU. And then I became a strategy professor. I became a design professor.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And so I think the type of work I want to do is whatever&#8217;s going to allow me to use me as an example for people who didn&#8217;t see themselves. And I think that whatever that looks like is where I want to offer my skills, but I also want to make sure that wherever I&#8217;m offering my skills is a place that appreciates what I bring. And so I think I&#8217;m open to the world and really thinking about other countries and thinking about other places or I can stay right here in Brooklyn. But I think whatever I do I want to feel like I belong. I want to feel like I&#8217;m contributing to a culture that is striving to be relevant to as many people as possible and taking down those walls. So whatever that looks like that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m interested in. I just don&#8217;t know what that is.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And therefore, I think in being able to be comfortable with what I&#8217;ve been able to achieve in such a short period of time, whether that&#8217;s in my current role or whether that&#8217;s just as somebody who has not even made it to 45 yet, I feel like I&#8217;ve been able to move in and out of spaces after being effective or as effective as possible. And being able to be comfortable with that success and then say, you know what? I don&#8217;t know what the next step is. Just like I didn&#8217;t know whether I could compete in New York and that fear is always mixed with excitement, but I got my own back. I believe that whatever I do, apply my skills to I&#8217;ll figure it out. I&#8217;ll be able to bring something to it in the way that I do.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And so I know that there&#8217;s some place that is exactly where I would thrive because in answering this question, I think I&#8217;m trying to acknowledge the fact that as the world shifts, which is where you started with the question, you can sort of find yourself misaligned, whether that&#8217;s in the country you&#8217;re in, based on how they actually treat children, or how they treat elders. You could find yourself misaligned in the culture you&#8217;re in at your job based on how they are or not dealing with the pandemic. You can find yourself misaligned in so many different&#8230; The society that you&#8217;re in based on whether they do or don&#8217;t live up to the mission statement that&#8217;s in the Pledge of Allegiance, right? One nation under God with liberty and justice for you all.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
I think we&#8217;re in this situation where because the whole world is being rethought I think it&#8217;s okay to not know what the next step is and to really sort of rethink the decisions that you had already taken for granted. Because that&#8217;s what we do in our profession, right? Like we sort of have to organize that chaos and question the answers that our clients come to us with that used to work six months ago, or a year ago in our case with COVID and really rethink what was the answer before, because the environment shifted.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
And so maybe that&#8217;s not the answer anymore so that we can turn, find those insights and then execute on whatever that plan is. And that&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve been moving through teaching. That&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve been moving through speaking, how I&#8217;ve been moving through writing, how I move through creating solution for my clients, but it&#8217;s also how I approach my career decisions. And so I might not know what&#8217;s next, but I do know that in questioning the answers, I am asking questions about things that were settled, I&#8217;m reopening areas that were given and I&#8217;m excited about that. That uncertainty excites me. Yes, it&#8217;s scary, but I&#8217;m excited about it. And so I don&#8217;t know what that means, but I do know that in order to keep my word to myself, in order to continue to test myself that I will be adding additional challenges. I just don&#8217;t know what they are right now. And I&#8217;m comfortable with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>

Sounds good. Well, Douglas Davis, I want to thank you again, just so much. I mean, one for taking time out to come on the show, but to really be so open and honest and candid. And I think also just thoughtful about not just the work that you do, but how it impacts the society and world around you. And really like take the time to think about just where we are in this current point in history and what that means for us as designers, what it means for you and I, and others as black people, as minorities. Thank you just so much for opening up and sharing all that, I really appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Douglas Davis:</b><br>
I appreciate you having me, Maurice. Thank you for having me back. I&#8217;m thankful, I believe in your venue, I share your posts because I believe in what you&#8217;re doing. I believe in who you are, and I&#8217;m thankful that I can call you a friend. So thank you for having me.</p>

<p>This week&#8217;s guest is a real treat for me. Sean Mack is an illustrator and graphic artist in Detroit, and I first ran across his work around a decade or so ago on Tumblr. His work has really taken off since then, so having him on to talk about his journey as an artist was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>We started off talking about his recent work on a commemorative comic for the late hip-hop artist MF DOOM, and Sean went into how he and writer Brandon Howard came up with their popular comic <a href="https://therevtimes.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">The Revolutionary Times</a>. We also talked about balancing his art while working a 9-to-5 job, working with big clients, and creating new work through the pandemic. If you&#8217;ve never heard of Sean or seen his art, then this interview is a great place to start!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
My name is Sean Mack. I&#8217;m a graphic artist, illustrator, graphic designer, comic book artist, storyboard artist, just all-around graphic artist, mostly all art, basically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, so, how are you feeling right now? How&#8217;s the year going so far?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
The year has been challenging. I&#8217;ve been trying my best to keep up with things, keep up with my craft, keep trying to stay the right path for the most part. I think I&#8217;m doing an okay job.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, you sound like &#8230; What&#8217;s the guy&#8217;s name in Kung Fu that has to walk the path? I forget his name, played by David Carradine.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Oh, I know who you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;re trying to walk the righteous path.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Right, right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me about what kind of projects you&#8217;re working on right now.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Mostly freelancing at the moment. I just got done with a tribute comic for the rapper MF Doom.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
It&#8217;s nothing like anything official. It&#8217;s just a nice, small, short story that covers his career in an entertaining way. I&#8217;m not too sure when that&#8217;s coming out. It&#8217;s still in the process of being produced. But, that should be coming out this year, and then just a few freelance projects here and there, just a couple &#8230; music stuff, covers for musicians and so on and so on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Were you a big MF Doom fan?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I was, I was. I wasn&#8217;t the biggest MF Doom, but I loved the music that he put out. I think it was &#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say weird, but it was weird. It was weird and it was eclectic. It was something I had never heard before, something I had never heard put together before quite like the way he made music. So, when he died, I was like, &#8220;Ooh.&#8221; That was a heavy one. So, just to be able to do this comic, it was pretty cool, actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, the way the news came out especially with his wife saying he actually had passed away months prior, and she had just, I guess, waited until the end of the year to drop the news. Not many people know this, but, I think every episode, most episodes of Revision Path that I recorded here in my little makeshift studio, there&#8217;s a 24&#215;36&#8243; poster of Madvillain to my right.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if many people know how much of an MF Doom fan I am, but yeah, when I heard that, man, that got me. I got the action figure. I got all the CDs. I got the magnets. I got a bunch of stuff, MF Doom patches and stuff. Man, what a loss, what a loss. How did you get involved with doing a tribute comic to him?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
So, I am friends with &#8230; Her name is Maia Crown Williams. She actually was the person who helped put it together. It&#8217;s written by a great writer by the name of Troy Allen. She basically was what got me involved with the project because she&#8217;s known me over the years. She runs a comic convention out in Detroit called MECCAcon, and I&#8217;ve done it once before. We&#8217;ve just been in touch over the years because she likes my work. She thinks I&#8217;m cool. So, when he was looking for artist, she hit me up to do a test drive for what would be the final comic. He liked what I did and it was just history from there on. He just knocked it out over the, I think, last month or so. Well, yeah, I worked on the art the last month or so, and, right now, it&#8217;s still in the post-production stage of everything. So, it turned out pretty good, I would say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, hopefully they put it up for sale or just have it online somewhere where people can take a look at it because he has a legion of fans around the world, me included. That sounds pretty dope.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve only seen a few of the finished pages so far, and they look phenomenal. I really like how it&#8217;s turning out. I think people will dig it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, now, you mentioned doing some album covers, some music covers and stuff. You&#8217;re kind of connected with a music company, is that right, called Soulstar?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah [crosstalk 00:09:25]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Soulstar is actually Musiq Soulchild&#8217;s company.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh!</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, Musiq Soulchild, that&#8217;s his imprint for not only his regular music Soulchild stuff, but his side passion projects as well. I&#8217;ve actually had a chance to work on all facets of those projects, so that&#8217;s been pretty cool to do. Yeah, that&#8217;s Musiq&#8217;s &#8230; I think it&#8217;s his label and his imprint at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, that name takes me back all the way to, God, maybe freshman, sophomore year in college, the year 2000. Oh my goodness, it&#8217;s funny you mention that because I know he&#8217;s done some work with India Arie. Oh my God, this was years ago I had designer for India Arie on the show, Denise Nicole Francis. This was years and years ago. I don&#8217;t know if that name sounds familiar to you or not, but I know they&#8217;ve done some work together in terms of doing design and imprint and stuff. So, when you&#8217;re working with a label like that, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s more than just album covers and stuff. What all kind of stuff are you designing?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been like his side projects and whatnot. I don&#8217;t know if I can&#8217;t talk about one of them because we&#8217;re still working on it, so it&#8217;s still behind the scenes. But for the most part, I had designs for logos like certain badges for his certain personas, his musical personas. That&#8217;s where his side projects came in. So, for instance, I had a badge for just Musiq Soulchild. And then, there was a badge for his persona called The Husel, which is like his rap hybrid persona. And then, there was another one called P. WondaLuv, Purple WondaLuv, and that was his Prince, funk-inspired persona. I did badges for all of those. I also did covers for them, as well. I did the latest album that came out, Feel the Real. I did the artwork for that one, and then his Husel side project and his P. WondaLuv side project. I did the art for that, as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Very cool. I can imagine there&#8217;s no shortage of interesting and creative ideas that he can come up with that now he can just turn around and have you work on. That&#8217;s pretty dope.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
The thing I don&#8217;t think most people know about Musiq is that he is a very, very creative dude. He is also very &#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say nerdy, but he very much embraces geek culture, and that&#8217;s how we connected through our love for stuff like anime and comics and whatnot. The stuff that I work for him, a lot of that influence shows. It showed in the concept and just execution of it, so that was a very cool thing to find out, working with him.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I first found out about you and your work years and years and years ago through Tumblr. You have a comic called The Revolutionary Times.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, so, The Revolutionary Times, it&#8217;s a comic started by me and my longtime friend Brandon Howard. He&#8217;s the writer. I&#8217;m the artist. We started it back in 2008 while I was still in college at the time. We were just inspired by &#8230; Boondocks was off the comic kind of thing for a while. It ventured into TV shows, so we were just like, &#8220;There&#8217;s not many Black comic strips out,&#8221; at the time, so we were just like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s start something. Let&#8217;s start something.&#8221; We were inspired by Boondocks. We were inspired by, obviously, the classics like Charlie Brown, Calvin and Hobbes, and we just put our own personal lives and mixed it with pop culture, mixed it with politics. It just turned into this comic that we&#8217;ve been doing for a while. It&#8217;s been off and on, but we&#8217;re still in the midst of trying to push more comics out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where did that idea &#8230; I guess you alluded to it. Now, you were inspired by the Boondocks and other similar types of comics, but where did that idea first come from outside of that? You just wanted to fill the void that you felt was left behind from those comics?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, because, originally, it&#8217;s all Brandon&#8217;s idea. He came to me one day. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Man, you still drawing?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yo, I&#8217;m in college right now. Yes.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Man, let&#8217;s do a comic.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yeah, let&#8217;s do a comic.&#8221; And then, he just came up with these ideas, these references to pop culture, to politics that was just amazing, and I helped with some of the humor part of it as well. The way it flowed, it was just amazing. Originally, yeah, it was all Brandon. I was just the guy with the pencil at the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you all have still kept up with it. I think the latest one that I saw, it was Madea protecting [Peria Megan 00:15:27] from Security or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, that was a quick one we had to put out because we just had to. It&#8217;s just one of the many crazy things that come across our minds that we say, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s make a comic about this.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know that The Boondocks was supposed to come back on HBO Max last year. Maybe hopefully it will happen this year. Certainly, I would love to see what the next season would be of just what they could pull off. I personally don&#8217;t count the fourth season of The Boondocks. The first three seasons were great. Season four, eh, it was all right. It was okay. I want to see what they come up with for the fifth season.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, I think they pushed it back to later this year. But, I look at the fourth season of Boondocks the same way I look at &#8230; what was that season? The third season of The Chappelle Show. I look at it the same way as that. It doesn&#8217;t exist. It&#8217;s nonexistent in my mind or in my history.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I rewatched it recently because I got HBO Max and I was going through it and everything, and I rewatched the fourth season just to see if maybe I missed something. I think I was watching it like everyone else was watching it on Twitter. They&#8217;ll watch it and give commentary and stuff. It was not hittin&#8217; at all. They had that weird sort of Good Times reference that strung through the whole season. What the fuck was that about? It was not good. It was not good.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Right, and then they tried to spoof Breaking Bad. It was just weird. It was weird.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, they were doing what I see sitcoms do when they run out of ideas in that they sort of start making up these fantastical parodies, and it&#8217;s like the show itself is already a bit of a fantastical parody. You don&#8217;t need to try to mimic something else. Yeah, why are they mimicking Breaking Bad? What&#8217;s that about? Are they just trying to cash in on that cultural moment? I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s just not good.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, so, hopefully, I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing with the newest &#8230; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a reboot season. I don&#8217;t even know. I hope this one is a little bit more Aaron McGruder [crosstalk 00:17:58]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I really hope he&#8217;s out there creating some heat because even Black Jesus was funny, and then it was on this weird hiatus. You&#8217;d catch and episode here or there. It was almost like Steven Universe. It didn&#8217;t stay on a regular schedule. You just had to catch it when you could catch it. So, I hope so, man, because so many people are missing his humor and everything. I don&#8217;t know. So, when it comes to creating comics, what does your process look like?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Well, it depends. For instance, with Revolutionary Times, the script itself, the scriptwriting itself is more so me and Brandon bouncing ideas back and forth recently, yeah. And then, when it comes time for me to actually create the work, I pull up all my references, background references, character references, and I just have them set up in another monitor. I have like, three monitors. I have one monitor for my main art program, and then the others for my reference to just look at while I work. The process is basically just putting all that together to try and tell a story, trying to tell a cohesive story, sometimes without words. It&#8217;s a long process. It can definitely be a long process, but I&#8217;m getting the hang of it, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you say character references, what do you mean? Do you have a file with information on a character or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, for instance, if I&#8217;m drawing, like Madea, I have pictures pulled off of Google of Madea or Tyler Perry or, what are they called, the royal guards. I have them all set up on one screen just to glance at as I sketch out to draw everything into the final, basically. Then, I use that for if I&#8217;m coloring it, if I&#8217;m doing the actual colors. I&#8217;m using that same picture as a pallette to get the right colors, color flats on the characters, basically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, I gotcha. What is the design scene like in Detroit? I&#8217;ve only had a handful of folks on the show that are in Detroit and working as designers. But, for you, what&#8217;s the design scene like there?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
It&#8217;s kind of hard for me to explain about it because, this whole year, everyone&#8217;s been stuck inside, so it&#8217;s hard to describe it. We have our design firms and whatnot. And then, you have the freelancers, the people who are just the wild guns of the design industry. I would say that, art-wise, Detroit is building a lot, I would say. Design-wise, like I said, there&#8217;s the firms. Art-wise, there&#8217;s a &#8230; What is it called? It&#8217;s called murals in the market. Well, they didn&#8217;t do it this year, unfortunately, of course, but they have it set up in the place called East St. Market where they pull a bunch of murals, paintings from around the city, and they go around that East St. Market area and they&#8217;re making murals on different buildings, and you get to see the sea of different styles all around you. It&#8217;s one of the most amazing things I&#8217;ve ever gotten a chance to see. I hate that I couldn&#8217;t &#8230; It just wasn&#8217;t a thing this year because of the pandemic, but, art-wise, Detroit is booming quietly but steadily, I would say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We have something similar like that here down in Atlanta called Living Walls, sort of like a muralist fest. Well, actually, it&#8217;s an art organization. They put on an event also called Living Walls. They do little murals &#8230; not little murals. They&#8217;re huge. They&#8217;re on the sides of buildings and stuff. Of course, we have underground artists and such that do all kinds of different interesting interpretations of murals like Fabian Williams, occasional superstar. I live in the hood. For folks that don&#8217;t know that live in Atlanta, I live in the West End. So, there&#8217;s a Caribbean restaurant near me called Mango&#8217;s, and, on the side of that building, he&#8217;ll do different sorts of murals.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think the last one I saw, which had to have been prior to the pandemic, which lets you know how far I&#8217;ve gone outside my apt. It was Martin Luther King, but I think he had a high-top fade and had cuts on the side or something like that. So, he&#8217;s done these modern/&#8217;80sish interpretations of civil rights figures. There&#8217;s Coretta Scott King, but she&#8217;s got an asymmetrical bob, Pepa from Salt-N-Pepa, something like that. But yeah, Atlanta is a big mural city like that, especially if you&#8217;re downtown. If you go outside of downtown, outside of the perimeter, I can&#8217;t be responsible for what you see once you leave outside of the actual city. But, in the city itself, there&#8217;s so much graffiti and murals and wall art and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve been to Atlanta, I think, once or twice, and I&#8217;ve seen some of the graffiti there. It&#8217;s amazing, so I get an idea of what you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, before we get more into your career, let&#8217;s take it back to the beginning. In your bio, you mentioned that you grew up in Saginaw, Michigan. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Ah, Saginaw, Michigan, Saginaw Michigan &#8230; Growing up in Saginaw, Michigan was an experience. Saginaw is a very small town. Well, I take that back. It&#8217;s not a small town, but, if you compare it to someplace like Detroit, it&#8217;s small. Growing up there, I&#8217;m not going to say I had it rough. I lived in the suburban part of Saginaw, but it was just a small town. Everybody knew everybody. If you&#8217;re from Saginaw, it&#8217;s like that Kevin Bacon &#8230; What is that thing called?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, like Six Degrees of Separation?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yes, yes, Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, that is basically living in Saginaw. You know everybody or somebody knows you from somebody. But, living there, it built me up. It built who I became to be, and that&#8217;s &#8230; I&#8217;ve fallen in love with art. We don&#8217;t really have an art scene, well, not that I know of, now. At the time, there wasn&#8217;t really an art scene in Saginaw, but there was always comic book stores, and that is where I found my love for art, in the comic book store. My folks would take me to a 7-Eleven, and there would be that lonely stand of comics just rotating in my face. That&#8217;s where the love came from. And then, I found actual comic book stores to just peruse and look at. It just grew out from there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Marvel or DC?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I am neutral.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Aw, come on! Okay, all right.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I&#8217;m sorry. I have a ton of favorites on both sides. I love Batman. I love Spider-Man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Did you watch the Snyder cut of Justice League?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I did. That, I&#8217;m still astounded by the differences that that movie has. I watched the original one, the Wheaton version before I watched the Snyder one, and it&#8217;s just night and day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Really?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yes, man. It&#8217;s just so night and day. I&#8217;m still astounded by it. I don&#8217;t think there has been a director&#8217;s cut that is this drastically different from what was put into the theater since Blade Runner. That&#8217;s how I feel about it. I loved it. I loved the Snyder cut. I&#8217;m sad that it wasn&#8217;t the first movie that I saw in 2017, but I&#8217;m glad it came out because it was everything a comic book person would probably want.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Does it help if you watch it from a 2017 perspective? Because, that&#8217;s when the original Justice League movie came out. I was wondering if it had aged over the years since it&#8217;s been in obscurity because of the studios and everything.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t think it aged, necessarily. There&#8217;s still a bad joke in there or two. There&#8217;s definitely some bad &#8230; not cringeworthy, but it&#8217;s eye-rollable, kind of.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s four hours. There&#8217;s got to be something in there that&#8217;s &#8230; Everything can&#8217;t be a hit.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
It&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s not. Have you seen it?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I have not seen it, and I refuse &#8230; Okay, refuse is a strong word. I don&#8217;t feel that DC has earned enough good will for me from their current movie offerings to sit through four hours of that.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Understandable, understandable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I did watch Justice League. Did I go to the movies to see Justice League? I don&#8217;t remember. I did see justice league. I have not seen Suicide Squad or the Harley Quinn movie. They just didn&#8217;t interest me, and that&#8217;s not so say I&#8217;m not a DC fan. I am a DC fan. I&#8217;m pretty split between marvel and DC, myself, but I feel like marvel does better live-action movies. DC does better animated movies.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, that&#8217;s definitely the case because the latest animation &#8230; No, I think the latest one we did was a Batman movie. But, the few animated ones that I&#8217;ve seen have been like, &#8220;This is the same company?&#8221; The quality is far beyond what you would get with the live-action stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right, but the writing is good. They all have a consistent art style. They have that kind of Bruce Tim art style and they take bold strokes in terms of storytelling. It&#8217;s not all canon types of things. You have Justice League Dark. I think they did one like with the apocalypse one. They take broad strokes in terms of storytelling that, of course, with live-action, would probably be expensive and risky to do. But, with animation, it&#8217;s probably cheaper, I would imagine.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, and that&#8217;s partly why it&#8217;s the more superior brand. But, I will say I did enjoy Birds of Pray. I enjoyed Shazam. That was a nice one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, Shazam was good! Shazam was good. I forgot about Shazam. That is a DC.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah. Shazam was good. Aquaman was good, but the fact that they shelved this version of Justice League is just one of the most baffling things in my entire viewpoint, because there had to be a way to just trim it down to two hours.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How long was the original Justice League?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
The one that came out in theaters?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
It was under two hours, I think.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
From what I&#8217;m guessing, Josh Wheaton reshot a whole bunch of everything, really, because even the endings are completely contrast of each other. It is an interesting thing just to see how different things movie came out to be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;re convincing me to see it because I don&#8217;t remember that much from the original Justice League except for the showdown where they all fought Superman, and I remember Cyborg, it felt like Cyborg was a bigger part of the story, or was at least a substantial part of the story in the original. And then, from what I&#8217;ve heard, he has a much more substantial role in the Snyder cut.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
So, the part where they&#8217;re fighting Superman, that&#8217;s still the same, still mostly the same thing. The way it ends is slightly different, but Cyborg is the main character in this movie to me. Once you get into the later parts of it, he is the heart and soul of this movie. I feel like I just repeated like a critic somewhere, [inaudible 00:31:20] but it&#8217;s the truth. It&#8217;s the truth. The fact that his entire storyline, which is cut for him to say booya at the end, it was weird to see. So, I would say, if you do watch it, watch it &#8230; because, it&#8217;s cut in chapters, so I would watch it in chapters, honestly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, so it&#8217;s not just a full four-hour slog. You can watch a chapter, come back to it?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, I would watch it in chapters because it&#8217;s worth to see. I think it&#8217;s worth seeing that version of the story.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, all right, you&#8217;ve convinced me. I say this like I won&#8217;t sit through and watch four hours of Bridgerton or something like that, so I can watch Justice League. You talked about earlier going to school for art. You went to Detroit College for creative studies. What was that like? What was your time like there?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
It was pretty interesting because, before that, I went to &#8230; My high school was called Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy, and it was a school that focused, basically, on sciences and arts. It had a heavy focus on the visual arts, performing arts like theater and dance. Then, you had your global studies, your biology, your scientific aspects. It was a unique school experience then, so it kind of prepared me for when I did move to Detroit to go to CCS. It was just more of an expansive view on art because I&#8217;m in this place where there&#8217;s different personalities, different styles. That was an eye-opener. That was a real introduction to just a lot of people that I still know to this day, honestly. It was eye-opening. It was a good experience for not only social-wise, but it was a good experience for me growing in my art, in my craft, because I learned so much at that school, and it&#8217;s just a lot of things that I still carry with me to this day, as it should, because it was expensive. It was just a good tool. The professors there were amazing, and they&#8217;re still people I still talk to to this day. They still help me out in my career, so I think it was a good experience. It was a good thing to utilize, still a good thing to utilize to this day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. It&#8217;s so interesting because I often hear the opposite from people that say they went to an arts college. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Eh, it was okay,&#8221; or that it didn&#8217;t really prepare them for going out into the working world, doing what they do. But, it sounds like you had a great experience. That&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Well, I would say there were those parts, too, the long nights of trying to finish projects. It was more so focused on our craft. There were classes here and there about the actually business side of the art world, but it was more so focused on bettering us as artists. I would say I learned more about the business side of illustration, for instance. I learned more so about the business side of that just through experience, honestly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Gotcha, gotcha, okay. What were some of your work experiences when you graduated?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
It was more so just freelancing because, when I graduated, I moved back to Saginaw, and then I was just more so freelancing, so it started off in event posters, mixtape covers, album covers, logos, and then it grew into more granter things like full-on album designs and full promotional designs or promotional releases or whatnot. Yeah, it just grew, and I started getting actual clients like Musiq or like ESPN or Complex.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I see you&#8217;ve done some work with some pretty big brands and big clients. When you look back at those past projects, what did they teach you?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Patience, patience, definite patience. I consider myself a pretty patient person as is, but freelance can bring a side out of you. I would say patience and just seeing a project through the end. I think, that part, a lot of people, it&#8217;s hard to get to the end, honestly, with some projects because of the time put in, the energy. There may be changes, and there are changes after changes. But, just seeing a project through to the end is one of the most satisfying things, no matter how you feel about the project itself. Just seeing it through the end is a satisfying feeling in itself, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Aside from that, you&#8217;ve also done a lot of collaborative projects. We talked about The Revolutionary Times, of course, being probably one of the bigger ones. But, for you, what&#8217;s the value of collaborating on projects?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I think collaboration opens your world up to other people&#8217;s viewpoints, other people&#8217;s creative world or creative ways of doing things. I think if you find that right person that you can mesh with, you could bring something pretty cool to the table. I&#8217;ve done, aside from working with Grid &#8230; and I&#8217;ve done collaborations with &#8230; There was one guy, his name was CJ Johnson. We worked on a full graphic novel. It was called Kill Or Be Killed, but it wasn&#8217;t some action type of graphic novel. It was a story about rich Black Manhattan type of people like bohemian style characters. It was just a story that you typically wouldn&#8217;t see in a comic book, just telling of a life of these classy but still kind of edgy characters. It was just something I had never done before because I was just used to doing funny comic strips and whatnot. That, for instance, is something that I always see as a good collaboration because it was a mixture of something that I&#8217;ve never experienced before, which, I think, bettered me as an artist to be able to tell CJ&#8217;s story. So, I think if you find that right collaborator, yeah, something magical might come out of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I&#8217;m mentioning this not in any sort of disparaging way, but you have a full-time job that doesn&#8217;t deal with art [crosstalk 00:39:28] I&#8217;m not going to ask you what that job is. I know you have a full-time job that doesn&#8217;t deal with art, but how do you balance the two? How do you balance having that extra time to pursue your creative passions?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
It is very difficult. It is almost impossible. There was, unfortunately, a year or two where it was impossible because of how this job just took out my energy. Well, I will say it is an essential job, so I was pretty much still working all last year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, so, last year being one of those years where it was just difficult to do art, it can get to you. It can overcome your passion. But, I think that you just got to find a balance. Because, at the time, it was impossible. It was impossible to really get a balance of work and getting time to be creative. But, I just had to set time aside because this is something I want to do. I don&#8217;t want to do this job, the essential job for the rest of my life. I want to do art for the rest of my life. So, I just had to set time, had to do what I can. It was just like taking a little sketchbook and sneaking in some art in the middle of the job. I had to do what I could just to be like, &#8220;Hey, I am still an artist. This is what I want to do.&#8221; So, it&#8217;s hard. It&#8217;s hard. I&#8217;m still dealing with it to this day, but it&#8217;s just something you just got to keep pushing for.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would it look like for you to be a full-time illustrator, or full-time graphic artist, I&#8217;ll say?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Definitely wouldn&#8217;t have to wake up at 4:00 in the morning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oof [crosstalk 00:41:33] my God.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s not fun. I would say just being able to spend time on projects whether it be just one main project or small multiple projects, just taking time out of my day to work on these different ideas. Because, in my head, I have a lot of ideas just running around in my head that I never have time to actually get out. But, being a full-time artist, that would open up that time to be like, &#8220;All right, this will be my hour of personal creativity, food, and then another hour of professional work, and whatnot.&#8221; It would just be a day full of creating, basically. That&#8217;s what I would want, just to be able to create whether it is just a sketch or something more polished, basically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of your artistic influences?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Names or genres?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Both.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
The first name that pops up in my head, his name is &#8230; Well, there&#8217;s a couple names, but John Romita Jr., Chris Bucello, Aaron McGruder, obviously, LeSean Thomas. He worked on The Boondocks, but he also has his own anime that&#8217;s on Netflix right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Cannon Busters or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yes, Cannon Busters, that&#8217;s exactly it. There&#8217;s a few other names. J. Scott Campbell, he did a comic book called Danger Girl.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, I remember Danger Girl. I actually have two of those issues, I think, of Danger Girl.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I loved Danger Girl. I loved his work, just how detailed his work was. Oh no, I&#8217;m going to ruin his name, the creator of Cowboy Bebop, Watanabe.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Watanabe, Shinichir≈ç Watanabe?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yes, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m a nerd over here. I know stuff.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Thank you, thank you. There&#8217;s like 1,000 others, but those are the ones that pop up to me first and foremost.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, Chris McCulloch work on early-stage Generation X and the &#8230; I think that had to be in the &#8217;90s or early 2000s. His work is so indelibly seared into my mind when I think about great comic work. He did some work for the larger X books, too. But, particularly with Generation X, I just have a big fondness for that team in general. They were done so dirty with that movie on Fox in &#8217;96. I think it was &#8217;96 when they had the Generation X movie.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Oh, I know exactly what you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s on YouTube. If you&#8217;re listening and you want to find it, first of all, buyer beware, i&#8217;s very bad. And, I think it was one of the first if not the first &#8230; well, not one of the first because I&#8217;m sure they had Fantastic Four shows and movies and stuff. But, to come out of the Mutant X kind of realm, Generation X was just so bad. I hate how bad it was.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
No, that was like the first live-action thing they did with X-Men, because they had the animated show and whatnot, but that was like the very first live-action. They went onto the movies, but yeah, that was-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, like, Jubilee was played by a white girl. Come on. It was so bad. It was so bad. And, they got a British woman to play Emma, but maybe Emma&#8217;s mom. She was way too old to be playing Emma. It was not good. It just wasn&#8217;t good at all. They deserve better. Although, I&#8217;m glad Monet, who was my favorite &#8230; I mean, I didn&#8217;t like how she was portrayed in the movie, but she was my favorite of the team, that she&#8217;s part of the main X Team now. Although, I still need to &#8230; I&#8217;m so behind on the comics, now, especially marvel stuff. I just catch a trade paperback here and there because that&#8217;s the best I can do these days.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s the best advice you&#8217;ve been given about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
This advice isn&#8217;t necessary exclusively on what I do, but it&#8217;s one that sticks with me the most. It&#8217;s advice that my dad always gives me whenever it involves a project or just anything, just life in general. But, it&#8217;s like, if you do something, do it to the best of your ability. And, if you do something, see it all the way through. That is literally what runs in my mind every time I do something. It&#8217;s just like, &#8220;If I do something, I have to do it to the point that, when you look at this, you know that I drew it. You know that I was a part of this project somehow and just being able to finish it all the way through.&#8221; Like I said before, it&#8217;s just a wonderful feeling no matter what project you do because it&#8217;s a feeling of accomplishments. So, I think it has nothing specifically to do with art, but, that advice that my dad gave me, that my dad gives me all the time, that&#8217;s the one thing that pops in my head all the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have a dream project that you&#8217;d love to do or that you&#8217;d love to work on one day?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I would love to storyboard for a movie. Well, I take that back. I would love, for instance, to make The Revolutionary Times into a movie. That&#8217;s a top goal, basically, but I would love to do some kind of work for a major production storyboarding or character design or something like that. A personal goal would be to draw a Deadpool comic. I don&#8217;t even have to do a series. Just give me a few pages or something. That&#8217;s definitely a goal. Yeah, I would just love to be able to work on something that&#8217;s a big production, just be able to have my style on something that&#8217;s going to be seen by millions of eyes. That&#8217;s something I would love to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is keeping you motivated and inspired these days?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I think the one thing that&#8217;s been motivating me has been &#8230; because I follow a lot of artists on all my social media, Twitter, Instagram, all that. Just seeing all this work that people are able to create, even in the midst of all this insanity that we&#8217;re dealing with, that&#8217;s inspiring to see the different styles, the different techniques, techniques that you could bring back to your own work and try and see if that&#8217;s something that you can adapt to your own style. That&#8217;s just the way of artists. You&#8217;re constantly growing. You&#8217;re constantly building yourself up to be like the better part of what you were before. You&#8217;re always transforming. You&#8217;re always evolving, basically.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
So, I think that&#8217;s one of the ways that I keep motivated, just trying to elevate myself, trying to see what I can do differently or see what I can mix up to create something that I haven&#8217;t done before. And then, there&#8217;s always just taking a day off and watching anime for a whole day. That&#8217;s one way to do it, as well. So, it&#8217;s a lot of ways. It&#8217;s a lot of ways that I&#8217;m trying to be inspired.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What shows are you watching right now?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Honestly, I&#8217;ve just been rewatching Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
That, when I&#8217;m down, when I&#8217;m not sure what to do, it&#8217;s always, just pull up Cowboy Bebop and running through a couple of those episodes. I did start rewatching Attack on Titan, which is traumatic, to say the least. There was another show that I just finished watching. It&#8217;s on Hulu. No Guns Life, I think it&#8217;s called. That&#8217;s what I started watching. It&#8217;s pretty good. It&#8217;s a pretty interesting concept to it. For the most part, I just go back to the classics. I&#8217;m always open for people to give me some new ones to catch because I feel like it&#8217;s like comics. That&#8217;s another thing that I&#8217;m trying to catch back up on because I&#8217;m still trying to find the new joints, basically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What genre of anime do you like the best? Comedy? Action? Supernatural?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I like a little bit of hybrid. I like the ones that have a mix of comedy and action to it. For instance, one of my favorite ones is Trigon. That has the comedy. That has the slapstick comedy, the action to it, the serious tones. So, that has a little bit of everything. I think the one that I fell in love with was the more so space-centered ones, because then you had Gundam. You had Cowboy Bebop, Outlaw Star, a lot of those space-centered stories. I would thank Toonami and the Syfy Channel for all that, but you know. I would say I like a mixture of all the genres, I would say, the hybrid ones where you have its funny moments. You have your stressful moments as well, so yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you see &#8230; God, what&#8217;s the one? You were mentioning one, and I was wondering if you saw it because it did come on Toonami, I think &#8230; not Toonami, Adult Swim. What was it called, Eureka Seven? Did you see that?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I did not see Eureka 7 no, that I haven&#8217;t seen. I think that&#8217;s one of the ones on my list that I have to sit down and watch. Yeah, I have a list of so many movies and anime that I just haven&#8217;t watched yet. It&#8217;s a long list, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m ever got to get through it at this point, but it&#8217;s on there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I&#8217;ll also give you a recommendation, but this one is pretty old school. I think it&#8217;s probably on &#8230; It&#8217;s got to be on one of the anime streaming services like Crunchyroll or VRV or something like that, but Legend of the Galactic Heroes. It&#8217;s an old one. It&#8217;s like an &#8217;80s anime, so it&#8217;s got that different kind of &#8217;80s anime style, but very complex storytelling. It&#8217;s set in space. It&#8217;s very much a space &#8230; I was going to say a space opera. That&#8217;s kind of the best way to put it. It&#8217;s like a military space opera kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
You said it&#8217;s called Legend of the Galactic Heroes?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Okay, all right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s pretty long, though. It&#8217;s over 100 episodes, so it&#8217;s not a quick one.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s not a quick watch.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Oh, it&#8217;s one of those, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think Eureka Seven is like 26, like a standard 26-episode thing, but it&#8217;s not as long as Naruto, which is like 500-something episodes or more.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, see, when you get to the shows that have like 1,500 seasons like Naruto and One Piece, I&#8217;m just not going to be able to get into that. I&#8217;ll enjoy the references along with everybody else, but I can&#8217;t sit down and watch 500 hours of Naruto. I&#8217;m sorry, I can&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think the last modern anime that I watched &#8230; I&#8217;m saying modern like within the past five years. It was either &#8230; It was a couple. It was SSSS.Gridman, which was pretty good. I watched [Personify 00:54:24] the animation because I played the video game, and, oh God, this one called Inuyashiki, which is &#8230; I&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s an acquired taste. I think it&#8217;s a 13-episode series. The protagonist is an old &#8230; I don&#8217;t want to spoil it, but the protagonist is an old man that is also a heavy robot arsenal. It&#8217;s an interesting [inaudible 00:54:50] I&#8217;ll put it in the chat so you can see it, but it&#8217;s an interesting story, Inuyashiki. There were some clips of it floating around in 2017 or so because I think Donald Trump is featured at some point in the anime. It&#8217;s kind of out there. I don&#8217;t want to say it&#8217;s morbid, but, you know what, you watch it and you tell me what you think about it. Also, for those of you that are out there listening, if y&#8217;all have seen it, let me know what you think about it. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Well, hopefully not waking up at 4:00 in the morning every day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Amen to that.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
The only thing I would definitely love to be saying that I would hoping to be doing I five years is just still doing art, still creating. I can&#8217;t honestly say what the next five years would look like, but I would just hope it has me creating something whether it&#8217;s illustration or even doing that big production, doing art for that. I just want to be able to keep &#8230; be able to create, basically, and, yeah, maybe I&#8217;ll be part of a studio or still doing my own thing freelancing. Or, maybe Brandon and I are able to take Revolutionary Times and make it to a bigger platform. It&#8217;s a lot to say. Five years, you never know. We didn&#8217;t know what last year would be like, so &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true. That&#8217;s very true.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
At this point, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t make any plans,&#8221; because life is very weird. Life is way too weird to make plans. Plan making is still important. Don&#8217;t go through life without a plan, but just know that life can always throw that one curve ball just like, &#8220;Oh, hey, there&#8217;s your plan in the bottom of the ocean somewhere.&#8221; I just would say I want to be able to still be creating in five years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, just to wrap things up here, Sean, where can our audience find out more about you and your work and your projects and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I guess the main place, Instagram, @silentsmack, all one word. I am on Twitter. Follow me if you want. It&#8217;s not much art on there, honestly. @ShizukaSam, I can&#8217;t spell it out right now, but @ShizukaSam on Twitter, and then @RevTimes on Twitter, @RevTimes on Instagram, and therevtimes.com for the comics. My personal site: smackillustrations.com.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Sean Mack, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. But, first of all, I was really just excited to talk to you because I&#8217;ve been following your work for such a long time, The Revolutionary Times and everything, so it was good to actually talk to you about the process and everything behind it. I think, certainly, with the work that you&#8217;re doing, the fact that you are such a keen collaborator and that you&#8217;re putting work out there that speaks to people, I hope that&#8217;s something that you will continue to keep doing throughout the years. I mean, the work that you&#8217;re doing, I could see this blowing up. I really can. We got to find a way to break you out of Michigan, but I can see your work blowing up in the next few years. So, hopefully, folks that are listening, make sure you check out Sean&#8217;s work. But, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
