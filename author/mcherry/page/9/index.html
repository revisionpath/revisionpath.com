Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>While the current creative industry tends to favor specialists, multidisciplinary creators like Reggie Perry Jr. know that being a generalist is what truly helps you stand out. He does it all &#8212; graphic design, photography, video and audio production, motion graphics and 3D, and a whole lot more! </p>
<p>Reggie told me about his work as a media experience designer at The Home Depot, and from there we talked about showcasing his skills through his own agency (Phox and Phoe) along with NYC-based creative and design studio The Future In Black. We also discussed some of his early career work for agencies, and he shared his tips on balancing creative work with family, as well as how he handles burnout and stays motivated to create so many self-initiated projects. </p>
<p>According to Reggie, with a plan and hard work, you can accomplish your creative goals. Now that&#8217;s some great advice!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
My name is Reggie Perry. My day job is Media Experience Designer at The Home Depot, and I also have a design agency that I do a lot of my freelance work through. That work includes a lot of motion graphics and animation work, video editing, photography, things of that nature. Pretty much across the board, creativity, even sometimes music production as well. Just a lot of different things that I do and have my hands in and kind of keeps it interesting for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s 2023 been treating you so far?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
2023 has been pretty good. A lot of good opportunities coming my way, which I&#8217;m grateful for and been working towards for several years now. So far so good and looking forward to seeing what the rest of the year brings.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have any plans for the upcoming Summer?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I do have some projects that are going to be released later in the Summer that I worked on earlier in the year. The people that I worked on those four, those should be coming out mid-Summer. I&#8217;m really excited to see where those go and what they do. Other than that, my day-to-day work and creating my own projects as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Let&#8217;s talk about your work at The Home Depot as a media experience designer. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve heard that title, but then again I feel like there&#8217;s a lot of titles these days that are, I guess they just represent different facets of design. When I came up, it was like you were a graphic designer, web designer, web developer, et cetera. Tell me, what is a media experience designer? What do you do at The Home Depot?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
In my role, I&#8217;m within the learning department, which is under the HR umbrella. Pretty much anytime someone joins the company, whether it&#8217;s in the store, whether it&#8217;s on the corporate side, supply chain, pretty much across the board, they have their training. It might be the orientations, it might be how to drive a forklift, it might be how to ring up a customer. Our responsibility is to work with the SMEs and the instructional designers to create the visual aspects of that. That&#8217;s photography, that can be shooting interviews, that can be motion graphics and animation, that could be creating job aids and just graphic design work. It pretty much touches on a lot of different aspects of design and just to basically support those associates across the organization.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. We just had someone on the show a few episodes ago, I don&#8217;t know if you might be familiar with them, but I think he also worked in education, Brandon Campbell-Kearns. Does that name sound familiar?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, the name sounds familiar for sure, but I&#8217;m not completely familiar.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Not that I expect all black designers at The Home Depot to know each other. I was like, &#8220;Well, he&#8217;s in Atlanta. He&#8217;s kind of worked in education.&#8221; But no, that sounds really, really interesting. So you&#8217;re kind of part of this overall education that&#8217;s responsible for, I guess, getting people onboarded and just learning about different parts and facets of working at Home Depot, it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, that as well as just ongoing learning. Whether it&#8217;s compliance training or if it&#8217;s a new best practice that rolls out, whether it&#8217;s surveys, it could be pretty much anything. We just work with all these different aspects of the business to create the visual aspects for them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does the team look like? You mentioned there&#8217;s some subject matter experts, some content people. What does that team usually look like?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I&#8217;m a part of the media team, so basically there is four of us and we&#8217;re all responsible for creating those visual assets. Then, an instructional designer or SME will come to us and say, &#8220;Hey, we have this project, we want to have these deliverables. What do you think would be best? What can it look like? What&#8217;s possible?&#8221; Then we kind of work with them to figure that out. Then we&#8217;ll schedule the shoots, or if I&#8217;m doing a motion graphic, it&#8217;s like, okay, they&#8217;ll send me the script, we&#8217;ll go over the scripts, figure out what assets we need, and then I build out that motion graphic. It pretty much just depends on the ask that we get. Then once they ask us, we kind of interface with these different people to create the final deliverable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like you probably have a steady stream of work that&#8217;s coming in because you&#8217;re doing it across the organization for a number of different initiatives or reasons or things like that,</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
It also ebbs and flows. For instance, this time of the year when people start going on vacation and stuff around Christmas time, it&#8217;s a little slow, and then sometimes it&#8217;ll be just nonstop back to back projects. It does ebb and flow, but there&#8217;s always consistent work. It&#8217;s cool because we actually get to see the work that we do out in the field. If we go into a store and somebody&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I just did this training, you did that? That&#8217;s pretty cool.&#8221; Or something like that. If we should an interview in a supply chain facility, and then that&#8217;s on the internal TV channel that&#8217;s on in up in all the facilities, that&#8217;s also cool as well. There&#8217;s a lot of different ways that our work gets out there and a lot of different aspects that we touch.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;ve been there for what, almost eight years now it looks like. How did you get started?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
2015. When I was working for this company called Digital Sherpa, they actually got bought out, I forget the name of the company. Yes, they&#8217;re actually in Atlanta, but oh, it&#8217;s CoStar. They got bought out by CoStar, so they closed down this whole section of the business. I was just looking for my next opportunity, and I had actually got into photography that Spring, so I was just shooting and shooting and shooting. Then actually my wife, who was my girlfriend at the time, her coworkers uncle was at Home Depot and they were looking for a content creator. I applied and she kind of did the introduction and then the rest is history. That&#8217;s kind of how I got on board. And that was within Crown Bolt, which is a subsidiary of Home Depot. They do door hinges and handles and shelf brackets and things like that. That&#8217;s where I started. Then after two and a half years I transitioned over to the learning team.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
As a content creator, were you doing pretty similar things to what you do now?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Basically, around that time was when there was a huge push for Home Depot to get all of their skews to have lifestyle photos and to have alternative angles for the images and to have videos on how to install these things. A lot of my work at that time was say if there was shelf brackets, here&#8217;s all the shelf brackets. We actually had a wall that was built with the drywall and everything, and we&#8217;d set everything up and then I would take pictures of it and then we&#8217;d change out the brackets and take pictures of that, and those will all be up on the website under the skew so you can see different angles and closeups and how to install it and things like that. That was more of the work I was doing at that time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a lot of, I guess now is this instructional work, because you mentioned this is on the website, so it&#8217;s under different products as well. Right?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Especially if you go to any e-commerce site and you look and they have seven or eight different images. One might be a video, one might be some of the directions, and then two or three may be different angles or different color options. I was creating those images basically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Okay. I think it&#8217;s good to sort of hear that this is a position that people actually do. I think when you look at different big box retail type sites, say maybe a Target or a Walmart, you might not think that all of those different photos and things like that are done in house. I think it&#8217;s good that people know that this is a type of position that you can do that&#8217;s still kind of in the realm of design at least.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
And even with Home Depot, there&#8217;s like a facility that&#8217;s south of Atlanta and pretty much most of the products that are sold in Home Depot, say it&#8217;s a Samsung refrigerator, they may send one of those refrigerators down there and they have this whole studio with cameras that&#8217;s going to capture images from 360 degrees. And then it&#8217;s like, have you ever seen those images of where the drawers would come out or the doors were open and you can kind of rotate it? They do that kind of stuff there as well. Even with that of building out a studio and shooting these products and then make turning them into 3D models and all that kind of stuff, there&#8217;s a lot of different positions and jobs around basically e-commerce and the imagery around it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Product imagery in general, I think in tech design, retail, et cetera, a lot of that is super important. And I think it&#8217;s good to know that one, it&#8217;s an in-house type of thing that you do, but it also sounds like it can be never ending because there&#8217;s probably always new products or like you said, the work you do now filters out into education within the organization, so there&#8217;s no shortage it sounds like, of work to do, which is a good thing, especially in this age of job security right now with layoffs and stuff. It sounds like you&#8217;re pretty set.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, it is never ending for sure. I remember in 2015-16, and I&#8217;m sure all the designers who are familiar with Photoshop will understand this, but it was like at that time I had to shoot every piece of plumbing hardware. If you go into Home Depot and there&#8217;s an aisle and it&#8217;ll have a thousand pieces of all these different just hoses and just all these different metal pieces and stuff, and I had to shoot all of those, and it was right before the AI got good enough to do the selection on its own without the pen tool. I had to go through and use the pen tool on like 2000 images/used the pen tool on 2000 images.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh my God. Wow. It also kind of entails, I guess a bit of bit of production design too, because like you said, you&#8217;re doing this at a time before the tools really were sophisticated enough to be able to make this a easier type of task.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
If I did it now, I would probably just create an action or a script and just run it [inaudible 00:11:43] in an hour.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of which, what is the most challenging thing about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I would say just managing expectations, honestly, because there are limitations to some of the deliverables that we do because a lot of these things will go out to stores across the country. Some might be in more rural areas and may not have the fastest internet, so we have to make sure the files are a certain size or we have to make sure you want to shoot this, but this might require a budget. You don&#8217;t really have a budget, so we need to scale it back. It&#8217;s just kind of figuring out and problem solving, but that&#8217;s kind of what design is anyway, so we have to figure out what&#8217;s the best solution for the learner that&#8217;s going to get the point across in the most efficient way within the tool sets or the parameters that we have.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We just talked a little bit about how the tools have gotten more sophisticated. How do things say AI and machine learning and things like that, do those sorts of things factor into the work that you do?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
They do, yeah. Some of the stuff, I&#8217;m actually doing a shoot on next week that we&#8217;re basically recording someone who does product videos and stuff so that we can turn them into an AI avatar. We have to record them with certain specifications and we have to do 15 minutes of video, like HD and all those kind of stuff. We&#8217;re just now starting to get experimenting with it. Some of the videos that we do, they&#8217;ll have AI voiceovers, things like that. For the most part it&#8217;s still kind of low key right now. We&#8217;re just now starting to get into it as far as Home Depot goes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I know we&#8217;re recording this right now at a time where there&#8217;s this big writer strike going on. WGA Union is striking and a lot of writers are striking. One of the sort of things that they want to be addressed by the industry, and I think this kind of maybe spills over into design a bit as well, I just haven&#8217;t seen that many conversations about it, it&#8217;s how do AI tools, et cetera, how do they reshape the work that we&#8217;re doing? Is it replacing it in some way? Is it making it better? Is it making it worse? And just even what you&#8217;re mentioning with this AI avatar and things like that, do you see a future where AI is going to play a more pivotal role in the work that you do?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Honestly, it&#8217;s been around for a long time and it&#8217;s been in a lot of the programs that a lot of us designers are using. Anyway, a year ago I learned Unreal Engine and with the MetaHumans and doing a mesh to MetaHuman and all this stuff, that&#8217;s AI, machine learning that&#8217;s building all that out. You can take a picture of your face and turn yourself into a 3D avatar. There&#8217;s a program that I use called Cascadeur I believe it&#8217;s called, yeah. You basically set your key frames and then it will use AI to interpolate the motion in between it, but also to add the physics to it, realistic physics and things like that. Things like that to me are very, very useful. I think with as far as the image creation and everything, it&#8217;s great for coming up with ideas, but I can also see that it definitely has a look to it, so everything&#8217;s going to kind of start looking the same. You just got to figure out your own way to use it and make your workflow more efficient.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think certainly now with the fact that these tools are so commonplace to use a Midjourney or DALL-E or things like that, and you&#8217;re starting to see larger companies kind of dip their toe into it as well. Microsoft has a tool called Microsoft Designer where you can just sort of put in a prompt and it will generate some AI images. I tried it. Not that good, to be completely honest. It wasn&#8217;t that great. I was like, oh, this is trash. I wasn&#8217;t expecting Rembrandt level work, but I mean, interns could do better work than this. Adobe does something similar. They have Adobe, I think it&#8217;s called Adobe Firefly. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Adobe Firefly that does a similar thing. I agree with you about the look. A lot of the AI art and stuff I&#8217;ve seen has a specific look. Granted, I know that those looks have been cribbed off of actual artists and such, so it&#8217;s not even original in that respect.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how AI plays out with, I think things like say interface design and stuff like that, where there are more set patterns and things that you could probably create complete UI toolkits or something like that just based off of a prompt. I&#8217;m interested to see where this goes. I would love to see more of the digital design community talk about it. I haven&#8217;t seen a lot of talk about it. Maybe I&#8217;m not looking in the right place, but I would love to see more talk about how this sort of influences the work that we do because I&#8217;ve gotten some people that I&#8217;ve had on the show where freelancers, for example, they&#8217;ll say a client may come to them with an image or something that they created in AI and expect the human artist to change it or to make it better or to improve it in some sort of way, which is like, is that what the future&#8217;s going to be? I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s still, I think, a little early to tell kind of how this will really play into the work that we do.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, I did see a video last week, I think it might have been on Vox, and it was this AI artist, which he was doing it in a way that I thought was really cool because what he would do was he would create images, but he would do several different passes of these images and do the in painting and out painting and all this stuff. He was basically putting himself in all these different locations, like he was taking a selfie of himself. He would then take all of these images and put them in the Photoshop and he&#8217;d take different sections of them and mask stuff out and add stuff to it, and then do all the color grading. At the end of it looked like a totally different image, and I thought that was pretty cool and a very unique way to actually use it instead of just saying, &#8220;Here&#8217;s some prompts, here&#8217;s an image, I&#8217;m going to throw some text over it and I&#8217;m done.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Right now I think we&#8217;re seeing AI start to flood the workplace in different ways. I mean this will affect what we do as creatives ostensibly, but I&#8217;m just going to be interested to see how this plays out because I think the point of mainstream adoption is probably still a bit a ways away, but seeing what&#8217;s happened within the past nine months around the explosion of AI in layman type tools has been just astonishing to see. It reminds me a lot of the early, early web and how those early days in, I don&#8217;t know, early two thousands. Innovations were just happening left. Trying to keep up was wild. You might have been doing something now, but in two weeks that&#8217;s going to be obsolete because now there&#8217;s this new way to do it. It&#8217;s really amazing to see how it&#8217;s changing things now.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, along with this full-time work that you do at the Home Depot, you have this design agency called Phox and Phoe that you started right as the pandemic started in 2020. What brought that on?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, so basically I&#8217;ve always been doing some freelance work for the last 10 or 12 years, and I wanted to just create my own design agency and entity and build that up and build client lists and everything like that. Basically at the beginning of the pandemic, a few clients had hit me up. So that&#8217;s kind of when I started it, just so I can have everything, my paperwork right, my bank account, all that kind of stuff. I named it after two of my kids, Phox and Phoenix, so Phox and Phoe Agency. Basically when I was going into the office, I&#8217;d be getting up at 4:45 because I live a little bit North of Atlanta, and I had to drive all the way an hour to work. So I&#8217;d just get up, go to work, come back, I&#8217;d get home at 5:30, and then I would really wouldn&#8217;t really have any time.</p>
<p>Once the pandemic started and I was at home, I was like, oh, I&#8217;m getting back three or four hours of my day. Let me really dig into this and start to build up my portfolio and build up my client list. At the same time as well, literally probably a month before the pandemic started, I started getting into 3D design. I was like, oh, I got all this time. Let me really dig into it and build and build and build. Now, three years later, three and a half years later, there&#8217;s a lot of opportunities that have come my way. There&#8217;s stuff in the works that I&#8217;m working on right now that it&#8217;s pretty big and it&#8217;s pretty cool to see an idea that I had four or five years ago be a reality in current time. So it was just something I always wanted to do. I just wanted to have my agency and design and make music and shoot videos and photography. So I just made it happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s that been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been going pretty good. It&#8217;s pretty consistent for the most part. Of course, it ebbs and flows. It&#8217;s just kind of the nature of freelance. I also don&#8217;t take on work just to take on work. I&#8217;m kind of intentional about the work that I do. I worked really hard over the last 10 or 12 years to be able to ask for the rates that I ask for and all of these kind of things. It&#8217;s like I just don&#8217;t take on any work. For the most part, it&#8217;s pretty good. It&#8217;s an extra stream of income, it&#8217;s a good stream of income. So I have no complaints about it. I think that I&#8217;m about ownership, I&#8217;m about entrepreneurship. That&#8217;s just kind of how I grew up. A lot of the people I grew up around own businesses and things like that. It&#8217;s always just kind of been in me anyway.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think it&#8217;s a great thing to have your own side business, especially when it&#8217;s not something that you&#8217;re 100% completely reliant on. You&#8217;ve got exactly your full-time gig, and so you can be a lot more, I guess picky is probably the best word, but you could probably be a lot more judicious with, as you mentioned, the projects you take on, the clients you work with, because you don&#8217;t have to have this in order to survive. You can pick and choose the type of work that you do.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ve definitely been in the position before of trying to grow business and it needed to support me and I needed to survive from it. That could be a very, very stressful. I&#8217;ve been in positions when I had a job and my side stuff started going well, and I quit my job, and then the side stuff wasn&#8217;t going so well. You know what I mean, I&#8217;ve done it. I&#8217;ve pretty much ran the gambit on all that kind of stuff. I could can pick and choose on what I work on. I still pretty much keep the same schedule when I wake up and go to sleep anyway. I don&#8217;t have to commute. I don&#8217;t have to get ready for work, I just walk downstairs. Instead of just sleeping in or doing whatever, I&#8217;ll just work out and then sit down at my computer and use that time where I would be sitting in the car to create and work on side projects and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve definitely been there with my studio before, so I know what it&#8217;s like when it has that kind of ebb and flow. In some years it&#8217;s good, some years it&#8217;s not. I think even with how the industry changes, I&#8217;ve recently kind of started getting back into doing more freelancing because I worked in tech roughly for about the past five years I&#8217;ve worked with different tech startups. After this last layoff, I was like, &#8220;You know what? Let me try to dip my toe back into freelancing and see what I can do.&#8221; I&#8217;m still taking on some projects kind of here and there. It&#8217;s a lot different now doing it in my 40s than when I did it in my twenties.</p>
<p>The good part about it is I can be a bit more, I guess, cautious about who I decide to work with, the types of projects I do, and really sort of what I put my name on. Because that&#8217;s another thing, especially I think with Black creatives is the work that we&#8217;re doing. What is it sort of speaking to in a larger sense? I&#8217;m there with you. I know exactly how you feel.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Definitely. Definitely. Yep.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I was poking around on your Instagram, and I saw this is fairly recently too. You&#8217;re also a part of a agency called The Future Is Black. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
A lot of the stuff that I do that&#8217;s on my portfolio on my Instagram is self-initiated. I basically created a portfolio for the type of work that I want to attract and do in the future. A lot of that&#8217;s just around black culture, specifically around I like the sixties a lot, Malcolm X, James Baldwin, people like that. Just kind of focusing and building around that. Then Joy, who was the owner of The Future Is Black, actually reached out to me maybe about six months ago. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I love this Malcolm X piece that you did. I would love to talk to you more. Let&#8217;s kind of stay in touch. I&#8217;m building something.&#8221;</p>
<p>She&#8217;s been building this and she&#8217;s actually a former makeup artist. She&#8217;s done a lot of different movies and TV shows and fashion design shoots and stuff like that. She&#8217;s kind of getting more into the design agency aspect of things. She reached out to me and was any clients that I have or bring on, would you want to partner with us and you do any of the 3D or motion graphic work? I&#8217;m like, yeah, sure, let&#8217;s do it. She just launched about a week and a half ago and started pushing it out there, and we&#8217;re going to see what&#8217;s going to happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Oh, I appreciate that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you balance all of this? You have the outside freelance work, you&#8217;ve got your 9:00 to 5:00, you also mentioned you have a family and kids. How are you balancing all of this?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
To be honest with you, I just really focus on learning the tools and being efficient, and then also just idea generation. James Altucher actually, I listen to his podcast a lot, just write down five ideas a day or 10 ideas a day. And the more you write them down, the better your ideas will get and the easier you&#8217;ll be able to come up with ideas. I don&#8217;t actually write them down, but I&#8217;m always kind of thinking of stuff, what 3D project can I do? What piece of music can I make? What graphic design or motion graphic project can I do? I&#8217;m always just kind of thinking about what would be cool to make and thinking through it. I kind of think through things in my head before I even sit down at the computer. When I sit down at the computer, because I do have limited time, because I do have a full-time job and I do have children and everything like that, it just kind of pours out.</p>
<p>I might be doing other things like cooking or cutting the grass and I&#8217;m thinking about it so I&#8217;m not thinking about it in front of the computer and getting frustrated. So that&#8217;s kind of how I approach most of my work, to be honest with you. Also, I&#8217;m not going to just take on work for the sake of taking on work. I do want to take on good projects that I&#8217;m excited about. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve been there, you might have taken on a project that you&#8217;re not really excited about, but you just want the money or need the money. It&#8217;s like second day in you&#8217;re like, &#8220;God, I just want this to be over.&#8221; You know what I mean?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s another thing too. If I&#8217;m excited about the project, then the energy comes. Right? If I&#8217;m not, then it kind of drains me and I just don&#8217;t want to be drained. I want to keep my energy up. I want to be working on things that I really want to be working on. That&#8217;s another reason why when I mentioned about building up a portfolio of the kind of work that I want to do, that&#8217;s kind of the purpose behind that. So when opportunities come my way, most of the time there&#8217;ll be things that I&#8217;m actually excited about and want to do instead of things that I have to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I have a hundred percent been there. We can talk about it after the interview, but I have definitely had some projects where it&#8217;s like, look, I got to pay rent, I got to get these bills paid. I might not be excited about it and doing cartwheels in the street, but I&#8217;m like, it&#8217;s work. I&#8217;ll do it. Yeah, I&#8217;ve been there, totally. Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit because I want to learn more about your backstory. You mentioned to me before we started recording that you&#8217;re kind of right outside Atlanta. Are you from just the metro Atlanta area?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I grew up in Hall County, so in Flory Branch, Gainesville area.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
That&#8217;s where from the time I was three until my twenties I was there. I lived out in LA for about three years, but then I came back. Most of my background, most of my history is here in Georgia.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Growing up, were you sort of a really creative kid? I mean, you&#8217;re doing all this stuff now. I imagine that probably started at an early age.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, I was always drawing and stuff, and my dad actually was into computers and stuff when I was growing up. I was on the computer since I was six, and this was before Windows, so C prompts and all that kind of stuff, running MS DOS, putting in floppy discs. I&#8217;ve always been into technology, into art, drawing, taking art classes pretty much my entire life, to be honest with you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You went to Georgia Southern, and then after that you went to the University of North Georgia. How were your college experiences? Did it sort of help prepare you for the work that you do now?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I would say not at all. Georgia Southern was cool. The reason why I transferred, because like you said, you&#8217;re in your 40s. I just turned 40 last year, so if you remember those early 2000s days, if anything about Georgia Southern, it was known for a party school.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I was just like, no, I got to try to focus. I was really into music back then and I was like, I just want to just focus on this and not flunk out of school. That&#8217;s why I kind of transferred out. I did learn a lot about networking and meeting people and I&#8217;m just by nature an introvert. So to be in an environment where everybody&#8217;s just like, Hey, what do you do? Or where are you from? And stuff, that was kind of helpful when you first go to school. Because everybody there doesn&#8217;t know anybody. Then I actually linked with a bunch of different people who had similar interests and within music and art and things of that nature. That was helpful. When I went to North Georgia, it was pretty much just go to school, go to work, come home and make music every day. That&#8217;s pretty much all I did.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Were you kind of more into music back then than design?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, I got out of design and creating for maybe about seven or eight years. I was just focused primarily on music. Then around I want to say 2009, 2010 is when I really kind of started getting back into design and digging more into Photoshop and Illustrator and just learning the tools and trying to become more efficient at those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Prior to that, you were just kind of doing music production stuff?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Pretty much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That was a, look, I was in Atlanta during that time. The music scene here was blowing up, really becoming known. I think Atlanta kind of has always been known as a big music city, particularly a big black music city. I just remember during that time there were so many artists coming out of Atlanta across all genres too. I could see how, shit I was actually a musician myself back then and I&#8217;m talking about it. I was a session musician, I played trombone, and so I would sometimes play in some clubs, play a gig here or there. I was doing this kind of alongside my day job. In 2005, I was working for the state of Georgia. Then from 2006 to 2008 I was working AT&#038;T, but then at night I was either doing stuff for school, because I was in grad school or I was playing a gig somewhere. Just the energy in the city, I would say probably that extends out probably throughout the metro area, but certainly in the city. The energy around just the music scene here was so big back then.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. Definitely. The conferences and then it used to be Atlantis and then eventually A3C kind of stemmed from that. Just stuff going on at Apache Cafe and the beat battles and the showcases and stuff. Those were good times for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I played Apache a few times. Yeah, great times. I remember that. Yeah. You were kind of getting into music production, but then you said you got back into design around 2009, 2010. What sort of prompted that shift?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Well, I mean, throughout that time when I was making music, I would need some design work or need to make a flyer or something. I would dabble here and there, but I was never really serious about it. When I started, and I know you mentioned you wanted to speak about this, anyway, so when I started Project Generation D, I started creating all of my own marketing collateral and stuff because the reason why that whole project even came about and company came about was because of 2008, I had just graduated two years before, I had a young child needed some money.</p>
<p>It was almost like now, everybody&#8217;s getting laid off and jobs are hard to find. I had to do something so I created this company to teach kids music production, video production, graphic design, all this kind of stuff. I didn&#8217;t have money to pay anybody to make my logo or marketing collateral, and I had enough knowledge to do it myself. That&#8217;s how it started. Then I would start getting a few freelance clients here and there. I just kind of stuck with it and started building it. I was like, oh, this is going to be a good stream of income and a good way to build upon what I have going on with music. That&#8217;s just kind of how I got more serious about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m looking at the website now for Project Generation D, which is dubbed an afterschool program for children and teens, ages 12 to 17, dedicated to providing students with a positive environment to flourish in the creative digital arts. Yeah, the 2008, I think that was right when the recession happened then. I remember that year vividly because I quit my job that year and started my studio. I was working AT&#038;T, hated it, hated it to the point I thought I had Crohn&#8217;s disease or something because I would physically get sick going into that place to the point where I was like, I can&#8217;t do this anymore.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve been there before too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I quit and started. I started my studio in oh eight and we started picking up work in &#8217;09. I continued it since then, but that time was really kind of an interesting time just in terms of opportunity as well as I think particularly I think if you were working in design, it was an interesting time because so much of what was happening in the country around one Obama getting elected, well, I&#8217;d say mainly with Obama getting elected is a lot of his work, I want to say, kind of played to the fact that that great design went into it. If you were a designer kind of working in that space, not even in the political space, but just in design during that time, so many people wanted that same type of polish or execution or diversity to be completely honest around the work that they were doing because they saw what Obama was doing. And this wasn&#8217;t just in politics, this was a cross design. I&#8217;m pretty sure the folks that made the Gotham font probably had dumped trucks of money because everybody wanted to use that damn thing everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Certainly. Yeah, it was definitely an interesting time. Yeah, when times get hard, you have to do what you have to do. If you have those skills, you got to kind of lean on those skills and build what you can to survive. That&#8217;s basically what I did and built upon that since that time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now you mentioned earlier Digital Sherpa, which is where you worked in 2014. When you look back at that time, this is sort of after the Project Generation D time, what do you remember? What were you going through at that time?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
A lot. At that time, so yeah, we got laid off. It was very interesting time because I was producing music all throughout pretty much mainly until 2011, 2012. I actually had a song that blew up and it blew up overseas and had 50, 60 million views on YouTube and all this kind of stuff. it was like I had signed a publishing deal, but it&#8217;s like I didn&#8217;t see any checks yet or anything like that. The business basically shuttered, had $40,000 of debt, moved into an old department, was just looking for job all the time, couldn&#8217;t get a job. I actually ended up getting a job at Sherpa, and then I was also tutoring at the same time. I&#8217;d go to work 8:00 to 4:00, 8:00 to 5:00, and then I would go get a snack or something or a quick meal, and then I&#8217;d go tutor from 6:00 to 9:00 PM every day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I was kind of just doing that, just trying to build. At that same time too, is when I started really digging into After Effects as well. It&#8217;s like, oh, I think this After Effects thing has some potential, if I can really figure it out and learn it, because it&#8217;s a little bit, it&#8217;s graphic design, but it&#8217;s like motion. I like the motion aspect of it. At that time, I ended up getting that job, and it was when blogs were really, really big still. Companies were like, &#8220;I need a blog. I need a blog. I need blog posts.&#8221; So basically the first position I had was, I think it was content manager. We contract out writers and then they would write blogs and I would proofread them and make sure they were good to go for all the clients that we had.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s mostly small businesses from around the country. Then I moved over to account manager, which was just kind of interfacing with the clients and things like that. Pretty much most of my day to day was just kind of overseeing content, making sure the blogs were getting written, they were correct, and getting posted and dealing with any issues that the clients had. It was just 2014-15 was really just a time of hustle for me, to be honest with you. I had the job, but I was also tutoring and I was also trying to design more. I would come home if I wasn&#8217;t tutoring at night and be trying to make art pieces and stuff and figure out Illustrator more and Photoshop more. During that time, it was kind of like a blur, but it was a hard time. It was, in retrospect, kind of a good time because it really laid the foundation for my life now 9 or 10 years later. Man,</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Much of what you are mentioning is my story as well. I had my studio back then, but I was also teaching and I was writing and I was consulting. I was doing multiple different things to try to keep the income coming in, keep myself creatively kind of satisfied and stuff. And it was also really coming at a time where the industry was changing. I would say roughly about 10 years ago might have been the start of when we started to see so much UX. I feel like that&#8217;s when we started to see UX and product really begin as a viable option for designers. Like you said, we&#8217;re roughly around the same age.</p>
<p>In the early two thousands, even say mid to late two thousands, you were either a graphic designer, a web designer, or a web developer. Then as the industry matured and changed, you have all these different type of design that pop up. Different titles go with it. There&#8217;s different titles with different companies. If I tell people I&#8217;m a designer now in 2023, they might automatically think I&#8217;m a product designer or UX designer as opposed to say a visual designer or something like that. So yeah, that time there was a lot about hustle, but the hustle came because there were just so many opportunities to do different things because that&#8217;s what the industry allowed you to do. It allowed you to wear a lot of different hats in that way.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
No, I remember 2015 or so going to the general assembly open house for the UX course, I was considering that at the time. It was a very interesting time. There was a lot of different avenues that you could take. Now a lot of these positions and jobs are commonplace, but at the time it was like, &#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s UX? What exactly does a product designer do?&#8221; That was where I was at at that time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, when you look at what you&#8217;re doing now compared to what you kind of did then, I&#8217;m curious how do you handle creative burnout or periods of low motivation? Because I would imagine all of this, like I said before, takes its toll. When you look back then and then you look at what you&#8217;re doing now, have you managed any sort of strategies or ways to pull yourself up during these times of burnout or low motivation?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, honestly I think that it&#8217;s okay to have low motivation. You&#8217;re not going to be going at a hundred percent all the time. Instead of forcing it in those moments, usually what I&#8217;ll do is just step away. If I don&#8217;t feel like making some 3D piece, I cook a lot. Cooking is a form of art. I&#8217;ll do that or exercise, or I&#8217;ll just catch up on a TV show or play some video games, and then I&#8217;ll see something in a TV show or a video game, or I&#8217;ll come across something and it will just spark some creativity and then I&#8217;ll go back and build off of that.</p>
<p>At this point, after creating for so long, I just try not to force it. It&#8217;s going to come in spurts. You&#8217;re going to have times of very high productivity. You&#8217;re going to have times where everything you make, you just want to just smash your computer because you hate it. It&#8217;s just part of the game. I think that&#8217;s just kind of how we are as humans. Everything we make isn&#8217;t going to be great, but you just have to learn how to manage what works for you and figure out some routines or steps that you take to get out of those funks to get back to creating again.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a really good piece of advice I think for folks now that might be trying to figure out what is the best way to manage themselves through all of this. Because you know mentioned you started your agency at the beginning of the pandemic. I feel like that pandemic period, particularly with people working at home kind of unlocked something in them to say, &#8220;Oh, wait a minute, I could also do this.&#8221; I think so many folks started getting on TikTok really back then, and now they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, well you know what? I was doing this nine to five, but I could be a content creator.&#8221; Which I kind of have beef with that term in general because I feel like it glosses over so many different skills and specialties within the realm of content creation. Sometimes it can even be used as a misnomer. If you tell someone you&#8217;re a content creator, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, wait, so do you do a podcast? Do you do OnlyFans?&#8221; What does that mean if you say I&#8217;m a content creator? It&#8217;s such a broad kind of term.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, I&#8217;m glad you said about a pandemic, because I viewed it that way since pretty much day one. And I mean, I&#8217;ve told my wife, and I&#8217;ve told a lot of my friends as well, I&#8217;m just like, I&#8217;ve been waiting for a time, not for people to be sick or to pass away or anything like that, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but as far as the opportunity to invest a massive amount of time into something to grow a skill, because you got to think when the pandemic started, you got to think of all the phases that people went through just on a broad level. There was GameStop and then there was Crypto, then there was the Metaverse. Now there&#8217;s AI. Know what I mean? It&#8217;s through all of that, I&#8217;m also, there&#8217;s time and the time is really our most valuable asset. What am I going to do with this time? So I took that time and added another skill. Cause I&#8217;m all, I&#8217;m really big on a unique skill set or a skill stack.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just like if someone were to come to me and say, &#8220;I want to do a short animated music video or film, and they need the music for it, and I need to have the poster created and they need to cut a trailer of it and have all these different aspects.&#8221; I could do all of that. That&#8217;s because I utilized that time to really put in those hours. I do hear you about the content creation. It&#8217;s almost like it cheapens the value of people who&#8217;ve spent the time to learn the craft and the skills. Right? Because I just post videos on TikTok and I&#8217;ll make money off of that, whatever. It&#8217;s like, what if TikTok goes away? That&#8217;s not really a transferable skill, just posting on TikTok. If you can design, if you can create an application, if you can do all of these different things, you&#8217;re going to be able to figure out your next move from that. That&#8217;s what I wanted to use the pandemic for was I have this time, let me add more skills that&#8217;s going to future-proof me moving forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. We&#8217;re using TikTok as an example here. I mean, I do think that there is a skill to that, but the problem that I see is that the skill is so closely tied to the platform that it&#8217;s hard, and I see this with some TikTok folks too. It&#8217;s hard for them to take success that they&#8217;ve made on one platform because the platform locks them into a specific way of maybe delivering content that doesn&#8217;t translate into a similar type of medium. For example, TikTok to Instagram or TikTok to YouTube, there are people that have millions of followers on TikTok and have 45 followers on YouTube because it just doesn&#8217;t translate. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s them not being able to transfer the skill to the platform because the skill is so tied to what the TikTok app allows you to do within its creation tools.</p>
<p>I remember this was back when I started my studio, my friend John, who had started a business together and he had found me through Meetup. They were like these web design meetups in the city, and he had just graduated from UGA, this white boy just graduated from UGA. We had met at a Panera Bread up in Buckhead, and I remember one of the first questions he asked me because he was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m looking to get into web design. Should I learn HTML or should I learn Dreamweaver?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, well, the language itself is probably better than learning the tool because the tool is just a tool that&#8217;s like saying, should I learn carpentry or should I learn how to use a hammer? It&#8217;s a difference in that.</p>
<p>I think sometimes with the tools like TikTok for example or things like that, you can get so locked in creation within that particular toolbox that you can&#8217;t transfer it over into something else. You can&#8217;t take the success that the platform or the algorithm or whatever TikTok gives you and transfer that into a magazine article, a blog, a long form video, a podcast, et cetera. The tools and the algorithm I think can sometimes lock creators into a box that is hard for them to get out of.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s why even a few years back, if you look at Desus and Mero, they were actually able to translate from Twitter to a podcast into a TV show. There&#8217;s plenty of other people who were funny online or on their YouTube channels who try to make the jump to TV or the radio and just bombed. It&#8217;s kind of the same concept.</p>

It can be tough to make that leap, to make that jump, especially if you&#8217;re just not able to transfer the skill that you have outside of the confines of the platform that you were kind of initially on.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I noticed that you refer to yourself as a creator over referring to yourself as a designer. Is there a specific reason behind that?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I just like to create. Right? I wouldn&#8217;t say there&#8217;s a specific reason behind it, but I do a lot of things. If I make a motion graphic, for instance, I&#8217;ll go create my own music for it. That&#8217;s kind of, I guess where that comes from. I create meals, I&#8217;ll have friends over, I have family over, and I&#8217;ll be on the smoker for five hours and create an experience in that way. That&#8217;s why I kind of look at it as more of a creator than just strictly a designer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Do you think it&#8217;s hard to, well, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s the best way to kind of frame this question, but I notice a lot of designers now are strict specialists. The work that they do is only within a specific type of design. They can only be a product designer or a UX designer or something like that. Not pick on product or UX folks, but they can only do what they do within that particular realm. I feel like designers like us, older designers, I think because we came up during this period where there was just so much opportunity because we were learning at the same time that the industry was learning and sort of discovering new things that we know how to do a lot of shit.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I was doing, &#8217;97, &#8217;98, I was making cash money websites on Geo City learning HTML.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I remember teaching myself HTML. I remember teaching myself Photoshop off of a cracked version of Photoshop, and then going to Barnes and Noble and looking at those $50 Photoshop tips and tricks books and just taking photos and bringing them home and using them on my cracked version of Photoshop to figure out how to make that sort of pixel and pin Diamante kind of cash money design or something like that. We know how to do a lot of things because the industry and just, I think the time period we were in allowed us the opportunity to do multiple things. It&#8217;s almost like now people want you to be more specialist.</p>
<p>Generalists and designers from our age group I would say we just know how to do a lot of stuff. You do audio editing, you do video, you do 3D, you&#8217;re a photographer. All of this is kind of wrapped up into what you do as a person and as a creator. I think sometimes in the industry, that can be hard for people to understand. &#8220;What do you do?&#8221; And you&#8217;re like, &#8220;I do a lot of stuff. What do you need?&#8221; You know?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Also too, from my perspective with starting the agency, if the agency continues on a good trajectory and it continues to grow, obviously I can&#8217;t do everything myself. Right? If I need to outsource, I want to know what to look for, and I want to be able to speak the language. If I&#8217;m talking to a photographer, I&#8217;m just going to be different from talking to a video editor than talking to a graphic designer. I want to be able to understand and explain and to lead and to coach and say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s try this instead of that, or let&#8217;s do this instead of that, or maybe we should use these file formats instead of these file formats.&#8221; That&#8217;s how I look at it having knowledge of all these different areas is because then in the future, when I&#8217;m working with my own team that I hope to build, I&#8217;ll be able to speak their language and to be able to break it down and to communicate with them on their same level, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, no, that makes sense. How would you say your creative style has evolved over the years?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
It&#8217;s kind of hard to say because even musically over the years, I&#8217;ve never really had a definitive style. If it moves me or if it feels good, I like it. But I feel like over the last three or four years that it&#8217;s definitely started to form into something more concrete. I just like clean design for one. Yeah, I just like clean, sophisticated, something that can draw emotion, especially with the 3D work, if it can take you into the world building those worlds and bringing the viewer into that. I would always say that the underlying aspect of all of that though, is really the storytelling. If you have the visual aspects of course, but the key parts for me is what&#8217;s the story that&#8217;s being told and does it evoke emotion? I think that&#8217;s what I focus on is more than what it looks like. Hopefully it always looks good and people like it and I like to experiment a lot, but my style I guess, would really be more of a storyteller just using all these different mediums to tell different stories.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you do a lot of self-initiated projects as you&#8217;ve mentioned. We can look on your website or your Instagram and see these little video vignettes and other things that you&#8217;ve done. Do you have a dream project that you would love to do one day?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Actually, I think I&#8217;m working on it right now. I can&#8217;t really discuss it right now, but yeah, I think I&#8217;m working on it right now actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. We&#8217;ll keep it vague so once it comes out it&#8217;ll be a big surprise, but no, that&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, I got to keep it vague because the NDAs and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, I feel like the work that I&#8217;ve done over the last three years has been definitely, like I said, I&#8217;ve been very intentional about the work that I create for myself to attract the kind of clients that I want to work with. So I think that since I&#8217;ve done that, I have actually, even The Future Is Black, that comes from me creating work that I want to do in the future. It&#8217;s all been very intentional and I think that now a lot of that stuff that those dream projects and the type of people that I want to work with and the type of projects I want to work on are showing up in my inbox.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What keeps you motivated and inspired these days?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Not to sound dark, but death, to be honest with you. We&#8217;re not going to be here forever, so we got to use our time wisely. Last year I actually lost my dad, so that kind of just lit an extra fire under me that was already under me. As we get older and you start seeing people that you&#8217;ve grown up on, even to see something like Jamie Fox having a medical emergency or something, you&#8217;re like, dang, we really are the middle age now. Half our life is done. It&#8217;s like we have to really figure out our legacy and what we want to leave behind and that kind of motivates me to keep going and to keep getting better and just try to be the best, not just creator but human I can be in the time that I have.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If you could go back and talk to your college age Reggie, if you could go back and talk to him, what advice would you give him about just being a creative?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
It&#8217;d probably be the same advice that I&#8217;ve given myself throughout the years anyway. It&#8217;s just keep going. It&#8217;s going to take time, and I&#8217;ve always knew it would take time. People always say it takes 10 years or whatever to be an overnight success, so I always knew whatever I wanted to do would take time and I would have to have the discipline and keep motivated to get to those goals, but also just be open to the possibilities and the opportunities that come your way. You might have a specific vision in your mind of how you want things to turn out or how you want things to be, and it might not turn out that way, and when it goes in a different direction, it might actually be better than what you thought it would be. You just have to be open and you just have to keep going and stay focused on what you want to do. For sure. You got to have a plan, you got to execute that plan, but don&#8217;t close yourself off to other opportunities that may open up even more doors for you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want that next chapter of your legacy to be?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
My goal right now, especially with the 3D, is to tell Black stories through a medium that is traditionally not Black.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out just more information about you, more information about your work? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
My website is reggieperryjr.com and then my Instagram is @nobodyfamous. That&#8217;s pretty much it. I don&#8217;t really mess with Twitter or anything else, but yeah, if you want to see some of my work, you want to connect, I guess the best place would be through my website, via email or my Instagram.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Reggie Perry, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. One, I think just thank you for just kind of detailing your creative journey. I had mentioned before so much of what you mentioned has been kind of neck and neck with things that I&#8217;ve experienced. I really kind of know exactly where you&#8217;re coming from with your thoughts on just content creation and just creation in general and using the skills that you have to put your mark on the world.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s important that people see that you can have a long career in design and creativity and whatever you want to call it, as long, like you said, you sort of put in the work, stick to the plan that you have, things will kind of work themselves out. Basically, from what I can see from your work, you definitely have put in the long hours, you&#8217;ve done the work, you&#8217;re continuing to do the work. I&#8217;m excited to see what you do next. I think certainly what you&#8217;re mentioning about telling Black stories like that through maybe kind of a non-traditional medium, I see that definitely in the future happening for you. Thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I appreciate you having me. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Isiah Xavier Bradley was born to be an artist, and you can really feel his love for the craft just from spending a few minutes chatting with him. The Seattle-based illustrator loves all things comics related, and his body of work is filled with superheroes, aliens, mages, and all kinds of other fantasy figures. </p>
<p>We talked about some of his creative projects, and we spoke for a bit about diversity in the fantasy illustration space, as well as how he approaches storytelling through his art. Isiah also shared his story of growing up in Philly, getting inspired by his father (a painter!), and finding creative community both online and offline. Isiah is looking to achieve great things and grow as a professional illustrator, and with his enthusiasm and talent, he&#8217;s well on his way of making that happen!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Hi, I am Isiah Xavier Bradley and I&#8217;m a freelance illustrator and comic book artist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has the year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been going wonderful. It&#8217;s been wonderful. It&#8217;s been unsuspected, but just wonderful accomplishments have been happening. Recently, I was at the Western Hotel and was doing an event with two other artists and we were hired to do a 10-minute painting of Seattle&#8217;s like landscape of the space needle and the mountains, and of course, we had to include someone drinking coffee in there because there&#8217;s nothing but coffee around in Seattle everywhere, but yeah, that was one of the events that I recently did about maybe two months ago, and that was just amazing fun. I didn&#8217;t think that was going to happen. It was like I get caught off guard about like how many wonderful things just happen out of the blue. It&#8217;s like you don&#8217;t know when it&#8217;s going to happen or what&#8217;s going to happen, but with all the work, just paying off and networking and pursuing, it&#8217;s just this year has been a wonderful surprise of many things I got a chance to experience and to do and people to meet. It&#8217;s been awesome. It&#8217;s been an adventure-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
&#8230; seriously. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have any plans for the summer?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Oh, goodness. Well, right now, I&#8217;m going to be going to see my friend later in this month to Las Vegas. I mean, I know it&#8217;s not exactly summertime, but it&#8217;s close enough. So, I&#8217;m going to go see her. We&#8217;re going to work on some storyboards together. Besides that, I plan on spending as much time as I can outside painting and enjoying the fresh air because in Seattle, it was just way too cloudy and I needed some sunlight, but that&#8217;s it so far for now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at this time last year, how would you say you&#8217;ve changed or how have things changed for you over the year? What&#8217;s different? What&#8217;s new? Anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
I would say my mindset has definitely been changing. Last year it was like my art was still, like my career was still growing and I was getting more people and more companies to hire me, which felt really good, but also I had to work on my mindset about what success was and about how my career is growing. For being an artist, there&#8217;s no chart to show you. Like when you meet a goal, there&#8217;s like no reward or some outside source, especially when you&#8217;re a freelancer, to say, &#8220;Hey, yes, you made it. Yes, you did it,&#8221; and everything and that was something I had to get used to because it was like I&#8217;m my own boss. I have to be the one to do that for myself. So, that way, I can acknowledge the work. I was doing the hours, the hard projects, the tight deadlines, or I had to change my mindset to recognize the accomplishments I was doing and also to be completely self-aware and present.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s another thing. I was working out more and I&#8217;m working out more now this year. I was realizing that physically, like they always wanted to make characters like toned and skinny and muscled, and realizing how that had a negative effect on people and it&#8217;s including myself because I was like, &#8220;I need to show that beautiful is all different types of shapes and sizes.&#8221; Beauty is diversity. That&#8217;s like with my character, Sandra. Actually, I was inspired by Lizzo because I was watching Lizzo and Lizzo was just this beautiful, powerful, thick queen and I wanted to create a character that was like that. So, I created a character called Sandra. She has this huge ice ax and she&#8217;s just around this really cool character that just doesn&#8217;t take nothing from nobody and it&#8217;s her own person and as I&#8217;m talking to you now, I&#8217;m looking at the poster above my desk and it&#8217;s like all my diverse characters. I have Native American. I have Mexican. I have Black, Afro-Latina, and different types of body types, and I just feel like that definitely contributed to how I was thinking differently last year and this year and how it affects my artwork now.</p>
<p>With that experience, it definitely helped me become more of a better artist and more in touch with myself too, about finding that beauty about myself too. So, now I&#8217;m able to take that and put it into my art.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You touched on something now that I actually wanted to discuss a little later, but we can jump into it right now. Is representation, and I&#8217;m using air quotes over representation because that&#8217;s such a broad spectrum of what that could mean, but is that something that you feel like has to be a part of your work? When you think about your individual identities, do you feel like I need to put that into my work in some way?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Absolutely. I think it&#8217;s important. For example, Ariel, that was a huge debate just because of the color of her skin, but the people that I saw, like Black little girls and Black women seeing Ariel being a Black mermaid and having that such powerful, positive enforcement, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, we need to have more of that. People need to feel like they can do that too,&#8221; and sometimes people just need to see that like I did. Like for X-Men, Storm, that beautiful Black queen goddess. I love her so much of the X-Men. She&#8217;s great. She definitely was an icon for me and diversity and acknowledging that I was like, &#8220;I have to make sure that I represent more of that, bring that out more into the world so that way people of color can feel beautiful too and people with different body types can feel beautiful too.&#8221; It&#8217;s just like diversity is absolutely needed because it&#8217;s all around us and it needs to be accepted.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s so natural and for it to not to be celebrated as such, it hurts and especially towards our younger community, our younger community needs to know that, yes, you can do this. Yes, you can be that. I dream of a future where everyone is just represented equally and accepted and loved. So, we can all just create beautiful things because imagine what we could create if all of us were just getting along together and just sharing our beliefs and whatnot, but we don&#8217;t have to agree on it, but it&#8217;s just something that could be so beautiful. So, absolutely diversity needs to be in my work. Absolutely. The more weirder, the more unique, the better. I just want that. I yearn for it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s that adage that goes like, &#8220;You can&#8217;t be what you don&#8217;t see,&#8221; or something like that and I think certainly along the lines of illustration, animation even, there&#8217;s been such an explosion at least over the past decade or so where we&#8217;ve seen Black and brown artists, queer artists, et cetera, that are creating works in those images and putting it out there in a way that&#8230; I mean, some stuff has even been on streaming series and things of that nature. You started to see such a huge explosion of this diversity through the medium of illustration or animation over the past 10 years and it&#8217;s really been something to see because along with that, there&#8217;s also all these other stories that can be told because it&#8217;s coming from people with these different perspectives or because the characters are not the average white character, et cetera. There&#8217;s just more opportunities and possibilities for storytelling.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Absolutely, absolutely, and I feel like some companies or people would just be nervous about tapping into it too, because it&#8217;s change and people can be very scared of change, but it&#8217;s like we need that change. We need it. Even though it&#8217;s scary, it&#8217;s like we need it because it&#8217;s like we can&#8217;t keep repeating ourselves over the years over and over and over. No, we need to have that change right here, right now, so that way in the future we can have a better opportunity for everyone and then everyone can just feel that self-love more and capable. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about your work as a freelance illustrator. What does a typical day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Oh, actually, it&#8217;s weird. My mind likes to play tricks on me and what I mean by that is sometimes I&#8217;ll wake up in the morning and I will be ready to go. I&#8217;ll just jump right into it. I&#8217;ll just get up and brush my teeth, maybe splash some water on my face or take a shower, or I&#8217;ll just wake up and I&#8217;ll just go to my art desk and start painting out of nowhere. I feel like those are my go-get-it days. Today is definitely one of those days where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to go ahead and do my work and be focused,&#8221; which is like I made that conscious decision to go into that. So, I would wake up, make a list because for me, I can&#8217;t think of things in my head of what to do. If I do that, I easily get overwhelmed.</p>
<p>So, I have to make a list and that list keeps me organized and not only that, but checking it off actually makes me feel like, &#8220;Oh crap. I&#8217;m actually getting stuff done. I&#8217;m actually doing it,&#8221; and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to focus on how long it takes me. I&#8217;m going to focus on getting the goal done,&#8221; because once I get that done, it&#8217;s going to feel really good. Then I can go on to the next one and then I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m doing it.&#8221; On off days, I wake up and I have no energy in the morning and I have to wait till 12 o&#8217;clock for my whole body to feel that full awareness. It&#8217;s like, okay, I&#8217;m ready to make art and I think that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to be self-aware because if you can be completely self-aware and present about how you&#8217;re feeling physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually, that you will be able to conquer yourself.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be able to be like &#8220;I know what you&#8217;re thinking,&#8221; and be like, &#8220;I know what to do.&#8221; It&#8217;s like if I&#8217;m at home and I&#8217;m trying to work and I can&#8217;t focus, I know to remove myself from that space into an outside space or a completely public space where I can focus and get things done. So, it&#8217;s about doing that work and realizing what works best for you and for me, it can just flip. It can be vice versa, but I&#8217;m working with it. It&#8217;s been doing wonders for me. I&#8217;ve been able to get more work done, especially from working from home because you could get so easily distracted, distracted by video games, distracted by cooking food.</p>
<p>I mean, I love food, but also I got to do my work or movies and whatnot and I think as long as you&#8217;re completely self fully aware, you&#8217;re good and breaks. I always try to take a break after probably between hours or every other three hours perhaps. So, I&#8217;ll take a small break or I&#8217;ll just get up after 15 minutes, after I realize that, &#8220;Hey, my focus is slipping. I&#8217;ll just get up and walk around, stretch my body out, just get it physically active, walk away from the project and maybe go for a walk outside,&#8221; and then I&#8217;ll come back and my mind is refreshed and I might be able to point out some things I didn&#8217;t notice before. So, yeah, it&#8217;s all about just knowing how your body and your mind think and just utilizing that for your advantage. That&#8217;s how pretty much my take goes. Natural chaos. I like to call it natural chaos.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I think you touched on something that a lot of people probably like at the start of the pandemic had to come to grips with when working from home is that it&#8217;s tough to work from home. It takes a lot of discipline to not fall into just doing something else. Like you mentioned, I could play video games. I could eat. I could do whatever. I could watch TV, whatever, but knowing that you have to get the work done is it&#8217;s a challenge. It&#8217;s a challenge and I think for a lot of people when the pandemic started, that was something they had to come to terms with. One, I think it&#8217;s just outfitting their place to be a place to work because the office is the office. Home is home.</p>
<p>Now, you&#8217;re bringing the office to your home. How do you make that happen? It&#8217;s a process to get to that level where you can feel like you can really wake up in the morning and get into a flow state and get work done at home. It&#8217;s harder than I think a lot of people realize.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Especially when you&#8217;re own, you&#8217;re your own boss too. You have no one looking over your shoulder. You are completely free. You get to decide exactly what you do and how you do it and it&#8217;s a blessing and a curse because you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Dang it. I need to focus.&#8221; So, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s always good to know yourself, to be like, &#8220;How do I function? What can I do to make sure that I am actually getting work done?&#8221; It&#8217;s so easy to fall into that trap and being a freelancer is more than just one job. You have multiple jobs. You&#8217;re the manufacturer. You&#8217;re the producer. You&#8217;re the advertiser. You&#8217;re the financial budget person. You&#8217;re the stock person organizing your area, make sure you have enough materials and whatnot and all that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re playing multiple roles. I don&#8217;t think many people realize when you&#8217;re playing freelancing, you&#8217;re literally your own army unless you are hiring somebody else to help you, but it&#8217;s hard times. Not everyone can be affording that, but if you also have that capability to do that stuff by yourself, then go for it. Just make sure you&#8217;re giving yourself breaks and affirmations. Affirmations are really important for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you do a little bit of everything from comic books to trading cards. What does your process look like when it comes to approaching a new piece of work? What does that look like?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
I usually like to feel it out. Like what is this image going to convey? What is the vibe I&#8217;m trying to give it? Because doing illustrations, and any kind of illustration, sketch cards, book covers. It all leads down to storytelling and it&#8217;s so important that you recognize body language, colors to evoke mood, the perspective, the layout of the image. Everything adds to the story. So, I try to keep that in mind while I&#8217;m looking for references and I try not to spend too much time on references because I find that you could spend a lot of time looking up references and then you lose too much time that you could have used for the project.</p>
<p>So, I try to do at least an hour of references, or under, and then I just go in there and do really quick, bold sketches. I think that doing bold sketches allows you to develop your idea much quicker and gives you a bit more of a confidence booster. It&#8217;s like I know what I&#8217;m doing. I know what I want to go for and it just helps you move things along in a much more progressive kind of way and afterwards, after thumbnail is chosen or making a discussion, depending on the client, sometimes clients have notes about something they would like to have changed, or sometimes you&#8217;ll just get lucky, which thankfully I&#8217;ve been very lucky where I&#8217;ve had customers where they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s perfect. Keep going.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Great.&#8221; So, I&#8217;ll just go onto the next step and I&#8217;ll do a loose sketch.</p>
<p>Back then I used to do sketches where I would just go from very loose sketch to a very, very tight sketch, but nowadays, I go from a loose sketch to half tight sketch because I like to add more details with the color. So, after I&#8217;m done doing a tight, but not full-on sketch, I like to do a quick color filling, and that quick color filling allows me to play with the color and see what works, what&#8217;s more powerful that serves the image in the story and then after I get approval for that, I just go in there and start painting it like I would traditional art. I don&#8217;t know if many people would do it this way, but I like to stick to three, four layers max only because I was raised by my father to do traditional art and when I went to art school, I learned digital art and then it took me a while to feel comfortable with digital.</p>
<p>So, I took that mindset and the way I used traditional paintings, I took that method and applied it to digital and now that I have less layers and I&#8217;m working on it like I would traditional, it actually turns out much more the way I would want it to. Yeah, it is weird. I think it&#8217;s just because I was just so trained for so many years. I was doing traditional art way longer than digital. So, that&#8217;s programmed in my head, but it worked nicely for me. I really like how my digital artwork comes up now. I still do traditional, of course, because I can&#8217;t let that old-fashioned love go. That&#8217;s my first love, traditional watercolor, acrylic color, pencil, love all that. I would just apply that method and it would just work nicely for me and that&#8217;s pretty much my process right there. Just remembering what you&#8217;re trying to tell, what the story you&#8217;re trying to tell, and long as you keep that in mind along with the body language and the color and the way that they&#8217;re just presenting themselves, the character or the environment, that&#8217;s the best way to create that image you&#8217;re trying to make.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now. You mentioned storytelling. How do you approach storytelling through your art? Is that a separate process?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Oh, well, first thing I did was I did some research. I actually had a friend, Tony Atkins. He&#8217;s a DC comic artist, and I think he&#8217;s the one that recommended me to look at this. I&#8217;m not 100% sure, but I have this book here called Framed Ink, and it&#8217;s called Drawing and Composition for Visual Storytellers. It&#8217;s so such a good book. I recommend this book for any artist who&#8217;s trying to do illustration or comic book art. Technically, it&#8217;s for comic book artists, but after reading this book, it allowed me to take that method and apply it to illustrations and it talks about everything. It talks about what direction the trees are going in. If the trees are somewhat bending towards the focus point of the piece, it actually creates more of a focus point. If you&#8217;re looking downwards or upwards at a person, let&#8217;s say upwards, it gives more of a towering kind of vibe where you feel small and they&#8217;re big and threatening and whatnot.</p>
<p>Even the dramatic lighting, when I was doing comic books, I was working on some stories where sometimes I wouldn&#8217;t even go in full detail. In the area, I would just put a Black background and add dramatic lighting to their face because sometimes the character would be sad or upset and I really wanted to capture that and it gave it a traumatic effect. There are so many little things you can do, and even hands. Hands are a big thing too that give a big personality in storytelling. So, if someone&#8217;s more gentle and calm, maybe their fingers look more elegant and soft and not so stiff and someone&#8217;s mad or trying to cast an aggressive spell or something like that. Maybe their hands are a bit more provocative or a little bit more like gnarly or something like that. There&#8217;s so many aspects to storytelling.</p>
<p>And also another thing I loved to do. I haven&#8217;t done it in a hot minute because I&#8217;ve just been painting crazy, which is look at movies and notice how they have the camera set, what kind of colors they&#8217;re choosing. It&#8217;s just like watching movies can teach you a lot about how to do storytelling and I&#8217;m trying to think of what was like a good movie I think that was pretty good. I would say I liked Ultraviolet with Milla Jovovich. That was a good one for how the perspectives were. They did the crazy camera angles and the way they showed scenes through someone&#8217;s shade. They&#8217;re wearing shades and then you could just see a picture within their shades. It&#8217;s just so many interesting ways for you to do storytelling. Maybe the person&#8217;s drinking a cup of coffee and you see them talking, but you&#8217;re not focused on them, the reflections in the cup of coffee. It&#8217;s just so many fascinating ways to do storytelling.</p>
<p>So, I would say for sure, just also pay attention to people out in public, just like we&#8217;re not having a conversation. They&#8217;re not all standstill and stiff like some action figure. No. They&#8217;re either hunched over or they&#8217;re leaning one way or the other, or it&#8217;s all about just pay attention to those small details and if you gather all those, those things to come together. You can come up with some really cool images. So, I would just say people watching, movie watching, sometimes even video games, but it depends on the video game. Like God of War, that&#8217;s a good storytelling for sure. If you&#8217;ve seen God of War, the video game, you would definitely see what I mean because it&#8217;s so well done and put well together, but that&#8217;s why I would say that and this book called Framed Ink for sure. It&#8217;s so good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of video games, as I&#8217;m looking through your portfolio and seeing your work and everything, a lot of it is based on fantasy, science fiction. You&#8217;ve mentioned comic books being influenced by that. What really draws you to those as genres? What draws you to all that?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Oh, goodness. I fell in love with comics and fantasy, sci-fi stuff when I was a kid. I was so obsessed with it. I wanted to submerge my mind into that world. Something about it just seemed like so much fun and it seemed bright and exciting and just something that just reached out to me. It all started with the &#8217;90s, those beautiful colored costumes and Storm making her speeches and you didn&#8217;t see, but my hands just reached out to the sky like her. Just like what else was fantasy like Yu-Gi-Oh!, the monster designs. I was just fascinated by all this. I was watching cartoons absorbing it like a sponge and I was so into it and I had so many action figures. I still do, and honestly, it was like my dad introduced me into fantasy art as well, because he&#8217;s an artist and he would do a lot of these paintings at home where they were just fantasy-based, abstract kind of fantasy combination.</p>
<p>I just grew really fascinated with it and to be honest, I was like, when I was a kid, I was bullied and that world of fantasy and superheroes honestly helped me with my day-by-day life. It just brought so much happiness for me and honestly, I think that&#8217;s one of the main reasons why I became an artist in the first place. So, anyone else who was different like I was, they could look towards that and maybe get inspired by a character because it was like I was just so inspired by so many other characters too that made me just feel like I was capable. Like being different was great and awesome, and I just think that that&#8217;s definitely what drew me in. It&#8217;s just that entire world is something that made me happy, really, really happy and it still does.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there a lot of diversity in that space? I mean, of course, there&#8217;s the different stories that are being told, but in terms of other artists and things like that, is there a lot of diversity in that fantasy space?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
In terms of other artists?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
I feel like for sure, like back then, when it came to it, like at the time I wasn&#8217;t aware, but Larry&#8230; I forgot his last name. But Larry is the producer and artist for the &#8217;90s X-Men and it wasn&#8217;t until maybe five years ago I found out that it was a Black man and I was just astounded and so inspired. I was already inspired by the X-Men. The fact that it was created by a Black man, I was about to burst in tears happy because it just made me so ecstatic and I was like, &#8220;Holy crap. Someone who made something that inspired me and that just touched me in so many ways,&#8221; and oh, it was empowering. It was just amazing. I would say for sure that was just an important part of my art journey.</p>
<p>And now, since him, I didn&#8217;t notice too many. Even before I met him, I didn&#8217;t even notice too many Black artists, or at least they weren&#8217;t acknowledged at least because I feel like when it came to especially the comic book industry, that a lot more artists were not being acknowledged for their work. I mean, thankfully now it&#8217;s becoming more of a thing, but it should have been a thing already. It should have been like they should have been recognized for their hard work for sure. I didn&#8217;t know that many. I know a couple now. I follow a couple now on social media, which is great, but I just feel like we need more because especially for big projects like Dungeons and Dragons and Marvel, like thankfully Marvel&#8217;s now definitely for short, like not even artist-wise, but actor/artist-wise, we&#8217;re getting more people like Monica, Miss Marvel. It&#8217;s just having more people of color. It&#8217;s just awesome and I feel like now we&#8217;re getting more people of color who are artists arising more, especially during the pandemic because&#8230; Well, I think the pandemic&#8217;s over now-ish, but I think a lot of people realize that you can make your own business. You can be a freelancer. You can do this.</p>
<p>And them realizing that really did reveal more to social media. Like, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re here. I&#8217;m queer and I&#8217;m a person of color and I&#8217;m here,&#8221; and because of that I am happy that that happened, that people were able to put their stuff out there more. So, now I can actually see more and honestly, I&#8217;m just really happy about that. I think that would be the only good thing that came out of the pandemic. The only good thing was people realized, hey, I can start my own business. Hey, I can do this. I can make art and people can buy it, and with that, I would just have more rising, more rising and I just want that for everybody. More people to bring their voices forward because I didn&#8217;t have enough of that when I was a kid. I didn&#8217;t and that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t know many people by name, which is unfortunate, but now it&#8217;s happening. So, yeah. Now, I can full on support.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I just looked up who you were talking about. I think it&#8217;s Larry Houston.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Yeah, I was looking at his last name on the Storm piece he signed for me, but I couldn&#8217;t make out&#8230; I was like, &#8220;Darn it. That&#8217;s too many swirls. I can&#8217;t read it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, Larry Houston was the producer and director of X-Men, the second season. I&#8217;m looking at his Twitter bio, but he&#8217;s like Fantastic Four, second season, Captain Planet, Johnny Quest, GI Joe, GI Joe movie, The Karate Kid, Care Bear. I had no idea. I had no idea he had such a impressive resume.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
I only knew he did the X-Men. I didn&#8217;t know the other stuff. My goodness.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And actually speaking of X-Men, like I know there&#8217;s the new&#8230; I think it&#8217;s like the reboot of the &#8217;90s Cartoon is supposed to be coming out I think this year, maybe next year, but that has a Black director at the helm too, Beau DeMayo.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, I&#8217;ve been following it too. I was like, &#8220;Yes, I need to see this.&#8221; It&#8217;s like it&#8217;s supposed to be a continuation off the &#8217;90s, which I&#8217;m very curious about how that&#8217;s going to go because first off, that show was just&#8230; It was ahead of its time. It tackled racism. It tackled speciesism. I think that&#8217;s how you say. You know what I&#8217;m talking about? I forget the correct terminology, but anybody who was different, that was not normal. Anybody who was different, they were just looked upon as a freak of nature or something like that and just to have a show that was empowering people who were different, it was a huge gift. I don&#8217;t know honestly if I would&#8217;ve been an artist if X-Men didn&#8217;t exist at that time for me when I was a kid. I don&#8217;t know because that was just a huge motivator, huge inspiration for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit. I know we&#8217;ve talked a lot about your work and you&#8217;ve led us into your process, but you&#8217;ve also given us, I think, a bit of a window into where you came from and where this love comes from. So, let&#8217;s talk more about you. Let&#8217;s talk about you. Are you originally from Seattle?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
No, I am from Philadelphia.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Most of my life, I&#8217;ve been an Philadelphian.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. What was it like growing up in Philly?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Oh goodness. First off, concrete jungle. No trees around. Some trees around, but not that much. Going from Philly to Seattle was definitely an adjustment. Goodness gracious. In Philly, I&#8217;m just remembering, like I was living with my parents. I went to art school. I went to Northeast High and that was in the Northeast Philadelphia and that was definitely a school I enjoyed for sure because I had so many good friends there. I was a part of the choir, so that was another creative thing, another creative outlet for me and I was working on comics and this is before I was overthinking some of this stuff. So, I was able just to draw without overthinking it and actually made a little bit of profit there too.</p>
<p>So, it was super fun just to draw my own comic book, make copies, and my classmates were like, &#8220;Ooh, we want to buy one. We want to buy one,&#8221; and it was just super, super fun, but the area I was in definitely was more concrete jungle. I don&#8217;t think I got inspired by the area I was in, more by the people I was hanging around with and my dad when he was working on this art and my brother too, and it was just like I had a good community over there. I&#8217;m very grateful for having so many awesome people there that inspired me to continue making art and going hushing over there in Philadelphia was great. Was there for four years. I met some very good friends of mine and they&#8217;re still friends of mine, which is a blessing because it&#8217;s hard to find some true friends and it was just a wonderful experience, and honestly, it also helped me find more of myself too, just like people there who knew me through and through.</p>
<p>Before even I knew me, it was weird. It was like, &#8220;Where are you, in my head or something?&#8221; No, it was just an awesome experience. Plus the food was way cheaper than Seattle. It was also dangerous because I could get me a plain pizza at large for 11 bucks and I would go for it, but over here in Seattle, it&#8217;s like a large plain pizza is like 26. So, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, maybe that shouldn&#8217;t be ordering so much over here. Maybe I should learn how to cook.&#8221; So, when I came up here to Seattle, it was definitely more of a, okay, let&#8217;s step up this adulthood more. Let&#8217;s learn how to cook. So, I did that and goodness gracious, I had to build my entire art studio again because I had no scanner. I had no art desk. So, it was just starting all over and fresh, but being in Seattle, I love the nature. Nature is gorgeous.</p>
<p>If you ever wanted to get away, obviously, you could just take a bus to a park somewhere and just chill there. It&#8217;s like nature is right there and it was just so nice to have that accessibility. There is definitely a Seattle freeze for a couple, maybe a handful or two. Over here where it&#8217;s like some people are just like they&#8217;ll pretend you&#8217;re not there or if they need to reach for something, they&#8217;ll just reach right in front of you and I&#8217;m not used to that. I&#8217;m used to Philly kind of interaction which is like, okay, if you need something, I&#8217;m going to say excuse me and then get together, but thankfully, a lot of people weren&#8217;t born here and moved here and you can always tell because those are the people that are just like, &#8220;Oh, hello. How you doing?&#8221; They actually will have a conversation with you or have eye contact with you, but thankfully I&#8217;ve had the pleasure to make friends with a lot of people who weren&#8217;t having the Seattle freeze symptoms.</p>
<p>They wouldn&#8217;t have the Seattle freeze symptoms. They would just be completely themselves and open and nice and kind. Yeah. So, be over here in Seattle and Philly, I could tell you that the difference is that for sure is like, &#8220;Philly, you just need more green. You need a lot more green,&#8221; and then Seattle&#8217;s like, &#8220;Seattle, you just need to look more fun. You need to have a little bit more fun.&#8221; Yeah, it was definitely like a process and adjustment for me to go from East Coast to West Coast. Such a huge adjustment, but I&#8217;m still me. I&#8217;m still a Philadelphian. I even consider myself to be a little bit of Seattleite, but Philly come first because I was there most of my adult life. So, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What made you decide to move to Seattle from Philly?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
I wanted to be with my ex at the time. So, me and him both moved to Seattle and at that time, I was going through a lot of struggle, a lot of inner struggle, inner demons, what&#8217;s that? Imposter syndrome. My friends were trying to help me and my family were trying to help me and they were all so wonderfully attending and want to make sure I was okay, but I was not going to be okay until I was going to want to be okay or figure out some stuff. So, when I moved over to Seattle, it gave me that breathing space for me to figure out what&#8217;s going on with me and it took a hot minute too, but thanks to therapy, thanks to journaling, thanks to working out, thanks to being self-aware and giving myself those self-love affirmations, all that helped me become much more of a happier person to get in touch with that inner child that was suffering from all the seriousness of adulthood.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like I know we got responsibilities, but also we are supposed to live our life and have fun. I can&#8217;t lose that part of myself because that part of myself is a huge part of why I&#8217;m an artist. So, I have to make sure that I&#8217;m taking care of myself and giving myself that time and space I need to do what I need to do to make sure I am in a better place, and when I&#8217;m like that, I&#8217;m actually able to be there for other people more. I&#8217;m able to handle more. It&#8217;s just something that I think that everyone needs to take into consideration. It&#8217;s about like self-care, self-love, self-expression for sure. Self-expression because too many people hold things in and it builds up like a volcano and it explodes and it&#8217;s not fun. That was one of the things.</p>
<p>I was just like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t be living my life like that. I want to be happy. I want to make my work and be proud of the work I make and I want to be there for my friends and not feel exhausted or forced and doing all that work. That self-work allowed me to become much better.&#8221; That&#8217;s what I would say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you been able to tap into an artist community or a design community in Seattle?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Took me a hot minute, but I find it a little hilarious because I didn&#8217;t think it was going to work, but I went to a comic book store, Phoenix Comics &#038; Games, in Capitol Hill, and I went there, and I was looking at the local artists and they had local artists putting their comic books on the rack and I was like, &#8220;Oh, let me see if I could find somebody,&#8221; and thankfully I found my friend Tim, and his book, I think it&#8217;s called Enter the Wolves. He had his phone number and contact information in there, or was it just his email? Either way I contacted him and he responded and we met up. This is before I had any of our friends at all here on the West Coast. So, I went to go meet up with him. We hung out, had a cup of coffee, talked, and it was like later we decided to start making it a thing.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get together and draw and then we would do that and then we started to bring more people into the forward people. He knew people I would probably meet that were interested in meeting for the art meetup and it&#8217;s just now a regular thing and we&#8217;ve been doing it for years now, just doing our art meetup and drawing and just having a blast because one of the huge things I missed in Philly was my art community, was hang out with my friend Laurie and Kat and we would just hang out together and I loved that. I didn&#8217;t realize how much I would&#8217;ve miss that until I moved to Seattle and it was no longer accessible and I needed that back in my life or at least closest to as I could get. So, having that art community is a huge blessing and it&#8217;s awesome and it also helps me focus too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Ooh, if I&#8217;m going to be home I&#8217;m going to have to adjust myself, but if I go out and meet with my art friends, then I have no excuse. I can just go in there and start drawing because I&#8217;ll be fine and chill with my folks.&#8221; So, absolutely worth it of trying that, just emailing random artists like, &#8220;Hey, you want to meet up and such like that?&#8221; I&#8217;m just glad that I did that because usually I get social anxiety and I get nervous about talking to people, but it was like, no, I&#8217;m not going to let that stop me from making new friends. I&#8217;m going to go out there and I&#8217;m going to do it. Yeah, I&#8217;m just very grateful for that. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you spoke earlier about Larry Houston, but I&#8217;m curious, are there other artists or illustrators that have influenced your work the most?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Jim Lee.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Because he was drawing the X-Men back in, I think, the &#8217;80s, &#8217;90s-ish. Like I said, I&#8217;m a huge X-Men fan. You just don&#8217;t know. I have so much X-men on my wall about besides that. No, Jim Lee, it was definitely for sure because I loved the intensity he will put into his ink work. It was just so comic bookish style and it really made the X-Men look really cool and I was just like, &#8220;Oh my God, I could just read this all day.&#8221; Another artist I would say is Ross Straus. Him, I enjoy because of a lot of his potent color. Like my art teacher back in Hussain would talk about how juicy the colors are, you know? When we&#8217;re painting, she&#8217;s like, &#8220;Get the juice in there,&#8221; and I&#8217;m just like&#8230; ever since then when it comes to my art, I just have to put juice into my color.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like I need to make this a little bit more pow in your face. So, yes, that was definitely another one. Alex Ross is another one. He is much more of a traditional. He does works in, like I think traditional acrylics or oils. I&#8217;m not exactly sure, but he does work with traditional mediums and his work is taking the comic book world and making it more into a realistic kind of vibe and he does a lot of dramatic lighting too. So, I just loved it. I just love how he was able to take that world that was fiction and bring it so close to reality. So, sometimes I&#8217;m doing my work. If I&#8217;m working on a cover or something like that, I&#8217;ll step on comic book style. I&#8217;ll probably go for an illustration style just because it gives it a completely different vibe. It gives the character more of a breath of life kind of scenario.</p>
<p>I mean, I love the graphic feel, but something about just seeing a character that looks almost realistic. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh crap.&#8221; You&#8217;re just like, &#8220;That looks great,&#8221; and one more is Simon Bianchi. I hope I pronounced his last name right, but I believe he is a French artist who works for Marvel and he does a lot of acrylic watercolor kind of techniques where it&#8217;s a combination of realistic and comic book style and I just loved how he would illustrate such a dramatic use of colors and his hair detail. He would draw a lot of detail in the hair, but it would just look so beautifully well planned. I can&#8217;t even get into full detail about how his stuff works, but Simon Bianchi is definitely an artist I studied especially back in art school. When I was learning watercolor, I would just look at his pictures and I would just paint what I saw.</p>
<p>I would just paint up a panel I saw of his I really enjoyed and because of that, I actually got much better with watercolor the next year because watercolor was literally the first medium I was trying to get really good at and it took a hot minute for me to understand how to manipulate watercolor, but now it&#8217;s like after all those years of studying and investing time and studying that medium, watercolor, I just was excited to actually be able to utilize it to make an image the way I wanted to because watercolor is very, very tricky. So, thank you, Simon, for doing that for me because now I know how to paint.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you mentioned that your father was a traditional artist. Was he an illustrator also?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
He definitely did his own paintings. He didn&#8217;t do it professionally, but he wanted to, but unfortunately he didn&#8217;t have the support of his family, like not the way that I do and I&#8217;m just grateful for him to give me that support because he knows how hard it is out here in the creative field because so many people want to jump in and do it, but my dad still does make art till this day. Like I was talking to him and my mother for Mother&#8217;s Day and he showed me these pieces he was working on. It was so beautiful, abstract, gorgeous, surreal kind of fantasy and it just makes me so happy that he&#8217;s still making his art because this is a part of who he is. He might not be doing it professionally, but at least he&#8217;s still doing it and I&#8217;m just happy and proud of him for that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. What advice would you give to any aspiring artist? They&#8217;re hearing you talk about your work and your process and they want to follow in your footsteps. What advice would you give to them about just starting out in the industry?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Number one I think is patience. Patience with yourself, patience with the process of making art and patience with the process of getting work if you want to pursue it professionally. It took me a hot minute before I started to get more commissions coming in manually, and it took a while for me to get to that point where, hey, I don&#8217;t have to look for commissions. People just come to me and asked me, &#8220;Hey, can you do this for me?&#8221; All that took a while and like I said, without that actual chart to show you, hey, you&#8217;re on step two now. You&#8217;re on step three. Woo. Without that, it&#8217;s so easy for you to feel like you&#8217;re not moving. You&#8217;re standing still, like your career&#8217;s not going anywhere, and especially if you are starting off with illustrate, like you&#8217;re starting off by making art and you&#8217;re not at the level you want to be, it&#8217;s so hard to be patient with yourself, especially when you&#8217;re comparing yourself to other artists.</p>
<p>I think people need to have much more patience with themselves and understand that what&#8217;s going to get you there is consistency, to keep trying, to keep painting, to try new things, to share your work. Don&#8217;t be afraid to share your work. That&#8217;s something that I still struggle with sometime. I mean, I know I have a lot of content on my social media. Yes, I do, but there are moments where my partner will catch me. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t overthink it. Just write out your stuff and post it on there,&#8221; and I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;You&#8217;re right. I just wanted to be perfect,&#8221; but there&#8217;s no such thing as perfect. The best way to be perfect is to be yourself authentically and then there you go. Just be your genuine self. That is perfection.</p>
<p>I would definitely say that that&#8217;s something that that&#8217;s needed is patience. No one&#8217;s going to give you a timeline of when you&#8217;re going to get that job either and that&#8217;s frustrating. I could totally get that, but you also just got to&#8230; Like I said, you got to be patient with that process. You won&#8217;t know until it actually happens in that moment. Like this podcast, I didn&#8217;t think I was going to get interviewed for a podcast and next thing you know, it just pops out in a moment. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, wow. Okay.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Fine.&#8221; Even the Western Hotel thing, that was another random thing, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh my goodness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another thing I would say for sure is give yourself affirmations for sure. If you had to make yourself that list and cross something off that you got done to get that pat on the back kind of feel, then do it. I would say go for it. That&#8217;s absolutely necessary because it&#8217;s so easy for you to do things and then forget what you do because this happened to me before and still does sometimes. You forget what you do in the day and then you feel like you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, I could have done more.&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;No, no, you&#8217;re doing pretty darn good. Look at that list.&#8221; I think it&#8217;s definitely important to give yourself that affirmation and also to sometimes take a look back at your old art and look at your art the way it is now so that way you can give yourself that affirmation of, oh, I did grow. You know? Because it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s so&#8230; Being an artist is a marathon. It&#8217;s not a race. It&#8217;s a marathon. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying to be consistent and with that marathon you&#8217;re running, it&#8217;s so easy for you to feel like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not growing as an artist.&#8221; My skill level&#8217;s not improving or whatnot and it&#8217;s always good to look back at your old art pieces and don&#8217;t compare to other artists.</p>
<p>That other artist is on a completely different path than you. Not every artist is going to get a job the exact same way. Not every artist is going to get noticed the exact same way. It&#8217;s so different from each other, it&#8217;s frustrating because you wish that there was a book to go ahead and tell you like, &#8220;This is exactly how you do it.&#8221; Oh no, there&#8217;s no book. You just got to put your stuff out there and be consistent and don&#8217;t be a butt hole. That&#8217;s another thing. When you&#8217;re talking to people, always want to be a genuine person, but also treat that person with fellow respect. No one likes to work with somebody who&#8217;s mean or nasty or comes off as aggressive. No, like this is networking and building a relationship, a friendship. You want to make sure that you are presenting yourself the best way you can be that is genuine and true, and I think that&#8217;s just something to absolutely consider as well and another thing I think that&#8217;s beneficial is trying out new things.</p>
<p>Like I&#8217;ve done watercolor, acrylics, used acrylics as watercolor and on canvas, digital painting. Now, I&#8217;m starting to get into story boarding and sculpting. Sculpting too. It&#8217;s like you are an artist and yes, you have a preference, but it&#8217;s always refreshing just to get into something just a little bit new and it keeps your excitement up. It keeps you like, ooh, I&#8217;m so excited just to try that out. You&#8217;ll see what comes out and everything. I&#8217;m painting on canvas now, and usually I don&#8217;t paint on canvas. I usually leave that alone, but with that 10-minute piece painting I was doing at the Western Hotel, that was something that really brought that out on me that I was like, &#8220;I want to paint on canvas. I want to try that out.&#8221; I feel something that&#8217;s pulling me towards that and it was like that kid-like spark that was like, &#8220;Ooh, I need that.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, now doing that and looking at the canvas, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I am happy,&#8221; and I think that&#8217;s definitely something important to do is don&#8217;t be afraid to challenge yourself and don&#8217;t be afraid to show your art, self-affirmations and patience with yourself, and one more I think is self-awareness, and self-awareness, I mean by that is just acknowledging if you are upset about something because being an artist isn&#8217;t just drawing pictures. It&#8217;s you&#8217;re putting your energy into that piece. You&#8217;re giving parts or you&#8217;re putting parts of yourself into that piece, and if you&#8217;re upset or going through something, it&#8217;s going to show up, or you might not be able to draw as well. You might not be able to think as well. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to be self-aware about what state of mind you&#8217;re in, and it&#8217;s all about just giving yourself that attention, acknowledging that you&#8217;re not okay or you&#8217;re upset, or maybe you&#8217;re just tired and burnt out.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good for you to acknowledge this and to know this so that way you can just take care of yourself, give yourself a hug, or get a hug from a friend or talk to somebody you trust, and this is definitely something that will help you out for sure because being an artist, and especially in a world like this, it&#8217;s stressful. It can be very stressful, but it&#8217;s also very, very rewarding, especially when you are just giving it your all and you see it pay off. It&#8217;s something absolutely worth it, and long as you are just making sure that you&#8217;re your own best friend, you&#8217;re going to get there just like you got to make sure you give yourself some loving and you got to make sure that you just acknowledge when you need something, and I think that&#8217;s important too. That&#8217;s my advice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have a dream project you&#8217;d love to do one day?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Oh, okay. It&#8217;s on my list. It&#8217;s on top of my list. I want to be a cover artist for Marvel, because I just like doing illustrations. I just love doing the storytelling. I want to be a cover artist. I want to do full-on paintings and do stuff for them. I want to do stuff for Wizards of the Coast because I love the overall style of their world. They&#8217;re just this beautiful like&#8230; It&#8217;s like Renaissance paintings. I don&#8217;t know if you know what I&#8217;m talking about, but it&#8217;s like they have that soft glow. It&#8217;s like the way they paint them. I was going to the Seattle Art Museum, and I was noticing these pieces that were back in the day Renaissance Times where I have no clue how they did it, but the way they painted, it&#8217;s almost looked like they were computers themselves, but you could still tell it was by an artist, of course. The way they just captured a glow or the texture or the way the person was, like the way they were standing. It&#8217;s just like their bodies weren&#8217;t even stiff. Something like that. It&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Oh God. Yes. That is exactly what I need.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We had someone on the show a couple of months ago, Lauren Brown. I think she&#8217;s an art director at Wizards of the Coast. I&#8217;m looking now. Yeah, Emmy Award-winning illustrator and art director at Wizards of the Coast. She&#8217;s here in Atlanta too. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Oh, nice. I&#8217;m going to look them up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes. Yeah, so there&#8217;s a lot. I mean, there&#8217;s certainly, I think as you sort of mentioned that, I think that opportunity is definitely going to be out there for you because as I talked about earlier, it just seems like there&#8217;s more and more Black people, really people of color, but I&#8217;d say Black people specifically that are really being out there, especially with the major titles. I&#8217;m really surprised to see how many are doing things for Marvel. We&#8217;ve had a few motion graphics designers that have done work for some of the movies, like Black Panther or into the Spider-Verse. It&#8217;s amazing how we are starting to get out there more. I mean, granted, it&#8217;s still not super diverse like in the grand scheme of things, but I feel like that&#8217;s going to happen for you sooner rather than later. I really think that.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Oh, thank you. Yes, please. I want that as like I can feel my spirit trying to grab it with its hands. It&#8217;s like I want it. It&#8217;s like I need that because in the future, I want to have my own company, like Marvel or Wizards of the Coast where it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m able to give those same opportunities for other people of color and especially Black people. It&#8217;s like there&#8217;s so much talent there and it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s so untapped and now we&#8217;re just tapping into it. It&#8217;s so much more like Woman King. Oh my God. [The] Woman King, Viola Davis, like oh my God. Thank you for doing that movie because that was amazing. Michelle Yeoh about&#8230; What&#8217;s it? Everything In Our Place. That&#8217;s a long title.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Everything Everywhere All at Once.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Yes, that&#8217;s another one. It&#8217;s like see what happens when people of color and diversity is represented. You get awesomeness. You get wonderful stories. It&#8217;s just something that is needed and in the future, if I can provide that opportunity for more people, I will. If I can reach back and grab my fellow artists and be like, &#8220;Hey, I did not forget about you. Come here. I got something for you.&#8221; I want to do that and I feel like that&#8217;s something that a lot of people of the community should be doing. It&#8217;s the only way for us to excel and expose ourselves to more and get our names out there because there&#8217;s so much that haven&#8217;t been shown yet and we&#8217;re just tapping the tip of the iceberg for all this. I just think it&#8217;s going to be amazing and I just can&#8217;t wait to be a part of it.</p>
<p>I just want to be a part of it, and I just want to be there with my fellow nerds, my fellow awesome nerds and yes, just being in a convention surrounded by people who are raised in the same world that you were raised in. You know, just like anything, like fantasy, sci-fi, comics, movies, games, all that. It&#8217;s such a beautiful way to bond with people and to share that. It&#8217;s so much fun and I feel like one of the biggest things, adults forget to have fun and to be a kid again, and honestly being an adult, you&#8217;re just older and you forget to tend to that inner child and it&#8217;s like, no, no, no, no, no. So, it&#8217;s when adults go to conventions and it&#8217;s like someone who&#8217;s like 50 and they&#8217;re still buying action figures and whatnot, go for it. Do it.</p>
<p>You work so hard. You get that action figure. You get it and you flaunt it like seriously. It&#8217;s just like we need to make sure we&#8217;re balancing out that fun and I feel like that&#8217;s what my work and the industry of creativity gives to people, gives you that permission. Even though you don&#8217;t need permission, you should be having fun. It gives you that childhood like happiness, and I think that that&#8217;s why the reasons why it&#8217;s so important to be an artist is to bring that out of people so people can still feel that. I think it&#8217;s still so important for it. I think it&#8217;s very important.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? I mean, I feel like you&#8217;ve already spoken some of that into the universe now, but what do you want the next chapter of your story to look like?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Oh, goodness. I have visions of how I want things to look like. As I say this to you, I&#8217;m actually looking at my manifestation board. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve come to really enjoy doing because I&#8217;m looking at my manifestation board and some of it&#8217;s already come true, which is great, but in the future, I would like to go to more conventions for sure. That&#8217;s something I love doing, just to be in that world full of people who enjoy the same things I do and to interact with them and to show them my work. It&#8217;s one of the greatest gifts to create art and someone comes along and they&#8217;re just entranced by it or they are feeling things because of it, that the art has moved to some kind of way, and I think that is awesome. So, I definitely will want more of that.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t had my work in galleries before, so I am focusing on getting my work in galleries too, because now painting on Canvas, it&#8217;s like I want to develop so much art on canvas, bigger size, small size, all the size. So, I definitely want to have more of my work in the galleries and I want to have my comic book up and have it out there because it&#8217;s like my own stories I&#8217;ve had on my mind for a while. I started to give it some more work recently, so I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m grateful that I&#8217;m starting to get back into that,&#8221; and in the future, I would definitely love to have a comic book made officially, have a shiny cover, and maybe a 3D model made of a character.</p>
<p>Five years from now, I just want to be making art like crazy and I want to be a part of those teams that make fun projects like people at Marvel, like the people who get to be a part of the whole process of the movie and whatnot. I would love to be a part of that. I would love to be part of a company like Wizards of the Coast where it&#8217;s like I can give contributions to like, hey, let&#8217;s make this character, whatnot, and just design new stories and characters and whatnot. I would love to do that just to be fully submerged more into my craft, and I think that&#8217;s something that I have recently come to full-on terms, which is like acknowledging that this is not only my career, but being an artist is my life and I love being an artist. So, it&#8217;s like I just want more of all of that. I am greedy and I want all of that.</p>

You can always go under my full name, Isiah Xavier Bradley and my page would show up. Just include that Xavier part, and we&#8217;re all good, and most people get confused with how to spell my name, so I am going to say it&#8217;s spelled I-S-I-A-H, and then underscore XB. Most people spell Isiah with two As. For some reason, mine is just with one A. I don&#8217;t know why, but okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. There you go. Well, Isiah Xavier Bradley, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on this show. I think if there&#8217;s anything that people will get from this interview is that you have this joy. It&#8217;s not even passion. I mean, I will say passion is probably there too, but you have this joy about just the fact that you&#8217;re doing exactly what it is that you want to do that is infectious. You&#8217;re excited about the genre. You&#8217;re excited about your work. You&#8217;re excited about all these things, but you&#8217;ve also taken the time to make sure that your own self is prospering and well throughout all of this.</p>
<p>I mean, the world is changing at such a rapid rate. I mean, you talked about self-care and rituals and things of this nature, so I really get a feeling that people will listen to this and they&#8217;ll get a really good sense of you as an artist, as a creative, and hopefully we&#8217;ll follow your work and we&#8217;ll see that Marvel cover one day. I&#8217;m putting it out there. We&#8217;re going to see you one day, but yeah, thank you again so much for coming on the show, man. I appreciate it.</p>

<p>I first learned about Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton way back in 2015 when I interviewed <a href="/silas-munro/" data-wpel-link="internal">Silas Munro</a>. Since then, Tasheka has gone on to become one of the leading voices behind discovering Black people omitted from the graphic design history canon. Even design legend <a href="/dr-cheryl-d-miller/" data-wpel-link="internal">Dr. Cheryl D. Miller</a> has sung her praises, so I knew I had to sit down with Tasheka and learn more about her remarkable journey.</p>
<p>Tasheka spoke to me about her experience as an educator and researcher, including an examination of her teaching philosophy. She also talked about growing up in New Orleans, her shift into design, working for the Navy Reservists, and even starting her own studio, <a href="https://blacvoicedesign.myportfolio.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Blacvoice Design</a>. Lastly, she discussed her upcoming book <em>Black Design in America</em>, and shared how the different aspects of her work keep her motivated and inspired. </p>
<p>If there&#8217;s any lesson you learn from Tasheka, it should be this one: you have control over your own path as a designer, so work hard and you can make your dreams come true!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Hi, and first, I want to say Maurice, thanks for having me here on Revision Path. I&#8217;ve been a listener for a long time now, so I feel really grateful and honored to be here. My name is Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton. I&#8217;m a designer, design educator. I run a design studio called Blacvoice. I also am a researcher, I guess, or design historian in regards to Black designers, as well as design writer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has this year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Very busy, but good for the most part. It&#8217;s been a really, really good year with lots of new projects on the horizon. Exciting and exhausting, all at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Any plans for the summer?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes, family vacation is one of the plans. I will be attending Typographics, and I&#8217;ll be a speaker there. So it&#8217;s exciting because I&#8217;ve never been to the conference before, and it&#8217;s kind of strange to have that my first attendance there would be me actually giving a talk, so I&#8217;m excited about that. I&#8217;m going to be teaching, I guess, this summer. I don&#8217;t normally teach in the summer, but I&#8217;m co-running a design residency program at the University of Texas, Austin where I teach. So I&#8217;m looking forward to that as well. And I have a couple of writing projects that I&#8217;ll be working on over the summer, and some design stuff as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Sounds like you&#8217;re going to have a busy summer ahead.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, speaking of teaching, you are teaching at two universities right now. You&#8217;re at Vermont College of Fine Arts, and you&#8217;re at the University of Texas at Austin, which is pretty new. You&#8217;ve been at VCFA what, for 10, 11 years now?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s been 10 years in April. 10 years. I started there in 2013.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
It&#8217;s kind of crazy to think that I&#8217;ve been there that long, actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What has the experience been like there?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Wow. The experience at VCFA has been truly amazing and transformative, and I think a lot of it has to do with the amazing faculty that&#8217;s there, that I teach with, who are not only colleagues but longtime friends now. It has to do with the sort of non-traditional structure of the program. We don&#8217;t have any classes or any courses. The program is, if you think about it as a two-year-long independent study, basically it&#8217;s a self-directed program where students decide on what they want to study and what they&#8217;re interested in. And the faculty is there basically, to sort of guide them and offer them resources, but it&#8217;s a self-directed program.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, that&#8217;s really interesting. No classes or courses?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you don&#8217;t have to put any curriculum together. That&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
No. So yeah, it&#8217;s definitely a different experience. So you do work with the students during the residency to come up with a semester plan on what they&#8217;re going to be working on throughout the semester. So as a faculty, you are there to help guide them and shape that semester plan. But again, it starts with what they&#8217;re interested in. We meet once a month. Students send their work via email, and then we have an hour conversation through, usually Zoom, and to talk about the work and sort of reflect on it, and kind of give feedback on how to move forward over the next month.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love how sort of open that is, especially I think during this time when I know we&#8217;re not out of the pandemic, but certainly, I think it&#8217;s still a time where some schools are trying hybrid models or things. That sounds like the way that it&#8217;s set up at VCFA, it allows you to really still be able to learn in that type of environment.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes. I think the one thing that at the core of the program is, first of all, it&#8217;s really tailored to, working professionals are people. You don&#8217;t have to quit your job for two years to get an MFA. You can still work or run your business, or whatever it is you&#8217;re doing and still go to school. And this is something that we&#8217;ve been doing prior to the pandemic.</p>
<p>So when the pandemic happened, not saying that it didn&#8217;t change the program and how we teach, but we were already sort of interfacing in that way. So the only thing it stopped was having the week long residencies that we would have twice a year in person. Then that programming got moved to Zoom. But as far as the interaction between the student and the teacher, or we say the student and the advisor, that was already happening.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now one of the professors that&#8217;s also there, we&#8217;ve had on the show. Oh God, that was a long time ago. We had Silas Munro on the show. This was I think, episode 85, 86, something like that. But he&#8217;s also a professor there, I believe.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah. So Silas, so you brought Silas up. Silas is one of the reasons, that&#8217;s how I ended up at VCFA actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
He&#8217;s one of the founding members of the program and Silas and I, we overlap by a year at CalArts. And so yeah, when the program was starting up, he sent me an email and asked me to join the faculty. And I wasn&#8217;t able to join at the time because of obligations with teaching. But then the following semester in April of 2013, I was able to come on board as a visiting, as a guest. Sort of a preliminary or, I wouldn&#8217;t say probationary period, but just to test to see if it would work out for me and if it would work out for the program.</p>
<p>So yeah, I credit Silas to bringing me in to a community in the program that&#8217;s, like I said, it&#8217;s been really transformative. Especially, the sort of approach to design pedagogy, this openness and not having this one idea of what design is. That sort of shift and change and marks according to the students, and the type of work that they&#8217;re interested in, and the type of diversity and the faculty and what we study and research, and type of work we&#8217;re engaged in. So that&#8217;s the thing that I really like, and it&#8217;s probably one of the few places that I&#8217;ve worked where I really felt a sense of family with my coworkers. Not that I didn&#8217;t have that relationship with other places, but there it&#8217;s really genuine. It&#8217;s not forced, it&#8217;s not fake. We actually truly do like and love each other.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, first of all, props to Silas for bringing you in, but it sounds like it is a great environment because you&#8217;ve been there for 10 years. Nobody&#8217;s going to stay there for 10 years if it&#8217;s not good.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, no, that&#8217;s true. Actually, you saying it, it&#8217;s technically the longest job I&#8217;ve ever had.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
When I think about it, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;re also teaching at University of Texas at Austin, which is fairly new. Tell me more about that. How&#8217;s that experience?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Wow, it&#8217;s been great, to be honest. I haven&#8217;t been there that long. I just moved to Austin, so I&#8217;m new to Austin and I&#8217;m new to UT. It&#8217;s been a really good experience as far as working in an environment with, I guess kind of similar to VCFA, where you don&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s this sort of one way that the faculty or the program is trying to teach design. It&#8217;s a little bit more flexible, it&#8217;s a little bit more nuanced where students get to dabble in a lot of different areas of design. Graphic design, industrial design, interactive design, design history, product design. So it&#8217;s really sort of flexible in that way and that&#8217;s one of the things that sort of drawed me in into UT.</p>
<p>The program itself was revamped around 2017, 2018. So the program as it is today, design, it&#8217;s the Department of Design and Creative Technology, is fairly new in a sense compared to a lot of other programs that are out there. So I think there&#8217;s something about that sort of newness. There&#8217;s a lot of vulnerability and a lot of questioning about the direction of the program. So it&#8217;s kind of exciting to be somewhere where we&#8217;re constantly thinking about ways to evolve and improve the experience for the students.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What is your teaching philosophy? I would imagine, between the work you&#8217;ve done at VCFA and are currently doing, and now with teaching at UT. And you&#8217;ve taught at some other places as well. What&#8217;s your overall teaching philosophy?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Well, one is, I try to approach teaching, one of the things that probably on the first day of class, I let my students know that, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m interested. I&#8217;m more interested in what you&#8217;re interested in learning, and what you&#8217;re interested in general out there in the world.&#8221; Not that I don&#8217;t have anything to impart or to give to them, but it&#8217;s less about me walking into the classroom saying, &#8220;Hey, listen up, I&#8217;m the expert here. You all need to learn what I have to offer.&#8221; Obviously, there is an important exchange that&#8217;s sort of happening, but I&#8217;m not interested in the hierarchies that traditionally plagues, I think, academia. So that&#8217;s the first thing is, to let my students know, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m curious about you, who you are as a person, and what you&#8217;re interested in.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other part of my teaching philosophy is, so how do I nurture that? How do I give them assignments, and give them projects and things to learn, to help nurture those interests? So often, I give projects and things that are about to help students investigate their community, and their environment and their identity. I think it&#8217;s really important for students to feel a connection to the project brief, to what they&#8217;re working on. And to figure out how to sort of channel their life&#8217;s experiences, as well as who they are into their projects. There are some practical exercises that are given to topography to talk about kerning and leading and that kind of stuff. But the start of bigger projects, I really try to figure out how to give assignments to help them sort of explore who they are in their environment and their community. Also, really, I think it&#8217;s important, one of my other goals is to make sure that I&#8217;m giving them projects or I&#8217;m giving them things to read and write about, and to consider about what&#8217;s going on in the world.</p>
<p>I like having discussions and I don&#8217;t shy away from, I won&#8217;t say controversial conversations, but I don&#8217;t like to shy away from, there&#8217;s always a group of students that have a certain perspective about another thing, and then you might have another group that have a different perspective. So I like having those type of conversations so we can learn from each other, because too many times that we all are always listening to and engaging in conversation with people who have the same perspective as we do. So, I always often give reading assignments, or articles or essays, or just come up with topics or things that might make some of them feel uncomfortable sometimes, where they have to talk about things that they don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;s going to be received by their classmates. And also, try to give them a sort of sense of agency and responsibility when it comes to their own learning, and not just take everything at face value to question, even question me, right? But obviously with the mutual respect, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d love to hear an example of something you would cover in class with your students.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Sometimes, it&#8217;s as simple as, I think this project isn&#8217;t something kind of, out of the park, but giving them &#8230; One time I had students design sort of protest signage. So they could approach it with whatever topic, anything that they felt really strongly about. Some people feels really strongly about, you should have solar panels on your house. Some people still feel really strongly about abortion, which sometimes for me, some of these topics that are still surfacing are kind of surprising. And some people feel strongly about police rights and things like that.</p>
<p>So any type of way I can give them some kind of assignment that addresses these issues, usually I try to get them to think about stuff that&#8217;s relevant in the media. Things that people are on opposite sides or sort of butting heads about, just to see, how do you handle that in the design context? Even, how do you handle as a designer having conversations about, &#8220;Well, if you have a very specific social or political agenda, what does it means to do design? Or could you do design for somebody to have a different perspective than you do?&#8221; So those type of conversations I think, are important to have.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I totally think that&#8217;s important because at any point throughout your design career, you&#8217;re going to encounter some conflict. I mean, I think we know the goal is to try to not have this sort of conflicts with clients or prospective clients or anything like that, but it&#8217;s going to happen. I mean sometimes you&#8217;ll have a client, you think they&#8217;re one way, and then you start working with them and it&#8217;s completely different. And even as you&#8217;ve said about personal views and such like that, it can get really tricky because the world is not just, I mean, not to use this as a racial thing, but it&#8217;s not a black and white place. There&#8217;s all sorts of ambiguity and things in there. So the fact that you&#8217;re able to work out those scenarios and issues with students in a learning environment is really important, because then they don&#8217;t get out there in the real world and have greater consequences for those sorts of scenarios.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah. So that&#8217;s one of the reasons why I do it, because I feel like if we can&#8217;t have these open discussions and conversation and academic space, then what&#8217;s the point of education or school in that environment? At least, that&#8217;s how I look at it.</p>
<p>Another project that I did when I was working at NC State last year was, I tasked my students with doing some design research in their hometown. So if they were from Charlotte, if they were from, I don&#8217;t know, somewhere in Germany, it didn&#8217;t really matter where they were from, but they had to do research about design in their particular community, where they were from. It was up to them if they wanted to pick where they live presently or somewhere where they were raised. And I gave them some sort of guidelines or places to start, I would say, because obviously if you said, &#8220;Okay, go research Charlotte, they may not know where to start.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I gave them four different areas to start. So I said, &#8220;Hey, why don&#8217;t you research the educational institutions, find out what schools offer design programs and research their faculty to see who&#8217;s working there? What type of design work or research that they do? Research the history publications in your particular area,&#8221; because I think newspapers and those type of print media is a good place to find the history of a place, sort of like the pulse, right? Design studios, talk to people there, make a list of all the ones that exist, maybe find out information about ones that used to exist. And I think the last place was printers. If they&#8217;re like print shops, go talk to those people. So those were the different areas as far as starting points that I gave them to start their research.</p>
<p>And then they had to interview people to help fill in the gaps of trying to create that sort of storyline. Because part of what they had to actually design was some kind of information design, but this wasn&#8217;t about charts and graphs. It was more like a storytelling or narrative sort of based research project, if you will. And then it was all the data, information was sort of collected in this zine that each student sort of designed together, and got it professionally printed at the end of the semester.</p>
<p>And I think it was a really good project. They learned a lot about design from where they were from, that they didn&#8217;t know, that they probably wouldn&#8217;t have even thought about if they didn&#8217;t have this project. And they learned something about themselves. I think for some of them, it was confidence boost. If you&#8217;re from somewhere or you come from an area where maybe design isn&#8217;t talked about or there are not a lot of people you see in design that look like you, and I think this project sort of helped them do some research and some discovery in those areas.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, what do you learn from your students? I mean, you mentioned earlier that you tell them at the beginning of the courses that you&#8217;re interested in learning from them. What kind of things do you learn?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I learn a lot from them. I think I can admit as a seasoned educator professional, but sometimes I go into the classroom with certain types of assumptions or misconceptions. So a lots of times, I might have assumptions what I think they might be interested in or what they should be. But then I learn actually, what they&#8217;re actually more interested in, and that sort of shifts and change sometimes. So for instance, a lot of students, now what I&#8217;m seeing, maybe something that&#8217;s trending because of technology is that, this sort of longing for tactile things, this longing to create and print things. Lots of times I think that students wouldn&#8217;t be interested in learning about letterpress, or screen printing or these sort of, or electroset. Electroset is something I love, doing electroset exercises with my students. And I really enjoy being able to talk to them about the history behind these all ways of printing.</p>
<p>But I find they&#8217;re really interested in these things. And I mean, you do have some that are like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m really more comfortable in a digital space, and that&#8217;s fine.&#8221; Again, I&#8217;m not there to try to not nurture what their interests are. But, I feel like I&#8217;m also there for to say, &#8220;Hey, look over here. There are these other ways of making and approaching design that sort of outside of maybe what you think you should be doing.&#8221; Or lots of times, I feel what I have learned is there are very specific things that sometimes students think, &#8220;Okay, design should be this way or look this way.&#8221; And a lot of it has to do with the tools that they&#8217;re using, because everybody&#8217;s using Adobe Sweden, everybody&#8217;s using Illustrator or whatever. And I try to tell them, &#8220;Well, if we&#8217;re all using the same tools, then everything starts to look the same. But why not take your ideas, and have your ideas and the content have to dictate what type of tool you use.&#8221;</p>
<p>So a lot of times I learn a lot that I shouldn&#8217;t make assumptions, about technology or different ways in which how they&#8217;re interested in making, or what they actually want to make. Sometimes I assume, &#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re probably interested in developing an app,&#8221; and they do have those type of interests, or they&#8217;re interested in AI. But then I find so many of them when it comes to technology, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t even want to touch that stuff over there. I want to get my hands dirty.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That is so fascinating to hear that students want to do kind of tactile things. I do a lot of different types of judging throughout the year. I&#8217;ll judge design competitions. I look at portfolios and things like that from students. And I have started to see more actual tactile work books, or pamphlets or zines or something like that. It&#8217;s such a stark contrast to 20 years ago. Now, I didn&#8217;t go to design school, but I knew people that were in design school at the time that I was also in school and everybody wanted a piece of digital. I guess it&#8217;s because it was just coming about at that time. I mean, when I went to college, there were computers. I remember vividly wanting to, I majored in computer science, computer engineering, and then switching my major over to math. Because I told my advisor I wanted to learn web design, and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s a fad. No one&#8217;s going to be into that sort of stuff.&#8221; And the school that I went to didn&#8217;t have an arts program, didn&#8217;t have a design program, so I just switched over to math.</p>
<p>But I knew people that were at the Atlanta College of Art, which existed back then, and the Art Institute of Atlanta. And everybody was just clamoring to try to do something with digital because they were tired of print. They were tired of, I guess, I don&#8217;t want to say they were doing maybe more traditional things like electroset or things like that. But everybody wanted to get in on the newness. And now, 20 years from then when technology is everywhere, now students want to get tactile, they want to make stuff. Yeah, I think that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, I think the thing that I have to keep in mind is that the way they&#8217;re growing up and how they&#8217;re entering these spaces in this world is very different from how I entered it, where I was there prior to computers and then post. Not that, to be honest, I don&#8217;t have the pay stop experience. I mean, I was in school at the advent of, Adobe was already there, Photoshop was already there. The Mac computer was already there in the early two thousands. So I was sort of a little bit post the desktop publishing area. But I think the thing that I forget is that, well, they&#8217;re so consumed, this is all they know. So for them they need a break. They are exhausted from the screen is what they tell me. So they&#8217;re kind of exhausted from it. And so when you show these other analog processes, they really light up. It&#8217;s really nice and encouraging to see that they still have these interests.</p>
<p>But again, there are some that are really interested in the technology. A lot of them are interested in the 3D sort of space and the digital space, but also the physical space. There are sort of a range. But I think that&#8217;s what I learn. The more I teach, the more I learn about what the sort of dynamics to what they&#8217;re interested in. And they have various interests and it&#8217;s not good to even put them into a box and assume what they&#8217;re interested in because, it&#8217;s a lot of different things that are out there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I love that. I love that. Students are tired of screens. I&#8217;m loving hearing that. Now, let&#8217;s learn more about you. Let&#8217;s hear your origin story. You&#8217;re originally from New Orleans. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me about what it was growing up there.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, I grew up in the inner city, not on the outskirts. I grew up in New Orleans, we sort of identified with the wards, which are actually voting wards. So I grew up in the seven ward, New Orleans, which the time that I grew up was predominantly Black or all Black maybe, don&#8217;t know the statistics on that, but a very urban inner city. Grew up poor, single mom, family. I&#8217;m the oldest of four siblings. Had a good childhood. I remember going outside and play, making games up as we go, just started using resources and things that we had around to play different sports, so to do different things. My mom was always really supportive in whatever it was I wanted to do. So when I was younger, I wanted to go to law school. Actually, I wanted to be an attorney. And so, I actually approached going to college, thinking that I was going to go to law school and practice law, actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow. What interested you about law?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
To be honest, Maurice, it was, the part of it that was probably really superficial, meaning I watched a lot of court shows growing up, and I got sucked into the drama of the investigations. And this aha moment when the real person, suspect was revealed. And the banter in the court and the back and forth between the attorneys, all the drama. So that seemed exciting because I always felt like, I&#8217;ve always had a strong voice, I guess, and a strong personality and perspective in that way. I can be very argumentative about things that I&#8217;m super passionate about. So I just thought I would be a good attorney. Why not? I was a good student, usually brought home good grades. So yeah, I could do this law school thing, and I can go to law school and do that.</p>
<p>The other side of it is, I also saw law as something that oppressed us as a people for a long time, and I wanted to understand it better to help us. So that was the sort of flip side of my interest in going to law school. But yeah, that faded when I actually, I mean I was really, up until my last year in college, I was still pursuing going to law school, to be honest.</p>
<p>Now, I was at Loyola, I was an English writing major. And the reason I picked that major was because I was told &#8230; I can&#8217;t remember if it was a job fair or a college fair when I was in high school and somebody said, &#8220;Oh, people who do really well in law school, they major in English because of all the writing and research you have to do,&#8221; whatever. So that&#8217;s really how that came about. And I did a lot of reading growing up. So the idea of having to read and write was kind of made sense, something I was sort of interested in. So yeah, that&#8217;s how that came about was because I wanted to be a good law student, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you had been on this path, I mean, to the point where you went to school, you were studying in it, you were getting all the way up to your senior year. Was there a deciding incident that kind of changed your trajectory?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
The incident was preparing to take the LSAT, I would say. So it was more like a process. So I want to say the first semester of my senior year, I was preparing to take the LSAT, researching what schools to go to. And all of that became extremely overwhelming and stressful, but it wasn&#8217;t exciting in a way, how things could be really overwhelming, but you&#8217;re still sort of excited about it, and if it&#8217;s you&#8217;re anxious. And so then I did some soul-searching and it was like, &#8220;Well, why do you want to do this Tasheka? Why do you want to go to law school?&#8221; And so, one of the things that is at the time it was really hard for me to admit, was that I honestly didn&#8217;t think I was good at anything, or I didn&#8217;t know what I was really good at. So because I was always sort of a good student, I just kind of looked at it as that way. I can go to law school, I&#8217;m going to be a good student, and then I&#8217;ll get a decent job.</p>
<p>I have always been a very goal driven oriented person. And so for me, it was always just sort of scratching things off the list. So go to school, major in English writing, do well, go to law school, take the LSAT, get a high grade, study. It&#8217;s just this constant thing. But when I actually really looked within, I realized that, well, I didn&#8217;t want to do it for the right reasons. You shouldn&#8217;t choose a career path just because it&#8217;s sort of checking off the list. I can accomplish this thing, but it&#8217;s not something that, I mean, I had a genuine interest in the law, but when I look back, yeah, it definitely wasn&#8217;t the right path for me.</p>
<p>So I just remember there was this one day, I used to do work study in the library. I just started going online and doing research about what do creative people do. So copywriter came about because I&#8217;m getting a degree in English, but at the time I didn&#8217;t feel too confident about my writing skills. So I was like, &#8220;Eh, I don&#8217;t really want to do that.&#8221; And then I remember, topography kept popping up, and this isn&#8217;t a time where in the early two thousands, when they had a lot of portfolio schools, like Miami AD and those type of schools.</p>
<p>So I was doing research and those type of schools kept popping up, and then I kept seeing topography and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What is topography? I don&#8217;t even know what that is.&#8221; So I looked in the school course catalog and I saw topography one and two, and then it was graphic design and I didn&#8217;t know what any of these, I wasn&#8217;t aware of any of this stuff, or what that meant as far as a career. And so the more I read and the more I did my research, I was like, &#8220;Oh, this design thing sounds really interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the next semester, I just went head first. I signed up to take a type one and a design one class, the year, the semester I was supposed to graduate. And then I fell in love with it. And then I pushed my graduation back about a year so I could get a minor in graphic design. And I didn&#8217;t get a true minor. I kind of had a relationship with the director of the art department at the time, because throughout my time in college, I took drawing and painting classes as my elective, because I&#8217;ve always had an affection for art and drawing. So I talked to her at the time and about getting a minor, and so they sort of told me that, just take the main classes. I didn&#8217;t have to take the foundations and stuff like that. So they sort of fast tracked me into design one and however many classes I could take within a year, because Loyola is a private Jesuit liberal university, just very expensive. And I was on a scholarship, so that extra year, I could only go to school those two extra semesters.</p>
<p>So I did that. After that year, it was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m a graphic designer now. That&#8217;s it. This is what I want to do.&#8221; Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a really interesting turn. I mean, you were already set to go along this way, and then you kind of just had another idea and there you go.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah. It wasn&#8217;t something that was obviously planned out in that way, but I&#8217;ve never looked back. I can&#8217;t honestly imagine being in any other field than design, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s really awesome that it sort of came about that way. I&#8217;m curious now on what Tasheka the lawyer would be like, if you would&#8217;ve went there.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I think about it, too. I don&#8217;t know, honestly. I mean, I think there&#8217;s a way that I would&#8217;ve found my niche. I would&#8217;ve found an area of law that would&#8217;ve been good for me. I don&#8217;t know how lucrative that would&#8217;ve been, especially if you think about going to a private undergraduate school, and then law school and then student &#8230; It&#8217;s just sort of the bills and student loans to pile up when you think about it. So yeah, I don&#8217;t know. I think I would&#8217;ve found my way, but I think that it definitely wasn&#8217;t the right path for me. And I think the sort of activist in me, I would&#8217;ve found whatever I guess sort of industry I would&#8217;ve ended up, I think I would&#8217;ve found that sort of angle.</p>
<p>But I do remember this one conversation I had with a lady at a job fair my senior year, and she said that her husband was an attorney and that he had a studio in their attic and he was a painter. And she said that, but once he started really getting into law, he stopped painting as much as he used to. And so I started thinking that I never wanted art to not be a part of my life. So that was sort of a reality check where I was, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want to go into law if this is going to prevent me from being creative or being a maker,&#8221; I guess.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So you graduated from Loyola, and I know later you went and got your MFA from CalArts. Between then, did you get out in the working world and experience a little bit of what it was like to not be a student for a while?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes. It was a very short time. It was exactly a year and four months to date. So yeah, after I graduated, I end up working as a designer at the Navy, which was such a strange thing for me personally, to end up working for the military. But yeah, I worked for the Navy Reservist Public Affairs Office, and they hired me because they saw my resume, that I took topography classes, which is kind of funny when I think about it. Because it&#8217;s like, well, when you go to, you study design, you take topography. It wasn&#8217;t nothing special. But anyway, but one of the other reasons they hired me was because they wanted somebody young with fresh ideas. And at the time, they were publishing and producing a tabloid newspaper. And so they wanted me on board to help transition that newspaper into a monthly magazine.<br>
I actually stayed there long enough just to do that, basically. We had a few firsts. I guess half the time I was there, we were publishing the newspaper. Then the second half, we transitioned over to a magazine, and that&#8217;s my first job. I will say that it was a really great learning experience in school, as far as print production and that kind of stuff. You don&#8217;t necessarily learn. So the Navy, I would drive to Panama City to go see the publication on press, that kind of stuff. So I learned all the production there. So yeah, it was a really good experience for me, as far as my first professional design job.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you were able to get that, I mean, one right out of school because you had this small amount of design experience just from studying, and they were like, &#8220;Yeah, we&#8217;ll go with that.&#8221; Nowadays, for entry level position, they already want you to have three years experience somewhere. So it&#8217;s good that they kind of took a chance and said, &#8220;Yeah, we&#8217;ll move forward and see what you have.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, I will say it was actually a head hunter that found me, or like a temp agency, I would say. And they put me in contact with the Navy. And I think that they were, because they were producing a publication, it was probably a time crunch. And so, I don&#8217;t know if I was the first person they referred them to. I don&#8217;t know if they had interviewed a bunch of other people. I have no idea. But I just knew that, oh, they were also impressed that I studied abroad. I&#8217;m trying to think of the things that they said to me during the interview or that made them sort of intrigued or want me to come in. They liked that I had spent some time abroad and that I took topography courses, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Where did you study abroad?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I studied abroad in Prague, in the Czech Republic. And it was mainly, it was more of a printmaking study abroad than graphic design. I mean, the graphic design aspect of it, was it that there was this workshop or this class that we took to set up design posters by hand. All analog, which was great, but it was really for printmaking, like lithography, learning to do aquatints and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And it was interesting, because it was actually with a program that was through NC State, and one of my professors at Loyola at the time was the person who was in charge. I had started that study abroad program. So it was kind of weird last year when I worked at NC State, it was like, &#8220;Oh, I did a study abroad program at this place and now I&#8217;m teaching here.&#8221; So I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s just kind of funny how things kind of happen that way in life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So tell me how your experience was getting your MFA at Cal Arts.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
That in of itself was an experience. CalArts was tough. I mean, I definitely went there knowing that it was going to be difficult, that it wasn&#8217;t going to be easy. Actually, I was there for three years. I got accepted for the three-year track. So a lot of schools now have a three year and a two-year track, and normally the three-year track is reserved for students who don&#8217;t have a traditional graphic design background. And so since my degree wasn&#8217;t in design, it was in English. And then, I had that limited experience, that year and a half working for the Navy. So I actually did three years instead of two. So the first year was, I guess an adjustment and challenging, in and of itself. For one, I was the only Black student there in the graduate and the undergraduate program, which for me was pretty shocking.</p>
<p>And the reason it was surprising is because I think, to be honest, at the time I was just starting, right before grad school and doing my first year of grad school. I was just starting to notice how there was a lack of visibility of Black people in design, or how the design profession didn&#8217;t seem to, or the lack of diversity that existed. Honestly, I don&#8217;t know why it took that long for me to actually realize that, but it wasn&#8217;t until, I think it was the 2004 AIGA conference that I realized that, where I saw maybe four or five other Black people at the conference. It was in Vancouver, I remember that. And then that&#8217;s when, that was not long before I actually started school at CalArts.</p>
<p>So that experience, and that was the thing that I think started me on this kind of trajectory, or the path into doing the research that I do, was looking around, not seeing anybody like me. Not learning anything about anybody who looked like me with the history class, or so, yeah, that&#8217;s sort of where I started. And me being at CalArts as a student, sort of asking the question, talking to faculty or just saying. Even sometimes it was in my work, I was questioning, where are the Black designers? When was the last time CalArts had a Black student in the MFA program? Nobody can answer that question. Or can you tell me something about Black people in design history? Nobody can answer that question.</p>
<p>So it became this thing where, and I know we&#8217;ve done similar sort of scavenger hunts. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Where the hell are all the Black people?&#8221; So anyway, that is where my research started. So because I couldn&#8217;t find anything out there that was tangible to hold onto, I just started doing my own research and investigation. Because I was like, &#8220;There&#8217;s nobody who&#8217;s here to tell me or give me that information. I have to discover it from myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I will say the faculty there was all, for the most part, it was, I felt supported. Although it was tough. It was like bootcamp, going to CalArts. It was a really, really tough, intense program. But I did feel encouraged most of the time for the type of projects that I had. And some of them was filled with a lot of emotion and anger, and aggression and frustration, and a lot of times that came out. But I will say that they sort of helped me nurture and cultivate my voice, and they also always encouraged me to be true, to keep that investigation and then that energy, and to being inquisitive about my design, Black design history, and culture and identity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s such a good thing now that it almost feels like, I&#8217;d say maybe within the past, I don&#8217;t know, 10, 15 years perhaps, we&#8217;ll say that. But we&#8217;ve started to see more Black design educators out there, and we&#8217;ve also started to see community efforts. I mean, Revision Path is one of them, but we&#8217;ve started to also see community efforts with making sure that Black people, and I would say Black and brown, I mean, I would kind of widen that lens a bit. But we&#8217;ve started to see now more people of color in general, being talked about, recognized, showcased, researched as it comes to design. I mean, I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;ll get to a point where there&#8217;s full equity with regards to that, but I think within the past 10 years, we&#8217;ve seen a lot of headway in that direction, where we&#8217;re starting to now see more Black students, or at least more talk about Black designers throughout history. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes, I would agree with that. There is definitely some sort of shift. I mean, if I&#8217;m honest, I&#8217;m not seeing it enough or as much as I would like to see it. But I&#8217;m also aware that things do take time, and especially when you have things that are so systemic and that&#8217;s a part of system that&#8217;s been there for so long that it&#8217;s not, it takes a long time to sort of dismantle it.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m honest, I do believe that it doesn&#8217;t have to, or it shouldn&#8217;t take it as long, but I understand it. I try to understand it. I do think that things can happen a lot quicker, but I do realize that there are still certain structures that are there, that&#8217;s way more difficult to dismantle to where it takes a lot longer. But I am happy to have colleagues. I didn&#8217;t think that I would see a day where I could name at least three other Black women that are doing similar type of work or things like that. So I am happy to see that there&#8217;s a change, and there&#8217;s a lot of work and way more work that needs to be done. But yeah, I agree. There are more efforts, I guess, and more initiatives that are happening at different places.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think with schools, it&#8217;s just always going to take longer because schools are just such, these large institutions. Of course, they get funds from different philanthropists and foundations and stuff like that. But I agree with you, in that I think the change could be happening a lot quicker. I a hundred percent agree with you there.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah. I just think that one of the things that I liked about UT was they started changing their admissions process. I think there are still more work to be done, but they have done away with the traditional portfolio. And so, their admission process is more a design prompt, so a student could &#8230; So the design program looks at just that one particular piece that they&#8217;re doing, and then they submit a 60-minute video that sort of talks about their process and their ideas, alongside the piece that they made for admissions.</p>
<p>So I think that, that takes a lot of pressure off because you still have so many students that, they don&#8217;t have the resources in their high schools to submit even a fine arts portfolio, let alone something that&#8217;s specific to design. Where you need all these different, you need a computer, you need the Adobe software, you need all these digital tools that a lot of high schools still don&#8217;t have those type of resources. So it&#8217;s nice to see that they&#8217;re at least trying to change that process a little bit, to make it more equitable for students of color to have access to the program.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, along with you being a design educator, and you mentioned this a bit earlier, you have your own design studio called Blacvoice Design. Tell me more about that. What are some of the projects or other work that you&#8217;ve done through your studio?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Well, a lot of projects I would say, first start off with the type of clients that I work with. So most of my clients are educational institutions like universities, colleges and things like that, nonprofit organizations, as well as kind of start up or small businesses. And I actually like the work that I do within those spaces. The type of projects that I do, format wise, most of them are books. I design a lot of books, but I don&#8217;t like to just consider myself a book designer because I do do identity projects and things like that. But a lot of the books that I do design, because a lot of my clients have modest budgets, usually I&#8217;m given texts and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>And so, I think that&#8217;s why I wear this hat of an image maker, because a lot of projects might call for me to take photos and I&#8217;ll take my own photographs for a particular project, or I do my own illustrations and create my own imagery for them. And so that I actually like. I like that whole process of generating the imagery, and doing the type setting, and doing the layout and the design. I really do enjoy being a part of that process from the beginning to the end. I thought at this point in my career that I would want to be in a more creative director sort of role, but I actually like and still enjoy being hands on.</p>
<p>So some projects that I&#8217;ve worked on in the past that are really kind of dear to my heart is, I used to do some work for a nonprofit organization. They&#8217;re now called 826 New Orleans, but they used to be called Big Class. And Big Class is a nonprofit organization. They started off basically sort of reaching out to the inner city public schools. And so, they would have writing prompts or writing projects for students to engage in after school. And so they would come up with themes, the students would come up with themes or topics that they wanted to write about. Usually it had to do with their feelings around their culture and their community.</p>
<p>And so, what I would do is basically, I would come in, talk to the student editorial board, find out what ideas they have about the design and the design process, and basically use that as information or inspiration and design a book for these individual projects. And so Big Class would take those books, they would have these readings, they would get people, they had their own press and their own imprint. And so they would publish and sell the books, and then they would just feed and go back into the sort of program. And I really like that program, because it not only gets students excited about writing, and writing is a form of expression, writing can be creative, right? Writing, I think gave them a sense of agency because they get to write, they get to publish, they get to put it out there, they get to have open mic and spoken words.</p>
<p>And so, I really love to see the sort of confidence that it gave these students, that maybe in their school, they may not ever have that type of experience. So for me to provide a platform for them to express themselves through words, through writing, I really did enjoy working with them. But now they&#8217;re part of this larger, more national collection of programs, that&#8217;s like 826 New Orleans, you have 826 Valencia. So 826 sort of exists in a lot of different cities. And my hope is to, there isn&#8217;t an 826 in Austin. Honestly, have no idea how to even start one. And it&#8217;s not that I even want to be in charge of one, but I would love to try to figure out how to create a rapport with some of the schools, some of the public schools here in Austin to try to get one started here. And then that way, it&#8217;s something that I would like my students at UT to be involved in that process, of helping those students design and get their work printed and published.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m a big advocate of designers needing to do more writing. A hundred percent. We had at one point in time, kind of design anthology called Recognize that we were doing through Revision Path, where we had designers just like, we would give a particular prompt or theme. I think the one we did before we shut it down was reset. I think reset was the theme. And so based off of that, we wanted people to submit essays up to 3000 words, centered around reset in whatever way that they wanted to. But it had to be design focused, like design writing. We didn&#8217;t get great ones. I&#8217;ll be completely honest. I think a lot of people rather wanted to design something than write something.</p>
<p>And even the first year that we did it, we would get some pushback from people, &#8220;Well, why do I have to write something?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;It&#8217;s a essay.&#8221; I mean, you have to write something because that&#8217;s the structure of it. I do want to bring it back one day if Revision Path can get the right funding and all of that. Because, I&#8217;m still a big proponent and believer of designers, I think, need to be, they need to know how to write because of course, it just helps you get your ideas out there. But it&#8217;s just so helpful for, and I think this probably ties into your research focus. It ties into your work being part of the cannon. If you can write down what you did, the work you did, case studies, et cetera, if it gets put out there in some way, if it gets preserved in some way, you&#8217;re now part of the cannon.</p>
<p>One thing with me, when I try to find guests for the show, it&#8217;s very hard for me to book a guest when I can&#8217;t find anything on them. I could maybe find-</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, you could maybe do some research.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, yeah, because I can maybe find a website or there&#8217;s maybe a blog post or something somewhere, but I need to be able to see what you&#8217;ve done so I can get a sense of who you are as a designer, if this is going to be a good fit, that sort of thing. But I say all of that to say that I&#8217;m a big, just huge fan of designers being writers, and write it down, write down your work, show your work.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I agree with that too, Maurice. And even as a person, I still think I have a very strange or uncomfortable, I think it&#8217;s a better word, relationship with writing. It&#8217;s something that with my teaching, I always make sure that there&#8217;s some writing component in a project for students, whether it&#8217;s a reflection to something they read or something they saw. I think it&#8217;s really important. I see a lot of similarities in the writing, in the design process. So for me, it&#8217;s been, although it&#8217;s still a place where I&#8217;m super uncomfortable in lots of times, a few years ago, to be honest, I think it was back in 2017 when I was teaching at Southeastern Louisiana University, and I had just gotten tenured there. And I didn&#8217;t realize at the time that until I was at NC State during that interview process, that up until that point, I had got tenured because of my creative work, because of doing exhibitions and things like that.</p>
<p>And at that point, I realized that with the research that I was doing, and then at that time, my research was startup, sporadic, how I was engaged with it. I started this research in graduate school, and then I would start to engage with it from time to time when somebody would ask me to give a lecture. And at some point, going back to what you were saying about the importance of the canon and sort of writing things down, that became a real turning point for me because at that point, I wanted to change my practice a little bit, and have it more focused on writing and publishing. Because in my mind, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, I can continue to do these lectures and talk about this stuff, but then what?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
What do you with it? And so I knew at some point I always wanted to write a book about Black design history. I knew, even from grad school back at CalArts, that&#8217;s something I wanted to do. I think, not until that point, I became more intentional about it. I was like, &#8220;Okay, if I want to shift,&#8221; not do away with making, not do away with freelance, not doing away with that work, but I wanted to be more intentional about the scholarly part of me, I guess, in that work. And sort of getting it out there and not have it just be through lectures. And I think, oral history and that stuff is valuable. I&#8217;m not trying to devalue that at all, but I do think there&#8217;s something about having something written and on a page, and printed and sort of documented. Right? I mean, I think it&#8217;s really important for our work and stuff to be documented, so it can be passed on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Exactly. I mean, the oral storytelling, and I realize we&#8217;re saying this on a podcast, but is mean that is important. But being able to write it down, pass it on, put it in a book, have it stored somewhere, that is what is really, that is the canon. That&#8217;s what you end up preserving. Speaking of books, I mean, we&#8217;re both working on books, but part of the research that I find is trying to find these writings and trying to find where people have talked about stuff. And you know what we&#8217;re doing now? Interviews. We&#8217;re having to talk to people because we can&#8217;t find where folks have written stuff down. So to that end, about books, as I mentioned that just now, you&#8217;re working on a book called Black Design in America. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, so I&#8217;m a co-author of Black Design America, African-Americans, and African Diaspora and Graphic Design, 19th to 21st Century. My co-authors are Silas Munro and Pierre Bowins. And how this book came about is not a linear kind of trajectory of story. So back in 2020, when George Floyd was murdered and you had the protests going on, and a lot of things were sort of happening online, VCFA had started this sort of virtual programming. I believe they contacted me and asked me if I was interested in doing a lecture or something about my research. And so at the time, I want to say around that time, I can&#8217;t remember exactly, but I know at some point, me, Pierre, and Silas had created a Google Doc, and we just started populating it with our research. And some of our focus on our research was slightly different. There was some overlap, but we started this Google Doc, and I think we started it with the intent of writing a book someday.</p>
<p>So the idea was that, &#8220;Okay, we want to have this document populated to start working on the outline.&#8221; So VCFA came to me. I decided that I didn&#8217;t want to just be the only voice talking about Black design history. So I invited Pierre and Silas to also give a lecture. So they call it these micro lectures. So still had the same amount of time that I had to give my lecture, but instead of me talking for an hour or 45 minutes, we each had 15 minutes to do a micro lecture, a mini presentation about our specific research.</p>
<p>So again, around that time, I met Dr. Cheryl Miller, and she was just starting, or had already started her archive for Stanford, a Black design history archive. And somebody gave her my name. And so, I met with her about sending my work there. And something that I still feel weird about saying was that was my first time hearing about her and her work, but I&#8217;m glad I did. I&#8217;m glad that we had that opportunity to talk and connect. And now she&#8217;s a huge mentor and influence, inspiration in my life. But that conversation with her sort of gave me a little focus. So I was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m really interested in the history of Black women in graphic design too.&#8221; So my portion of the lecture was about that.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re in the midst of the pandemic, and Silas had this idea. And so we all talked about how this information needs to get out there. I don&#8217;t know if we have time to go through the process of writing a book and getting published, and trying to do all the stuff that you have to go through, as you you&#8217;re working on one yourself. It&#8217;s a huge timeline. You don&#8217;t just do it overnight. It takes a lot of time. So Silas and his studio, that&#8217;s how they came up, and they put together the BIPOC Design History Classes, went live January of 2021. And so again, it wasn&#8217;t the intent to have the classes. And that sort of happened first. That idea, we thought, prior to the pandemic and whatnot, that we would be working on a book first. So that happened. That was the success. And so then after the chorus, then we felt like, &#8220;Okay, now we have to write this book now, because we kind of already have a structure. We have content.&#8221; But little did we know, Maurice, that it was not that easy.</p>
<p>These small classes. Okay. Yeah. There are chapters in the book, but I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s just, yeah, they&#8217;re still talking to people. There&#8217;s still more research to be done. There&#8217;s still more archives to visit. So it wasn&#8217;t just that simple to just make that transition from the series of classes, and then to make it into a book. So we&#8217;re still in the process of writing now. We have a hard, hard deadline coming up on June 1st, where we have to really turn over the manuscript. And we&#8217;re all also collaborating on the design of the book, too. So yeah, it&#8217;s been an interesting process.</p>
<p>And I think the thing that, I know for me, and I think from my co-authors as well, the thing that&#8217;s been most difficult is that it&#8217;s a design history book, but we&#8217;re not approaching it like a Meg&#8217;s book in a way, or this book came out a few years ago, it&#8217;s called Graphic Design Pioneers, or Pioneers in Design, where it&#8217;s focused on individuals. So we do talk about individual designers and sort of their impact, but it&#8217;s more about the diaspora, it&#8217;s more about Black experience in a way, and what we had to go through and deal with. It&#8217;s more about how we&#8217;ve been represented through visual culture, and who&#8217;s responsible for that and that kind of stuff. So it&#8217;s not necessarily about a clothesline of designers, although we do talk about individual people, because you can&#8217;t write a history book without acknowledging individuals. But, it&#8217;s not just about highlighting people, I guess in that way. It&#8217;s more about the different movements that happened, throughout time and throughout history.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, because I mean-</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
And we&#8217;ve been affected by it, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Because you&#8217;re, like you said, it&#8217;s set up with, it&#8217;s in the context of America during that time, and so there&#8217;s been wars, there&#8217;s been civil rights movements, there&#8217;s been other sorts of radical movements. And so, being able to talk about how Black design has been a through line with all of that in this country, we don&#8217;t learn it in school, in K through 12 schools. And based on what you&#8217;re saying, and probably from others, it&#8217;s probably not even something that&#8217;s really readily learned in colleges.</p>
<p>So having a book like this is super important, I think, not just to the design canon, but just like to American history in general. Because everything that we go through in this country has been designed in some capacity. That don&#8217;t necessarily mean that it&#8217;s been done with a pen and paper or in some visual aspect, but the systems of oppression that are in this country and many other things that sort of hold people back or push others forward, these are designed constructs. And so being able to talk about Black design in this country is super important to, I think, informing that for a lot of people. So, I&#8217;m excited to see the book when it comes out. Congratulations to you, because I know it&#8217;s a lot. I know all too well. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I mean, I think writing a book is a challenge, in and of itself, but I think history, and I think we have a special challenge in the type of history that we&#8217;re trying to bring to light, because it hasn&#8217;t been well documented or readily available. So it&#8217;s a lot of things you have to do to discover these stories. That&#8217;s definitely been a challenge. I think, one thing that I want to say I&#8217;m proud of about how we approach the writing in this book is that we sort of try to do away with &#8230; we&#8217;re being ourselves. We feel like using I, then we use I. If we want to throw in a little snarky, something that maybe a long time ago would be unorthodox for a history book, but we are just throwing it and putting it all out there. We&#8217;re not sort of concerned about our voices being the same, and we like that our voices are fluid and they&#8217;re sort of interchangeable.</p>
<p>We collaborated and wrote the introduction together, and there are parts of it, it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t even remember what I wrote. And we do have our chapters that the three of us have been responsible for, and we have contributors to certain chapters as well, but we&#8217;re not sort of concerned with the more traditional approach to this type of book. We don&#8217;t even call it a textbook. We&#8217;re not really approaching it in that same traditional way, I guess, if you will.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So you&#8217;re teaching, you&#8217;re running your own design studio, you are working on a book, you&#8217;re doing this research and your research focuses on, as we&#8217;ve talked about throughout this interview, Black people being omitted from the graphic design history canon. Given all the different spaces that you occupy, designer, educator, et cetera, what does the path forward look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I think about that a lot. I think it&#8217;s going to continue in this realm of writing and publishing, and designing. I think I like the idea of being a content generator and being the one to design that content. So I see more books around the same topic, but in different iterations. So for instance, I&#8217;m completely obsessed with Louise E. Jefferson. She is a Black woman who was one of the first art directors in the publishing industry at Friendship Press. She started working in the mid, late 1930s, and she was a designer, a calligrapher, a cartographer, an illustrator, a researcher. I mean, she was a real true renaissance woman, and she rubbed shoulders with all kinds of people during the Harlem Renaissance. But I&#8217;ve been doing research on her for a really long time. And so, I envision writing and designing a book about Louise E. Jefferson. And right now, I&#8217;ve been in touch with Friendship Press where she worked at as an art director for 20 years, and they&#8217;re interested in me writing a book about Louise and her work.</p>
<p>So those type of projects I see still continuing. The past few years have been great. The writing, the lecturing have been amazing, meeting amazing people, and have been great with giving me more opportunities to write into research. But I would like to hopefully, have more of a balance between that and my making, especially maybe even more so personal projects. I really enjoy doing small collaborations with other designers, whether it be zines or just random, creating compositions and giving files, going back and forth between digital files and things like that. Well, not really knowing what the outcome is. I think I just miss making and playing, and having fun.</p>
<p>Not that the design work that I do isn&#8217;t enjoyable, but it&#8217;s just a different type of making, I guess it&#8217;s different. You&#8217;re doing research and you&#8217;re writing. That&#8217;s a lot different than like, &#8220;Okay, I have this idea for making this thing using these materials, or even this tool or this technology. Am I making?&#8221; I&#8217;m really interested in this sort of synthesis, and analog and digital tools and how they sort of come together, and how to expand our uses in ways that they weren&#8217;t actually meant to be used. So I would like moving forward to be able to engage more, and just being a maker and not thinking about what I&#8217;m making so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, being a designer and an educator and all these things, you&#8217;ve talked now about how you want your path to go forward, but in your current work, how do you balance these different aspects? Do these different roles inform each other in some way?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, I definitely see there are so much overlap in &#8230; For a long time, I actually didn&#8217;t know how to bring all these things together, especially in the classroom because it took a while before I started teaching design history, and actually I&#8217;m not teaching it right now. I haven&#8217;t taught it in maybe three years. But I think, that doesn&#8217;t mean that I can&#8217;t still bring that into the classroom. So to me, it doesn&#8217;t matter. I don&#8217;t care that I&#8217;m not teaching design history. Whatever I&#8217;m teaching, you&#8217;re going to learn something about Black design. Some kind of way I&#8217;m going to insert my agenda, because I know that these are things that are, in part, it&#8217;s not just Black design history. I talk about queer history. I talk about other areas of design where people are marginalized or we don&#8217;t know a lot about, and I know a little something. I still try to impart that to my students, so I make sure that I&#8217;m trying to be equitable in that sense.</p>
<p>But yeah, I&#8217;m just starting to see where these roads and where these things are starting to overlap. So am I making? Now I think about, well, how could, besides designing books about Black design history or whatever, and the publishing aspect, but I start thinking about, well, what are other things that you can make that sort of has to do with your research? So I&#8217;m starting to think more about that, like timelines and things like that. So to me, the crossover is starting to happen. It&#8217;s slow and maybe not as fast as I would have liked them to be. And then I see them in the projects that I give to my students too. So it sort of reverts back to the classroom in that way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, I like that it all feeds into each other then. That&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Kind of makes less work for me in a way, as opposed to try to compartmentalize everything. So for a long time, everything used to be in these separate buckets. Black design studio, freelance here is writing and lecture. But now, they&#8217;re just starting to morph together, and that has been good, and that&#8217;s how I would like things to continue in the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hey, look, work smarter, not harder. I get it.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to someone out here that&#8217;s hearing your story, that&#8217;s hearing about all these different things that you&#8217;re interested in, and they want to follow in your footsteps? What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I would say, learn how to be comfortable in your voice, in your skin, and how to &#8230; I didn&#8217;t always feel comfortable being Tasheka, being authentically me, because sometimes I had moments where I didn&#8217;t want to step on people&#8217;s toes, but I noticed moments where I did do that, and I was just kind of myself and just kind of put it out there. Those have been the best experiences.</p>
<p>And I would say that we all have control. You have some kind of control over your path, and so if there&#8217;s a certain direction that you want your practice, or your craft, or your skill or whatever it is you are into to take, that you can kind of plan for. Talk to people who are doing the thing that you want to do, align yourself. Reach out to them. I know sometimes, we think and we look at people that we admire and we put them on this pedestal, but if they&#8217;re the right people, they&#8217;ll talk to you and they&#8217;re not full of themselves. And lots of times, people are more than happy to talk to you about your path, and this is especially to younger designers. Don&#8217;t be afraid to reach out to people who you admire, and have conversations with them about what they do and how they got to where they are. But yeah, I just say be bold.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Be bold.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Be bold and intentional about how you move through this world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love that. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want the next chapter of your story to be?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I do see myself still teaching. I do see myself still being at UT, and I&#8217;m hoping, my hope is that in five years, I have a couple of books under my belt by then. Maybe, I&#8217;m just going to throw it out there, Maurice. I would say at least three of them, because I have a list of projects that I&#8217;m really like. It&#8217;s kind of like these have to be done before I die. No, maybe they don&#8217;t have to be done in five years. That&#8217;s pretty ambitious of me, but I&#8217;m already working on one, so I can get the other two at least in the works by that time, that would be great.</p>
<p>I do have sort of a passion project that I&#8217;ve been sitting on on for a while. I have a collection of drawings, maybe it&#8217;s like 200 and something drawings, that I would like in five years to have their own sort of brand, where it&#8217;s a collection of, whether it&#8217;s greeting cards or home decor or apparel. Not or. I should say and. So I&#8217;ve been procrastinated on this project for a really long time, and I hope in five years that that project sort of sees the light of day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I&#8217;m probably most active on Instagram and Facebook. So Facebook is Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton. On Instagram, it&#8217;s Blacvoice. I am on Twitter under Blacvoice, but I&#8217;m not that engaged with that platform as much. But, I&#8217;m on there and I tweet every now and then. I&#8217;m on LinkedIn, which is, you can find me under Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton. Again, that&#8217;s not a platform that I&#8217;m super engaged in, but I&#8217;m there, and you&#8217;ll probably find me multiple times under LinkedIn, but I&#8217;m there. But Instagram, I would say, it&#8217;s probably the place to see me. I&#8217;m more active there. I would hate to throw out my crappy Adobe Portfolio website. That&#8217;s just a bunch of stuff that&#8217;s thrown on there right now. But hey, why not? Blacvoicedesign.portfolio.com. That&#8217;s just something that&#8217;s there right now, just to have an online presence, until I have time to do something else with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. You and your work have been on my radar for many years, I think probably, maybe since 2015? For a while now. And it wasn&#8217;t until recently, I had spoken with Cheryl, had Cheryl on the show for 500th episode, and she sung your praises to the high heavens. And I was like, &#8220;I feel like I reached out to her before. Let me reach out again just to see if she might be interested.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Actually, you did, Maurice. I thought about that. I was actually just telling my sister right before, and I was like, I feel weird because you did reach out to me a long time ago, and I think at the time I was just not ready, and something that had nothing to do with you or the show. I love the show and listen to it, and I think that was just like, &#8220;I&#8217;m still in my boldness. I&#8217;m kind of shy too, and more of an introvert.&#8221; So I think that, yeah, it just took a while, but you did. You did, but I&#8217;m glad you reached back out again.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, but I mean, I also just want to say from hearing your story and hearing about everything that you&#8217;re working on, I think it&#8217;s evident that you have a passion for design. You have a passion for honestly getting the story right, whether it&#8217;s through writing, through education, through your visual design work. I&#8217;m really excited to see and hear more from you in the future. I feel like you&#8217;re one of our bright shining stars that are really going to help represent us, as we move forward in this crazy world that we&#8217;re in right now. I feel like the work that you&#8217;re doing is really going to stand out and help showcase what Black designers are doing everywhere, so thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>

<p>I had to connect with Morgan Bissant after seeing a few of her images of 90s sitcoms make the rounds on Twitter. Her work definitely captures to the richness of the Black experience, and she&#8217;s done everything from editorial work for Comcast to children&#8217;s illustrations and book covers. But that&#8217;s not all!</p>
<p>Morgan and I talked about some of her big freelance projects, and she spoke on how Black pop culture, especially animation, is a big source of inspiration and her creative process. We also discussed how she stays up on trends in the industry, how she handles burnout, and she gave us a look into her current art journey and creative process. Morgan&#8217;s experiences and raw talent are a unique combination, and I think we&#8217;ll definitely see more of her amazing work in the future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
My name is Morgan Bissant. I am a graphic designer and illustrator. I do a lot of branding work. I do a lot of layout design, I do web design, but something that I&#8217;ve always been more passionate about is illustration and I&#8217;ve been doing illustration work since I was old enough to hold a pencil. Currently, I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of illustration work for different companies and publishers. I&#8217;ve been working on children&#8217;s books, I&#8217;ve been doing promotional material. That&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve really enjoyed doing. I enjoy being able to actually use my craft, I guess, in bigger spaces.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. It sounds like it keeps you pretty busy.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yes, it&#8217;s a lot. It definitely takes up a lot of time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has this year been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
So far it&#8217;s been going pretty good. I&#8217;ve actually started a new full-time job probably a couple months back, I want to say. I started a new full-time job doing graphic design work and I work at a marketing agency called OrthoSynetics. It&#8217;s been nice being able to do a lot of different things. In my previous job, we designed a lot of baby products, and in this job we do a lot of different marketing products. So, we&#8217;ll do flyers, we&#8217;ll do social posts, we&#8217;ll do websites. I was able to work on a major branding project for a new doctor that we picked up for our agency, and that&#8217;s all been pretty exciting. It&#8217;s really different from what I&#8217;m used to doing. It&#8217;s a much faster pace than some of my earlier jobs and projects, but it&#8217;s been a lot of fun. I like being able to do a lot of different things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Keeps me interested.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Congratulations on the new job.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have any plans for the summer? Anything coming up?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Not necessarily. I&#8217;m just seeing what may be over the horizon maybe. So, I&#8217;ve currently been working on doing some freelance projects and I&#8217;m just always trying to keep myself open to seeing if I could get some other things, follow up with those. I&#8217;m always trying to see what other opportunities that I may have and other work that I can take on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I saw back in September last year that you had did some work for Comcast for their Black History Month series, which ran this year. Can you tell me a little bit about that?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah, sure. So, actually it ran last year. I ended up reposting it because I&#8217;m pretty proud of it, so I&#8217;m going to keep sharing it. So, this was something that we worked on last year. It was a partnership that they reached out to me for. I had initially gotten their attention because I had seen one of their ads on Twitter and it was something for the Olympic Games, and I saw there was this little black girl and she was looking at the screen in awe and seeing the black athletes doing all kind of stuff, and she was just so amazed and everything. And I just thought she was just so cute and I was like, &#8220;I just have to draw this little girl because she&#8217;s adorable.&#8221; And so I went ahead and illustrated how she looked in the ad and I figured out I would just post it and tag them, because why not?</p>
<p>And they ended up seeing it and they really liked what they saw. And so I want to say a couple months down the line, they reached out to me and they said, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re doing this campaign for Black History Month, and we really loved the artwork that you tagged us in on Twitter. So, we wanted you to do something actually in partnership with us this time in celebration of Black History Month.&#8221; And that was pretty exciting. So, they asked me to do a couple of different illustrations. The first two that they asked for, they wanted some illustrations of Erin Jackson and Elana Meyers Taylor for the Winter games.</p>
<p>They followed up and they said that they wanted to do something else, something I guess a little bit more Black History Month specific. They wanted to do the McDonogh Three. I know a lot of people aren&#8217;t exactly aware of who those are, and that is three little girls that desegregated McDonogh 19 in New Orleans in the 1960s. And that was something I was really excited about doing, because being from New Orleans, that was something a bit more personal for me. Them doing that, desegregating schools is what gave me the opportunities that I had growing up, and that was something that I really was excited to do.</p>
<p>So, I was over the moon about that part of it, and I went through everything to put the illustrations together and they wanted two separate illustrations, so they wanted to show, I guess, a parallel of the past and show them as little girls, and one in the present. So, just showing them how they are now and I guess illustrating how far they&#8217;ve come over the years and what their sacrifices meant to people, and also to show that these women are still alive today. And a lot of people always think that, &#8220;Well that happened so long ago, and everybody that was involved in that is probably gone and all of that is over,&#8221; but they&#8217;re still here. They&#8217;re still here to tell the stories, and they&#8217;re still here to push a lot of the, I guess I want to say, push a lot of what was hidden, a lot of the things that were lost historically because a lot of people know about Ruby Bridges, but a lot of people also don&#8217;t know about them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean there&#8217;s a lot of layers to that, that I think is really cool. One that Comcast saw an illustration that you did and they were like, &#8220;Oh, this is great. Can you do some work for us?&#8221; I feel like you hear those sorts of things sometimes is being discovered out of nowhere things, but I think that&#8217;s really cool that they just picked up on some work that you put online and they really wanted to keep working with it. I think that was great, but also the levels of being able to do something that&#8217;s tied to history, especially civil rights history in this country as people from this podcast.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m from Selma, Alabama, so I grew up in that cradle of the civil rights movement, and there are so many stories about things that have happened that we knew about, the bigger things we knew about the March to Montgomery, as you mentioned, we know about Ruby Bridges, but we don&#8217;t know about some of these lesser known stories and struggles and triumphs that have happened.</p>
<p>And so I think it&#8217;s great that you were able to create some work that shone a light on that and to let people know that while this is &#8220;history,&#8221; it&#8217;s also the present. Like you said, these women are still alive, so the fact that they are still here and that they fought for these rights is something that we should all be aware of.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yes, it&#8217;s always good to make sure you&#8217;re informed. And it&#8217;s always good to be able to put more things out there and shine light on things that we don&#8217;t know about, because there&#8217;s just so much stuff that we didn&#8217;t learn in school and just so many things in general that just get overlooked in favor of just those little three big figures like Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King. I mean nothing&#8217;s wrong with learning about them obviously.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s sad that that&#8217;s all most people really know about and they barely know about them either.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I think it&#8217;s also telling that, in the past, media was really the thing that brought the whole civil rights movement to the nation. I mean because a lot of these things were happening in small southern towns, et cetera, and it wasn&#8217;t, I think until the incidents of, I think it was Bloody Sunday that happened in Selma. It wasn&#8217;t until those incidents where there were actually cameras and then that footage got broadcast across the nation that people saw about it. So, in a way, you can see how there&#8217;s a lot of stories and things that happen that we just don&#8217;t know about. Parts of history that get covered up.</p>
<p>I think people are just starting to really know about, for example, Bayard Rustin or Claudette Colvin, and people have mentioned Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, but not these other people that were behind the scenes maybe, or that did the work that they did before they did. So, a lot of those stories, it&#8217;s interesting, are now also being uncovered through media. I think within the past, I&#8217;d say at least in the past 10 years, I&#8217;ve seen so many black creators unearth a lot of these stories through animation, through illustration, et cetera. I think it&#8217;s really great. It&#8217;s really great.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s always something exciting to see.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s talk more about your work as a freelance illustrator. You mentioned that you&#8217;re also working full-time at this agency OrthoSynetics. What does a regular day look like for you right now?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
With working full-time, that gets a lot of my time. Basically what we do is we have a certain amount of projects that we have to get done throughout the day, and it&#8217;s generally a nine to five situation, and so we&#8217;ll have certain things that we&#8217;ll work on. We might have banners that we might have to do, we might have billboards, but it basically varies from day-to-day what we might have to work on. The things that we do are mainly for orthodontists and dentist, and that&#8217;s just a lot of what we see.</p>
<p>We might have flyers advertising different prices for dental work or different offers or things along those lines. So, that&#8217;s basically what we have our eyes on throughout the day. Now, as far as doing any freelance work, I have to put that, I guess, on the tail end of my day or reserve that for the weekends because we&#8217;re generally just so busy with doing graphic design work at the agency that sometimes it can be a little tough to juggle. But generally speaking, when I do get freelance projects, I&#8217;m given a sufficient amount of time to complete them. So, it&#8217;s not like I have to do everything at work and then come rush home and then just rush and get a book cover done in five minutes.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ll have months and months to work on things and get things done, and I&#8217;ll do that in my free time that I have. Sometimes I&#8217;ll work on things while I&#8217;m listening to music or while I&#8217;m watching a TV show that I enjoy to motivate me or I guess help me to get into a groove. It just helps to do it when I have, I guess, some breathing room to do so, which again, with the deadlines, it does help to give me some breathing room to actually get a lot of these projects done, and I try not to take on too much at a time so that I won&#8217;t be overbooked.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean that&#8217;s a good thing. I know that you&#8217;re represented by an agency, which we&#8217;ll talk about a little bit later. I imagine your agent knows that too. So, when you&#8217;re getting booked for things, you can&#8217;t do something last minute, there has to be some buffer time around it for you to be able to get it done.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah. They have different industry standards on what is appropriate for different projects. Now sometimes people will come and be like, &#8220;Hey, we need you to get this done in two days,&#8221; which I mean, it&#8217;s really ultimately up to you on whether or not you want to take it with not enough time to get it done. But generally speaking, for larger projects especially, you definitely need a sufficient amount of time to finish things. And especially in a creative space, you don&#8217;t want to be pushed to the limit and be getting yourself burnt out when you&#8217;re trying to come up with ideas that look good and are executed well. I always try to do things that are within my means. Now, if it&#8217;s something like maybe smaller and it might be a little bit of rush, I just feel like I have time and I feel like I might be able to do it, I might grab it. But usually if it&#8217;s a little too tight, I might ask for more time or I might have just have to pass on that one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Now, I&#8217;m looking through your website now. I see of course you&#8217;ve done illustration work, but there&#8217;s logo design work here. You&#8217;ve done book illustrations, character designs, all of it is really great, and I mentioned this to you right before we started recording that I saw your work on Twitter because you had done this character lineup of the main cast from Living Single. And I mean the style of it was so good. I was like, &#8220;I have to reach out to her to see if she can come on the podcast.&#8221; Are you influenced a lot by TV and pop culture in your work?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I am. That actually is what pushed me to start drawing, and that&#8217;s really what made me want to do it more seriously. Pop culture is a huge part of it, especially things that are immersed in black culture. Obviously me being black, that&#8217;s my own culture and it&#8217;s something that I can pull inspiration from my personal experiences. Things like anime and cartoons, they&#8217;ve always fueled my desire for illustration. I&#8217;ve always been influenced by things like Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball Z and things like that. Growing up, I was very small and watching a lot of these programs, and that&#8217;s what made me want to draw. I started copying things that I saw while I was watching TV. I would be watching Sailor Moon in the mornings and I&#8217;d said, &#8220;Well, I want to draw Sailor Moon.&#8221; And so I would be working until I got her to what I felt was right and was an accurate depiction of what she looked like on the screen.</p>
<p>And as I got older and I started cultivating my talents and working on my skills, started trying to branch off and do other things. And I&#8217;ve always tried to start creating my own concepts and characters, and nowadays I am still heavily influenced by anime and animation in general, but a lot of other things that I was exposed to like different black sitcoms and cartoons, that also had an impact on my overall style. Bruce W. Smith has always been one of my huge inspirations for illustration work. I&#8217;ve always liked his style since The Proud Family and B√©b√©&#8217;s Kids, Happily Ever After, Fairy Tales for Every Child.</p>
<p>That always was a draw to me. And I&#8217;ve mimicked some of my style and my character designs around some of the things that he&#8217;s done, and I mean he isn&#8217;t one of the only influences that I have, but that&#8217;s always something that I&#8217;ve seen growing up, and I&#8217;ve always liked his style and I&#8217;ve always wanted to, I guess, put a little bit of that into my style. And so nowadays I have this, I guess, combination of all of these different influences that have created what I have today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, talk to me about how you approach a new project. What does your creative process look like when a new project comes across your table?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
So, for basically any new project that I have, whether it just be freelance or something personal, I always try to brainstorm first. I might write down ideas or just sketch things down, and I just try to just do things and just get my brain going. I don&#8217;t always have something in mind before I start sketching, so I have this approach where I&#8217;ll just start doing anything. Well, not anything, but I&#8217;ll start trying to draw different things and just see where it takes me and then try to give myself a couple of different options and variations in what I might want to do with it, and then just see where it goes from there. This is especially true for larger projects, because I definitely have to see where I&#8217;m going before I start tackling something so huge.</p>
<p>So, I always have to sketch things out first. I always have to get ideas down first, and if I have any troubles or bumps in the road, I might go online. I have my Pinterest, I have all these bookmarks and stuff on Instagram. I have all these bookmarks on Twitter of different photographs or screenshots or fashion or just whatever, and I might use that as a way to, I guess, give myself a little bit of inspiration so I can push myself in the right direction. Because sometimes I can&#8217;t always come up with things just immediately from the top of my head.</p>
<p>So, it helps for me to look at some things. It helps for me to continuously draw things until I can get some ideas to come out that I like. I always try to keep things in my back pocket that I can always pull up later in terms of references and images that I might have saved that I think that I could probably use going forward for my creative process.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Was there ever a really particularly hard design or illustration that you had to create for a project?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I think that probably one of the hardest things that I have worked on in recent years would be probably the illustration that I did for the Crescent City Sneaker Ball. It was both illustration and it was a graphic designed invitation, and I&#8217;m really happy with how it came out, but there was a lot of thought that had to go into it, and there was a lot that I had to consider like, &#8220;Okay, how is this going to work? How can I fit this in here?&#8221; Because it was a little bit different from what I usually do. Everything was a collage and I had to make sure all the pieces fit together and flowed together and had to make sure things didn&#8217;t look too cluttered or too structured. So, it took a lot of working around with that one and playing around with it to make it work.</p>
<p>But I think ultimately all things considered, it came out pretty cute. It was a lot to think about. It was a lot to figure out how everything should go and everything should work together. I&#8217;m also really not too fantastic with buildings, or at least I personally don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m all that great with them. And that had a lot of structures in it. I like drawing people more. That&#8217;s always been my thing. I&#8217;ve always liked drawing characters, so structures and boats and street cars and stuff, I&#8217;ve never really done a lot of that. And that added to the challenge. So, executing that, it was a lot for me, but ultimately I&#8217;m glad I took that on. I thought it came out pretty nice, all things considered.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have any upcoming projects that you can talk about? Anything you&#8217;re excited about?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if this would be considered upcoming, but the book that I have recently illustrated for Lamar Giles that is going to be coming out next month, and I&#8217;m actually pretty excited about that one. So, I mean, I don&#8217;t know if I would call that an upcoming project because I&#8217;ve already finished it, but we haven&#8217;t gotten the printed books yet. And so I&#8217;m honestly very excited to see how it will come out on paper, because I&#8217;ve seen what it looks like on my computer, but I want to see it in book form. It&#8217;s just an entirely new feeling you get when you actually see your work just tangible and you can hold it in your hand and on a professional level, because you can print out your own stuff at Office Depot or something, but it&#8217;s not the same as this is a book that&#8217;s going to be in Barnes &#038; Noble.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost so weird because I never thought that I would ever get to this point in my life where I would actually be seeing my name on the cover of children&#8217;s books or seeing the book actually in store somewhere. So, that&#8217;s pretty cool and I&#8217;m excited to actually get some copies of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I mean I think it&#8217;s always an accomplishment when something you do makes it on a book or a magazine or something like that, because it&#8217;s so finite. Things that are on the web can get redesigned or deleted or moved or stuff like that. But a book or a magazine or something like that, that&#8217;s permanent.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
It&#8217;s exciting. Like he said, it&#8217;s not the same. I mean you can post all your stuff on Instagram and I mean nothing&#8217;s wrong with that or anything. It&#8217;s great to have your stuff out there, but it&#8217;s totally different to go outside and see your work there at the store and other people actually see it. And people that might not even have Instagram or Twitter, they can see your work, and people that are working in these industries, they can actually see your work. And that&#8217;s almost like an out of body experience sometimes thinking about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s a really big deal. It&#8217;s a big deal. I think it&#8217;s a big deal. I want to get more into your work and your career, but before that, I want to learn more just about you. As you mentioned earlier, you&#8217;re a New Orleans native. Tell me about growing up in New Orleans. Did you do a lot of creative stuff as a kid?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I did. I don&#8217;t know if that necessarily had to do a lot with me living in New Orleans, I did have a lot of opportunities to be creative growing up. We did have a lot of stuff at our schools where we could paint murals and things on the walls. I had this one art teacher in elementary school, Mr. Baldwin, and he had all of the art students paint this, I guess, prehistoric scene of all the dinosaurs on the cafeteria wall, and I thought that was so much fun. I wish I could do more things like that. I just always liked collaborative types of projects and things that were always, I guess, larger than life, at least to me. Because like I was saying before with the book, it&#8217;s different when everybody can see it like that. And I think as a child, that really pushed the importance of artwork to me because it didn&#8217;t just trivialize it as this little hobby that kindergartners do when they draw with crayon on paper and things like that.</p>
<p>It actually took our craft seriously and it encouraged us to pursue what we were doing. It gave a credence to art, and I think that that&#8217;s always important for little kids that enjoy that stuff. I think that it&#8217;s always important to encourage what they&#8217;re doing because that&#8217;s something that needs to be fostered, that&#8217;s something that needs to be developed. And if it&#8217;s something that they really enjoy and that they want to go forward with it, I don&#8217;t see why you shouldn&#8217;t encourage it and give them opportunities to push them and put their work out there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Was your family really supportive of you going in that route?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah, they always have been. So, like I was saying before, I&#8217;ve been drawing since I was able to pick up a pencil. I don&#8217;t remember this, but this is what my mom told me, so this is what I have to go off of. So, I have just always been drawing things and I guess the things that I was drawing were a little bit more developed than what the average toddler would do, and I guess I was showing that I was able to pick up different forms more than somebody that would have that natural inclination. As I got older, my drawings started getting a little bit more developed, and as I was watching cartoons, I was drawing the cartoons that I saw on TV, and they weren&#8217;t exactly stick figures. I always tried to get them as close as I possibly can with the skills that I had at three years old.</p>
<p>And as I got older, my parents, they noticed what I had and they put me in different programs. They tried to get me in talented art classes at school, and they always wanted to give me a chance to grow as an artist, and they always encouraged what I did. They always saw what I had, they saw the talent that I had, and they always wanted to encourage me to continue doing it and to pursue it. And eventually I ended up pursuing that as a full-time thing. Now, graphic design is different from a illustration, but it&#8217;s still a form of art, and that&#8217;s something that they never stopped me from doing it. They were like, &#8220;No, don&#8217;t do this. Be a lawyer.&#8221; They wanted me to do what I enjoyed doing, and I&#8217;m really grateful for that, that I always had a supportive family that always pushed me to do what would make me happy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I mean, graphic design is a gateway into I think a lot of different just visual designs. I mean back in the day I think it was all just called communication design, and then it splintered off into advertising. And then I think especially with the advent of the personal computer and Photoshop and stuff like that, it became desktop publishing and then it was graphic design. So, it&#8217;s a gateway into a lot of different things. I mean, as you mentioned, you really wanted to do it enough to the point where you ended up studying it. You went to Louisiana State University, majored in graphic design there. How was your time there at the school?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I really liked the time that I had, because they gave us a lot of time to explore a lot of different things. So, with the curriculum that we had, which it was basically called fine arts, the entire degree itself, they gave us opportunities to do a lot of different mediums of art. Your primary major would be graphic design, and that was what was ultimately the focus. But we had classes where we could illustrate, where we could paint. If we wanted to, we could explore photography, we could explore welding and print making.</p>
<p>So, they gave us a lot of different mediums and avenues that we can dip our feet in and see how we liked it, or we could even use those things to apply them to graphic design in a way. So, myself, I&#8217;ve always been interested in illustration. I always wanted to put illustration in my graphic design work, and so when we took a lot of illustration classes there, it also helped me to develop my style and pay attention to a lot of things that maybe I might have been overlooking.</p>
<p>So, it helped me to improve my craft overall when I took illustration classes. And I could always bring that back into graphic design where I could maybe draw characters and now my characters look more refined, or I could draw different symbols, and now everything looks a little better, it looks sharper and it looks more professional. And that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve always liked. So, I don&#8217;t know exactly how every other school tackles this degree, but I really did like that about it, because it gave us a lot of different options to go in. You weren&#8217;t exactly forced to do all of them. So, I was never really huge on photography. So, I didn&#8217;t do photography, but I had another option.</p>
<p>If instead I wanted to do painting, or I wanted to do sculpture making, I could do one of those. And that&#8217;s something that I really appreciated. It gave us a lot of different things that we could go into, and I felt like that helped me in the long run because while it gave me a graphic design degree, which helped me getting a full-time job, it also helped me in terms of art in general, because all of those illustration classes, they helped me in terms of anatomy and in terms of composition and things like that, that you can use that in graphic design, but ultimately you could use that in illustration too, because that&#8217;s a lot of what I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean it sounds like the program was really expansive to allow you to just try out a lot of different things and see what you liked the best.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah, they gave us a lot to work with, and that was just a lot of, I don&#8217;t know if you would call them collectives, but they weren&#8217;t exactly our core classes. They were just things that you can pick to add on to what you were doing. And even within graphic design, we still had a lot of things that they gave us that we could explore, like typography and making different graphic symbols and things like that. So, we always had a huge variety, which that was great, honestly, for all of us. Because a lot of people, they branched off and did other things and they found that taking this drawing class, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, now I want to do books.&#8221; Or &#8220;I took this photography class and now I want to do photography and I want to do events.&#8221; And that was always something that I felt was influenced by the fact that we had all of these options.</p>
<p>And I always thought it was really great, and it made the curriculum a lot more fun. I always liked drawing. I always had fun drawing. So, being able to take all these drawing classes, it was nice. And then it gave me a little bit more of an outlet, because graphic design isn&#8217;t always about drawing. Sometimes it&#8217;s about laying out things, and sometimes it can get a little bit monotonous, especially if it&#8217;s all for school projects and things. But if you have time to go on the side and go draw a polar bear or a bowl of fruit, and that&#8217;s something that you enjoy doing, it can make your time in school more enjoyable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So, when you graduated, did you have an idea lined up about what you wanted to do next?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I honestly was not exactly sure, but at the same time, I actually already had an opportunity lined up for me before I even graduated.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
So, a couple of months before I graduated, me and a few other students had gotten recruited by a local business called Impression Works, where we did photo books and greeting cards and things like that, and we could basically do whatever we felt like worked. So, it didn&#8217;t always have to be layout stuff. If we wanted to put illustrations in them, we could, and it gave us a little bit of creative freedom. And that was nice to be able to have during school, because it was a bit of a safety net in terms of having a job when I graduated. But then on top of that, I had a little bit of income coming in while I was in school, and it was flexible because we could do most of our work from home.</p>
<p>So, I was able to just work on projects for work in my free time, and we were still interns/part-time, so we weren&#8217;t totally overloaded with things where we couldn&#8217;t balance homework and senior projects and work work. And that ended up working out for a little while. And then it was a contract job, so once the contract was up after that, I had to try to turn around and try to find something else as soon as I could. And I wasn&#8217;t exactly sure how that was going to work out, because with me being pretty illustration oriented, I wasn&#8217;t sure how I would&#8217;ve liked something that didn&#8217;t really allow me to do that. And I know that a lot of graphic design jobs don&#8217;t really have a heavy focus on that. And so I was always wondering, &#8220;Well, will I be able to fit into another job somewhere or at a real firm?&#8221;</p>
<p>Because I really didn&#8217;t do a whole lot of layout at the time, and I didn&#8217;t have a whole lot of that in my portfolio outside of a couple of school projects. So, I was wondering how that was going to work out. And I ended up landing another full-time job at a company called Sassy Baby. That was a place where we got to design a lot of baby products. So, we would draw the little characters that were on bibs and bath products, and there were a couple little toys and stuff, we designed teethers and things like that. And that actually worked out in terms of capturing the, I guess, the niche that I am in, because being a graphic designer and an illustrator isn&#8217;t always&#8230; it is I guess. A lot of people who are graphic designers, they&#8217;re not illustrators, and a lot of illustrators are not graphic designers.</p>
<p>So, I guess I felt like I was different in that sense. But that job that I found, it ended up working out pretty well because I got to draw cute little characters. And we also had to do a lot of graphic design, we had to do a lot of layout things, we had to do a lot of presentation materials. So, graphic design of course helped me in those aspects. But being an illustrator helped me in terms of being able to capture different likenesses of little bears and bunnies and things like that. That was a pretty nice job, because we got a lot of tangible products out of it. You&#8217;d go in Walmart and you&#8217;d see the bibs that you designed. You&#8217;d see the little patterns of characters and things that you did, and you could go to Target or Meijer or wherever, and you could see the work that you&#8217;ve done, and you&#8217;d see it on full display for people to buy. And that was always cool. And it was always rewarding in a sense, to see your work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m so glad that you said that about a graphic designer&#8217;s not an illustrator. Illustrator&#8217;s not a graphic designer, because I feel like sometimes, and this is really from the company standpoint, they just think it&#8217;s all the same. They think as long as you can do something in design, that you can do everything in design. So, I&#8217;m glad you qualified that by saying that.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve seen a lot of mix ups with that. I will see a lot of illustrators that I follow get all of these requests for, &#8220;Hey, can you do logos?&#8221; And I&#8217;m just like that&#8217;s not the same thing. Just because they can draw Goku does not mean they can give you a professional looking logo for your law firm. This is two totally different forms of art. It&#8217;s an important distinction.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, it&#8217;s an important distinction. And I think it&#8217;s good to stick by that, because I think early in your career you want to be able to do any work that comes your way because you want to be able to prove yourself as a creative. So, even if you are, say for example, really good at illustration and someone says, &#8220;Well, can you do a logo?&#8221; You&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;Well, I mean it&#8217;s a drawing. I can do that.&#8221; But I think it&#8217;s good that you&#8217;re sticking by saying, &#8220;No, I only do illustration. This is what I do. I can&#8217;t do this other thing that you&#8217;re asking for.&#8221;</p>
<p>I mean you probably could technically do it because the skills are transferrable, but I think it&#8217;s good to stick by that because what it does is it strengthens your particular craft in that area. So, people eventually don&#8217;t get it confused. But I feel like that&#8217;s pretty common early on though. You try to do a little bit of everything, one, to see what you can do, and two, because the work just comes your way.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah. And I get that, especially if you&#8217;re just starting out and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any projects and this guy is asking me for a logo, so I&#8217;m just going to take it because I need the money.&#8221; But if that&#8217;s not what you do, you don&#8217;t want to end up getting saddled with that your whole life, trying to struggle to do something that you know you don&#8217;t enjoy doing and you don&#8217;t exactly, I guess, have the equipment for. Because you can definitely do a logo that&#8217;s a drawing. But I mean if this super corporate firm is asking you for a super corporate logo and you draw just characters or buildings and things like that, it&#8217;s not always going to transfer well.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t exactly have, I guess, that same know-how or that same eye to capture what they might want. So, I like to make sure people know that there&#8217;s a difference, because every illustrator that you try to ask for a work from is not going to be equipped to give you what you need, because illustration and graphic design aren&#8217;t the same thing. And I feel like a lot of people just think, &#8220;Oh, art is art,&#8221; but that&#8217;s just not how it is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Now you&#8217;re represented by Inkyverse, which is a agency. They rep a lot of animators, artists, authors. How did you go about getting representation? Did they come to you? Did you seek them out? How did that work?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
They actually came to me. I believe they found me on Instagram, I want to say. So, it was, I think not too long after I had posted this graphic that I did. It was the Salt Girl, the Salt of the Earth thing that I did. And that went viral, and I think that&#8217;s what got me noticed by the agency. They reached out to me, they actually sent me a text because I had my number on my resume and they were like, &#8220;Hey, this is Inkyverse and we are looking to see if you would be interested in commercial art representation.&#8221; And then I followed up with, &#8220;This is not a scam, this is real?&#8221; Like okay.</p>
<p>I was like, &#8220;Well, thank God for clarifying.&#8221; I sure was about to just block the number. They said that they would keep in touch with me, and we ended up having a conversation over the phone. The agent that I was speaking to, Katrina, she was going over everything that having an agent entailed and how having an agent can help you find high profile clients and they can help you to establish rates for yourself and they can basically just manage you. And I was like, &#8220;That sounds pretty good to me. So, I mean I don&#8217;t see why I would say no personally.&#8221; I mean I never was really good with managing everything that I had. I was always really bad with trying to figure out rates that I wanted to charge for myself. So, I mean I was like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll go for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I mean the worst that could happen is that I might not like it and I can just say I don&#8217;t want to do it anymore. So far it&#8217;s really been a blessing to have an agent and work with Inkyverse, because having a lot of these major companies reach out to me, not having an agent would have been terrifying because I would not know what to say. I would not know what money to ask for. I wouldn&#8217;t know how to fight back against that, because especially if you&#8217;re pretty green, it&#8217;s like you don&#8217;t want to say the wrong thing and be like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, I just ruined this entire opportunity because I have asked them for the wrong amount or I said the wrong thing, or whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, it really helped to have somebody, I guess, go back and forth on my behalf that actually knows the industry and actually knows the standards and actually knows what to ask for, what is fair. That&#8217;s been a huge help in getting me fair rates for projects, for getting the amount of time that I would get for things. I mean it&#8217;s been good to have somebody to look over contracts and things and make sure nothing weird is in them before I sign them. And that&#8217;s something that I really like having and I would definitely recommend other artists do so if it is at all possible to have somebody to, I guess, be your help where you need it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean I&#8217;ve had other illustrators on the show before that are also represented by agents and they&#8217;ve talked about how it just helps them to focus on the work. They don&#8217;t have to handle all the administrative emails and contracts and all this stuff. They can just focus on doing the work when it comes in, and it&#8217;s just such a big benefit for them. And it&#8217;s really cool that they reached out to you, they saw your work and wanted you to be a part of what they&#8217;re building.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah, and I was honestly really blown away by that. I was, &#8220;Really? Me? How did you even get here?&#8221; It was really exciting. I was like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you would want me to do this.&#8221; And then even more so with the random text, I was like, &#8220;Are we sure this isn&#8217;t a scam and you&#8217;re not going to ask me for my credit card number next? I feel like this is too good to be true.&#8221; But it was really nice to be able to have somebody who works in that industry say, &#8220;Hey, we think your work is so good and that it can make a whole bunch of money, so we want you here.&#8221; Not to say that my representative is just like, &#8220;Hey, we just want you for the money,&#8221; because I didn&#8217;t want it to sound like that, but it&#8217;s nice to know that your artwork is appreciated in a professional sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. How do you stay up to date with the latest design and illustration trends? Like you mentioned pop culture being a big part of your work, pop culture and television. How do you stay up to date with trends in the industry?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I personally would say that I try to do somewhat of a research. I don&#8217;t know if I could 100% call it research. Well, I guess I could, yeah. I try to research some things when I have time to do so. At my previous job for graphic design, we always used different magazines and publications and even Pinterest to stay up to date with what was trending and what was up-to-date and designs that we can pull from that won&#8217;t look dated. And I do use that to a certain degree when it comes to illustration work, but I also do like to look into a lot of fashion.</p>
<p>I follow a lot of fashion bloggers and I&#8217;m always looking at things on TikTok and stuff like that, because that&#8217;s always been an influence on my style as well. I like drawing illustrations that incorporate a lot of fashion. I like looking at different, I guess, design when it comes to fashion on TV or in movies or things like that. I try to pay attention to those things and pay attention to, I guess, what is out now and what I could probably see in the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is one of the newer trends right now?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
You mean in terms of fashion?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I mean like, yeah, I guess in general, as you look at it as to how you might apply it to your work, do you see any trends that you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, I might want to try that out?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Honestly, I&#8217;ve been looking at a whole lot of fashion.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I mean fashion could be that inspiration, it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Sometimes I look at a lot of just things that I see just online, and it doesn&#8217;t have to be anything in particular, but if I feel like something is particularly striking, I might pull some inspiration from it, from what I see on there. I guess as of right now, I&#8217;ve been liking a lot of, I want to say suits and things in that general area. That&#8217;s always been something that&#8217;s been drawing my attention. I don&#8217;t know if that is exactly the trendiest thing overall now in terms of I guess business and things like that. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people doing those kinds of things on TikTok and whatever. That&#8217;s always something that I wanted to incorporate in some of my illustrations as well. Now, in terms of now, I wouldn&#8217;t say a pulling a whole lot of things from now in particular, or some things that are trendy now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you say that your style as an illustrator and a designer has evolved over the years?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I have definitely gained a better understanding of composition, and I want to say anatomy and layout. Basically everything that I worked on, I feel like it has elevated. I feel like I&#8217;ve really grown to have a better understanding of what works and how things should look, how I can utilize the different spaces of things and create, I guess, a better and more fluent composition. I also feel that I&#8217;ve grown in the sense where I&#8217;ve been able to refine how my characters look. I went really back and forth with a lot of different styles and trying to figure out what worked and trying to figure out how I should paint things and should I do things that are really stylistic? Should I do things that are realistic? It&#8217;s always been experimental and trying to figure out how I want things to look overall and what I felt worked for me.</p>
<p>And I think I&#8217;ve found, I guess, a good middle ground of how I want my illustrations and how I want my designs to look. But I think just having more of a knowledge of shapes and color and growing in those areas has really helped my design and illustration work to flourish. And I have also accepted the fact that everything is not always going to look the same. So, I know a lot of artists have a particular style. I know a lot of people, including myself, have always felt like you should just have one style and that should be it, and you shouldn&#8217;t really do anything else. As I&#8217;ve grown, I&#8217;ve learned that you could just do whatever you want. I mean if I want to do something realistic one day, I can do that. If I want to do something stylized another day, I can do that.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that I don&#8217;t have a style, and it doesn&#8217;t mean that I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing. It just happens. You might want to experiment, you might just want to do something different. I mean I think that that really just shows that you just have a lot to offer as an artist. I mean it just shows that you have the skill to be able to go back and forth and do a variety of things. And I don&#8217;t think anything&#8217;s wrong with that, which unfortunately a lot of people still feel that way. But I think that I would always encourage artists to just do what you enjoy doing. If you want to do a lot of different things, I say go for it, as long as you&#8217;re not burning yourself out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I guess speaking of that, how do you handle those periods when you might be burnt out or you might just have low motivation? How do you handle that?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
So, overall I try to just take breaks in between my work. I try not to rush things, and I always am pretty careful about not overbooking myself, especially keeping in mind that I do have a full-time job and I&#8217;m trying to juggle freelance and whatever else I have. I always want to make sure I&#8217;m trying to gauge my time properly and see what I actually have room to do, because I don&#8217;t want to get to that point where I&#8217;m just like I&#8217;m completely just worn out and I just can&#8217;t do anything. I think that it&#8217;s very important to take breaks when you can. I always try to set aside some time or a day or whatever to just do nothing or just have fun or maybe watch a movie or play a game or just something, something not work related. But there have been times where I just didn&#8217;t have a choice.</p>
<p>I just had to power through something. And I felt like what just motivated me to get it done is just to try to have as much fun with it as possible. There&#8217;s been projects that I&#8217;ve worked on and I just try to, I guess, put a little bit of myself into it and just use that as a way to express myself, which wasn&#8217;t exactly discouraged in the project. And that helped me to, I guess, think of the project that I had to work on or something that was just more fun, something that I could enjoy. Not thinking about it as, &#8220;I have to get this done right now because the deadline is tomorrow, and if I don&#8217;t, then the whole project is ruined.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought about it as this is something that I&#8217;m enjoying doing and I just want to do it. And in times where I am just getting a bit pushed, that&#8217;s what I try to think about. I try to think about it as something enjoyable. I try to just take my time with it as much as I can and have fun with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you hope people take away from your work when they look at it?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I would hope that they could see the beauty in a lot of these different characters. I like to do a lot of black girls and black women, and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen, because you have seen my portfolio, but little black kids. I like to draw a lot of that stuff. And growing up, I had issues where I want to say I had lower self-esteem than I should have had. I never really felt like I was cute. I didn&#8217;t think that I was pretty, because I would see a lot of the cartoons, like the heroes and the love interests on a lot of cartoons, and they wouldn&#8217;t look like me. And that is what made me want to put a lot of black features and characters into my artwork, because while we did see a lot of that growing up, I felt like we didn&#8217;t exactly see as much as we probably should have gotten.</p>
<p>Black characters were always like the sidekicks sometimes, and they didn&#8217;t always get time to shine. And that&#8217;s something that always impacted me growing up. And so I like to put that into my work. I like to show people, like anyone that we are beautiful and nothing is wrong with our features. Our features are beautiful. They make us unique, they make us who we are. And I think that that&#8217;s something that I wanted to put in my work, because I want everybody to be able to embrace that. So, I always hope that little kids and adults alike can take that away from what I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to someone, they&#8217;re out here listening to your story, they&#8217;re hearing about your work and everything. What advice would you give them if they want to follow in your footsteps?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
The advice that I would give to anybody that might want to pursue a career in art or graphic design, I would say that don&#8217;t be afraid to do what you know you want to do. Have fun doing it. I would say that if this is something that you really enjoy and you really see yourself doing this in the future, and you know you really want to go into these different arenas where you can use your art for animation or books. So, I mean I would encourage anybody that wants to pursue art to just go for it. I don&#8217;t think that you should let anything scare you from doing it. If it&#8217;s something that you enjoy doing I say, why not do it?</p>
<p>I mean it&#8217;s something that it&#8217;s always been fun to me. I could never really see myself doing anything else. And so I felt like this is what I had to pursue, this is what I was going to do. And I know that there&#8217;s other people that feel that way and I feel that they should go forward with it, because I mean why keep yourself from doing something that you enjoy doing and that you can make a living off of it. And I know a lot of people feel that it&#8217;s harder to actually make a living off your work than doing other things, but I believe that we have so many examples out that shows that that&#8217;s actually a possibility. You can work in animation, you can do books, you can even do things like ads and partnerships with brands.</p>
<p>You can do flyers, you can design things for brands, branding or whatever. There&#8217;s so many options that you can explore, things that you can put your talents toward. There&#8217;s so many options that you can look into that you can use your skills to make it tangible and make it real. So, I would say that you shouldn&#8217;t limit yourself and you shouldn&#8217;t hold yourself back if you&#8217;re afraid that you might not be able to get different opportunities, or you are afraid that you might not be able to get into this certain arena so there&#8217;s nothing you can do, because there&#8217;s a lot of things that we, as artists, we don&#8217;t really think about how many opportunities that they really have out there.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a lot. It&#8217;s just the possibilities are endless. And on top of that, I would encourage people to always have fun with what they&#8217;re doing. Never be afraid to experiment and do different things. Just have fun. Just enjoy it. Take time to perfect your craft. Take time to practice. You always want to take time to pour into it, because if this is something that you&#8217;ll enjoy doing and you want to put yourself out there and you want to continue to grow, I mean you always want to keep doing it. You always want to keep those, I guess, creative gears turning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I&#8217;m honestly not 100% sure. I honestly never thought I would even see myself where I&#8217;m at now five years ago. It&#8217;s different for me. If there is something in particular that I could be doing down the line, I&#8217;ve always been interested in animation of course, because it&#8217;s always been a huge inspiration for me. And I&#8217;ve always wanted to work maybe in an animated series, maybe like creating some characters or concept work or visual development or something along those lines. So, here&#8217;s hoping that maybe at some point in my career the door may open for that. I&#8217;m just here to see where life takes me as of right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
So, I am on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok at morg_city. Also on Facebook at Morgan Bissant, all one word. I have a website, morganbissant.com, and you can basically see most of my portfolio on there, and you can find links to my social pages at the bottom.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Morgan Bissant, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you really for talking about I mean, one, your journey as an artist, as an illustrator, as a designer, and how it&#8217;s brought you to where you are now. But I really think it&#8217;s good that you talked about your process, you shared your inspirations, you shared your experiences. My hope is that when people listen back through this interview, and especially once they get a chance to really look at your work, they&#8217;ll be able to get a good overall view of who you are as an artist and the work that you&#8217;re bringing into the world. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Well, thank you so much for having me. This is definitely a pleasure speaking with you.</p>

<p>It takes a lot of hard work, dedication, and sacrifice to make it on your own as an artist, and Akeem Roberts knows this well. This illustrator and animator juggles being an associate director at Holler Studios with freelancing for <em>The New Yorker</em>. Even though Akeem&#8217;s been in the game for nearly a decade, I have a feeling that we&#8217;ll be seeing his work for many years to come.</p>
<p>We talked about Akeem&#8217;s new gig at Holler, and from there he went into sharing his unique approach to storytelling. Akeem also spoke about attending the University of South Carolina, went into some of his influences for his artistic style, and gave some great advice for handling operational tasks as a freelancer. Akeem knows that success doesn&#8217;t happen overnight, and he&#8217;s put in the time and effort to come out on top!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
My name is Akeem S. Roberts. I&#8217;m a cartoonist for The New Yorker. illustrator for J.D. the Kid Barber series, and a book designer by day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2023 been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
2023 has been pretty crazy so far. I started off the year unemployed, just doing freelance stuff, and as of like three weeks ago, I just got a brand new job and sort of getting the reins on that and everything&#8217;s been going pretty good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. Congratulations on the new job.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have any plans for the summer? Anything you want to do?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
For the summer, right now I don&#8217;t have anything planned. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll just try to go to a beach or a lake or something and just relax for a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious, from last year to this year, aside from the employment change that you mentioned about, have there been any other kind of changes for you? Anything else going on?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I&#8217;d say from last year to this year, I&#8217;ve more committed to being in publishing versus animation, which was kind of the main thing that I did at the start of my career was mostly animation. After I started doing stuff at The New Yorker and stuff with Kokila, I slowly started making the transition into publishing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What brought that transition on aside from just more work? Was it a feeling or anything?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I felt like for animation mostly it was things move a little bit slower and it feels like the artists&#8230; I guess I was a cog in the machine animation-wise, while publishing, even though I am still just in the machine, I have a little more of a voice and a little more of a say, and I guess it just feels more freeing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds like there&#8217;s just more, I guess, agency, I guess, in publishing.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yes, exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Let&#8217;s talk about some of your work that you&#8217;re doing as a freelance illustrator. I&#8217;m curious, what does a regular day look like for you these days?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
If I&#8217;m doing dailies for The New Yorker, I&#8217;ll try to get up around like 7:00 and then hit Twitter or some kind of news source and just go through trending and try to see what&#8217;s going on, what happened in the past 24 hours. Then, I&#8217;m seeing if I can find a joke and connect that into a bit for The New Yorker for their daily cartoons.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;re creating new pieces every day, so you have to check the news, be like, &#8220;Oh, this is funny,&#8221; draw something, and-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; then it&#8217;s just done? That&#8217;s it?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
It depends on the process. Sometimes, for instance, I got one in for a daily after the trailer of the Barbie movie dropped. For that, I had an idea of doing something of scientists trying to get to the Barbie because there was all of those memes about people saying three, how many or whatever for Barbie movie tickets. I wanted to like have that idea of getting to the Barbie movie first and having it happen immediately, so I was first thinking like scientists creating a time machine to get there on the day that it&#8217;s released. Then, for The New Yorker, I thought of that idea, but I put a little bit of &#8217;80s nostalgia in it, so then I changed it to kind of like Back to the Future where they&#8217;re trying to go to the future to see the Barbie movie.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like Marty and Doc Brown and the DeLorean?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, so they&#8217;re all sitting in the JCPenney parking lot trying to get to the Barbie movie.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s funny. It&#8217;s interesting, though, that you have to, I guess, get them in by a certain time, but it&#8217;s every day, so that makes sense, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. For the dailies, it&#8217;s you have to get the sketches to them before 9:00, and then they&#8217;ll let you know if they like it or not by 10:00, and then you have that done by noon. The one that I did for the Barbie was like a bonus for the daily, so I didn&#8217;t have to get that done till 2:00.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. No, that&#8217;s just interesting that it&#8217;s so fast. I don&#8217;t know why I thought maybe you would have done it the day before or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I think some people do. I&#8217;m reckless.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I see you do a little bit of everything, book illustrations, you do comics, you do animation, you do editorial work. Is there a particular one of these that you prefer to do?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I think I prefer to do comics and publishing chapter book stuff. I feel like that gives me the most control, but also the most freedom. I feel like when you&#8217;re usually doing a comic book, you got to do like 30-something pages and the deadline&#8217;s pretty tight, but when it comes to chapter books or whatever, it&#8217;s a little bit&#8230; It&#8217;s still tight, but it&#8217;s not as, I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s not as hard just because you&#8217;re just doing one panel kind of basically, versus doing nine panels, trying to semi-tell a story, designing multiple backgrounds. It&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. I can see how doing it in that sort of controlled format also, it&#8217;s just easier on you probably just on your workload, you know?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me about how you approach a new project. What does your process look like?? Does it vary per type?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, it definitely varies per type, per project. For anything that&#8217;s like New Yorker, that&#8217;s just I&#8217;m just on the subway jotting down ideas. I send my notes app and I&#8217;ll just like think of jokes, try to connect them, and then from there I&#8217;ll draw a little small thumbnail and then sketch a bigger illustration for that and then send that to the New Yorker. Then, my process for when I&#8217;m doing my web comics also starts on my phone. I just write a joke, describe what&#8217;s happening in the panels. Then, from there I do a thumbnail and then I finalize it and then add all the texts and stuff.</p>
<p>Then, for animation, usually with this, there&#8217;s only a couple of those that I started from scratch where I had a original character and original plot. Those started off more&#8230; I was in Word and Google Docs instead because it was longer format and I had to share it with other people to read, look over, see if they had any notes on the script. For those, it&#8217;s like script first, and then you start the thumbnails and animating each thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What if you&#8217;re doing, say, editorial work or something for the book? Is that process kind of the same?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, editorial is like you&#8217;ll&#8230; Most of the stuff that I did editorial for was like for Men&#8217;s Health. They have this section called Cool Dads-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; so for that, I would like&#8230; They would give me the article that a celeb wrote, and then I would read it. Then, from there, I would like think about an illustration that kind of hit the vibe of what the celeb wrote. The latest one I did was for like LeVar Burton. His whole thing was talking about reading books to his daughter and giving her the freedom to read and how he wants to be there for her. Then, he also makes a reference basically to Harry Potter.</p>
<p>For that, I just drew him in like the garbs with a wand fighting off the Dementors because in the article he talks about how his daughter stopped reading because she didn&#8217;t like the Dementors. He was like, &#8220;Maybe I should have not introduced her to Harry Potter.&#8221; I just took that vibe and added it to the illustration. I would send like three sketches and then the art director over there would pick which one they think is the best. Then, from there I would finish and color it and everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You kin of have to read a little bit of what it is that you&#8217;re going, then, to make sure that the illustration kind of matches that in some way.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. With every editorial or even like the children&#8217;s book, you have to read the manuscript and everything first before you can fully get the gist of it to kind of sum it up in whatever illustration, whether it&#8217;s for a chapter or for an article.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Last year, I was Editor-in-Chief of a print magazine. This was part of the job that I was doing at the time, and our in-house creative director had decided for our first issue that he wanted to also do all the editorial illustrations. I was like, &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; &#8220;a lot, but if you want to do it.&#8221; He also did the cover and everything. I was like, &#8220;Look, more power to you.&#8221; It was so funny because the way he approached it was like, &#8220;Well, I have an idea of a theme for the whole magazine,&#8221; and so he just did illustrations based on whatever, and none of them matched the article in any sort of real way. I&#8217;m telling him like, &#8220;You should probably try to make sure that the images match what the article is about. You drew a polar bear. This article has nothing to do with polar bears. What&#8217;s the connection for the reader to look at this?&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, well, the connection is winter because we&#8217;re publishing the magazine in the winter.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Huh. No, no.&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t make any-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s sounds like a little bit of a stretch, but you know, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, that&#8217;s one of us that feels it. I mean, eventually we ended up sort of just going with the concept because we didn&#8217;t have enough time, but for the second issue, the pieces fit the article more and I told him like, &#8220;Look, read the article and then get started with designing.&#8221; He would just start designing and be like, &#8220;Oh, I have to read the article?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yes, it would help. It would be helpful so at least what you&#8217;re designing matches that in some capacity.&#8221; So&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah yeah. You got to read the article.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
You got to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, how do you approach storytelling through your art? I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s more than just like in, say, the book illustration example, it&#8217;s more than just reading. How do you really approach telling a story through your art?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I would read it and then I would like try to imagine it in my head and say, for instance, for the J.D.the Kid Barber series that I did, for that it was reading it, and then the art director would kind of tell me what they imagined in it. They were like, &#8220;Oh, this character is in their room,&#8221; but it&#8217;s up to me to add anything else that I wanted to add into it, so I would just try and look up Google images basically to find what I imagined this school look like because references, it&#8217;s always great to have. I know sometimes it&#8217;s like, especially when you&#8217;re starting out, you want to not use any references. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;I can do this from my head.&#8221; You can&#8217;t. I mean, you can, but you&#8217;ll miss the small details that you want to have caught if you weren&#8217;t looking at a reference. I would look at reference, kind of imagine the area, and then just try to imagine the characters just living and breathing.</p>
<p>For some of them I would add even like small jokes. One of the illustrations, the art director was, &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s losing this battle, but everyone has numbers up saying 10 for this guy who&#8217;s winning.&#8221; Then, for one of those, I drew his friend in there giving him a thumbs up with like a two, so everyone has a good rating except he has a bad rating for the guy, and he&#8217;s got a thumbs up giving it to the guy being like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I got your back.&#8221; I try to put in little jokes like that inside the book so kids will see it and notice it. I&#8217;m trying to always make an illustration for, I guess, like the younger me if I was reading it as a kid.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. Do you try to add a little something that&#8217;s just unique to you in each image that you do?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
If I do try to add anything, I try to add humor. I feel like that&#8217;s my go-to form of communicating is trying to add a joke if I can.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, we&#8217;ve had a few New Yorker illustrators on the show before, most recently, Liz Montague. I&#8217;m curious, how did you get started with doing illustrations for The New Yorker?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I feel like my story is very unique. I have yet to hear anyone else who&#8217;s had this experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Basically I was like tabling at this convention in New York called Mocha Fest, which is like an art festival, and I had a bunch of comics that I had done online and this little short story that I did that was in black and white. After that weekend, I got a message from Emma who&#8217;s like the Editor at New Yorker. She was, &#8220;Oh, do you want to do a daily shouts?&#8221; Basically like, &#8220;I like your work, and I was wondering if you want to try to submit some jokes or a daily shout or anything like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was like, &#8220;All right,&#8221; and then I sent my first batch, and then after that Friday after I sent it they were like, &#8220;Oh yeah, this one is in.&#8221; I sold one the very first time I tried, which was crazy good. I don&#8217;t know anyone else who&#8217;s done that. Maybe other people have, but I had sold it first immediately. Then, the next week, I also submitted some batches and I also sold another one, so I was feeling really good. I was like, &#8220;All right, I can do this,&#8221; and then after that, it was 40 weeks of like not selling anything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is that usually like the&#8230; You said that was sort of unique to you. I&#8217;m just curious, what would a cartoonist normally do if they&#8217;re trying to get into like The New Yorker? Is there a more-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; typical process?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s like submissions that you can do on the website, and you can send them batches that way. Then, they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;You&#8217;ve made it,&#8221; and then you&#8217;ll get Emma&#8217;s email, so you can start sending batches to her directly. Sort of like a filtering process before you get her email, but I just got it immediately and then got one in immediately, which felt good. Then after that, it slowed down a bit, obviously.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, you&#8217;re still doing it now, so, I mean, it obviously worked out in your favor.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there a particular style that you think, I guess&#8230; I guess it probably varies per publication, but for The New Yorker, and not to harp on them specifically, but is there a particular style that you think they&#8217;re looking for?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
For The New Yorker, I think they&#8217;re looking kind of for something that is sketchy and has detail, but not too much. Nothing that will distract from the joke.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Basically just like if you had to jot down a joke with stick figures in five minutes, that&#8217;s kind of the ideal I think like they want in terms of detail is just not enough stuff that will distract from it. Then, they definitely don&#8217;t want it too cartoony, which is like I always put my stuff, and maybe sometimes it&#8217;s too cartoony, but there&#8217;s a line where you&#8217;re trying to hit where it&#8217;s not cartoony in the sense that it feels like on a Saturday morning cartoon, but also not cartoony in the way that it feels like it&#8217;s Family Guy. You got to hit a perfect, unique just like sketch style that takes a lot of work, but looks simple.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm. I get what you&#8217;re saying. I get what you&#8217;re saying. Certainly, nothing that&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t know, Marvel style, like not a comic kind of thing, but you also-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; want it to have some level of expression and polish, as you would say, that doesn&#8217;t detract from the joke.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve worked with some other big clients as well, Boom! Studios. You mentioned Men&#8217;s Health earlier, Conde Nast, which is over a bunch of different magazines and such. Is it easier working with bigger clients like those than, say, smaller clients?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
For sure. I feel like bigger clients, they kind of have an idea and they kind of let you be free, especially if they know your work. They&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;All right, I saw your work. I kind of imagine what you can do. If you&#8217;ll do that, we&#8217;ll be great.&#8221; I feel like when it comes to mom and pop type of clients, it&#8217;s a little less freeing for the artists in a sense because I guess the dollar value that they&#8217;re spending is&#8230; it&#8217;s precious, their $500 or whatever.</p>
<p>This thing that you&#8217;re doing for them, especially if it&#8217;s like a logo or anything that they&#8217;re going to use over again for t-shirts, it&#8217;s very important. Because of that and because of how important it is to them, they&#8217;re sometimes a little overbearing. They&#8217;ll overwork in illustration because of having multiple revisions that kind of the artist loses&#8230; The more revisions that&#8217;s happening, the artist kind of loses the spirit sometimes. If it&#8217;s 20 revisions to get this logo done, the artist each time is less and less into it-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; and that doesn&#8217;t mean that there will be a point where they don&#8217;t care. The artist is always going to care because it&#8217;s for their portfolio and their job. They want it to be good. It&#8217;s kind of like a way of the artist helping&#8230; not helping themselves, but guarding themselves from being like&#8230; If you&#8217;re too personally attached, you&#8217;ll get upset about the notes-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; so you have to be removed. The more and more you get notes, the more and more you&#8217;re like, &#8220;All right, this is getting away from my vision and I&#8217;m trying to see if I can get exactly what they&#8217;re seeing in their head,&#8221; which is not normally something an artist can reproduce is what another person is envisioning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like if I had to do 20 revisions on a design, I would want to fire the client. To me, that feels like the client really doesn&#8217;t know what they want, and they feel like you&#8217;re just going to keep iterating on it until it magically appears to them. I mean, I know that&#8217;s how we&#8217;re sort of just pulling that number out of anywhere, but I get what you&#8217;re saying about the dollar value, which I think is something that&#8217;s really important. A lot of these bigger companies just have the budget to be able to do bigger type projects, more audacious ideas, et cetera, but then smaller clients, that money has to really go far. That&#8217;s not to say that larger clients aren&#8217;t as invested in the end project, but it just takes on&#8230; There&#8217;s an added gravity to it when it&#8217;s from a smaller client or for a smaller client, I should say.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Can you discuss any upcoming projects or collabs that you&#8217;re excited about?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Right now, I don&#8217;t really have anything coming up. I guess the only thing I have is I&#8217;m working on a graphic novel and I&#8217;m trying to pitch to HarperCollins or Kokila to just get the story that I have in my head off the ground.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I&#8217;ve always wanted to do a graphic novel. I cannot draw, but I have had ideas for characters in my head since I was a teenager to put into a graphic novel. I&#8217;ve talked about it here on the show before. People probably already know this, but one day I&#8217;m going to have the time and the funds to make it happen, so I hope it works out for you.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m hoping it works out, too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I want to get more into your work and your career, but let&#8217;s learn more about Akeem. Let&#8217;s learn more about you. Are you originally from New York?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
No, I am kind of like from everywhere is what I tell everyone. I was born in North Dakota and my Mom was in the military, so I moved around a lot from North Dakota to Alabama, to Germany, to South Carolina, to Texas, to Maryland, to New York. A lot of places, but most of my time was in the South, so I guess I could just say I&#8217;m from the South.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Did you do a lot of drawing growing up?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yes. I would just say that I started drawing&#8230; There&#8217;s two big reasons I started drawing, so first I was just doodling, and then in third grade, I won an award for the state in South Carolina, third place for this painting I did-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; and that was a good boost. I was like, &#8220;Oh, wow, this is cool. I can draw.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t really think of anything of it. I was just like, &#8220;All right, I can doodle.&#8221; Then, in fifth grade, there was this girl that could draw way better than me. I was crushing, so then I would try to get better to impress her, and I think that&#8217;s kind of my origin story is trying to get better to impress a girl. Then, I just kept drawing on my own.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did it work?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
It did not work, you know? So-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; ultimately it was for me, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I had someone on the show a couple episodes ago, Kendell Burton, and he was telling me how he first&#8230; He&#8217;s an art director now, but he was like, &#8220;Oh yeah, I first got into design in the web because I was making a blog on Zynga to try to meet girls.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Does that work?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Never does.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You were doing a lot of drawing and stuff growing up, and I see you went to the University of South Carolina and majored in Media Arts. Tell me about that time. What was that like?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Media Arts, basically, I ended up there because I was very late at applying for colleges, and my family had just moved back to South Carolina, so then I just applied there. This guy that I met with was like, &#8220;Oh, tell me what you want to do.: I was telling him that I probably would want to do some animation, like comics and stuff, and so he was&#8230; The Media Arts Program, which is basically teaching you how to use the Adobe Suite while learning about film, photography, script writing, and so it was like mostly on the film and photography side. Then, I minored in Illustration, so I did like one figure drawing class on my senior year and one illustration class on my senior year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you feel like they really kind of prepared you as an artist?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I feel like not in a sense of what I ideally wanted to do, which was basically do animation and stuff like that. I didn&#8217;t have a student film. I didn&#8217;t even take the animation course because I never signed up in time, but I guess overall, it kind of helped me be a jack-of-all-trade because certain things with film and photography and script writing can transfer into illustration. Having that does help me visualize ideas, but not necessarily in the sense of, &#8220;Okay, you do this something. You&#8217;ll have a job immediately after.&#8221; You know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think school is interesting in that way. I mean, I majored in Math, so I didn&#8217;t think-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Oh no.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; when I was graduating I was going to have&#8230; Actually, no. I mean, I did major in Math, that&#8217;s true, but I had like a scholarship thing lined up with the program that I was in that I was going to work for the government after I graduated. Then, that fell through like junior year because of 9/11. It fell through. I was like, &#8220;Oh, I have no plans for what I&#8217;m going to do when I graduate.&#8221; I was working part time at the Symphony here in Atlanta selling tickets, and I did that, I think&#8230; I did that up till I graduated, and I remember when I graduated they took the calculator away from my kiosk because they were like, &#8220;Well, you have a math degree now. You don&#8217;t need this.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Is that supposed to be funny?&#8221;</p>
<p>I mean, I didn&#8217;t need it, but I didn&#8217;t have any sort of career plans lined up after graduation because I thought I was set. I really didn&#8217;t even pursue other companies. I snuck my resume into other departments&#8217; resume books so I could get interviews at places. I was wholly unprepared going into senior year for any kind of actual career goals. I was in college just because I was a nerd that liked math.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah. That actually sounds very familiar to my story. That&#8217;s basically kind of like how I ended up in New York was my friend got me an internship in New York, and then I did that internship for the summer, but it kind of fell through near the end. Then, I was working at Starbucks in South Carolina. I was making $9 an hour, but the rent was just so much. Most of my money was going towards the rent-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; and then it was like&#8230; I think the rent was&#8230; I want to say almost like 600, almost 800, which is a lot. Then, they were like, &#8220;Oh, you could transfer to the Starbucks in New York,&#8221; which I transferred and I was making like 13. Then, the apartment I had up here was 584 with everything included, so I was way better off staying in New York, and that&#8217;s just like how I got here was not planning on staying. I came up for an internship and I was like, &#8220;All right, I&#8217;m just going to go back,&#8221; but then it just seemed to work out better for me to just live here than be in South Carolina barely making it-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; that makes sense, and I would say also probably as an artist, I mean, you kind of want to be in the cultural capital of the country when it comes to experiences and stuff. I would imagine you probably wouldn&#8217;t have access to the same level of experiences in South Carolina that you would in New York City, you know?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I mean, I feel like&#8230; Okay, so when I was going to college, there was this rumor that actually a bunch of comic artists actually lives in South Carolina, which might be true, but I just never met anyone.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If I recall, and this was years ago when I interviewed him, Sanford Greene, who&#8217;s like, I know he&#8217;s done stuff for Marvel, for DC, pretty prolific visual artist, lives in South Carolina. He lives in South Carolina.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Oh really?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, he went to Benedict&#8217;s.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yep.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, so like yeah, I guess&#8230; Look, I guess South Carolina is the home for the comic artist, but I just could not find that community at all, but comic artists tend to be homebodies, so you would never really see them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I&#8217;d imagine, yeah, it&#8217;s probably not&#8230; There&#8217;s no collective or something like that. I would say it&#8217;s probably just easier in New York because of availability and just the cultural atmosphere of the city. I came from a small town in Alabama, and if I would&#8217;ve stayed there after I graduated high school, I&#8217;d know I wouldn&#8217;t be doing what I&#8217;m doing now because there was no kind of technology or design or anything. You either got married, got into the church, or maybe worked a factory job. Not a lot of options.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s not endemic of the South, but just in particular, like-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah [inaudible 00:30:14].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; your environment can help out, you know?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
No, no, I hear you. I have a bunch of family from Alabama.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. One of your early career gigs, you were at this place called ideaMACHINE Studio where you worked as an animator. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
All right, so crazy with that was one of my friends came up and he was doing photography. I was still working at Starbucks at this time, and he was like, &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s an animation studio just like here. Do you want to apply?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;All right, cool.&#8221; We possibly could work in the same building, whatever, so I applied. Then, I got the job, and then that same day my friend got fired from whatever company he was working at in the building, so it&#8217;s like we didn&#8217;t get to work together, but he did help me get this job by seeing it. Then, at that same time, I was still working at Starbucks, which I worked that job while also doing Starbucks for like a year and a half just doing both of them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, and at Starbucks, I had just became a shift manager. I would only work two or three days a week, but it was weird because I&#8217;d be in charge then, so it&#8217;s like&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You were able to kind of juggle it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I was able to juggle it, but it was surreal once I think about it, just like how many hours I was working. It was a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How was ideaMACHINE Studio? Was that kind of your first studio experience?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, that was my first studio experience. That one, it was a little more&#8230; I guess in a sense it kind of trained me, kind of gave me the animation class kind of a sense because I went in there knowing some stuff, but not really knowing the 12 principles of animation or anything like that, just what I saw online. Most of the stuff that I did for them was kind of like whiteboard explainer videos.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
It was like for pharmaceutical companies that had this idea, but wanted it to be explained in a simply way. That&#8217;s what we did for them. There was tiny stuff that you can animate, and then I would push it every once in a while to try and get better at my animation chops and my graphic design skills. I guess in a sense that job kind of trained me, but it was very reluctantly because the guy who runs the company was&#8230; I was trying to get better at art, and he was like, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to get better at drawing.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yes, I do.&#8221; Then, I just kept pushing and doing my web comic on the side was also something I did. Just work on my skills and progress my abilities to draw and stuff like that. Was just doing that weekly in order to force myself to put something out consistently and have a foundation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, so you were doing this kind of freelance work or doing your own work at least as well as doing this nine-to-five. How did you balance that?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I did not sleep a lot is how I balanced that. Basically, I would work during the day. If I had a Starbucks shift, maybe it was two or three hours, so I&#8217;d work nine to five, and then I would walk over to the Starbucks. I just happened to be super close to this company and then work four hours there and then come back home, which the commute was good. It was like 30 minutes, not that bad, especially for New York, and then work on my freelance stuff. Then that started again in the morning. It was a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s amazing the stuff that we pull off when we&#8217;re younger just to try to get that&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, I guess you just have all that youthful energy. You can get it done. Nowadays, absolutely not. I&#8217;m in bed-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; at a certain hour. I not staying up pulling all-nighters anymore. No, I get what you&#8217;re saying. It takes a lot to try to make sure you&#8217;re doing all of these things because, of course, you&#8217;re doing what you have to do to pay your bills and whatever, but you&#8217;re also establishing yourself during this time doing your own thing, which I think is super important. It&#8217;s something I tell a lot of designers that come on the show, especially ones that just start off, like have something on the side that&#8217;s just your own thing, you know?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You can still do what you have to do to get involved with your career at your workplace, but have something that&#8217;s just yours.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, after you worked at ideaMACHINE, you ended up at another studio called Holler where you were their Associate Animation Director. Was that a big shift from your work at ideaMACHINE?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, that was a big shift. One of the main things that like&#8230; The reason I left ideaMACHINE was first I wanted to grow as an artist, and then the second thing was that they were in Brooklyn, and then they were moving the company to New Jersey. I was&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to step foot in New Jersey, no offense to New Jersey, but I was just like, &#8220;I live in Brooklyn. The commute is crazy. Getting on the path just to get there, I absolutely can&#8217;t do it.&#8221; This is around the same time that The New Yorker reached out to me, and then this company reached out to me and they were like, &#8220;Hey, do you want to do a test for us?&#8221; I did a test for them. I had my Cintiq and everything all set up, and then my Cintiq broke that weekend-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; and I had to use the Bamboo, which is kind of like is still a drawing tablet, but just doesn&#8217;t have a screen. I had to use my Bamboo tablet and finish that animation for them, which is a quick reaction GIF that was like three seconds long. I did that over the weekend and they liked it.</p>
<p>Then, I started working there and the culture was very different. ideaMACHINE&#8217;s culture was kind of like you were doing like a student project. You would have art director&#8230; They would like help you, but not with any direction. The art direction was purely up to the animator. The way that it looked was purely up to the animator. The client would give notes, but it wasn&#8217;t like I had to follow a guide. I was the guide. It was like everything I did at ideaMACHINE from like the music to audio, sound effects and all of that compositing, there we did&#8230; It was a one-shop stop for one artist on each video. It wasn&#8217;t like working as a team really. It was kind of one guy is doing this, and if they need help with the animation, they&#8217;ll ask you, but it wasn&#8217;t anything that was ever felt like a cohesive team effort where everyone is trying to draw in the same style or anything like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm, so it seems like it was definitely just a ramp-up in terms of responsibility, though, right?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, so for Holler, when I first started, I was just doing little three-second GIFs and there&#8217;ll be client stuff, and then we&#8217;ll work on those. Then, later on, I started directing some shorts that they did right before I left. There was one called Akemi-chan: Is It Magical?, which is an idea that I had which was like a play on Magical School Girls trying to do a bunch of anime inside jokes kind of stuff like that. I was writing the script for that and then guiding the people that was working with me of how I wanted it to look and fleshing out storyboards and having more of a commanding role, which felt good, which kind of led to my newest role is sort of still doing that. It was kind of a stepping stone of becoming in charge, taking a step back and letting people do their things, but also helping them grow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. I would imagine even with that, it&#8217;s sort of helping you out in your freelance because you were still freelancing also during this time with Holler?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. With Holler, I was still freelancing. Like the beginning of 2020, like in January 2020, I got a call from Kokila being like, &#8220;Hey, do you want to work on this book?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;This name looks familiar.&#8221; I was looking at the art director&#8217;s name, and then I looked it up and it was the same art director for Hair Love, which I loved Hair Love. It was great. They&#8217;d just had that short come out. It was beautiful with Matthew A. Cherry. I was, &#8220;Wow, I would love to work with them.&#8221; I reached out to them and I was getting started. I was like, &#8220;Man, I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m going to do this with the commute, but I&#8217;m going to try and make it happen.&#8221; Then, of course, the pandemic happened, so it made it a little easier for me to finish my day job and then jump straight to my freelance. From there, every day I was doing illustrations from like 9:30 at night to like 2:00 in the morning-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; just to get those things done, and it was a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, but I mean, I would imagine it changed the way you work freelance, right?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, definitely. Freelance before I felt was more if I felt like I had the energy to do it, I&#8217;d do it-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; but with the book, it was like, &#8220;All right, you got to get these pages done. You got to get these multiple books done. You kind of have to treat this now like a full-time job where you clock in.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;All right, my clock-in time is 9:30 at night to 2:00 in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, that&#8217;s good. You get into doing it, you kind of time box your schedule, it sort of helps out, especially if you&#8217;re doing it on a regular basis.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, something that I&#8217;ve seen at least over the past decade that I&#8217;ve done this show, but I&#8217;d say probably prior to that as well, you started to see a really big increase of Black artistic talent, visual artistic talent specifically. Cartoons, animations, fine art, like you mentioned Hair Love from Matthew A. Cherry. No relation, I think, I think. Any genealogists out there want to dive into that, I&#8217;m more than welcome.</p>
<p>When I see all of this, I also end up seeing this question about representation, like that always seems to come up, which I think is kind unfair that if you are a Black artist that you have to represent your community through your work. I think it&#8217;s up to the individual artist what they choose to do. Is that something that you feel like you have to do through your work? Have you gotten that kind of, I don&#8217;t know, sense of&#8230; I don&#8217;t even want to say responsibility, but have you gotten that, say, from other people, from clients, et cetera?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, I would say there&#8217;s a little bit of that, and there&#8217;s like, for instance, when I first started at Holler, I was one of the only two black people there that was the artist and black people in general. One of the things I did when I started there was like I didn&#8217;t want to get pigeonholed as the guy who you only come to for Black stuff, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
That I immediately just did not draw. I drew like animal characters that I knew were Black or like Mother Earth was a character that had an Afro, but I knew she was Black, but it was like I didn&#8217;t do anything that was explicitly Black because I didn&#8217;t want to get pigeonholed. With my comic stuff, it&#8217;s slice of life, but there are times that I do stuff that is political, but those are very few and far between. Then, my main stance on that is just I want my web comic to&#8230; There&#8217;s a bunch of web comics out there where it&#8217;s just nothing really happens. It&#8217;s just like couples chilling and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>I was like, &#8220;This web comic, I&#8217;m doing it to show that Black people are normal. This is my every day. This is slice of life. There&#8217;s like nothing big going on. No overarching villain. This is just a Black guy chilling. Here&#8217;s a look into this. It&#8217;s not what you normally expect.&#8221; I feel like there&#8217;s that, and then sometimes if there&#8217;s bigger issues, I&#8217;ll just bleed over. Then, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;I have to address this.&#8221; I will-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; but most of it I&#8217;m just the way that I&#8217;m thinking of representation is just like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m just a normal guy on the internet. This is what a normal Black dude is doing-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; you know? Chilling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I like that, and I&#8217;m glad you sort of framed it in that way. You know, it&#8217;s interesting, even after doing this show for as long as I&#8217;ve done it, people will only think Black designers come in one specific type. I mean, that can be whatever that type is what that type is, but I say that to say that there&#8217;s a lot of variety in what people might think might just be a monolithic set. One thing I&#8217;ve tried to do with the show is like, yeah, I have designers, but I&#8217;ve got cartoons and illustrators. I&#8217;ve had footwear designers on the show. I&#8217;ve had software developers on the show. I try to make it pretty diverse in general just to give a sense of what we&#8217;re doing out here in terms of creativity in this kind of digital age. I&#8217;m glad that you framed it in that way. I think that&#8217;s a really good way to look at it.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, that was also one of the things when I did the J.D. the Kid Barber books was the reason I worked so many hours on it was because I really wanted the illustrations to have like an angelic feel or like magical feeling, and to have there be depth in the Black character&#8217;s skin, so it wasn&#8217;t just a gray tone because it was on black and white, but it wasn&#8217;t just a gray tone for the skin and no light. I made sure that there was an airbrush. I showed the details of Black skin so when a Black kid opens it up, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, my skin is beautiful.&#8221; I made sure the skin popped, and that&#8217;s what I was like&#8230; That was another way of what I was thinking of representation, but not in the sense of, &#8220;Oh, this stands for something,&#8221; but just in a subtle way of like a kid opening a book and seeing that Black is beautiful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Who are some artists or illustrators that have influenced your work?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I got the classic Calvin and Hobbes. Loved the Garfield. Loved Boondocks. Maybe it wasn&#8217;t age-appropriate for me to be watching it when I was, but I did love The Boondocks. Strong anime influence. Just a bunch of stuff. Even speaking of The Boondocks, when I was in college, I think this guy is named Carl Jones. He worked on The Boondocks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah. He was in Columbia, South Carolina, for something. I don&#8217;t know what he was there for, and he saw my sketchbook. He was like, &#8220;Oh, let me look at this.&#8221; Then, he looked at it and he was like, &#8220;You got some good ideas here, but you really need to work on your fundamentals.&#8221; From there, I just started working on my fundamentals like crazy, which I reached out to him and I told him that and he was like, &#8220;Wow.&#8221; Then, that was it, That was the last we talked, but he was like, &#8220;Wow, thanks.&#8221; Then, he started following me on Instagram and I as like, &#8220;All right, cool.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, that&#8217;s so interesting. Early&#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t even say&#8230; This wasn&#8217;t even in my career, and I keep sort of making these parallels because you&#8217;re saying some things that line up directly with some experiences that I&#8217;ve had. This was the year, God, I sound so old. This was like 2000 I want to say, &#8217;99, 2000 maybe, but I was palling around on the internet. This was back when Yahoo used to be a big destination on the web for a lot of people.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It had chat, it had games. I mean, ask any elder Millennial about Yahoo Spades, and they will spin you a tale, okay. Yahoo had a lot of these user groups that you could just join or whatever. Very similar to like, I guess, a forum or something like that. They had one around Black comic books that was just called like Black Comics. When I tell you the cr√®me de la cr√®me of Black artists at the time were in there, I&#8217;m talking Denys Cowan, I&#8217;m talking Dwayne McDuffie. Dwayne McDuffie-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; actually gave me a critique on a comic book idea that I had. I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I want to make this comic book about these like&#8230; They&#8217;re ninjas, but they&#8217;re Black, and I&#8217;m going to call it Black Ninjas.&#8221; I mean, I can laugh about it now. This is terrible. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;This is just-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Oh no.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; &#8220;you&#8217;ve just taken Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,&#8221; which I love, &#8220;you&#8217;ve just taken Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and mapped their direct characteristics onto Black people.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;If you want to make something that&#8217;s your own, you really have to make it your own. You can&#8217;t just copy from what someone else has done.&#8221;</p>
<p>That has stuck with me. I mean, I&#8217;ve certainly taken that advice with other projects and things that I&#8217;ve done, but this was way back in the day. It&#8217;s amazing how even just like those kind of little comments that you get from someone that has been where you&#8217;re trying to go can help just set you in the right direction, that kind of indirect mentorship in a way.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to any aspiring artists out there that are just starting out in the industry? What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Work on your fundamentals, but also when you&#8217;re doing contracts, there&#8217;s a couple of things you need to make sure you have, which is a kill fee. If you finish an illustration, no matter how much percentage of it, they&#8217;ll still pay you what they said they&#8217;ll pay you. That way, even if they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, you finished this illustration,&#8221; and then they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Actually, we don&#8217;t want to do the project anymore,&#8221; if you have a kill fee, that would be like, &#8220;Hey, I finished a hundred percent of this project. Pay me a hundred percent of the project.&#8221; No matter what, they still have to pay, which is important.</p>
<p>Then, make sure you have a limited number of revisions. I like to do three revisions, and then if a client goes over that, they pay for that, so like you get these three revisions, then anything else they pay for it. That allows the client to think about it because I feel like if it&#8217;s unlimited revisions, the client is just going to keep being like, &#8220;Oh, what if this was pink? What if this was blue? What is this was orange?&#8221; If you&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Hey, you have three revisions,&#8221; that kind of nit-picky stuff with the client they&#8217;re not going to do because they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, these are important. Let me actually think about it.&#8221; Like, &#8220;Oh, can I just imagine that color in blue or whatever versus asking the illustrator or artist to do it for them.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Then, after that, I would say also save 30% of whatever you get for freelance for taxes because you do not want to get caught with your pants down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are you speaking from personal experience there?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
No, I was able to catch it. I didn&#8217;t let that happen to me, but I&#8217;m always worried. I&#8217;m always trying to save just in case. I don&#8217;t want to end up having to pay too much in taxes and don&#8217;t have any money in my account.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good idea. That&#8217;s a good idea. How do you stay inspired and motivated in what you do? I&#8217;m curious. How do you handle burnout or any sort of periods of low motivation? How do you get through that?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
That, I feel like whenever I&#8217;m in a funk, especially when I&#8217;m drawing stuff, I kind of just doodle a comfort character, which for me is like I love Sonic the Hedgehog. Sonic 1 was like one of the first games I ever played. I always draw Sonic, and it helps me get out of the funk because I feel like the funk you&#8217;re usually in is just because you&#8217;re progressing in your mind, but you haven&#8217;t kind of caught up to your hand yet. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, this is looking bad,&#8221; because I know my taste is a lot better in my head and I can visualize it, but I&#8217;m like my mind, my body hasn&#8217;t quite gotten there yet. I feel like if you have a comfort character that kind of helps you put things in perspective, I guess.</p>
<p>For me, it&#8217;s Sonic, which whenever I&#8217;m feeling out of it, I&#8217;ll just doodle a little Sonic and I&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Hey, this was better than what I did before. That keeps me motivated, and I always try to measure myself only to myself. Yeah, there&#8217;s going to be artists and stuff that you look up to, but make sure you just look at how you are progressing so that way you don&#8217;t lose motivation and drawing. If you&#8217;re drawing and then you see another person who just draws something straight out of the air and it&#8217;s perfect and beautiful and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Man, I can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; you just got to like slowly keep working. Just look at yourself and be like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m slightly better than what I was the other day,&#8221; and just keep going.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I&#8217;d love to have this graphic novel come out and then continue doing stuff in publishing, because right now my job is designing book covers-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; so I don&#8217;t do the illustration or anything in that. I just do the layout, the fonts and everything-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; and I feel like that has been a little freeing in order to look at the process, but also pick other artists that will be good for a work or a job or something like that. I guess I give them the opportunity to show themselves.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I think designing book cover certainly is a&#8230;that seems pretty cool. I&#8217;ve seen awards go to just book covers in terms of design and everything, so that&#8217;s a pretty cool gig to have.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m liking it so far. Only three weeks in, though, but it&#8217;s good right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
You can find out more about at akeemteam.com and everything pretty much at Akeem Team, which ironically, that is just like an AIM username I made back up in middle school and I just kept it,</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, it&#8217;s yours. It&#8217;s yours forever.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good, man. Akeem Roberts, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. Thank you for, I think, demystifying a little bit about what it&#8217;s like to be a working freelance artist. I think what&#8217;s probably the most important thing that I gathered just from this conversation and from your story is that this wasn&#8217;t an overnight success. You always sort of had this gift for drawing, and then you cultivated that through college and then through your additional work experiences. Then, you were also freelancing and now you&#8217;re doing cartoons in The New Yorker and you&#8217;re designing book covers and stuff like that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all a process, like you&#8217;ve managed to continue to build your skills up at every step of the way, and I think that&#8217;s something that for most people, particularly for most people I think that are listening, it&#8217;s just an important thing to know that success doesn&#8217;t come overnight. You&#8217;ve really kind of worked hard to make a name for yourself. I&#8217;m excited to see what else comes out from you in the future, so thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Hey, thank you so much for having me, man.</p>
