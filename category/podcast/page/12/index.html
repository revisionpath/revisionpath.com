Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>It&#8217;s been fun checking up on folks I&#8217;ve interviewed on Revision Path before, which brings us to my interview this week with art director Kendell Burton. <a href="/kendell-burton-2013/" data-wpel-link="internal">When we spoke nearly a decade ago, he was just kicking off his career.</a> Now he&#8217;s winning awards and staking his claim as one of NYC&#8217;s most dynamic creative talents.</p>
<p>We started off talking about his current work at international health agency 21GRAMS, and from there Kendell shared his story of growing up in Brooklyn and getting excited about tech through an unlikely source &#8212; Xanga. Kendell also spoke about the high points of his career, gave some tips about working at agencies, and talked about his horror podcast <a href="https://www.terrornovapodcast.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">TerrorNova</a>. Kendell truly loves what he does, and I can&#8217;t wait to see how his career continues to grow well into the future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Hey. My name is Kendell Burton. I am a senior art director at 21GRAMS, currently. I&#8217;ve been there now for a year. Yep. Coming up on a year. Yeah. Just past the year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. How&#8217;s the year been going so far for you?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
2023 has been nice so far. I can&#8217;t complain. I&#8217;m always excited for what comes each year. I try to mix things up a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything that you want to accomplish this year that you didn&#8217;t accomplish last year? Any New Year&#8217;s resolutions or stuff like that?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t really do resolutions that much, but I guess if I had to say the closest thing to it is this year I want to travel a little bit more. I haven&#8217;t traveled as much as I would like, in a lot of ways, these past few years. Of course, due to the pandemic and stuff like that. I want to get back to doing that a little bit more.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I hear you there. I took my first plane trip since the pandemic back in October. I went to Toronto and spoke at a conference. I was tripping, leading up to the trip. You see on the news folks be fighting the airports. I don&#8217;t want to go and it&#8217;s some hassle. I just want to go to the airport, get on the plane, get where I&#8217;ve got to go. You know what I&#8217;m saying? It was fine. Once I got back into that rhythm, I was like, &#8220;Okay. This is good. I can do this.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
That&#8217;s cool. You went to Toronto. I love Toronto. It&#8217;s one of my favorite places to visit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That was my first time visiting. I didn&#8217;t get to see a whole lot of the city because they had us right by the convention venue where we spoke at. I tell people that Toronto kind of feels like if Hollywood made a big city to shoot movies in, it would be Toronto. It feels like New York, but less gritty and grimy, in a way.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a perfect description, actually. Yep. Someone who goes there every year, that&#8217;s a perfect description.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interestingly enough, I got to the airport, took my cab to the hotel, got to the hotel. Soon as I walk in the hotel, they&#8217;re playing Drake. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Really? Really?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
They love Drake over there. [inaudible 00:07:03] Drake. Cab drivers have asked me and my lady about that last time I went. I went in the summertime last year and the guy was like, &#8220;you heard of Drake?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I know [inaudible 00:07:11]. Who didn&#8217;t hear of Drake?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who hasn&#8217;t heard of Drake?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t listen to his music like that, but of course I&#8217;ve heard of the man. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;He&#8217;s not popular in America?&#8221; It said, &#8220;Very, very popular.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. You mentioned 21GRAMS. Let&#8217;s talk a little bit about the work that you&#8217;re doing there. Can you tell me about that?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. I could tell you a bit about agency. I&#8217;ve been there, like I said, for a year. The work is pharma based, which is really interesting because it&#8217;s my first step ever into pharma. I&#8217;ve like never done anything pharma before this. It&#8217;s been really interested. 21GRAMS a pharma agency. It sometimes comes down to figuring out the best way to market a drug. Very similar to a traditional agency in the consumer space where maybe Mars or M&#038;M&#8217;s would come to the agency and say, &#8220;Hey. We want to do a campaign. What should we do? What is the thinking? What is the concepts? What does your campaign look like?&#8221; That&#8217;s pretty much the 21GRAMS does with pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>It could be a general campaign that&#8217;s about bringing awareness around a particular disease or particular condition that people suffer from or it could be a campaign that&#8217;s about a very specific drug that is meant to help and treat a very specific condition. The campaigns kind of range, but the thinking and all of that stuff, strategically, conceptually, design-wise, all that stuff still applies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is a typical day like for you?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Oh, man. It&#8217;s exciting for me, because I&#8217;m still learning so much new stuff every day. Some things are the norm, just hopping on Teams or hopping in chats and talking to my teammates about what&#8217;s happening on the project. Some days can be very heavily design focused where I&#8217;m in design or Photoshop or XD or any of the millions of programs in the Adobe Suite. Could be one day of me making maybe working on a brochure or a lead behind or working on a direct mail alert or it could be working on a page for a website or I could be working on print ads. Like I said, it&#8217;s a variety. Honestly, some days can just be very heavily meeting focused where I may be having conversations with my internal team about the upcoming project, relaying questions to them about what I need to do, what I can do.</p>
<p>This is the interesting thing about working on pharma, you kind of have to learn about the drugs or a disease stage you&#8217;re trying to fix. That&#8217;s another meeting, they call it Med 101. They may be sitting in a meeting for an hour where I&#8217;m just learning about the condition that people suffer from and this is why this particular medication was created to treat this. It&#8217;s really interesting. My day could jump around. It could be very, very different from day to day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What attracted you to work for them?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I wanted to try something new, to be honest with you. I wanted to try something new. I remember telling them that during an interview process as well. I wanted to try something different throughout a good portion of my career I&#8217;ve to work consumer side, which you knows things like Nike, Adidas, my Little Pony, Hasbro, all of this variety of brands I&#8217;ve been fortunate to touch. I remember one of my professors always said with pharma, he was like, &#8220;Hey. Some people get stuck in it. Some people don&#8217;t like being stuck, so if you could try consumer for a little while and then go into pharma, so at least if you don&#8217;t enjoy pharma, you can go back. You might find that you like it, so it&#8217;s kind of up to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m the type of person that likes to try new things. I was like, &#8220;Great. I&#8217;ve done all these years of consumer.&#8221; The opportunity for pharma came up to me and I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I want to try that. I haven&#8217;t done that before, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have to think differently and learn new things.&#8221; That&#8217;s kind of a part of a reason I got this field to begin with. So I was like, &#8220;Time to launch a new step.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Overall, as an art director, what would you say is the best thing about the work that you do?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a lot of things. Of course I&#8217;m a fan of the end result, when the project is done. [inaudible 00:11:03] A everyone&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Wow, this really came out better than we expected.&#8221; It&#8217;s always great to hear that. I honestly love proving the people that design requires more work than people think. I think oftentimes people just to just go, well, you know the brand color is, what photography to use, I would direct that. I think sometimes a big part of art direction, which is different from design, they are not a hundred percent the same. A big part of our director is trying to direct people like, &#8220;Hey. We can do it like this. We can do it like this. I know you may be selling this particular thing, but we could style this in the style of, I don&#8217;t know, a Cinderella book or something or some type of fairytale story.&#8221; You could just remix things in the ways that people don&#8217;t expect and that&#8217;s a part of the experience.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just laying out the content, but it&#8217;s the way in which you lay out the content that makes things really interesting. That&#8217;s a part of the art direction. What type of typography do we use? What type of photography do we use? That&#8217;s a part of art direction that&#8217;s slightly separate from design, but is of course connected. That&#8217;s one of my favorite aspects of it. Just kind of showing non designers that and showing &#8220;non creatives&#8221; that aspect of what we do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I hear people kind of use art director and creative director somewhat interchangeably. What would you say are the difference between those two, from your perspective?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve heard it a few different ways. I would say, I guess, in my experience, the way the industry has been lately, within the time I&#8217;ve been in it, it seems like people have tried to merge the two. From my understanding how things used to be, there was never really a mergence of the two because thinking and doing are two very different tasks. There are people who are really good designers, like fantastic designers, but they may not be the best in terms of figuring out the best direction for something to look visually, but they may be the best to put it together. They just may not be the best to come up with the idea. Generating ideas is important. Similarly, to how people think of Apple when they&#8217;re just, &#8220;Steve Jobs didn&#8217;t design anything.&#8221; You&#8217;re like, &#8220;You&#8217;re probably right.&#8221; Having the vision and coming up with the idea is a big part of the process too. You can&#8217;t separate the vision from the actual technical part they&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always viewed creative director and art director as they&#8217;re different. In my opinion, the creative director is more of the manager. The creative director is the manager of the entire project. Not just necessarily the art aspect of it, but understanding what are we trying to accomplish? What are we doing on brief? What is the brief. What is the brief action? Do we have enough information in the brief? All of those things. I feel like, the creative director is a part of kind of guard railing to make sure that the art director and the designers can succeed.</p>
<p>The art director, I&#8217;ve always viewed it as art director is generally in charge of what is the ownable creative POV in which we can tell this story. Are we telling the story in a way of a video game? We know some type of video game narrative that uses maybe a UI video game experience. What are we trying to say? Here&#8217;s the best way to say it. The career director is just, I would say, there to make sure that you have all things in place such you can actually get to doing part. That&#8217;s just how I viewed it. I&#8217;m sorry if that sounds a little complex, but that&#8217;s just kind of how I thought it. Art director is the creative vision. Creative director is making sure art director has everything they do and need and being the guardrail and the pressure cooker to make sure that things are going out make sense.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re like the, I would say, the artistic version of the client. That&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve always thought of it. When I work on a project, even though I&#8217;m designing as well oftentimes, I&#8217;m going to the creative director far before I&#8217;m going to anyone else to go, &#8220;Hey, here&#8217;s what the brief said. Here&#8217;s what the POV is. Here&#8217;s what the goal is. Here&#8217;s how I think we should do that. We should tell that story. We should solve this problem. What do you think?&#8221; I feel like the creative director&#8217;s supposed to put their client hat on in some ways to go, &#8220;Okay. The client may or may not like certain aspects of this. We&#8217;re kind of pushing a bar, but that&#8217;s cool. Let&#8217;s push the bar. Let&#8217;s do this.&#8221; That&#8217;s kind of how I&#8217;ve always viewed it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, I got you. No, I like that distinction and that comparison. When I&#8217;ve had folks on the show or even when I&#8217;ve just talked to other creatives, I keep hearing them used interchangeably. I know they&#8217;re different, but I don&#8217;t know if they know that it&#8217;s different, if they&#8217;re saying one thing and it should be something else.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s why I say what it is now, because from my understanding from people I&#8217;ve spoken to who have been in this field far longer than I have, even before I knew this field was an option in life, people who have been in this field maybe 20, 30 years, maybe even longer. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Hey. These jobs used to be treated entirely separately.&#8221; Even the designer and art director were treated entirely separately. You weren&#8217;t just promoted from designer to then your next level was art direction because some can&#8217;t make that jump. I was like, &#8220;That makes sense.&#8221; Now it seems like it&#8217;s been smushed together in a lot of ways. I&#8217;m sure it has to do with money, it&#8217;s easy to pay one person versus two. I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s why that decision was made. Everyone who&#8217;s an art director is not meant to be a creative director and vice versa.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Got you. Got you. I kind of want to switch gears here a little bit because you sort of alluded to earlier about not even knowing this was a profession. I kind of want to know about your origin story, how you first got into design and art direction and everything. You were born and raised in Brooklyn, right?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me what it was growing up there.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I loved it. I still live in New York. I&#8217;m not in Brooklyn anymore. Now I live in Manhattan, but I&#8217;ve always loved Brooklyn. It&#8217;s always had a good community, in my opinion, especially being a kid. I was born in 89, which isn&#8217;t that long ago, but it can feel like it [inaudible 00:16:42] hindsight. I&#8217;ve always had a really great community. I was not a cool kid, but I mean I had a good time as a kid growing up in Brooklyn. I was always in parks, really simple life. My family wasn&#8217;t super wealthy or had money to really do vacations in crazy places or anything like that. It was a lot of spending time with family, going to block parties when Block Brooklyn used to do more of that when I was a kid, block parties were a thing. The thing, especially in the summertime. It&#8217;s the best thing ever. Just every morning in the neighborhood comes out, everyone&#8217;s cooking, giving stuff to kids, nobody&#8217;s worried about kids getting kidnapped. It was chill. It was really cool.</p>
<p>I really just loved that as a kid. That&#8217;s literally my fondest memory of Brooklyn is just block parties and everybody just kind of being out and no one calls [inaudible 00:17:31]. Everyone&#8217;s just chilling. Hey, you want a hamburger? We&#8217;re making burgers over here. You want some hotdog? You want some ribs? Everyone&#8217;s making everything. It&#8217;s a great time. I loved it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I love that sort of sense of community that comes from close-knit places like that. I mean, I grew up in the deep south, but that&#8217;s one of my memories of growing up is we were around this tight-knit community where if you needed something, you went across the street. It sounds quaint. Oh, I&#8217;m going to go across the street and borrow a cup of sugar or whatever, but you could do that. Folks would sit out on their porch and wave to each other and all of that. Doesn&#8217;t happen now, but back in the day it definitely was just a different vibe back then.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. I try to recreate that in my everyday life in some capacity. It&#8217;s a little challenging, but I try to create some small aspects of that going forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, were you a really creative kid? Did you do a lot of drawing and stuff?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I tried. I tried. I guess I would say I was creative. I was like every other kid watching Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon and things like that and trying to draw the character as best I could. I did have that aspect of it. Drawing never really stuck with me, but I did do that. I just enjoyed comedy and seeing and doing creative things. I was a really active kid. I was never one of those kids who just knew what they wanted out of life in terms of &#8230; Some kids are like, &#8220;I know I want to be a doctor. I know I want to be this.&#8221; When that question came to me in elementary school, I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, man. I&#8217;m five. I know firemen do cool stuff, but I know police do their thing. All these other companies and professions do their things, but I don&#8217;t know. Can I just learn life?&#8221;<br>
That was always how I&#8217;d been. I would just learned stuff. I was like, &#8220;Oh. This is interesting. That&#8217;s interesting.&#8221; Standup comedy was interesting. My father would play that stuff in the house and that&#8217;s how I knew Richard Pryor and things like that. I was like, &#8220;This is funny. This is interesting.&#8221; It was movies another thing.I just experimented with everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You said you were born in 89, right? Right around that time of the late eighties, early nineties. I would say even going into the mid and late nineties, there was such an explosion of culture that happened, I think particularly here in the US, because of the advent of technology and personal computers and cable and the internet and all that sort of stuff. Prior to the generation before us, we just got exposed to so much more stuff at a formative age. It kind of makes sense that when that question gets asked about what do you want to be, it&#8217;s tough because you have so much choice.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. I think it&#8217;s good to have choice. I&#8217;m always the person that thinks people need to experience stuff to know what they like. That&#8217;s just how I view it. I guess you can call it my childhood wisdom even. That was just the way I viewed things. I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know until I tried it,&#8221; I would just try stuff. That&#8217;s why I played a billion sports. I was also drawing stuff. I was trying to write poetry, I was doing so many things. I was just like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m good at yet. I know I&#8217;m smart. I don&#8217;t have any self-esteem issues or self-confidence issues, but I need to explore the world. I just got here. I&#8217;m eight.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now did your family support you in this, all this sort of exploration of all these different things?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. They definitely did. My dad, I mainly raised by my dad, because my mom passed when I was a young age. My dad, he didn&#8217;t even tell me to do these things. I just was interested in stuff. I would see stuff that he did and I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s kind of cool,&#8221; obviously. Whether it was movies we watched or TV shows or bike riding. We did a lot of bike riding when I was a kid. I still try to ride my bike now. It still applies. Seeing things in the world, seeing things in the park, seeing people try stuff maybe in a TV show and I&#8217;m like, that&#8217;s interesting. Let me try that. My parents never discouraged me from doing anything.</p>
<p>They kind of in some ways opened the world up to me. They didn&#8217;t really shield me from things in the world heavily. They were just kind of like, &#8220;Yeah. Some things are like this and things like that.&#8221; They kind of encouraged me to ask questions and tell them my thoughts if I had any. I just kept going. I just kept doing it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now I read in another interview that you cut your teeth in tech trying to set up a Xanga blog to meet girls. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yes, that is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me about that. What&#8217;s the about?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
This is my origin story. You know what&#8217;s funny? I tell this story at job interview, so I&#8217;ll tell you exactly how I tell it. I need people to know my personality. I&#8217;ve always felt like if people don&#8217;t understand my personality then there&#8217;s no point in me working at places. I tell them the same story when I go to job interviews. People are like, &#8220;What got you in the design?&#8221; I go, &#8220;Women.&#8221; People are like, &#8220;What? What does that mean?&#8221; It&#8217;s not a answer you expect. You expect me to sit down and be like, &#8220;I was drawing such a young age, Picasso.&#8221; No, it was none of that.</p>
<p>It was gross. I was a teenager, I was 13 years old. I had my first summer job or first job, period. It was a summer job. I worked at a senior center in Queens. I lived in Queens at the time. I worked at the senior center and Ravenswood in Queens. This kid that I worked with with was a little older than me. He was a graduating senior in high school. I just finished my freshman year. He was always on this website called Xanga. I didn&#8217;t know what it was. I just saw he was always on it.</p>
<p>They had a computer. This is before computers were everywhere. People had computers, but not everyone had a computer at home. I was one of those people that didn&#8217;t have a computer at home. I knew how to use computers because schools had computers. In our office job, at the senior center &#8230; It was office job. You&#8217;re sorting paperwork, you may occasionally have to type something, you may occasionally have to send an email. We mostly hung out with the elderly people that were there, because that was what it was. It was like maybe bringing lunch to him, stuff like that. It was just a space where older people could hang out in the summertime and they didn&#8217;t have to go out and worry about the heat or anything like that. It was a really chill place.</p>
<p>My coworker that worked there, he was just on his website all the time, Xanga. I always saw he was on there, whether he was putting music or changing photos. It was a really simple blog. I guess this was before people even called them blogs, but it was a really simple blog. He always had music playing. He was just metal. He had cool backgrounds. I think one day after a few weeks of getting to know him, I was like, &#8220;Hey, man. What is this website?&#8221; He was like, &#8220;Oh. I use it to talk to my friends who are&#8221; &#8230; What is the word I&#8217;m looking for? For people who were shipped out in the military, because he was in a program called ROTC, I believe was the name of it, which is kind of a preparation program for people who were going to go to the military or go to military schools, things like that. He was like, &#8220;Yeah. I stay in touch with my friends who are overseas and who have already been deployed. I just used us to stay in touch with them and talk to other people.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s cool. That&#8217;s really cool. Can I meet girls on here?&#8221; Specifically, can I meet girls on here? He was like, &#8220;Well, technically, yeah.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Cool. That&#8217;s all I need to know. Create a profile for me.&#8221; [inaudible 00:24:45]. I had my own page. I remember my username was Shadow 1989. I had my own page and I just started tinkering with it, because I saw that he was always tinkering with it. I was like, well, what can you do? The page gave you limited HTML on coding capabilities, honestly. It was like you can change the background color, you can put an image in the background, you can position the image in the background, you can change the color of the text. You could change some of the effects over the text. Maybe you hover over the text and instead of it going purple, maybe it glitters or something. It was just these little capabilities that were really cool. Me and my friends were literally Googling stuff to find out how to change the code on certain things.</p>
<p>It just opened up a can of worms. I was on it all the time, customizing my page all the time, thinking of really interesting themes for my page. Oh, I want to do a Final Fantasy theme. I think at the time, Final Fantasy 10 was a thing. I had the photo of Titus and Uno. It&#8217;s from the game for people who played the game. There&#8217;s a scene in the game that&#8217;s really beautiful where they&#8217;re in this water and there&#8217;s these fireflies around. I had that in my background. The hover state for my links was this sparkling glitter that looks like it was from the scene. It was beautiful. [inaudible 00:26:03].</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know what design was at the time, but I was just doing that all the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean I think what you&#8217;re mentioning here is something that&#8217;s really important for, I think, anyone that&#8217;s looking to learn something new. Use the gateway of something that you enjoy to be that sort of fuel that pushes you into it. Do you think you would&#8217;ve gotten into this if you couldn&#8217;t meet girls or &#8230; You know what I mean? Because you knew that because that was an avenue for you, you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay. I think I want to learn more about this,&#8221; because you had a vision of what you wanted to do because of what you were interested in.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. It was a hundred percent that. See, that&#8217;s the funny part. I had years of using that software, using that website. I got all my friends hooked on it. We were all 13 at the time. I think one or two of my friends maybe a year older. We all got hooked on Xanga. We&#8217;re all using it for the same reasons, pick up girls. We also all were just really getting into the design aspect of it, but not knowing that it was something that people do professionally.</p>
<p>The way I found out graphic design was an option was in my junior year of high school. Yeah. My junior year of high school, I had a computer class. I transferred schools. I went back to Brooklyn. I had a computer class, I remember with a teacher, Mr. Mastell. That was his name, Mr. Mastell. Mastell. I remember his name. Really nice guy. I remember seeing him years later and I told him this story. He laughed. He was like, &#8220;I forgot all about that.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I know you&#8217;ve had a hundred students.&#8221; The computer class, we had to build a webpage. We had to build a website, but mainly you could just build a webpage. He was like, &#8220;Just build a page.&#8221; In that class, as we were on computers all day, I was bouncing between building my page and then playing with my Xanga. Why not. I&#8217;m a kid so this is what I do.</p>
<p>Then one day the teacher was coming over to my desk and I was on Xanga and I saw he got close, because remember when he used to have those big computer monitors, it wasn&#8217;t like [inaudible 00:27:54]. Well, you could see somebody walking up to you. It was the big one. I didn&#8217;t see him until his shadow basically came over the top of my screen. I was like, &#8220;Oh snap. Let me minimize this window.&#8221; Being an old computer, the window froze and it got stuck. My Xanga page was just stuck on the page. I&#8217;m just sitting there clicking so hard on the minimize button. It just wouldn&#8217;t minimize. He came by and he was like, &#8220;How&#8217;s your project going?&#8221;</p>
<p>He sees my screen. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;It&#8217;s going.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;Hold on. What&#8217;s that?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. This thing [inaudible 00:28:29].&#8221; Yeah. I thought I was in trouble. He was like, &#8220;No, that&#8217;s actually really cool.&#8221; I remember having this tornado marquee with typography coming out of and stuff. He was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s really cool. Wow, that&#8217;s really cool. How did you even learn how to do that? I didn&#8217;t teach you guys anything like that. This is cool.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;Wow. You should maybe be a designer or something.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Hold up. I was just using this to pick up women. You&#8217;re telling me I could have a career choice here?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was like, &#8220;Yeah. There are people who do graphic design, professionally, whether it&#8217;s websites or other stuff.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I had no idea. I&#8217;m so happy you said that. I didn&#8217;t even know what I wanted to do in college. I just knew I wanted to go to college.&#8221; That was kind of how it started.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of college, you went to City Tech. For folks that have been listening to the show for a while, we&#8217;ve had a few professors on the show; Douglas Davis, Danny Shaw, we&#8217;ve had a couple of City Tech alums too. Tell me what your time was there.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
That&#8217;s my professor, Douglas Davis. I had him as a professor.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, really?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yep. Danny Shaw, that&#8217;s one of my good friends.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
City Tech was great, man. I loved City Tech. It was a really nice experience to get around other people who were trying to do something in field. Remember, I&#8217;m just a kid who&#8217;s just playing around on the website. I don&#8217;t know design principles, I don&#8217;t truly know color palettes. I know how to use color. I know what looks good to the eye. I wasn&#8217;t that kid who was like, well, you&#8217;re supposed to use these particular shades of red to go with this particular shade of blue. I didn&#8217;t understand or know any of that, because I never was traditionally taught any of it. That&#8217;s why college was really great, because I got to really see the basics of how to do some of these thing, even just basic drawing. I still don&#8217;t draw much to this day, but just having life drawing classes and things like that was really fun. You see different people skill levels. You see people who&#8217;ve clearly been doing it for way longer than you, or you see people who are also learning as well.</p>
<p>Meeting these people, becoming friends with them and become friends with the professors. City Tech was honestly one of the best parts of my life. I met a lot of really cool people that I&#8217;m friends with to this day. It was great. It was a great experience, man, from beginning to end. My skillset was terrible walking in, considering I only knew how to play around on our websites. To what it was post, after leaving City Tech, like drastic change, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d imagine it was probably pretty cool also having a black male professor, someone that&#8217;s teaching you how to do all this stuff too.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. Doug was cool. His class was hard. As somebody who didn&#8217;t have any traditional training in the field or any understanding of what a concept for a campaign was, it was very hard for me at first. I remember telling him this. He was always just like, &#8220;Oh, I know it&#8217;s hard. I make it hard because this is what it&#8217;s going to be like.&#8221; His class isn&#8217;t hard for the sake of being hard. It&#8217;s hard because he&#8217;s being realistic about how projects are done and the actual agency space. I was like, &#8220;Okay, cool.&#8221; It was super challenging. I didn&#8217;t know how to come up with a concept fora campaign. I didn&#8217;t know what a campaign truly was. I knew commercials I saw that were really cool. I remember, I used to always tell people this joke, but I&#8217;m clearly when I saw the Old Spice commercial, which was out at the time with the dude &#8230; What was his name Isaiah Washington?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, Isaiah Mustafa, I think.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah, something like that. The guy riding on the horse?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:31:42] to the camera. That came out when I was in college. I remember seeing that commercial going, I don&#8217;t know how they got to a black guy on a horse, but I know it couldn&#8217;t have just been somebody saw Old Spice black guy on a horse. There had to be thinking again from A to that. There had to be thinking. He was like, &#8220;Yeah, for sure.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what any of that thinking is, but I would love to learn.&#8221; His class was great for that. His class was really, really good for that. Yeah. Seeing a black professor was awesome. In a lot of ways he was inspirational, because I didn&#8217;t have many black professors prior to that, that I can recall, let alone that was still actively working in the field and still was keeping up with where things are moving. He&#8217;s a very innovative professor for not just City Tech, but just in general.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What was your early career after you graduated? You obviously had this interest that you had sort of cultivated through getting on Xanga and meeting girls and stuff. Then you&#8217;re also strengthening it through college. Once you got out there, what was your early career?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
It was interesting, man. I didn&#8217;t know where to go. There&#8217;s no clear handbook for what you do once college is done. You know you want to get a job in your field, but for somebody like me, like I said, I didn&#8217;t know what was possible. I had a better idea of what was possible after all of this college stuff, whether [inaudible 00:33:02] internships or talking to professors or being fortunate to volunteer for some award shows to actually see what those were like. I still didn&#8217;t really know where I wanted to go. When I graduated, I didn&#8217;t get a job right away, but I was applying places. I was talking to recruiters and all that. I still do that to this day, honestly. Talk to recruiters, email recruiters, hop on the phone with recruiters and talk to them. I always kind of try to make a habit of that because you never know.</p>
<p>Actually, Doug used to always say this. He was like, &#8220;It&#8217;s best to talk to people when you don&#8217;t need them.&#8221; [inaudible 00:33:35] for a favor. I was like, he&#8217;s a hundred percent right because I hate when people hit me up only to ask for favors. I try to it make a habit. No, I make it a habit to be a good person in general, not just when I need something, to everybody, whether you can give me something or not. I was the same way with recruiters. Yes, I needed their help when I was coming out of college, but I was also just trying to build a relationship. It actually worked out for me. That was how I got my first job.</p>
<p>I got my first job three months after I graduated college. It was at VaynerMedia. I got that job because of a recruiter that I spoke to probably about two or three times a week. He was always so proactive about trying to help me get something, it&#8217;s my homeboy Jakes. We still talk from time to time. He was so proactive about helping me get a gig because he was like, &#8220;Your work is clearly good. Obviously you&#8217;re a junior and [inaudible 00:34:22] stuff you have to learn.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I know. For sure. I&#8217;m willing to learn it.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to keep trying to place you.&#8221; He kept trying to place me.</p>
<p>Then eventually the intermediate reached out to me through email for an interview. I went to the interview, I got the job. I was like, &#8220;Wow. This is awesome. I got first job.&#8221; Ironically, the first day I ran into him in the bathroom. He was like, &#8220;Hey.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Hey, man. What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; He was like, &#8220;Hey. How&#8217;s everything going?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Good.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;How&#8217;d you think you got the job interview?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. They just randomly reached out.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It was me, dude. I recommended you.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Oh, thank you, man. I didn&#8217;t know. You didn&#8217;t tell me that. I knew you left your recruiter job, but I didn&#8217;t even put two and two together that you came here and then they reached out to me.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s so cool. I appreciate that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I remember when I reached out to you. I think this was almost 10 years ago, almost a decade ago. Good Lord. You were working at VaynerMedia at the time. For people that know Vayner Media was founded by Gary Vaynerchuk, who &#8230; I haven&#8217;t really followed him lately, but I know back during that time, right before he started VaynerMedia, was really well known in the social media entrepreneurship space. What did you learn from that experience working there?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I will say a lot. Honestly, I also want to preference, I didn&#8217;t know who he was when I went to the job interview.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That probably is a good thing, to be completely honest with you.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I guess. Well, I&#8217;m sure people do, but I didn&#8217;t go there like, &#8220;Hey, I really want to work with Gary.&#8221; In my mind I&#8217;m like, I just got out of college. It&#8217;s an interesting job where I could do social media work. I&#8217;ve always been told that digital is going to be the future anyway, in a lot of ways. This is a cool opportunity. I remember the woman who interviewed me, she said, &#8220;Hey. Do you know anything about Gary?&#8221; She was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to hold it against you. I just want to know.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about this man. I just found out who he was when I found out about this agency and that&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;m cool with that.&#8221; That&#8217;s not to say that he&#8217;s bad or anything, it&#8217;s just I didn&#8217;t know who he was prior to getting the job.</p>
<p>Sorry, what was the question?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What did you learn from that experience working there? Did it teach you anything? Any sort of lessons that you still carry with you to this day?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. I worked with some really awesome art directors there who were, I would say, patient with me. I tell everybody, you need patience with people. Regardless of job level and title, you need patience with people. It was my first gig. I&#8217;d done social media work a little bit prior to that, but honestly not a lot. I did intern at Buddy Media when I was around at one point I interned at a F Sharp building user experiences for social, but not creating daily social content.</p>
<p>Working at Vayner was a bit of a change, because at that time we were pumping out social content for so many different brands daily. It was a very go-getter energy. I kind of really liked that. I didn&#8217;t right away appreciate it. I was kind of like, &#8220;What&#8217;s going on here? What the hell&#8217;s going on here?&#8221; Because everyone was kind of bouncing around doing different things. I would see the art director. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;I&#8217;m heading to a shoot.&#8221; Then I see him five minutes later, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;I&#8217;m designing something for something.&#8221; Then I see him a few minutes after that. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;I&#8217;m overseeing this other person who&#8217;s working on a different brand, but I&#8217;m in charge of what happens on that brand.&#8221; I was just like, &#8220;Wow, this guy&#8217;s doing a lot in two hours. There&#8217;s a lot happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was just the energy there at the time. Even as a designer, they gave me a good amount of responsibility. I was in charge of my daily creative needs where it was a certain amount of content for maybe a brand I was on. I was on Hasbro. I touched a lot of brands when I was there, probably some of the most in my life. It&#8217;d be like maybe designing maybe four to five pieces of content a day. I remember this daily content, they&#8217;d do daily content at the time for brands. My day would be designing maybe four or five things. Then I may be leading a small photo shoot for one of the products for one of our brands. Then maybe I&#8217;m also helping out somebody else for another brand because maybe someone just needs a body to do something.</p>
<p>Hey, guys. We&#8217;re trying to record a Vine, when that was a thing. Need someone to be here. We need someone to be here. Who&#8217;s free to help? Then it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Kendell, are you free for 10 minutes?&#8221; Sure, I&#8217;m free you. Then I&#8217;ll go in and help out with a Vine, whether we&#8217;re doing something for Chips A-Hoy or doing something for a random brand. I was like, &#8220;Cool.&#8221; It was just a really good go-getter energy. I really appreciated and that it. It was really cool. It was a lot to learn there from everything that was just happening.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now after VaynerMedia, a couple of years afterwards, you ended up working at another agency G and you were their lead designer. Was that kind of a big shift from that sort of fast hustle culture that it sounds like VaynerMedia had to, what was going on at GLOW?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
A little bit. Yeah. A little bit. I felt like with Vayner, often days you didn&#8217;t know what you were going to get. I knew it was going to be designing a few things, but you sometimes didn&#8217;t know if you were going to be leading the shoot or volunteering with different things. There was a lot going on. It was really fun. I loved being a part of that. That was awesome. GLOW is drastically different and drastically smaller. It was way smaller. When I first got to Vayner, I think two weeks in and they were moving to a new office, because they needed more space. I think we might&#8217;ve been over 300 employees at that point. It was a lot of people there. So much so I started losing track of names of so many people. If you weren&#8217;t on my direct team, or I didn&#8217;t work with you in the past, it was hard to keep track of names. There was so many people.</p>
<p>GLOW was a lot smaller. GLOW was maybe 20 to 30 people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:39:41] the creative team. I meant the company was 20 to 30 people. It was a lot smaller. The work I did there was some of my favorite work I&#8217;ve done in my career. It was just a good time. It was a different experience. Whereas, Vayner was a lot of consumable goods, whether it was like Hasbro or Chips Ahoy and things of that nature. With GLOW, it was a lot of entertainment focused. It was TV shows, which was drastically different. I worked on social for a lot of TV. It was still social based, so that aspect I still hold down to. It was a lot of TV shows, whether it was shows for HBO, Showtime, Star, Sci-Fi Channel. It was a lot of TV shows. There was a little bit of a learning curve in what you can say for a TV show, what you can do or what you can&#8217;t do. It was interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting. I&#8217;m trying to place the year. I&#8217;m guessing this is like 2010s maybe, mid to early 2010s?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. Roughly about maybe five years ago almost. Probably mid to late.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Yeah. I think about how television and social, because you mentioned that, I remember when Scandal came out on ABC. I had been on Twitter. I had been on Twitter since 2007. I don&#8217;t think the concept of live tweeting a television show was really a thing back then until that show. It really popped off. Now you go on Twitter and you can&#8217;t escape every web series, movie, television show has some kind of hashtag or social campaign behind it or something. I feel like that was really sort of the golden age of that stuff popping off.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. I was actually just looking at the year. It was like 2015 till 2018 I was there. Yeah. Definitely during that time where live tweeting was becoming a big thing and brands were starting to care, TV shows in particular, but all brands. Really TV shows are starting to care a lot more about how they appeared on social, how did they engage with the audience? Were they doing good stuff prior to the episode airing and then during the episode earring and then after the episode airing. It was really cool, man. It was a great time. Some of the stuff I got to touch and work on, some of the most fun work I&#8217;ve done in my career, honestly. It was just a really interesting time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, after GLOW you worked for even more agencies. You worked for 360i, you worked for Collected, you worked for Ghost Note. We actually had their art director on last year, Rebecca Brooker. What draws you to working for agencies?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
They keep hiring me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look, that&#8217;s real. Hey, I get it.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
It&#8217;s really that. They kept hiring me. From Vayner, like I said, I had no predetermined career path. I was like, &#8220;Well, this agency works for me, let me try another one.&#8221; It just kind of kept snowballing that way. It&#8217;s been good. It&#8217;s been interesting. It&#8217;s been good. I&#8217;ve learned different things from every agency. They just kept hiring me and I kept getting really interesting opportunities. I was like, why not? I&#8217;ll keep rolling with this. It just kept working.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What qualities do you think agencies look for in a designer? Is it just about having a portfolio of good work or is it something else?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s a little bit of both. I&#8217;ve heard people say different things, but I think it&#8217;s a little bit of both. I think on one hand they see a portfolio that people look for potential. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh. How does this person think? What does this person think about?&#8221; Who they are based on their work. Then I also think they&#8217;re looking for a fit. Oftentimes, a lot of agencies, at least a lot of ones I&#8217;ve experienced, I can&#8217;t speak for all agencies. A lot of agencies I&#8217;ve experienced, they usually hire because they were trying to fill a specific need. It was like we got new business coming in. They probably have a specific type of business coming in, so they&#8217;re looking for a specific type of person to fit that brand that they&#8217;re bringing in. Whether it&#8217;s a cooking brand or something, like looking for somebody that probably fits that niche.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s just general and they&#8217;re just like, we just need bodies in here. We need people in here who are going to fit the mold and fit the team. I think oftentimes people are looking for a specific kind of fit. Yeah. It is your work. I think also it&#8217;s a part of who you are. That perspective of who you are can be very helpful in your day-to-day life.</p>

I&#8217;ve always kind of just been curious about that because I mean, I&#8217;m speaking partially from personal experience, but also from what I&#8217;ve heard from other designers. For those that may have worked on more of the UX side or product or tech, what I&#8217;ve heard and experienced personally is that it&#8217;s hard to break agency because agencies are looking for &#8220;agency experience&#8221;. Have you heard that before?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I have heard that. I have heard that, but I can&#8217;t say definitively they are, because I think it&#8217;s mixed. Here&#8217;s the thing. I think a lot of people like agency experience because agency &#8230; It&#8217;s just my opinion, I&#8217;m not speaking for everyone. I think a lot of people look for agency experience because agency experience tells them that you know how to deal with a lot of crazy things happening at once. I think there is an underlying but known secret that a lot of agencies are not super organized. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s that they&#8217;re unorganized, because they just decided we&#8217;re going to not be organized. There&#8217;re things that happened. There&#8217;s a lot of moving pieces in our field from account, strategy, creative. There&#8217;s a lot of moving pieces. It&#8217;s easy for something to slip through the cracks. Some people can&#8217;t function when things slip through the cracks. They&#8217;ll just be honest. There are different personalities. I have friends who don&#8217;t want to do agencies at all. I understand, because I work in agencies so I can understand why that wouldn&#8217;t be for everyone.</p>
<p>As an employer I can see why employers would see that as exciting because it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Wow. This person knows how to kind of function in a little bit of chaos. They may be good here.&#8221; Some people don&#8217;t know how to function in that little bit of chaos. Depending on the type of jobs or internships you&#8217;ve had prior, you may not have dealt with this kind of chaos. You may have been in-house, probably had one brand. That one brand that&#8217;s probably not super dependent where you selling something every day. You just kind of, not coasted, you ain&#8217;t coast, but your workload was different.</p>
<p>Agency, you could be on three brands doing campaigns for three different projects that are completely different. They have the deadline of four days between the three, they just slightly staggered. That&#8217;s not what it should be like, but that is what it&#8217;s like sometimes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You know what? Thank you for saying that. I have asked that question to so many people and the response I get is almost like they&#8217;re ruining the first rule of fight club. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, well I can&#8217;t tell. If you don&#8217;t have it, you don&#8217;t have it.&#8221; Even my personal experiences with trying to work at agencies, they&#8217;ll look at my work and be like, &#8220;Oh. Well, you&#8217;ve done all this tech stuff. We&#8217;re really looking for agency experience.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t get agency experience if I don&#8217;t work at an agency.&#8221; I&#8217;m glad that you mentioned what that distinction is.</p>
<p>I get. It makes sense mean. From the other folks that I&#8217;ve had on the show that have worked at agencies, you do have the opportunity to work on lots of different projects. It can be kind of fast-paced, a little frenetic. Again, if you&#8217;re in-house and you&#8217;re only working on a brand or part of a brand or part of a product, it&#8217;s just different. It&#8217;s just a different type of workflow.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s very different. I often think when I&#8217;m on Twitter, I&#8217;m on Twitter quite often, but I&#8217;ll see someone, unfortunately when Twitter did all those layoffs, a lot of different people talked about different aspects of their job. Some of those people have very specific needs, I mean very specific rules. Some people were like, &#8220;I work just on bookmarks.&#8221; I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Only bookmarks? That&#8217;s all you did for Twitter? You work specifically on bookmarks?&#8221; That&#8217;s really interesting. I wonder what their day to day is. That&#8217;s tech, so it could be very &#8230; That&#8217;s not to say their life&#8217;s cushy, but if you&#8217;re working on just one thing &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a little cushy. A little cushy.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I would hope your job is some level of cushy from time to time. Every day can just be grinding nonstop. I would [inaudible 00:48:00]. You go, &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s cool. You get to work on this one thing and really refine this one thing.&#8221; There is a lot of pros to that, but some people could look at that as a con, because like I said, similarly to the creative director, art director thing, it seems like people are kind of smushing these roles together. They want somebody to be a bit of a Swiss Army knife.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s so tricky because in the tech world, at least what I&#8217;ve found, there&#8217;s just so much sort of needling down to specialty. They want specialists. They want a UX person that&#8217;s done work on a healthcare brand. They&#8217;re looking for a specific person that fits in that specific niche. It could be a person that&#8217;s done UX as more of a generalist, but if they haven&#8217;t done it for this brand or this type of company, then they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh. We&#8217;re looking for this one thing.&#8221; I&#8217;m kind of grossly generalizing this, so please, people don&#8217;t write to me and be angry. I find tech really wants specialists in very particular, finite roles and places, because even that can differ for company. Whereas, advertising is kind of more about, like you said, being a Swiss Army knife, someone that can do a lot of things at a particular level across a number of different brands.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s not bad. I don&#8217;t think being a specialist is bad. I don&#8217;t think being a general is bad. When somebody&#8217;s hiring, they could ask for whatever they want.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s wild man. It&#8217;s wild.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
It is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to somebody listening to this episode and they want to follow your example in being an art director. What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Network. I always tell people this for any field, but network heavily. Network. That means with people in your field and out of your field. It is good to know people because the more you get to know people, you get a better idea of not only what they&#8217;re capable of, but maybe what you&#8217;re capable of, which you didn&#8217;t even consider. Right now we&#8217;re talking about design and the design field, but there are a million other ways to be a part of the design field and be a part of this industry in one way or another, whether it&#8217;s a strategist or an account person. There&#8217;s a lot of other ways that can still utilize design thinking. You could have a good design taste, but be a project manager. You don&#8217;t necessarily have to be the person that&#8217;s in Photoshop. You could have a good design taste and be an account person. That doesn&#8217;t mean that you are a designer, but that means that you can at least do a good job backing up the designs that are being presented to clients. There are a lot of ways into this industry.</p>
<p>I think you need to talk to people and network with people to kind of figure that out. Hell, go on LinkedIn, man. Go on LinkedIn. If you ain&#8217;t got one, create on LinkedIn. Message absolute strangers. I think of it as back in the AOL days when people were just online like, &#8220;A/S/L, where you at,&#8221; but on LinkedIn. You type in project manager, if that&#8217;s what you want to be. You could literally type in project manager or senior project manager. A bunch of people will come up. You can narrow it down to your state, your country, whatever you prefer. I would just recommend you message somebody.</p>
<p>Hey, man. I&#8217;m a new kid who&#8217;s interested in project management. I see that you have a title that does this. Can I ask you about it? I&#8217;ve done some research on project management, but do you have a few minutes to tell me what you do or type? Why not? Right? You may not get response, but LinkedIn has unlimited people. You can do this all day. You can do it for five people a day. Somebody might respond. I&#8217;m saying that because I did that. I did that at times when it came to finding a job. I got an interview at ESPN a few years ago because of me doing that.</p>
<p>I was going online, looking up other things. I was like, hey, I&#8217;m interested in sports. Let me see what people were doing in this. I&#8217;m looking for recruiters. Recruiters, lot of times they&#8217;ve got the 411, they know what&#8217;s going on, they know what&#8217;s happening. I was just online looking up recruiters. All right, man, design recruiters or recruiter or whatever, narrow it down. Okay, cool. I&#8217;m not familiar with this recruiting agency. Let me reach out to one person that works there and tell them who I am and maybe they can at least give me on their list of creatives and then down the line they can push something out from me. I started those conversations. Somewhere along the way, somebody at ESPN got pushed my way. I was like, &#8220;Oh. That&#8217;s great.&#8221; I had an interview at ESPN. I would&#8217;ve never gotten one otherwise, probably just existing out here. People do and just get reached out to, but you can also play a little bit of active role. That&#8217;s networking.</p>
<p>I would highly recommend your network online, of course. I would also recommend you network work in person, the people you sit next to in class. Doug used to always say this to us, Professor Doug, our professor, as I always call him. He always said this. You&#8217;d be like, &#8220;The people who sit next to you in class, to your left, to your right front and the back, these might be the same people you end up working with. You never know which one of them end up giving you a job or you end up giving them a job or they end up recommending you for something or you end up recommending them for something.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have friends who finished in City Tech like I did, who did not get into design, who still reach out to me for design related jobs doing other things. They just reach out to me. They just like, &#8220;Oh, Kendell, I was thinking about you because this gig popped up.&#8221; Does that always mean I want it? No, but that opportunity is there from me just being a good person and being their friend for so long that they&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Oh. I thought of Kendell when I saw this.&#8221; There were 40 other people in his classroom, when we were teens learning this stuff, and he was like, &#8220;I thought Kendell when this position popped up. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m reaching out. What&#8217;s going on, Kendell? Network.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Network. I agree with that a hundred percent. That&#8217;s a really great thing I think people should all try to cultivate. Like you said, you never know when you&#8217;re going to need it. Don&#8217;t just do it when you&#8217;re in need. Continually network even when you&#8217;ve got the job, when you&#8217;re in the job, but just let people know that you&#8217;re always out there.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s how I met Danny. I met Danny through networking.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, was he not teaching at City Tech when you were there?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
No. When I was there, Danny had already graduated. He&#8217;s a few years older than me, so he had already graduated. I think I might have heard his name in passing because Professor Davis mentioned him a few times. At City Tech, I think they still have it, we had a design club. In the design club we would do this event called Meet the Pros. We&#8217;d bring the professionals to talk to the students. We&#8217;d also do an alumni version where we&#8217;d bring back people who graduated from City Tech who are working in the field. Danny was one of the people who they brought in.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t the president at the time, so I was just a part of the club. I wasn&#8217;t the one actively talking to them that had those conversations. Well, after the event was over, I was like, &#8220;Hey, man. You seem really cool. I appreciate everything you said in the talk, man. You want to stay in touch?&#8221; Then we just stayed in touch. Now we&#8217;re good friends. We are very good friends.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, aside from work, you are a podcaster. You co-host a show called TerrorNova. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
That&#8217;s my baby. TerrorNova, it&#8217;s a horror podcast as it says in the title. It&#8217;s TerrorNova Horror Podcast. Me and actually one of my fellow alumni from City Tech, Jackie, Jacqueline Martinez, we both were fans of horror. We&#8217;re both really big fans of horror.I grew up watching horror. She grew up watching horror. We&#8217;re both massive fans of horror. Even when we were City Tech, whenever I needed somebody to talk about horror movies, it was usually her. Now we&#8217;ve got Get Out and all that, so a lot more people get into horror. Before that, a lot of people weren&#8217;t as broley into horror. Me and her would always chop it up and watch horror movies, whether it was digitally sending each other the link or just talking generally about horror movies.</p>
<p>I was like, &#8220;Man, she&#8217;s always my go-to for this. This is great.&#8221; Then during the pandemic, we had that, I guess you could say two years or a year where everybody going through different stuff, everybody&#8217;s figuring stuff out. We had a little bit of that slowdown when it was kind of like you just stay in the house. Then after that two weeks slowdown, we still had a bit of a slowdown. I was like, &#8220;Man, I kind want to do something. I want to do something that&#8217;s fairly positive, but also enjoyable and doesn&#8217;t really feel like a job, but it is something I could have fun with.&#8221;</p>
<p>I listened to a lot of podcasts. I was like I guess I could do a podcast, but what would I want to do it about? I didn&#8217;t want to do it generally. I wanted to be very specific about what I talk about. Horror just popped in my head. I was like, sure, why not? I love horror. Let me see if there are any podcasts out there to talk about horror. There were a few and I was like, okay, cool. There&#8217;s a little bit of market for this. Let me have some fun with this. I want to do it with a co-host, I don&#8217;t want to do it by myself. Then Jackie came to mind. I reached out to her. I was like, &#8220;Hey. I have an idea for a horror podcast. Do you want to do it? If you don&#8217;t do it, I probably won&#8217;t do it.&#8221; Then she was like, &#8220;Okay. I&#8217;ll think about it. You know what? Yeah, sure. Why not? Let&#8217;s do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then we kind of jumped in. We have a horror podcast. We talk about movies, we talk about TV shows, we do topics. We started doing kind of more autobiography type episodes where we highlight your figure and talk about their relationship with horror. Yeah. We do everything horror. It&#8217;s really, really fun, man. To go back to that whole community thing, there&#8217;s a really big horror community everywhere, honestly, but definitely on Instagram as well. We found some really interesting people on there. We&#8217;ve brought people on as guests from all different walks of life. I had people from London who came on, people from Texas, people from just all over. They were just like, &#8220;Hey, man. If you ever in town, let us know we&#8217;ll hang.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just kind of an extension of the stuff I was doing when I was in high school with Xanga, but now I&#8217;m doing it not to pick out women, but to meet new people who also like horror. It came full circle.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What has podcasting as a medium taught you? Has it taught you anything that you kind of take back with you in your work as an art director?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
It taught me to be clearer with my thoughts. Not even just as art director, as a human being, it is sometimes hard to clarify your thoughts. You have so many of them going through your head, especially at once, even before someone probably even asks you a question. Just someone can say a statement, you have a hundred things running through your head. I&#8217;m really big on trying to be clear about what I&#8217;m saying when I say something. That is probably one of the biggest things I try to be hard on myself about. When I say something, do I mean what I&#8217;m saying and is it clear what I mean what I&#8217;m saying? I don&#8217;t want to misinterpret or mislead someone. I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s in part because of a lot of the fake news stuff going around in the world and fake thoughts and fake opinions that people have about stuff. I try to be very clear on my thoughts.</p>
<p>The podcast has been a huge help for that, because we end up talking about horror movies. We always say the podcast is for people who horror movies and even for people who don&#8217;t horror movies, whether it&#8217;s you don&#8217;t want to watch them or you&#8217;re too scared to watch them. The podcast is for those people as well because it&#8217;s not that we spend a bunch of time talking about the guts and people being ripped in half. We spend time talking about how the characters feel and how the characters are relatable and how there&#8217;s a scene and the themes and the socioeconomical version of this stuff, the race. All of these things that make these movies, these movies that people go, &#8220;Oh. That&#8217;s [inaudible 00:58:47] culture.&#8221; No, all of these things were written and baked into the film for a reason. We&#8217;re not making this up.</p>
<p>We spend time talking about all of that. It forces me to get clearer about what I&#8217;m saying because I&#8217;d never want to say something and people would just go, &#8220;That person&#8217;s being crazy,&#8221; or, &#8220;That person&#8217;s making stuff up,&#8221; or, &#8220;That person&#8217;s being hateful,&#8221; or, &#8220;That person&#8217;s being ridiculous.&#8221; I try to be very clear in my thoughts and it translates to my job a lot because often as the art director, even the designer, you have to just explain your decision making. Even if you wow somebody with a design, the person still probably wants to know the logic behind it because [inaudible 00:59:25] the design is nice, but if it&#8217;s not on brief and it&#8217;s not hitting the goal, not hitting the mark, it just looks good and that doesn&#8217;t help anymore.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is your favorite contemporary horror movie?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Of the past few years? Something recent?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;d even go say the past decade or so.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Actually, no, I&#8217;m going to just go with something fairly recent that I really enjoyed. There was this horror movie that came out recently called Pearl that I thought was really the great. I saw it in theaters three times.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, I think I saw a trailer to that movie. I think the setting is in the twenties or something. Is this the movie I&#8217;m thinking of? I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Kind of, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think the lady that&#8217;s in it is Mia Goth, I think.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah, Mia Goth. It&#8217;s set around I think a time of World War II.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. She&#8217;s like an actress or something, right? You can tell I watch a lot of movies.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
[inaudible 01:00:20] you only saw the trailer then I can understand why you wouldn&#8217;t know what it is. She&#8217;s a farm girl in a lot of ways. Her family grew up on a farm. They&#8217;re German, so they in some ways fled from Germany during a war and all of that stuff. She just wants to get off this farm. She has aspirations of being a star, whether it&#8217;s a singer or actor, she has these aspirations. She grew up on a farm. The way her life is going there&#8217;s probably no chance that she&#8217;ll see those aspirations come to life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
The thing that makes it interesting is the style of it. I tell people it&#8217;s The Wizard of Oz of it was a slasher because it&#8217;s not styled like a dark and grim horror movie. It&#8217;s styled very beautifully with bright colors and mostly during the day, similarly to Midsommar. It&#8217;s styled really interesting, which kind of in some ways is a reflection of how the main character sees the world. I could talk about it all day. It&#8217;s very interesting stylistically how they did the movie versus what the messages of the movie are and the themes that are super relatable about identity and self and all that stuff. It&#8217;s like it&#8217;s a really, really well done movie.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. It&#8217;s clear that horror is certainly a big thing for you. It&#8217;s something that you really love. What are some other influences for your creative work? Is it any people in particular? Any things in particular?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I wouldn&#8217;t say a specific person or anything like that. Just like when I was a kid, I&#8217;m a fan of stuff. I love science fiction. I love action movies. I love every genre of everything. I try to take pieces of that with everything I do. Just how I tell stories, how stories are told, how I design. I try to take all of these things into account when I&#8217;m working. I wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;m inspired by any specific visual style or specific person. Honestly, life just inspires me. Life inspires me. The people I get to have conversations with, the people I meet, the characters I see in movies and TV shows, all of those things inspire me. I&#8217;m not inspired by any specific graphic designer. I&#8217;m sure there are better designers than me in the world, but I&#8217;m not heavily inspired by super great graphic designers. I&#8217;m inspired by super great storytellers and super great stories that I&#8217;ve seen unfold that feel very human, they feel very grounded.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
At this stage of your career, do you feel creatively satisfied?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Surprisingly, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Why surprisingly?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I say surprisingly because, man, you would expect the corporate world to kind of beat you down. There&#8217;s always that tragic story of the artists of they got in it because they love it and then somewhere along the way money got involved and they hate it. I could see that very easily happening in this field as well to people. Trying to fill a lot of bellies, [inaudible 01:03:03] task of a designer or honestly even any world you have in this field. You&#8217;re trying to fill a lot of stomachs, man. Whether it&#8217;s account people, the clients, strategy, yourself, creative. There&#8217;s a lot of people that have go to get fed before an idea goes out into the world and actually exist.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of battles that people have to fight for their work to be seen by the general public. You would think with all of those challenges in front of you that some people end up hating this, but I actually surprisingly still enjoy it. I do enjoy these conversations. I enjoy the people that I work with. I enjoy the people that I&#8217;ve worked with in the past, whether we had disagreements or not, because I&#8217;ve learned something from them, whether it was about myself or about them. Honestly, if it was just about myself, how do I handle a situation? How do I handle moments where things feel like it&#8217;s too tough and they feel impossible? How do I handle moments where I spent a lot of time on a design and then someone goes, &#8220;Let&#8217;s just change the whole thing.&#8221; How do I handle that? How do I bounce back from that?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been satisfying, man, how I&#8217;m bouncing back for these things and how I learn from them and how I get better from project to project. It&#8217;s been very satisfying.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, when I had you back on the show again, this was 10 years ago, I asked you where do you see yourself in the next five years? You had mentioned that you wanted to create a product that you can build a company around. Granted, since then you&#8217;ve worked for agencies and such, but at this stage of where you&#8217;re at now with your career, where do you see yourself in the next five years?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Oh, man. That&#8217;s a good question. I forgot I told you about that. That was back when I was working on this bike app idea that I had. I still have that somewhere. I think in the next five years, man, I feel like I still see myself doing this. Maybe my title will probably go up, but I still see myself doing design or possibly even still pharma, but I&#8217;ll see. I still see myself just enjoying this field, man. I&#8217;m not tied to any specific industry in terms of which one I [inaudible 01:05:01] or not. I just really enjoy what I do. It&#8217;s a good time. You get to meet interesting people and they get to tell you interesting stories. You get to live a pretty interesting life when you make it in there.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not flying to Dubai every week or something for photo shoots or anything like that. I&#8217;ve done very little of that in my career. The type of people you meet and the type of stories you get to hear people tell and that you get to tell yourself, from the projects you work on, it&#8217;s really interesting and priceless, man. I really enjoy it. I kind of just see myself still going down this road of in some ways where the winds takes me, but in some other ways, I&#8217;m just enjoying this space.</p>

You could add me on LinkedIn. You can look me up, my name, Kendell Burton. It should be in a show notes and everything. You could add me on LinkedIn, feel free too. You could follow me on Twitter if you like. Honestly, on Twitter, I don&#8217;t really talk about the field much. I just kind of enjoy the craziness of Twitter. Enjoy the memes and the wild stuff people say on Twitter. That&#8217;s pretty much what I&#8217;m doing on there. I guess if you want to laugh along with me about the crazy stuff that happens on Twitter, then feel free to follow me there. My name is theKendellB.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my name on most things. You can find me on Instagram, same way, where you can follow my podcast, which is exclusively on Instagram. I just don&#8217;t want it bounced between a million platforms. The podcast TerrorNova is only on Instagram, but you can listen everywhere. It&#8217;s on Spotify and all that stuff. Yeah. So LinkedIn or Twitter, or Instagram. Those three places, best places to find me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Kendell Burton, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you for, I think, honestly for just showcasing how much your enthusiasm and passion for what you do. To me, it just sort of permeates through everything you talk about, your life story, your story of working through the industry and things like that. I can tell that you really have this innate, deep, burning passion for it. That&#8217;s something that I think we all need to kind of work to try to cultivate, find what it is that sort of lights your pilot light.</p>
<p>I get the sense from you that really this is something that you&#8217;re super passionate about. I&#8217;m excited to see what you end up doing next, man. Thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. I appreciate it, man. I appreciate the invitation to come here and talk to you again, man. It&#8217;s a pleasure. It&#8217;s great. For everyone listening, man, just find what you like, man. Find what you like and just strap yourself to it, the best way you can, because you&#8217;ve got to enjoy life.</p>

<p>If you want to be more authentic in your work and life, then this week&#8217;s episode is especially for you. I sat down with Kirk Visola, creative director extraordinaire, and the founder of <a href="https://www.mindthefont.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Mind the Font</a>, a full-service branding and packaging design agency.</p>
<p>We dove right in and I learned about how Kirk approaches design projects while balancing the want for innovation with the need to stay true to a brand&#8217;s established identity. Kirk also spoke about growing up and getting into design and illustration, talked about his podcasting endeavors, and he gave some great advice for aspiring creatives of all stripes. We even nerded out for a bit about comic books and video games! </p>
<p>For Kirk, being himself and sticking to those who encourage and support his creativity has given him a great life, and that&#8217;s a lesson we can all take to heart!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
All right, what&#8217;s up? How you doing, Maurice? Thanks for having me on, man. I&#8217;m Kirk Visola. I&#8217;m the founder and creative director of Mind the Font. It&#8217;s a full service branding and packaging design agency. We try to focus on things in the food and beverage space, mainly CPG, which is consumer products goods. And as much as this sounds like I&#8217;m reading this, I am not. That was off the top of the dome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. How has 2023 been going so far? I know you&#8217;re in California, so y&#8217;all have been getting hammered by the rain.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s not too bad for the most part. I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough, I&#8217;m in Santa Cruz, which is close to Aptos and Capitola, which were both hit pretty heavily on their downtowns, and also SoCal and on the docks, and then next to the ocean. We lost part of our road here, West Cliff, in Santa Cruz, so it&#8217;s been raining pretty heavily. But today it led up and it&#8217;s a beautiful day. That&#8217;s the weather forecast for 2023.</p>
<p>As far as business and just livelihood, I&#8217;m happy to be upright, pushing 50, in my late-forties, and I&#8217;m a Black male in this country and I&#8217;m still alive. So that has to count for something, so I&#8217;m happy about that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I heard that. Amen to that. Let&#8217;s talk about your branding and packaging design agency, Mind the Font. Tell me more about that.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a really, really good question, which is what people always say on podcast, &#8220;Great question,&#8221; because we&#8217;re actually trying to think of a way to answer the question. I&#8217;ve been working in design for a long time. I started in &#8217;98 and I was doing all kinds of things. I was still going to school. I was going to take design classes. And I started working freelance with my wife at the time. And then I was working freelance and I decided to go into the private sector or into corporate sector, however you want to call it. And so starting in 2009, I got a job at Pure Red Creative. If you want to read my resume and when you got off here, that&#8217;s fine too.</p>
<p>But fast forward to 2014, I started working at a company called Shaklee, and it was a great job at the get go. My boss, who&#8217;s still a really good friend, she was very, I&#8217;m trying to think of the best way to put this, very progressive by the means in which people worked. Because I had been freelancing for Lord knows how long, and that was all from my house. It was all via emails when FTP, File Transfer Protocol, first came out, and stuff like that. And I was doing all that stuff and then she left.<br>
No, actually, here&#8217;s what happened. I got absorbed into a different place at the company, and then she left and it just went downhill from there. It was a horrible experience. I guess I can get into that later, but what made me leave was the fact that I couldn&#8217;t handle it anymore. I was stressed out. Half of my face would go numb going into work. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You know what? Fuck this. I&#8217;m going to do my own shit.&#8221;</p>
<p>So my wife and I were on vacation, and I was at the point where I was trying to figure out what I was going to do. And we were in the UK and everything there when you ride on the London Underground is, &#8220;Please, mind the gap.&#8221; It&#8217;s like this repeated person over the intercom saying, &#8220;Please, don&#8217;t forget to mind the gap. Mind the gap.&#8221; And so my wife goes, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just call it Mind the Font?&#8221; And I just was floored. How did I not think of this? How did I not think of this? So I have to credit her with giving me the name for the company.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s just doing stuff I&#8217;ve always done. I&#8217;m really good at what I do, but my main interest and my main focus in regards to design work is branding and packaging. That&#8217;s like my forte. It&#8217;s what I love. And so that&#8217;s what I do at Mind the Font. And clients range from new alcohol products to new baby food products or just food products. And also, I&#8217;m trying to think of stuff I&#8217;ve done, beauty products and perfumes. So we run the gamut on all things that come in a box, and that&#8217;s what Mind the Font does.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious, have you found there to be any sort of big changes in designing for consumer packaged goods over the years?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Oh, absolutely. There&#8217;s always standards that you have to abide by. There are certain things that need to go on packaging that you need to think about. There&#8217;s certain techniques that have evolved over the years, especially in printing. That&#8217;s a big thing. Printing has evolved so much and all of the protocols of companies trying to go greener, and then print companies also keeping up to go greener. The actual programs that you use are advancing, especially with the big AI thing coming out.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve even kind of dabbled with Midjourney. And it&#8217;s weird because people are speaking about how it&#8217;s used to steal their art, but what I&#8217;m doing is I&#8217;m taking art I&#8217;ve done and using that as a prompt to see what it does. So it&#8217;s like my art as a base, but then putting in the prompt is what it does for Midjourney and add texture to this to make it look more like three dimensional. And it does it to my own artwork. So I&#8217;m thinking maybe that&#8217;s something that could possibly be an avenue for people to go.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to replace designers. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to replace artists. But I do think that it&#8217;s a means of weeding out the bad designers and good designers. Like when there was a big real estate boom, there were tons of real estate agents and a lot of them went away, but the ones that were really good at what they did, they&#8217;re still there.</p>
<p>And so there&#8217;s programs that are advancing, and there&#8217;s also different mediums to go about. When I first started, it was basically web and print. This is the late &#8217;90s. There was no real social media. Maybe Facebook started coming out and other things. And all of a sudden, next thing you know, there&#8217;s UX designers, product designers, UI designers, web designers, and there&#8217;s print designers, social media managers, social media content creators. There&#8217;s like this wide gamut of things that people can do now. And so it&#8217;s just advanced with all the stuff that&#8217;s coming out.</p>
<p>And for me, it&#8217;s just too much to keep up with from that standpoint. But in my own field, which is why I specified branding and packaging, it&#8217;s like I feel very comfortable there. And I&#8217;m always trying to learn. I&#8217;m always talking with people. I&#8217;m always getting new ideas and figuring out new ways to handle things and bouncing ideas off of people to see what they think. I have a trusted group of friends who are phenomenal designers I talk to. It&#8217;s always good to do that, man. And so I think I&#8217;m keeping up that way, so I&#8217;m doing all right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s so interesting you mentioned that about Midjourney. I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of playing around with ChatGPT, which is another sort of AI generated tool. Midjourney is more for visuals. I think ChatGPT is more text based. And it&#8217;s funny, I was talking about this with my mentor and we kind of both came to the conclusion that these kinds of tools, they almost feel like you&#8217;re working with a really good intern. They&#8217;re not going to be specific enough to be an artisan or a master and expert at it, but they can get pretty good.</p>
<p>Like how you&#8217;re mentioning with Midjourney, how you feed your own art into it. I&#8217;ve been doing that with ChatGPT, hopefully listeners don&#8217;t get mad at this, but I&#8217;ve been feeding in some past episodes and generates 20 questions based off the transcript of this interview.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it&#8217;ll put the questions out. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, this is pretty good.&#8221; They&#8217;re not perfect, but it&#8217;s a good jumping off point for me to say, okay, &#8220;I can take this out. I can change the words here. I can do that.&#8221; I&#8217;ve even, not for this interview, just to be clear, but I did do it for one interview. I had ChatGPT. I fed them this person&#8217;s bio and said, &#8220;Generate 20 questions as if you&#8217;re doing an in-depth, one hour podcast interview.&#8221; And I knew some of them. Some of them were good, some of them were not. But some of them I was like, &#8220;Okay, this is promising.&#8221; It&#8217;s promising.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
&#8220;If you had a breakfast cereal that you would like to eat, what would it be?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. And with ChatGPT it&#8217;s so interesting because you can even tell it certain books, books that I haven&#8217;t necessarily read, but I could say, &#8220;Give me a 10 point summary of this book by this person.&#8221; And it&#8217;s the best kind of Cliff Notes in a way. I know that there are educators that are like, &#8220;Oh, we got to ban this shit. We can&#8217;t have this in the classroom.&#8221; Because some of this stuff is too&#8230; I don&#8217;t even want to say it&#8217;s necessarily too good, but it&#8217;ll get you there. It&#8217;s not the best, but it&#8217;ll get you there. It&#8217;s good enough.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Right. Here&#8217;s the thing with that, twofold. One, there are actually programs where you can put in someone&#8217;s work or a written book from what I&#8217;m reading, like their actual essay or whatever they&#8217;ve written, and you can plug it into the internet somewhere and decipher if it was written by them or if it was generated by AI. There&#8217;s some type of thing that does that. And two, just because it&#8217;s written by someone doesn&#8217;t necessarily educate them or make them a better writer.</p>
<p>My biggest fear and problem is that all AI is doing is taking stuff we&#8217;ve already done and rehashing it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
And right now the focus is on speed. The focus is on, &#8220;Oh, look how quickly I can do this.&#8221; What if people just stopped making art? What would we be able to choose from? It would have to go back and it&#8217;s just going to repeat the same thing. And the next thing you know, everything is going to start looking the same.</p>
<p>And I noticed that when I put in a prompt in AI, it gives you four images in Midjourney. And the images, they usually have the same colors when you do it, and the type isn&#8217;t right, which is something that&#8217;s going to work through, I&#8217;m sure, but it&#8217;s always relatively the same. And I&#8217;m thinking to myself, &#8220;Man, how can you just sit there and do something up real quick and then use that as your work?&#8221; No.</p>
<p>I can see that what you&#8217;re saying, as a jumping off point or a starting point. It&#8217;s great for that. &#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t have thought of doing that shape.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t have thought of using that pattern or color. Let me build off of that.&#8221; But to just use it as your work? I don&#8217;t know, man. I can&#8217;t fuck with it.</p>
<p>And the other thing too is there&#8217;s been tons of programs that have come out that were supposed to &#8220;destroy&#8221; the art industry and make art more hard for people to get into. Like Canva. Canva came out and you can do your own design work. And it hasn&#8217;t gotten rid of designers. Motion pictures, telephones, the car, everything else is coming out. The only thing I can really say that really hurt people was Netflix. Blockbuster got destroyed.</p>
<p>When there&#8217;s some type of disruption in a field, it&#8217;s good because it forces people to progress. But with the progression, you don&#8217;t want to regress in regards to art and creating art or thought processes. And I think that&#8217;s so critical for any type of field is to have a thought process, is to have some type of critical thinking in regards to what you&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think that&#8217;s being lost with AI because it&#8217;s just pulling from art. It&#8217;s pulling from our shit to create more to shit give back to you. It&#8217;s literally plagiarizing everything that it&#8217;s doing. There&#8217;s no other way around it. People say, &#8220;Oh, well, it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s this, it&#8217;s that. This is the future.&#8221; It&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s plagiarizing. It maybe the future, but it&#8217;s plagiarizing. It&#8217;s literally stealing everything we&#8217;ve already done to recreate something.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s weird. But anyway, enough of that.<br>
But like you said, the art styles do kind of end up looking the same in some instances. And I&#8217;ve heard that argument too from designers and artists that are like, &#8220;Well, this is going to take over my job,&#8221; or something like this. But if someone comes to you, say, a client comes to you and they want you to do some changes or do some design based off AI artwork, you can always just say no. You can say, &#8220;You know what? I don&#8217;t work with that. I&#8217;m not going to work with that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Right. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, binary, non-binary folk, thank you for coming to our AI chat.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you approach a new design project?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Carefully. It&#8217;s interesting because there&#8217;s so many ways to approach a new design project, and it&#8217;s so broad. But I&#8217;ll try to paraphrase and not be as wordy as actually giving you this explanation as to how I&#8217;m not going to be wordy. You get a brief usually of what someone wants to do as far as a design goes. That way the brief&#8217;s more entailed, rather than just saying, &#8220;Just do something and I&#8217;ll let you know when I like it.&#8221; Sorry, I don&#8217;t work that way. And if I am going to work that way, you&#8217;re going to be paying a lot of money for it because I&#8217;m not going to do it for free.</p>
<p>So the way I approach a project is to see exactly what the person wants, see what they have, if they have anything, and then what I&#8217;d like to do, and this is old school, I go pencil and paper, pen and paper, and I just sketch. I sketch and I fill up sheets and sheets of paper with just sketches and ideas and thoughts. And maybe this will work, maybe that won&#8217;t work. And to me, it&#8217;s the best tool you have. It&#8217;s quick and it doesn&#8217;t break. It doesn&#8217;t break down. You can&#8217;t lose files unless you throw it away.</p>
<p>And once I get to a spot where I think it works, I then start going digital, if it&#8217;s supposed to be digital, and I bring it into the computer. This is the way I describe it: Whatever I&#8217;m doing, whatever I&#8217;m making, I do &#8220;high quality comps,&#8221; meaning that I will do something in a manner to where it feels real and looks real, just to give the person who&#8217;s on the other end a better idea of what&#8217;s to come. Like, &#8220;Hey, here are the concepts and here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I explain each concept and I put it into a different bucket or theme. And I explain why it works in this theme. I explain why it works for their business, and I explain how it&#8217;ll work in the space, whatever space they&#8217;re going into, just so they know that I&#8217;m not just doing something because it looks pretty. And I think that&#8217;s important.</p>
<p>Oftentimes people do stuff because it looks pretty, rather than serve as being functional. Being pretty, that shouldn&#8217;t even be in the vocabulary. That shouldn&#8217;t even be a thought. Of course, you&#8217;re going to do something that looks nice, that&#8217;s a given, but does it fit within what you&#8217;re trying to achieve, which is in that certain niche, in that certain area? What are you trying to achieve by making this product? Are you doing what&#8217;s best for the client?</p>
<p>And so I try to approach initially with gathering information with them as much as I can, seeing where it needs to go, wherever space they&#8217;re into, sketch, go digital, put together a thoughtful presentation as far as why I was doing things a certain way and why it will benefit them, and then get feedback and move forward and see how that works.</p>
<p>And honestly, this is a interesting conversation, but I&#8217;ve been doing this for, oh my God, a long time. &#8217;98. So, holy shit. 25 years? Is that right? Is my math right? 25 years? No. &#8220;Was he that old?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds about right.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Oh my God, that is&#8230; Wow. Okay, cool. The point was&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You blew your own mind there.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
I got a lot of my sensibility, I&#8217;ve been doing this so long. The point is I&#8217;ve had maybe six or seven clients in that time who were just disappointed with what I did. And so to me, it makes me feel like, all right, I&#8217;m doing something right, because if I wasn&#8217;t, the list would be a lot longer.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m also realizing too, this is something very important for people who are starting out and doing any type of art or any type of media that is subjective, anything that visually captures your eye, to be judged is subjective, so art, video games, design, packaging, clothing. Whatever is visually perceived is subjective. And that is fact.</p>
<p>So when you&#8217;re designing something, you have to remember that if someone doesn&#8217;t like your work, it&#8217;s subjective. It doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t like you. It doesn&#8217;t mean that your work&#8217;s bad. It&#8217;s just subjective and it doesn&#8217;t fit their taste, or it doesn&#8217;t fit their style. It&#8217;s not on you to make the client like your work, it&#8217;s on you to deliver what&#8217;s best for your client. That&#8217;s your job as a artist, as a designer, as a game developer, you deliver what&#8217;s best. And if they like it, great. If they don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s not personal. So that&#8217;s how you have to view things moving forward.</p>
<p>And I just, man, I&#8217;ve been doing this for 25 years. I&#8217;m so old. But I just realized this a couple years ago, and because my wife told me. She&#8217;s so smart. She said, &#8220;You know what, Kirk? It&#8217;s not they don&#8217;t like you, it&#8217;s just they didn&#8217;t like your design.&#8221; Like, mind blown. Like, &#8220;Damn, you&#8217;re so right.&#8221; For everybody who&#8217;s starting out or who is in the crux of it every day grinding, just remember that it&#8217;s not you, hopefully your work doesn&#8217;t suck, it&#8217;s subjective. That&#8217;s what they&#8217;re judging: your work, not you. So there we go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a great piece of advice, I think, for even folks that have been in the game for a long time. That&#8217;s a good piece of advice to know.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Yeah, and it took my wife, she&#8217;s so wise, to tell me that. Because here&#8217;s the thing, we&#8217;re all emotional creatures. And as designers and as artists, we&#8217;re all a bit egotistical. I&#8217;ll admit it. I am. And when you hear a fresh perspective from somebody and you remove the emotion and you remove the subjectivity, and you look at it objectively, you&#8217;re able to say, &#8220;Oh, well, you&#8217;re right.&#8221; Because everything that you do in the visual world is subjective. So there you go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There you go.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So how do you kind of balance the business side of everything, like the marketing, the finances, the contracts, how do you balance that with the creative aspects of your work?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m still trying to figure that out. The business side of things will work itself out. I do what I&#8217;m supposed to do to get paid. I do what I want to do to stay fresh. So I will do the jobs I have to do and depending on what it is, if it&#8217;s a fun job like branding or packaging, that&#8217;s where I can explore. Sometimes you have to do things like marketing pieces or flyers or graphics for a social media post or design a booth or design a shit-talker for whatever.</p>
<p>And so there&#8217;s just various little things that go into branding and marketing, or whatever, that need to be done and it&#8217;s just more of a production artist or more just a getting it done aspect rather than actually creating things. So for me, what I do if I&#8217;m stuck or want to stay fresh or creative is I draw. I haven&#8217;t been drawing enough. So I try to draw. I do writing, and I try to make up stories and make up characters.</p>
<p>And I also like to play video games. Now, this sounds silly, but video games unlock a lot of creativity for me. And the biggest reason as to why is because my brain literally has to shut off because it has to focus on the game I&#8217;m playing. Like everything else is shut out and so my mind quiets. And when my mind is able to quiet, it actually has a better time thinking. So oftentimes I&#8217;ll play a game for, I don&#8217;t know, 30, 45 minutes, and I&#8217;ll stop playing and be like, &#8220;Oh, damn, I just had an idea,&#8221; because it makes me refocus. And so whatever the idea is, I try to go with it.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the other thing too, is if you have an idea &#8212; and I have several because of the ADHD &#8212; if you have an idea, just start it. Just do it. Just get it out of your head, whatever it is. If you want to paint something, if you want to draw something, if you want to write something, if you want to come up with an idea for a game, if you want to think of an idea for a cocktail you like or a coffee drink, or even a puzzle that you want to do, just do it. I mean, take some time and just do stuff for you. Always mind your deadlines, but also make sure that you do stuff to stimulate you. I always tell people I&#8217;m a very creative person, but my medium of earning for my creativity has always been design.</p>
<p>And growing up, I loved reading comic books. This is in my bio, but growing up, I loved reading comic books. I loved all things comics. I would draw, I would pretend I was a comic book hero. I would make up stories. I would watch Star Wars. I would watch everything. And the one thing I did with comics was I copied how they looked. I would copy the lettering, I would make up my own lettering, I would make up my own stories. And all of that is all design. If you look at a comic book, people are like, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s just a comic book.&#8221; The amount of vocabulary used in those as well as the form and the pictures and the settings and everything else, it really enhances readers, because you get engaged with it. And also, it gives you lessons in layout, and it gives you lessons in hierarchy, in form, in structure and the way things should look on a page with composition.</p>
<p>So, all of that led into what I&#8217;m doing, and I think that people need to realize that you can find creativity in anything, but I think you need to love what you&#8217;re doing in order to do so. You can be creative in any way you want. If you have an idea or whatever, just get it done. And I know I&#8217;m talking too much, so I&#8217;m going to shut up now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, tell me more about these video games. What are you playing?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Oh. See, now we got on a real topic. First of all, let me preface this by saying I&#8217;m older, so we&#8217;re the generation that grew up playing games. We were the generation that had&#8230; And television and the Commodore 64 and Apple and playing Oregon Trail on Atari 2600 and the first Sega and the Sega Genesis and Nintendo 8-bit, and then went to the Super Nintendo. So all this stuff we grew up with. So I love games. I&#8217;ve always loved video games and I just got a PlayStation 5 about six or seven months ago and I just never played it. I thought, &#8220;Why am I not playing it?&#8221; So I broke out Miles Morales and I played that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
I played through it. And then I&#8217;m like, &#8220;All right. Let me try God of War.&#8221; Started it. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I have to dedicate time to this and I don&#8217;t have time.&#8221; The first God of War, Greatest Hits, of course, because it&#8217;s been out forever. I played through that, finished it, and I got Ragnar√∂k, played through that, finished it. Then I replayed Tomb Raider, which Tomb Raider was it? Finished it. Started playing a Ratchet &#038; Clank, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Ah. I can&#8217;t fuck with this.&#8221; It&#8217;s too happy for me. I need to kill people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s not bad to say, that&#8217;s a video game, right?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Oh. This is some crazy shit. So you heard about Jaguar going off, right? She&#8217;s an artist, R&#038;B artist. I can&#8217;t think of her last name, but she&#8217;s &#8220;exposed&#8221;.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
So she&#8217;s talking about things in just really&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s spilling the T or borderline snitching. I&#8217;m not sure which one it is, because sometimes it&#8217;s like she&#8217;s spilling the T on bad things. And sometimes she&#8217;s just snitching thinking, &#8220;Girl, speak your mind. Do what you want to do, but people are going to come at you one way or another.&#8221; But the one thing she said that really bothered me that went back to white racist senators was talking about&#8230; I don&#8217;t blame any of people doing the one thing I don&#8217;t like is GTA six or GTA. GTA is a terrible game. I mean, you sit there and you sit there and you kill people. You do this stuff and do that stuff. And then what&#8217;s going to make you change and do it in real life? What&#8217;s going to make you think you can&#8217;t do it in real life? It&#8217;s like, I can play Uncharted. I can play Max Payne 3, Tomb Raider, Last of Us.</p>
<p>I can play violent video games and never kill anybody or have it come across my mind because I have the ability to separate reality from fantasy. So you can&#8217;t say that someone playing a video game in fracks on their life. I&#8217;m not going to be Spider-Man, I&#8217;m not going to be Batman. It&#8217;s a ridiculous notion. Rather than talking about the environment in which they grow up and the violence that they&#8217;re exposed to outside of their house, and the systemic and cyclical poverty that they&#8217;re exposed to on a day by day basis, especially in poor areas and ghetto&#8230; [inaudible 00:29:01] even say ghetto. That&#8217;s terrible.</p>
<p>Poor areas of black and brown people. You have to think about that before you say it&#8217;s the video game&#8217;s fault. It&#8217;s a silly notion. But anyway, back to video games, I really have to dedicate an hour at a time because I just get swapped in. And once I&#8217;m in a game, if I&#8217;m into it, I got to finish it. It&#8217;s like, I know I can&#8217;t get into it again, because I know I have to finish it. It&#8217;s going to be a big chunk of my time. It&#8217;s going to be a lot of stuff that I do. So that&#8217;s the other problem. But it really does help me shut off. And it&#8217;s a nice stress reliever just thinking about the pattern of the boss that you&#8217;re fighting. Okay, he&#8217;s going to do this, which means I got to dodge which means I got to throw this. It&#8217;s like, so there&#8217;s always a pattern and there&#8217;s always something you can figure out in a video game. That&#8217;s what I like about it. Do you play games?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. Oh yeah. I have a Switch. I have a PS5. It&#8217;s funny, I&#8217;m not a big PlayStation person, but then I look back and I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve actually owned every PlayStation console, even the handheld.&#8221; Even though I haven&#8217;t really played them a lot. I had a PlayStation one when I was in middle school, high school. I played the hell out my PS2. I had the big chunky PS3 that could do backwards compatibility. My PS4 is in my closet. I just got a PS5 last year. And I have a Switch. I have one of the first&#8230; When they came out five years ago or whatever, I&#8217;ve got a Switch. Oh yeah. I&#8217;m a big gamer. Well, let me take that back. I feel like I&#8217;m more of a game collector slash enthusiast because I don&#8217;t play as much as I used to. I&#8217;ve started recently, I guess you could call it a resolution this year. I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to start playing more games this year.&#8221; Because my switch is literally right next to my desk. And I got one of those little&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called a ShadowCast. A Genki ShadowCast, where you can basically connect your Switch or your Xbox or PlayStation, whatever, to any HDMI input. And so I have HDMI on my main computer, which is a gaming PC. So I have my Switch hooked up to my PC, so now I can just have it in another window. Because I have a ultra wide screen monitor. I just have another window and I&#8217;ll play a little Animal Crossing or play some&#8230; I play a lot of play Picross, which I started playing when I was in high school. I think Picross is this Japanese&#8230; It&#8217;s sort of like a crossword puzzle, but you make out a picture instead of doing words. Although I do really crossword puzzles too. And there&#8217;s this company called Jupiter that just keeps cranking out Picross games every six months. There&#8217;s like a new Picross game. So I had all the ones on the Nintendo 3DS Picross E, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, E7.</p>
<p>And now the ones on Switch are Picross S for Switch. So now I&#8217;m currently playing my way through Picross S8. And it&#8217;s very much one of those things where&#8230; Yeah. I can just kind of turn my brain off because I&#8217;ve played it so much that I already know, my hands and brain already know what the controls are to do the things, so I don&#8217;t have to think about it. And it&#8217;s such good&#8230; I actually block out three hours on my calendar at the end of Friday, just to play that. Not all three hours, but I&#8217;ll play it through some of those three hours just to sort of defrag my brain from the week. Like, &#8220;Okay. This is good.&#8221; Calm down time. Turn the phone off. Yeah. [inaudible 00:32:39] games we played with more recent, Kirk. Thanks for tuning in.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Yeah. Man. You mentioned the PS. And there&#8217;s a game that I just&#8230; Honestly, man, it still blows my mind even going back and playing it. It is Metal Gear Solid on the PS. And [inaudible 00:33:00] was at Konami for a long time and he owned&#8230; And he&#8217;s the guy that invented&#8230; He&#8217;s basically the dude that solidified, invented action adventure games. Without him, there wouldn&#8217;t be a Resident Evil. I mean, without him, there wouldn&#8217;t be any of those games, because he invented the idea of sneaking around and figuring about puzzles and collectively trying to collect goods and stay as&#8230; It&#8217;s just brilliant. And you go back and play and it still holds up. This still holds up. The graphics are not great at all, especially on a nice TV. But man, the story play and the cut scenes&#8230; Cut scenes became a thing then it&#8217;s just, oh. Anyway. All right. I know [inaudible 00:33:43] let&#8217;s finish your interview. Shall we?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to go more into your origin story. You&#8217;ve kind of already touched on really being into comics and video games. Tell me more about growing up.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
I grew up in a small town called Modesto, California. And I know you grew up&#8230; We touched about this before we started the podcast. You grew up in Selma, and just because people get a Black president or you live in a certain area, doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that racism goes away. And growing up in an ag heavy city like Modesto, it was very different, for lack of a better term. And I played soccer, I played sports. I had three older brothers. But the one thing I really loved to do was read comics. I mean, let me mention that before, I loved reading comics and I never thought there was an avenue for it. I wanted to be a doctor or a firefighter.</p>
<p>And it wasn&#8217;t until I met my ex-wife that I knew about graphic design. And damn. This was in &#8217;98. I basically started doing design when I first learned about it, just because I was so intrigued by it. Her father, my father outlaw was the head of the creative services department in Modesto, called E&#038;J Gallo Winery. And he was the head there and literally known in very, very wide spaces, especially in the beverage, in wine and spirit space, because of the work he had done. He had been doing it since the sixties, and he invented the E&#038;J brandy bottle, and he invented the New Amsterdam vodka bottle, the shapes. So if you look at those, those are very iconic. So he would sit there and he took me under his wing basically, and told me about design.</p>
<p>So from there, I was intrigued and I started taking classes at the local JC and I went to classes at San Jose State. And the one thing that was very bothersome to me was being accessibility to take more classes there, because at the time before they made it into a BFA, Bachelor of Fine Arts, it was just a BA, you had to qualify for their design program. And I quote-unquote wasn&#8217;t good enough to qualify for their program. And I remember sitting there thinking, looking at designs and critiquing designs, and I found what I was good at. I just understood design, I understood it spoke to me, and it was like I was the duck. I was the duck who had been sitting at the office desk that finally found out that there was water outside and he could fly.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how I felt, right? And from there, I was just able to have mentor. A mentor was the best in the world at doing something and run ideas by him. I still talk to him. I just talked to him three or four days ago. I mean, he&#8217;s my father outlaw, but I still talk to him to get advice and stuff like that. So I look back at that experience and look back at my life, and I just think of all the obstacles that were there that I have no idea how I would&#8217;ve found this job had I not been where I was. I mean, I&#8217;m in Modesto. Modesto&#8217;s known for Scott Peterson, George Lucas, Gallo Wine. Those are our three major claims of fame. And it&#8217;s just a small town. It&#8217;s not a small town. It&#8217;s fairly decent sized town in the Central Valley where it&#8217;s not heavily populated by Black people. There are tons of Latinos, predominantly Mexican, that work on the area there.</p>
<p>But I had no idea what graphic design was or that it was even a possibility. And I still wouldn&#8217;t have had an idea had I not met my ex, I would not be doing what I&#8217;m doing. It&#8217;s all the things that had to happen in order for me to be able to do this is just&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, man. It&#8217;s luck. There&#8217;s no other way to put it. And I&#8217;m not religious. I can&#8217;t be, I guess spiritual, but I don&#8217;t believe in going to church and everything else. I do believe in karma, and I think that my karma was to be a designer. It just was just happened. So I got lucky man. And I started doing design work from there. Worked freelance for a while when I had my kid in 2000. And then see here, in 2009, I started working in the office I was telling you about. And then from there on out, just did design work. And here I am.</p>
<p>And I think the experiences I had and the wide range of dabbling in different designs, being me a better designer, but also having that foundation of the fantastical world of comic books and video games also helped. It just led to this path for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, it sounds like it was also kind of just this constant sense of inspiration too, for you.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Yeah. No doubt. I mean, I can&#8217;t doubt that. I mean, my profile pick on my LinkedIn is me holding a Batman cup, taking a sip. My signature, my professional signature, my actual signature is the bat simple. It&#8217;s on my passport, it&#8217;s on my license. It&#8217;s like that&#8217;s my legit signature. It&#8217;s just kind of part of me. I have on my sloppy ass desk, I have a couple of Grogu figurines, a Boba Fett Star Wars lamp. I have Batman behind me. I&#8217;m just surrounded by it. So it&#8217;s always influencing me and always has. And I&#8217;m thankful I found a career that kind of lets me create.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you were already a working designer when you were studying at San Jose State. How did you balance school and work?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Honestly, I don&#8217;t know. I had a kid at home, young kid, and I was working part-time as well. As well as going to school and having a job, freelancing. I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m not saying that to&#8230; Because I&#8217;m doing a brag or I&#8217;m self glossing. I&#8217;m saying it because, I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s all a blur, basically. From 2000 until 2010 is all a blur for me. During that time, I had gotten married in &#8217;99, and then had our first kid in 2000. And then a set of twins in 2003, my father passed away that year, and then my brother passed away. Or sorry, he didn&#8217;t pass away. He was murdered in jail by cops in 2009. And then 2010, I moved from Modesto. Honestly, dude, that whole decade&#8217;s kind of a blur. So you know how you do things in the moment and you go back and you say, &#8220;How did I do that?&#8221; That&#8217;s the moment for me.</p>
<p>Because my ex was laid up in bed when my twins were born, and so I was taking care of the newborn twins. A three-year-old or soon to be three-year old kid. And then my ex. So the resiliency of the human spirit is truly amazing when it&#8217;s put to the test. You can do a lot. When you set your mind to do something, you really can do a lot. And I had to do it. There was no choice. So that&#8217;s what I remember. I&#8217;m sorry, I can&#8217;t answer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, that&#8217;s real. I think about&#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s necessarily a blank spot, but it&#8217;s definitely a blur. I remember vignettes of things from 2000 to maybe 2006. That&#8217;s my blurry period because I was in college and I remember certain things. I remember where I interned at. I remember getting my first apartment. I remember graduating. I remember graduating because they had the graduation outside in the middle of a thunderstorm. And the person sitting next to me would not share their umbrella with me. So I kept trying to scooch under the umbrella, and they kept moving it back. So how umbrellas are curved. So the water just wow came down. And I had this sad droopy mortar board when I went to go get my degree. I remember vignettes and things, because I know during that time I was working a bunch of jobs and I hated&#8230; I get what you&#8217;re saying. I get what you&#8217;re saying.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&#8217;re so in it that you don&#8217;t really remember the&#8230; You don&#8217;t remember it. Yeah. You were there. But you don&#8217;t have full recall of that time. I even have a pop culture blind spot from 2000 to 2006 or so. People will mention movies and TV, and I&#8217;m like, I kind of know what that is. People will mention stuff about SpongeBob and Harry Potter. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m familiar with it in the cultural zeitgeist.&#8221; But I don&#8217;t really recall being into that because I was in my twenties and just trying to survive. I don&#8217;t really remember it.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Most artists or some artists have a blue period. We had a blurry period. But honestly, man, this is kind of sad but true that more than likely it&#8217;s just severe trauma that we&#8217;ve suffered at that time. And neither one of us know how to deal with it or even comprehend.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And I say it was a blind spot because I had&#8230; And I&#8217;ll ask you about what your time was like at Shaklee, but I know I was working at&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve even mentioned this on the podcast before. I was working at Autotrader as a&#8230; I think I was a dealer concierge or something. I was trying to work my way up to something higher paying or whatever. And at the time, I was also a blogger. I won&#8217;t mention what my blog name was, but I had a blog and I was talking about other stuff. And I never used anyone&#8217;s name. Everyone had a pseudonym or whatever, but they found out about it at work. And they had called me into the office. And they had printed out reams of my blog, which honestly was a little flattered because I fancied myself a writer.</p>
<p>I wrote all through high school and college and stuff. And so I was like, &#8220;Oh, for me?&#8221; I was kind of bit taken and they&#8217;re pointing out stuff that they&#8217;ve highlighted. And then I remembered, I was like, &#8220;How did they find out about this?&#8221; Because I never did it from work. And then I remembered that there was someone at work that I told about it. And that could have been the only way that they found out about it.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Snitch.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Snitch end up in ditches as Paul Bettany said.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so they tried to fire me and I quit before they fired me. And then I remember I was going home that evening. And I was on the phone with my mom, and she was just like, &#8220;What are you going to do with your life? You got this degree, you don&#8217;t want to do this, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.&#8221; And I applied to this job in the back of our [inaudible 00:45:10] weekly here called Creative Loafing. I applied to a electronic media specialist gig. That was where the start of my professional design career actually was doing work for the state of Georgia. But that job was so bad. Oh my God. At the time, I thought I was living large. I was 25, I think? 24, 25, had my own office, had cards. I mean, you wouldn&#8217;t get this shit nowadays because of the way that the industry is.</p>
<p>But I had my own office. I had cards with a door that I could close, and I thought, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m doing pretty good.&#8221; But then there was also all this at the time, this sort of pervading narrative that I kept hearing from people. &#8220;Well, you just have a bachelor&#8217;s degree. Well, the bachelor&#8217;s degree is a new high school diploma. If you really want to get far, you have to get a master&#8217;s degree.&#8221; And I&#8217;m just like, Ugh. And so I was trying to get my master&#8217;s degree at that time and my boss was just the worst. I&#8217;m not going to slander her on this podcast, but she was just a very bad boss to the point where we had to get mediation from the state to come in. And it concluded with me just leaving. I just had to leave. I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to stay here with her any longer.&#8221; It&#8217;s just not going to work out.</p>
<p>So that whole period is kind of a bit of a blur, because I was like, look, I&#8217;m just trying to survive. And also at that time, I had just started my first big design project, which was the Black Weblog Awards. I was working full time, I was doing that, and I was just trying to survive because I didn&#8217;t go to design school. So I didn&#8217;t have any sort of design knowledge of anything. All I had was Photoshop, blends that I made, because I downloaded a cracked version from LimeWire and it didn&#8217;t put a virus on my computer. And I was copying tutorials from books that I&#8230; That I didn&#8217;t buy from books that I just read in Barnes and Noble. And I either took notes or I took pictures with my little Olympus point and shoot camera and took them back to my apartment and was like, &#8220;Okay, so how do I do this?&#8221; So I had to teach myself how to do all this stuff. I was just trying to get by, man. I was trying to make it so I get that blurry period. A hundred percent.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s life. I mean, it&#8217;s one of those things too, because being older and you talking about just reading something, reading up on something and figuring it out, it&#8217;s like, if I really wanted to, I could do that now, but I don&#8217;t want to. I don&#8217;t [inaudible 00:47:42]. I just want to learn TikTok. And I mean, I don&#8217;t want to get on there and start doing stuff. It&#8217;s not hard. I don&#8217;t want to do it. And I don&#8217;t think that the younger generation, they think that we&#8217;re old and we don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;What the fuck. We&#8217;re the ones that invented this shit. We were the ones who were going on Napster and Limewire and everything else to try to figure out how to get stuff.&#8221; That was us. We were the ones who&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Everything else to try to figure out how to get stuff like that was us. We were the ones who saw things go from landlines to mobile phones. We saw it go from VCRs to downloadable HDX files. We&#8217;re the ones that saw that. We&#8217;re the ones that saw the transition. We were the ones that evolved with it. If the apocalypse happened, like the zombie apocalypse happened, have you seen The Last of Us yet?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I haven&#8217;t seen it yet, the first episode.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Have you played the game by chance?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I haven&#8217;t played the game, so that&#8217;s why I haven&#8217;t seen it yet because I don&#8217;t know if I need to play the game to watch the show.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
No, you don&#8217;t, but it&#8217;s just shitty because you can see stuff coming and it&#8217;s just like&#8230; but it&#8217;s so well done. It&#8217;s so well done, but what I&#8217;m thinking is if we were to go back into the zombie apocalypse, and everything had to go back before there was all this technology and digital and everything else, many of us wouldn&#8217;t survive. Many of us wouldn&#8217;t know how to take notes or to do basic things because we&#8217;re so dependent upon electricity, and power, and the internet because I&#8217;m thinking we are in Santa Cruz and the electricity went out and it&#8217;s just pitch black. I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;If it stayed this way, could any of us really figure out how to survive? How long would it be before we started going into full on the Walking Dead Kegan mode? How would that take?&#8221;</p>
<p>And so I think that we would immediately have some better survival skills in the previous generation, but I just don&#8217;t feel like going through that mess, and so hearing you go in and say, &#8220;I read this and read up on it and figured out,&#8221; I&#8217;m like, see, that&#8217;s baller status right there, and I think that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m happy I don&#8217;t have to do, even though I probably should in order to keep up with things, but what are we talking about again?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;re talking about you. We&#8217;re talking about you.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I wanted to ask about your podcasting. I mean, we&#8217;re on a podcast, but you are a pretty prolific podcaster yourself. What made you get into it?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Wow. First of all, I don&#8217;t listen to podcasts. I don&#8217;t even listen to my podcasts except when I&#8217;m editing them. It&#8217;s very odd. I know, but I find them to be a bit pretentious at times. I feel like, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s always so formulated,&#8221; so I feel that way about podcasting, but what made me get into it was, and I&#8217;m so glad you said when we started this, it&#8217;s just going to be a conversation because that&#8217;s what got me into this, was listening to talk radio, and being 13 or 14 years old, I was exposed to talk radio and I was exposed to &#8220;shock jocks.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t listen to a lot of NPR, things like that. I listened to the Don and Mike show. They were out of WJFK in Washington DC. They were syndicated, and I listened to Howard , and I listened to a show called Mark and Bryan.</p>
<p>I listened to this show called The Rise Guys out of Sacramento at KHDK, and then I listened to Carmichael Dave out of KHDK, and then Jim Rome, so I listened to a lot of talk shows, and what I learned is that most of the times when they were doing things and talking, it was just the stream of consciousness. It was just the thought. It was just four guys hanging out, but they made it interesting and they knew how to pivot, and they knew how to keep the topics going. They knew how to really get through things, and there&#8217;s a lot of stuff that they would mention, and say, and do, and just the feel of the show was like you were there hanging out with them, and I really like that about talking. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, I want to bring that to a podcast,&#8221; because I try listening into podcasts and it&#8217;s so boring.</p>
<p>And I want to just bring that to a podcast. I want two guys who understand design, and my good friend Andy Kurtts, K-U-R-T-T-S, Andy is, that&#8217;s my dude. He is so cool, man. He&#8217;s cool. He always knows what to say, and he&#8217;s a good designer, and I love the guy, and it&#8217;s like, I couldn&#8217;t do this design show with anyone else really, and I met him on a whim when I was doing something with startup CPG, which is a foundation that helps up-and-coming CPG brands, and we were both on a Pictionary thing, and that&#8217;s how I met him. We just did this online Pictionary during a holiday party, and like, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s do some stuff,&#8221; so we started doing stuff on Clubhouse, and then we started doing stuff finally on Buzz Sprout, I think it&#8217;s called, where you just do podcasts.</p>
<p>And so our idea was let&#8217;s just do a packaging podcast, so we go on to talk about all the specifics of packaging, what&#8217;s important to put on the front of the pack? What&#8217;s important to put on the back of the pack? Do you know about your nutritional labels? Do you know about all the contents that go in? And then we started having people on, and we would have people who actually worked in the industry who owned their own brands, rather designers, and then we realized that it went past that, and we just started talking about design, strictly about design, and that&#8217;s how I got into it with Andy, and we have people on every week, and it&#8217;s just grown into this fun little sit down and chat with people, and I love it. I love that aspect of it.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the old talk radio I used to listen to, but now I&#8217;m actually doing, and only have to do it for an hour instead of three or four. I don&#8217;t know how those people do that. That&#8217;s so impressive. Three or four hours on the air just talking and talking. I hate hearing myself talk, and which is why I probably don&#8217;t listen to my own podcasts, but that&#8217;s one thing, and then I did another one called Jerks with my friend Jeremy Smith, and I had to stop that one just because I was doing two a week, and when we did Jerks, it was mainly, it was an honest approach to things, but I felt it took a lot of me emotionally and to do the edits because we were talking about real shit, and then I have to the edits and things like that, and it was just like a lot, and I said, &#8220;I have to cut one out,&#8221; and I thought, &#8220;which one&#8217;s going to be better beneficial to me as far as my business goes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And as far as really promoting that,&#8221; it had to be Kirk and Kurtts, but Jeremy and I would get on and we&#8217;d talk about shows we watch, we&#8217;d talk about laws that were made. We&#8217;d talk about people that were doing stupid shit, and it would be Donald Trump or Kanye West or whatever was the topic that week we would talk about, and it was good, but it just took so much from me, and I wanted to get back into my own podcast because what I was doing was just having anybody on and talking to them about what they liked, talking about stuff that I liked, but then I&#8217;m realizing it&#8217;s just so much work and I just am not willing to put in that work. Whereas if I&#8217;m doing it with Andy, it&#8217;s twofold.</p>
<p>I get a chat with Andy and we get a catch up on work and we get a catch up on life, and then the other thing is that it holds me accountable that someone else is dependent upon me to actually do my shit, so that&#8217;s the thing, and it&#8217;s not as emotionally draining as Jerks was because it was frustrating, uplifting, happy, and sad. It was just this bag of bittersweet, mixed emotion the entire time, so it was very taxing, and I love Journey Man. Dude&#8217;s cool. I still keep in touch with them. Really nice guy, really great guy, but it was just a little too much for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
What made you get in the podcasting?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve done this for a long-ass time.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
The OG.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What made me get into podcasting? I started back in 2005, again, back with this blog that I had mentioned before. I started, I bought a $10 mic from CVS, like the CVS up the street from me. It was like this little GE mic that you just stick into one of the ports on the back of your computer and you just start talking. Back then, at least when I started, podcasting wasn&#8217;t a big thing. I actually don&#8217;t even remember if it was really called podcasting back then because podcasting is like a portmanteau of iPod and broadcast, and I know the iPod came out in &#8217;03, but I don&#8217;t think podcast was a big word in general back then.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know audio blogging was because the precursor to Twitter was this website called Odio that I used to use to just record snippets of stuff and would send it to friends because a lot of my friends lived either in New York or they lived in California. They didn&#8217;t live in Atlanta, so we would just do audio blogs and stuff back and forth, and on the side, I would just do a&#8230; I called it a blogcast, but I would just kind of record an episode, and maybe I&#8217;d have a guest on using Skype. I would have a guest on, and we would talk about just whatever&#8217;s in the news and whatnot, and I was learning how to edit. I was doing editing myself with Audacity or whatever, and then I fell into this group of other people in Atlanta that were doing podcasting, and I met this couple, Amber and Rusty, who were doing&#8230;</p>
<p>They basically created this organization called the Georgia Podcast Network, and it was mostly Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, the Tri-State area, and we would have semi-regular meetups. There was a website. I think they even put on a few pod camp conferences using the camp style of conferences, which they called an un-conference back then because the attendees are the ones that set the itinerary and got into the podcast community, then met some people, just kind of other folks that were doing shows, and then I kind of fell out of favor from doing it for a while because, I mean, this was around the time also, YouTube started to become big, so people were really starting to get into doing video. Blogging itself was dying out a bit. More people were going towards video.</p>
<p>Audio was still something that largely in terms of distribution was more in the arena of big media entities, so a New York Times or an NPR or something would do a radio show, and then they release it later that day as an MP3 or something because I would listen to that stuff at work or whatever, and so that&#8217;s how I first got into it, and there just wasn&#8217;t, at least around the time with the Georgia Podcast network, outside of them, really a big community for it. I call that the first wave of podcasting, and then the second wave really came in the mid 2010s with Cereal. Like Cereal came, and then they had that famous ad with the woman mispronouncing MaleChimp, and that seemed to just take off wildfire in terms of people just being like, you can listen to audio on this device that I hold in my hand that has a headphone jack that I&#8217;ve been listening to music?</p>
<p>Yes, you can. You can do that. It wasn&#8217;t a big, big push.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Right. Sometimes the most obvious answers aren&#8217;t obvious.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, but people started to see, I think, the possibility in it because even though Sarah Koenig is a journalist, and she was doing this independently at first, people saw like, &#8220;Oh, wait. I can make a show about anything,&#8221; and the way that the podcasting industry has, honestly, expanded and grown in the past 10 years is phenomenal, just in terms of the availability and the the suaveness of hardware, the availability of software. I mean, if you have a Spotify account, you can record a podcast. There&#8217;s so easy now, and so the learning curve has gotten much, much flatter for people to try to get into it, which I think for better or for worse, has been something for the industry.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to say it&#8217;s been good or bad, but now, because so many people can do it, everyone can do it, and so there&#8217;s just so many different shows out there, but I wanted, at least with Revision Path, I wanted to establish the lane fairly early because I had been listening to other design podcasts, and there were no Black people. And I would ask them, &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you talking to any Black designers? I know Black designers,&#8221; and sometimes I would get a response, which would usually be negative, but most of the times they would never even respond, and so I started Revision Path, not as a podcast at first, it was just going to be an online magazine because a friend of mine, this woman named Deedee Sutton had a really successful online magazine that she created called Clutch Online, or Clutch Mag Online, I think is what she called it, but she had a really super successful online magazine.</p>
<p>I was like, &#8220;I want to do something like that with, but around design at Revision Path,&#8221; because by this point in time in 2013 when I started the show, I had quit my job at AT&#038;T five years ago, started my studio, and then I had been in my studio now, and it was successful for five years, so I was like, &#8220;Oh, I have the time and the space to actually do this,&#8221; and so that&#8217;s how Revision Path was born, and I recorded my first podcast in June of that year. We started in February in terms of interviews, but the first recorded podcast was in June of that year, and then in 2014 is when we started to do it on a fairly regular weekly basis in terms of audio interviews, and it just kind of took off from there.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
That&#8217;s dope. That&#8217;s so cool to hear because I&#8217;m in the process now on our show of interviewing more Black designers because I told Andy, he&#8217;s a North Carolinian white dude from North Carolina, and he&#8217;s just, he&#8217;s super cool man, and he is definitely an ally. He understands things. He is very encouraging. I keep telling him, &#8220;I want this person on,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, yeah, and he&#8217;s feeding me people that I&#8217;d never even met before seen because he&#8217;s more in that space for knowing people than I am as far as designers, and so it&#8217;s good to see, and so I&#8217;m starting to get more people of color, all colors on our show, but mainly Black people because there was a survey, and I&#8217;ve mentioned this before on other places where I&#8217;ve talked, I think it&#8217;s called Design census.org or design census.com, and they interviewed 9,450, so for arguments sake, let&#8217;s just say 10,000 people.</p>
<p>And only 3% of the people interviewed design wise were Black because that was the space, and then it was like 13% Asian other, but it was 71% white male were designers, 71%, and you look at agencies and you look at the about us, and you go through the headshots and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Wow, there it is right there. This is exactly it.&#8221; Okay, and you go to the next agency. &#8220;Oh, there you go. This is exactly it,&#8221; and that&#8217;s how it is, and it&#8217;s understandable, but there&#8217;s so much talent being missed out on, just even basically from seeing things from a different perspective, being Black and understanding different ideas and stuff.</p>
<p>It was like, for instance, I think also two companies don&#8217;t even really try to be creative anymore. I&#8217;m serious. I&#8217;m serious. Think about the last cool Apple ad you&#8217;ve seen, and so I thought Apple&#8217;s always, like they had this weird thing where they were showing they did this weird for shortening of people holding up their phones. And then they were small silhouettes in the back and it&#8217;s now bigger, and I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Oh, my God, that&#8217;s terrible.&#8221; Here&#8217;s my idea for the perfect Apple ad, apple iPhone, iPhone, if you&#8217;re listening or this service goes back to you, I want my royalties on this shit.</p>
<p>What you do, all you do is you show a phone with a screen off, and you just show the phone screen off on a desk, and I want the desk to be a real desk, not like this perfect pristine thing. I want to see a takeout menu. I mean, real life shit, everything kind of just normal, and then I want to hear two people in the background. You hear a show in the background, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Nah, now I&#8217;m telling you, that&#8217;s the dude.&#8221; This is how it starts. &#8220;&#8216;s the dude from the last night or Night Quest.&#8221; &#8220;No, it&#8217;s not. No, it&#8217;s not.&#8221; &#8220;Yeah, it is.&#8221; It&#8217;s an argument going on and finally you here, &#8220;Hey, Siri?&#8221; &#8220;Yes?&#8221; &#8220;Who was this person then?&#8221; And then it just comes up, it says, &#8220;iPhone,&#8221; and then phones scratched out. It says, &#8220;I want to win this bet,&#8221; so every scenario&#8217;s like that, and then you go do another one, and it&#8217;s in the car in the holder. The phone&#8217;s in the car, in the holder, right?</p>
<p>And you see traffic in the background. It&#8217;s kind of blurry. It&#8217;s nighttime, and you hear two people talking about, &#8220;I&#8217;m telling you the Tacoria is right here.&#8221; And then it&#8217;s like iPhone and Scratcho says, &#8220;I want to find that restaurant.&#8221; Right? Focus on what it does rather than what it is. That was Steve Job&#8217;s big thing, focus on the product, the actual benefits of the product rather than the product itself. So why wouldn&#8217;t they do that? Why wouldn&#8217;t they found a way to push it? Because everybody knows what iPhone is, right? It&#8217;s not a phone. It&#8217;s a mini do wall in your pocket, and so why not focus on that?</p>
<p>And I hardly, and this is no joke, I maybe talk on my phone two times a month, maybe actually talk on my phone two times a month because people know I don&#8217;t like talking on the phone and they&#8217;ll text me, so it&#8217;s like, you can have anything now. I want to win this bet. I want to find a restaurant. I want to see what time that movie starts. It&#8217;s like it does everything for you, so why not mention that and make it fun? People know what it does. People know why they&#8217;re buying an iPhone. You don&#8217;t have to show the camera on the back and how it&#8217;s like, who cares? We all know it has a camera. We all know it takes good pictures. That&#8217;s the given. Just saying that when you design something, it&#8217;s going to look good.</p>
<p>What is a solution you&#8217;re trying to find? What are you trying to do with that solution? And so for me, being a creative person, I&#8217;m always thinking of shit like this, how to solve for a real thing. What would I want to see on a commercial? Anytime I see a commercial and I see a iPhone commercial, it&#8217;s Lily, right? She&#8217;s talking about AT&#038;T and how you can get a free iPhone. I like her. I love that character because it&#8217;s just kind of silly and it&#8217;s fun. It&#8217;s like a nice counter to the Verizon can you hear me now, guy? So that&#8217;s one thing, but it doesn&#8217;t speak about the phone itself. It speaks about AT&#038;T services, so have something that does something to do with the phone, but anyway, I think they&#8217;re missing that because they narrow their search to what looks good on paper rather than what performs well in real life. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
People can present really well on paper, but not be that great in real life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Apple also snaps up a lot of really good designers and art directors, and I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing with them. I mean, I would imagine they work on many of the other parts of the Apple ecosystem. For example, I&#8217;ve never been able to interview anyone that worked at Apple or that, I&#8217;m sorry, that currently works at Apple because they don&#8217;t let their employees do interviews, so it&#8217;s I&#8217;ve interviewed X Apple people when they&#8217;ve told me what they can about it, but I don&#8217;t know what goes on inside that large Taurus building in Cupertino, but that&#8217;s some ironclad NDA action right there.</p>
<p>Whatever is going on. I don&#8217;t know if the creativity necessarily is making its way out to people because I think even with the last iPhone, with the iPhone 14, a lot of people have been like, it&#8217;s not that much of an improvement over the 13, and granted, that&#8217;s probably supply issues and things of that nature too, just in terms of the camera and stuff, but yeah, I don&#8217;t know if Apple is the innovator like it used to be in that aspect.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
No, and also, too, I&#8217;m still rocking my old iPhone 7 plus.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
I&#8217;m still rocking that and I love it. Honestly, I wish they would go back to the four size, the size of the iPhone four. It was just a little bit bigger than a business card. That&#8217;s what I don&#8217;t want. I&#8217;m tired of these phones getting so big. I don&#8217;t want to carry around an iPad. I want to carry around a phone, like the old flip phones. I think Samsung, they had the flip phone, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. The Galaxy Flip or Galaxy Fold or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s pretty cool. I see some problems with the screens possibly being messed up because of all the opening and closing, but I like the idea. How fun was it? Remember how fun it was to end a call just by closing it, closing it shut, like end of the call. Now you have to just push a button violently in order to make sure people know you hung up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
A violent tap, a long press.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
You want to give them those three beeps. You know when they hang up beep, beep, beep?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Okay. That&#8217;s the end of the call. It used to just be slam and that was it. Call over, so that&#8217;s the one thing that phone brings back, which would also be a fun aspect for a marketing standpoint. With this phone, you could now end calls properly. It shows a dude just like, &#8220;Bye,&#8221; slamming the phone.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
I think, yeah, but anyway, tangent.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious with the podcast, and as we talked about little earlier, has that helped you become a better designer now that you&#8217;re able to really speak with other designers in congress on a regular basis about stuff? Has that helped you out?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Oh, I don&#8217;t talk to anybody in Congress or in the Senate at all.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, no, no.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
I know what you said. Not necessarily a better designer, but a better-informed designer. I&#8217;m able to see perspectives in a different way from people who&#8217;ve done certain things, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s helped me be a better designer, just helped me understand where people are coming from and just more exposure. More exposure to anything definitely increases knowledge of something in regards to your field, but I don&#8217;t know if it necessarily makes you better equipped design wise, although it might, I don&#8217;t know. I haven&#8217;t really seen a big uptick in my design skills. Maybe I should just keep interviewing people in the hope that it will rub off via telekinesis because osmosis, you need water, so people say, &#8220;oh, you&#8217;re going to get that osmosis.&#8221; You always need a water source, so you can&#8217;t get it through osmosis, but through telekinesis, possibly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
My mother is a biologist. She tells me that same thing, that exact same thing. People can&#8217;t get stuff through osmosis. I get it. I get it. I get it.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
So you need to have areas of high concentration to low concentration or to living proper in order to have&#8230; Okay, Mom, sorry,</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I get what you mean about being a better-informed designer. Even as I&#8217;ve done this show and I&#8217;ve talked to people all over the world, it lets me know what our differences are, what our similarities are. I feel like a lot of designers have the same issues regardless of where they are, whether it&#8217;s their work or finding work or finding purpose and things like that, but then you see how different it is in parts of Africa versus in the UK versus here in the States, even from the rural areas of the states to big cities and things like that. It has, I think, made me, I get what you mean about it, making you better informed. Just hearing more people&#8217;s perspectives helps you to see a lot farther than what you just might in your own kind of narrow field of vision.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Right. Yeah, exactly, and that&#8217;s exactly what&#8230; You said it so much better.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What kind of advice would you have for any&#8230; Like people are listening to this conversation. They&#8217;re hearing you. They&#8217;re hearing your story. What advice would you give to people that want to follow in your footsteps, they want to have the career that you have?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
First of all&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They want to have the career that you have.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
First of all, I think it&#8217;s good to understand, like I said before, not everybody&#8217;s going to like your work. Right? Everybody&#8217;s not going to like your work, and so you can&#8217;t take it personally. I also think that it&#8217;s good to find a designer whose style you like in different fields, and find multiple influences to help your thought process. I also think it&#8217;s good to find a mentor if you can, someone you trust that will be honest with you. And by honest, I don&#8217;t mean absolutely mean, but I do think you should find someone who&#8217;s not going to bullshit you.</p>
<p>And last, and this is the most important thing that I&#8217;ve found, is just be yourself. Just be yourself. Be unapologetically you. Now granted, there are, and you and I both know this from working with people in the corporate space, you have to figure out a way to tone back a little bit at times, because especially if you&#8217;re a person of color, black, brown, you have to figure out a way to tone back sometimes, because then you&#8217;re seen as being aggressive. You&#8217;re seen as being loud, you&#8217;re seen as being abrupt. You&#8217;re seen as being a disruption. But you can set boundaries by your actions, not answering emails, being cordial [inaudible 01:13:31] people, being firm, and then setting those boundaries. But try your hardest to be yourself because people who will fuck with you will understand you 100%. It&#8217;s not going to be, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve never seen this side of you before.&#8221; That should never come out of anybody&#8217;s mouth who you&#8217;re talking to.</p>
<p>And I say this all the time, that whoever I&#8217;m talking to, I talk to the same way. I talk to six-year-olds this way I&#8217;m talking to you. I&#8217;ll cuss around them because that&#8217;s me. I&#8217;m not going to blatantly go out on my way to cuss, but if something comes up, I will cuss. And it&#8217;s just because that&#8217;s who I am. I&#8217;m not trying to be rude. I&#8217;m not trying to be edgy. I&#8217;m just trying being me. And if that happens, it happens. And at times I realize I&#8217;ve said something and it&#8217;s like, oh, it doesn&#8217;t work the best around my two-year-old nephew, because he&#8217;s a parrot and repeats verbatim with incredible syntax, vernacular and diction, exactly what you&#8217;ve said, so I have to watch that. But be unapologetically you as the biggest takeaway, I would say. But know when to. And this is a horrible thing to say. So it&#8217;s like good advice and bad advice, because you shouldn&#8217;t have to shrink for anybody. But there&#8217;s times in order to get ahead, you kind of have to make sure you do, which is terrible to say.</p>
<p>And if people don&#8217;t like you and they don&#8217;t fuck with you, then you don&#8217;t want to work with them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have there been times in your career where that&#8217;s come back to bite in some way?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Yeah, it has. And we didn&#8217;t mention Shaklee earlier, where I worked, but I basically had a target on my back after speaking back to the VP at some point. And here&#8217;s a fun story, and other people who&#8217;ve heard me on other stuff will probably say, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard this a thousand times.&#8221; When I was working there, there were one, two, three, four, five, like six black people that worked there, maybe seven. And one of the women that worked in a different department that I worked with, she was walking by the VP&#8217;s desk. And the VP, she sat in the middle of the office in it&#8217;s an open office, which for those of you who are listening, open office plans, they&#8217;re terrible for everybody. But anyway, she was walking through [inaudible 01:15:57] open office, and she walks by and she says, and I&#8217;m going to call her Sarah for the conversation, &#8220;Sarah, how are you coming along on that action brochure?&#8221;</p>
<p>The action brochure was a brochure that I was working on that was due for a global conference, which Shaklee holds every year. And last time they did it was in Vegas I think, but I haven&#8217;t thought about that shit for four years. But anyway, &#8220;So where are we on that action brochure for the global conference?&#8221; And Sarah looks at her and says, &#8220;Oh, well, I have it back with creative, and they&#8217;re making changes to it.&#8221; Mind you, I am literally 20, 25 feet from the VP in an open office. And she says, &#8220;Oh, well what can I do to help you? How can I help you?&#8221; The VP says to Sarah. Sarah looks at her confused and says, &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure exactly how you can help. I mean, it&#8217;s with creative right now.&#8221; Being incredibly calm, as Black women have to be in the workplace, or they are assumed to be combative. So that&#8217;s another thing.</p>
<p>And then she says, &#8220;You know what? Forget it.&#8221; The VP, &#8220;Forget it. You go do your thing. And I&#8217;m going to sit here and do my thing. Okay?&#8221; [inaudible 01:17:09] So I hear this and I&#8217;m thinking, this bitch. So I get up and I walk over to my project manager who sits even closer to the VP. And I walk up to her and I say in this exact tone, in this exact voice, &#8220;Was that about the fucking action brochure?&#8221; And she looks at me. And the project manager and I, she&#8217;s dope. I love her. She&#8217;s at a different company now and whatever, but she&#8217;s so cool. She was basically a mom to all of us. And she wasn&#8217;t that much older, but she just had that caring and very organized nature about her. And she goes, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; And I go, &#8220;Tell them if they would stop changing shit, then I&#8217;d be able to get it done.&#8221; And I said it loud enough so the VP would hear it.</p>
<p>And so I started walking back to my desk and the VP does this. &#8220;Oh, oh, oh, I&#8217;m sorry, Kirk, what did you say?&#8221; And I turned to her and I say, &#8220;If you would stop changing shit, then I could get it done.&#8221; So this is what she does. Puts her hands up, like the entire hands up, shoulders back, like, &#8220;Whoa, whoa, whoa, we&#8217;re all on the same team.&#8221; And I said to her, &#8220;Mm-hmm, yeah, right.&#8221; And I went back to my desk.</p>
<p>After that moment, it was like a bullseye was on me. Everybody was like, &#8220;Kirk is leaving early to go do something,&#8221; which I had established because I was leaving early on certain days to get my kids from school and spend time with them, because I was going through a fucked up divorce and custody battle. So I needed every moment with my kids. And then it was like, &#8220;Kirk isn&#8217;t doing his work, or getting work done, or asking for more work.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I was like, &#8220;Motherfuckers.&#8221; So I got called into the office after that one day, or into HR. And I go in there and the first thing I ask is, &#8220;Am I fired?&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, okay, then let&#8217;s talk, because here&#8217;s the thing, if you&#8217;re going to fire me, just fire me. I don&#8217;t want to lecture. I don&#8217;t need to hear anything. Just fire me.&#8221; So they sit down and all these things come up. You&#8217;ve been leaving early. And I said, &#8220;Well, I told you I was going to leave early because it was my supervisor and the HR lady.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I told you I was going to leave early.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Well, what do you do when you get your work done?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, predominantly, I probably either surf the internet or I catch up on other work than I&#8217;m doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>And they go, &#8220;You don&#8217;t ask for more work?&#8221; I say, &#8220;No, why should I? Why should I ask for more work?&#8221; See, Kirk did quiet quitting before quiet quitting was cool. And I said, &#8220;Why should I ask for more work?&#8221; And they go, &#8220;Well, you know [inaudible 01:19:49].&#8221; And I said, &#8220;No.&#8221; They said, &#8220;Well, people have come up to you and you&#8217;ve had your headphones on, and you put boxes up on your desk.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yeah, because I need to get work done and I&#8217;m right next to the bathroom. And people know that I&#8217;m friendly and they want to talk to me, and I don&#8217;t have time to talk sometimes, so I put the headphones in and get stuff done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People have also said that you&#8217;re unapproachable,&#8221; and we all know what that&#8217;s code for. You&#8217;re Black and scary. People-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Or that you&#8217;re just Black.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Right? And so I said, well, I don&#8217;t understand that. And I look at my supervisor and they go, &#8220;Yeah, because you might be hurting people&#8217;s feelings.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay, well,&#8221; I look at my supervisor and I say, &#8220;hey, have I ever given you any flack for a job?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I ever done a bad job?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever been displeased with anything that I&#8217;ve done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see what the problem is though.&#8221; I said, &#8220;My job is to do the best I can in the time allotted, with the information that I have. That is my job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You [inaudible 01:20:51] hurt people&#8217;s feelings.&#8221;</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t give a fuck about people&#8217;s feelings. That&#8217;s not my job.&#8221; And I knew I wasn&#8217;t hurting anybody&#8217;s feelings because I would have people come back to me repeatedly, specifically asking for me to do work for them. I think it&#8217;s a combination of jealousy and other people in my department who I worked with who were fucking busters.</p>
<p>And I think it&#8217;s also the fact that I didn&#8217;t march to their drum. I didn&#8217;t do everything that they said. So they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, well how can you do this?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Nah.&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; And then the HR lady asked, &#8220;Kirk, do you like working here?&#8221; I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Bitch, what the fuck you talking about? How can you ask me that? You already know the answer. You&#8217;re asking me a rhetorical question. You already know the fucking answer.&#8221; Like, &#8220;Dude, you know the answer.&#8221; So I sit there and I look at her dead in the eyes and I say, &#8220;I really like who I work with.&#8221; And that was it. I didn&#8217;t say anything else. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;You really think I&#8217;m going to dig the hole with a shovel you gave me so you can knock me in it, so you can shoot me and put me in it like a damn gangster movie?&#8221; No, I&#8217;m not digging a hole. I&#8217;m going to say what I have to say and it&#8217;s going to be honest. I did the people I work with there.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, man, this is the biggest thing other people can remember too. Working with people is about relationships. And when you have a good relationship with someone, your work is going to be better than it would be if you have a bad relationship with someone. That&#8217;s just, that&#8217;s everyday life. That&#8217;s a job. That&#8217;s a marriage. That&#8217;s a basketball team, that&#8217;s a baseball team, that&#8217;s sports, whatever, it&#8217;s everywhere. So I have people, and I can think of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven people who I used to work with at Shaklee that have left Shaklee and have come to me for work, to help them do things.</p>
<p>Now, if I was that bad of an employee or that bad of a person, they wouldn&#8217;t want to work with me. They wouldn&#8217;t seek me out afterwards. It&#8217;s like that&#8217;s the thing that I measure from being not only a good designer but a decent person to work with. And that&#8217;s important to me. So just realize that people at work aren&#8217;t your friends, but there are people who can become friends when you get to a certain point. And there&#8217;s several people who I work with from there that I really enjoy working with and love. And so there were people that I loved there. But I couldn&#8217;t say that I actually liked working there. I would have half of my face go numb going into work. I would have headaches. I would have terrible anxiety. I would sit in my car at times. I would start around 8:30 and I would get to work at about 8:20 and sit there until 8:50 or 9:00, just not wanting to go into the office. That&#8217;s how bad it was.</p>
<p>And the day my wife said to me, &#8220;You know what? You should look into seeing if you can get time off for stress relief.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay, cool, bet.&#8221; So I talked to the Kaiser Permanente psychiatry department, which is non-existent. It&#8217;s terrible. And I talked to the dude and then either in person or over the phone or whatever, I don&#8217;t remember. But he said, &#8220;You know what, they normally only give out two.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to give you three weeks.&#8221; And I thought, as soon as he said, I&#8217;m giving you three weeks from work, this weight had been lifted. I mean, right now talking about it, my face is kind of going numb. That&#8217;s how stressful and traumatic it was being at that fucking work environment. And when the three weeks was almost up, I started having the same fucking symptoms coming up.</p>
<p>Same shit would happen at home, knowing I had to go back in. And my wife said to me, &#8220;Just quit.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Really?&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; And the moment she said yeah, it&#8217;s like the weight had been lifted. I felt like Atlas finally could stop holding up the world. Like, &#8220;This is someone else&#8217;s job. And ain&#8217;t my job.&#8221; There was that much stress and pressure on me. And when people were talking about, &#8220;Oh, you quit because you were mentally not there,&#8221; or whatever, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;You&#8217;re fucking right I did, because it was killing me.&#8221; It was literally killing me to be in that environment. And I don&#8217;t think people understand the amount of shit that other people can&#8217;t escape from. There&#8217;s people who can&#8217;t do what I do. I was lucky. I was fortunate to have a supportive partner and to have someone who cared enough about my mental health, as well as my physical health to say, &#8220;You need to quit that fucking job.&#8221;</p>
<p>And my former boss who was working at a different company was just telling me like, oh, I need to stick it out. [inaudible 01:25:40] said, &#8220;No, you need to quit. Since you started working here, this, this, this and this have happened to you. All these physical things have happened to you based upon your job. The stress is killing you.&#8221; So finally she quit and she said she feels so much better already. She&#8217;s getting back into a rhythm. She&#8217;s starting to exercise. She&#8217;s sleeping better. And it&#8217;s like, yes. And I don&#8217;t think people realize the importance of A, working in a hostile work environment, but B, working in a hostile environment by being a marginalized person, i.e. not a cis white male. And it&#8217;s tough. It&#8217;s tough and it&#8217;s tougher for other people in certain situations. So yeah, that&#8217;s the reason why it left. That&#8217;s my experience there. Overall, I learned a lot while being there and I met some nice people. But I can honestly say I would not work there again.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds a lot my time working at AT&#038;T. It was just, oh my God, not great, not great. AT&#038;T at least at the time when I was about to quit, I thought I had had Crohn&#8217;s disease or something. Every time I thought about going in or had to go in, I would automatically get sick. I would automatically have stomach issues. I thought I had IBS or something. And then once I quit, it all just cleared up. It just like, poof, vanished. It was gone. So yeah, working in those stressful environments can definitely do a toll on you mentally, physically. Yeah, I know what that&#8217;s like.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Yeah. And I&#8217;m sorry you had to go through that. It&#8217;s not a good experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
It&#8217;s difficult. See, you empathize and you sympathize and it&#8217;s hard for people to understand it if they haven&#8217;t gone through it. How can you let that happen? Actually, dude that used to work there at Shaklee went somewhere else. And all the shit was happening to him from an abusive narcissistic boss. And he said, &#8220;Oh, I have to quit.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I remember criticizing you for quitting Shaklee.&#8221; But he said, &#8220;Now I understand. I apologize because I had no idea before.&#8221; Like, &#8220;Yeah, man, it&#8217;s real. It&#8217;s real.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
As much as I don&#8217;t like Kanye West, one of these great lyrics from one of his songs, he said, and I&#8217;m paraphrasing because I don&#8217;t know the exact words, because it&#8217;s Kanye, he said, &#8220;Where do you want to be when you&#8217;re 25? She turned around, looked at me, and she said, alive.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Damn, that&#8217;s kind of how I feel. I would like to say I want to be retired in Hawaii, sipping on pina coladas and mai tais and watching the turtles. But reality, I just want to be around. I mean, I want to be somewhat healthy, doing stuff with my wife, chilling, working, just enjoying life.</p>
<p>As far as career goals, I really would&#8217;ve liked to finish a script I&#8217;m working on, finish a video game idea, finish a graphic novel. I just want to finish something, because I have all these ideas and they all kind of go around and sync up. Oh, here&#8217;s something too. See, the ADHD brain is working. I&#8217;m working on a project right now that has a certain character I meet up. And so this is what I was thinking. I hadn&#8217;t seen it done before and I think it would be kind of fun. I was going to start a character and the first thing [inaudible 01:29:07] do was write a little brief book intro about him. And the second thing I wanted to do was write a or design a video game that picks up where the book left off. And that&#8217;s the only media it&#8217;s available in. It&#8217;s not going to be in a book, it&#8217;s not going to be online. It&#8217;s just going to be only the game.</p>
<p>And then after the game, I want to make an animated movie or show where that picks off and pick up from there. So it crosses three different media, but it continues one story. And I hadn&#8217;t seen that before. And I was thinking maybe because it&#8217;s not as big of a deal or it&#8217;s too hard to do, but just different things too. And I want the video game to be able to transfer, like when you&#8217;re playing it from a 2D scroller to a 3D sandbox. I want them to interact that way, where you can just pause it, change settings, and then go to a 2D scroller. Think of Rayman versus Batman Arkham Knights or any game like that, God of War or Tomb Raider. So you go from that to a 2D scroller, like Kung-Fu or a Rayman or whatever, or Kung-Fu Master, that was my idea behind that.</p>
<p>But I want to do something along those lines from my personal, not personal, but just for my creative zeal. But mainly just in five years, I want to be able to chill and probably have some better relationships with my sons, my twins. We go deep when we talk. This is always me. So I&#8217;d probably like to have a better relationship with them too in five years. But we&#8217;ll see what happens.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So just to wrap things up, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where could they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
You know what? Just to wrap it up, thank you so much for asking me that question Maurice. I&#8217;m putting on my podcast voice. I want to tell you about [inaudible 01:31:09] &#8230; No, people can find my agency work at Mind the Font dot com, so it&#8217;s like M-I-N-D-T-H-E-F-O-N-T dot com. And then I have something else I do, just kind of my own weird personal thing. It&#8217;s called Vsla Brand, but it&#8217;s V as in victory, S-L-A brand dot com. And on there, it&#8217;s just kind of my own personal stuff. I do have some swag that I sell on there, like hoodies and a T-shirt. I also have a thing called Thought Spot on there, where I write down random stuff that I&#8217;ve been thinking or what I&#8217;m going through at the time. And I date it, so you can read that. It kind of like is just me unfiltered. And I think that&#8217;s it. And also if you look up Kirk Visola, you&#8217;re going to find me, which is everything.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty weird. You can find podcasts I&#8217;ve done, old pictures of me from newspapers when I had dreads. Yeah, Kirk Visola, that&#8217;s me. Just type it in, you&#8217;ll find me. And also too, anybody listening to this, please seriously reach out to me, and if you want any questions or ideas or thoughts or anything, reach out to me, because we don&#8217;t communicate enough, especially other Black designers, other Black creatives, we should be communicating with each other. Maurice and I were talking about this beforehand. And I told him to call me anytime he wants to vent or talk or chat or whatever, because we need to lean on each other in order to make each other strong. So reach out to me anytime y&#8217;all. And Maurice, thank you so much for having me on. That&#8217;s it for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, no, this was a really great conversation. Kirk Visola, thank you again so much for coming on the show. Really I think, if there&#8217;s anything that&#8217;s come across in this conversation, it is your just unfiltered, complete authenticity about yourself and your work, and your attitude to the work and everything. I hope that that&#8217;s something that as people certainly look at what they want to accomplish this year, they can sort of follow in your stead about being yourself, and knowing that by doing that and by being themselves, that they can succeed as well. So thank you so much again for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been at your local Target lately, then there&#8217;s a chance you&#8217;re familiar with illustrator and entrepreneur Domonique Brown. She&#8217;s the founder of <a href="https://domoink.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">DomoInk</a>, a contemporary lifestyle brand including apparel and home d√©cor, all with art by Domonique. Pick up some of her products in <a href="https://www.target.com/c/celebrate-black-history-month/-/N-bw2fb" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Target&#8217;s Black History Month collection</a> and bless your space, y&#8217;all!</p>
<p>Our conversation began with Domonique giving me a behind-the-scenes peek at her business, and she outlined some of the unique challenges she&#8217;s faced as her work becomes more popular. We also talked about breaking out from your 9-to-5 job to do you own thing, her aspirations to go into fine art, and we discussed Black art and mainstream exposure through other Black creatives. Domonique is a woman on the rise, and I know we&#8217;ll only be seeing more and more of her work in the future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Hi, I&#8217;m Domonique Brown. I&#8217;m an illustrator and founder of DomoINK.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How have things been going for you so far this year?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been going really well. I started the year off with my new collaboration with Target for Black History Month, and also I have a collaboration within the same store of Target with American Greetings, where I am selling greeting cards.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, that&#8217;s big. That&#8217;s big. I&#8217;ll make sure that we have links to those in the show notes, so people can check those out. I saw on TikTok, which is actually how I first discovered you, I saw a TikTok from Tabitha Brown. She was picking up your stuff in Target. She was like, &#8220;Oh, I got to get these coasters and I got to get this.&#8221; And we&#8217;ll talk about how that all came about. But it really seems like last year was quite a year for you, and now you&#8217;re starting off this year with this big collaboration. Are there any other things you really want to try to accomplish this year?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I really want to get back into the fine arts. I think right now with all these collaborations, there has been a huge focus on my digital work. I&#8217;ve been lucky with Target, and I guess I could say also with American Greetings, that they kind of have been, I guess, touching more on my, I guess my artwork on paper. So I really want to build value towards my original artwork. Because before I started doing digital designs, I was just in class drawing with pens and markers. So I think I really just want to get back into, I guess, back to basics and try to get into some more art galleries. My huge dream is to get into art to cell and yeah, just really just get back into just being a fine artist. The digital design work is cool, but I want to have both. I&#8217;ll say, there you go. I&#8217;ll just say I want both, to be a digital artist and be a fine artist at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Let&#8217;s jump right in there and talk about DomoINK, which is your company. I&#8217;m looking at the website here, and you&#8217;ve got art, you have home decor, you have apparel, and it&#8217;s all your artwork, which is amazing. Tell me about how you got started creating DomoINK?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, I think DomoINK really just came from me just wanting to have art for my own space. When I first started DomoINK, I had just moved into my first home and we just had a lot of empty walls. So I was like, okay, let me just go to the store and see if I can find something that spoke to me. I would go to all these different stores and I would see nothing. And say, if I did find Black art, I felt like it was very generic, it may be just an African woman sitting there. But I was like, okay, I want something else. I want each space to say something different. This room could be filled with abstract art. This room could be line art. I just wanted more variety. So I just started drawing from my own space and posting it on social media, and people were like, &#8220;I want this.&#8221; And I was like, okay.</p>
<p>So I decided to create my own store and just build it up to offer a variety of just unique products that will connect to people who are also going through the same thing as me. I think as a Black woman, it&#8217;s so tough to find art and decor, or even apparel that represents you. So I wanted to have it to be like DomoINK is a one-stop shop where you can find Black art, Black cultured products 365 days a year, instead of having to wait for a retailer to offer a Black History Month collection in order to be able to get something that&#8217;s Black.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I mean, speaking of social media, I love how you&#8217;re using social media to kind of provide a glimpse, not just into your artistic practice, but also where your work is at. Like I mentioned, I saw you on TikTok, but you&#8217;re on Twitter, you&#8217;re on Instagram, you have your own TikTok. How does social media help out with what you do? Does it just help you get to a wider audience?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I feel like it allows you to build your own destiny, I feel. I feel like before, let&#8217;s say in the nineties where there&#8217;s no social media, you just have to get discovered from someone walking into an art gallery. But I think with social media has allowed me to make my own art gallery at basically no cost to where I can reach hundreds of thousands of people, and especially if a video goes viral. So with me being able to post on social media, it has allowed me to connect with you, like as you said, you saw me on social media. But then also even for brands, brands come across. Recently, for Bleacher Report, I had did an illustration for their social media platform. They found me because of a viral video I did of me drawing Martin Luther King with crayon. So I think it&#8217;s just social media is so powerful to where you can really build your dream out through it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I saw that video too. That&#8217;s a really good illustration.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you approach creating a new piece of art or a new design project?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I think when I first started, I honestly was drawing for the trend. Like if I saw, let&#8217;s say a celebrity&#8217;s birthday was coming up, I&#8217;ll illustrate really quick for that. But I think I was like, okay, I don&#8217;t want to just be drawing celebrities. I really want to draw something that&#8217;s meaningful to me and also could relate to someone in their own home. So I think with me having my own store now, I&#8217;m trying to think in a perspective of, I guess you could really say what&#8217;s marketable and also just connects with people. So that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been going more in the direction of drawing the everyday man or everyday woman, and they&#8217;re just living life. I think my artwork is all about positivity and just joy. You&#8217;ll never see me draw anything negative. I just really want it to be, when someone looks at my piece, they feel like that could be them. That could be their aunt, that could be their uncle, something that they want to bring into their home and feel good about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there a particular design that you&#8217;ve done that really took off that you weren&#8217;t expecting?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I think it was when I did my Black hair series. I really wanted something that was very abstract, but at the same time, you can look at it and be like, &#8220;That&#8217;s a Black woman. That&#8217;s a Black man.&#8221; So it&#8217;s basically people, their hair is black, their skin is black, and if they have any accessories, their accessories will be in gold, their sunglasses, their earrings, but their apparel is basically African textures and tones. And I just did it one day and I just made a whole series out of it, and I posted it on social media and people were just like, &#8220;I want this. I want this.&#8221; And I was like, okay. I&#8217;m like, I understand now. I think before me, I was just thinking very about myself of, okay, I really want art that looks like me, that looks like my family and my friends. And when I posted it, everybody else was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s me or That looks like my grandpa.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you didn&#8217;t have anyone particular in mind when you created that?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
No, it was really for myself in a sense of me just, I guess from me just dealing with never finding artwork that looks like me when I go shopping, and I just posted it and it just took off.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, are there any sort of unique challenges or opportunities that you faced doing your work or exhibiting your work as a Black designer?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Oh, I will say, I think that there is still a lack of, I guess, companies wanting to utilize Black art. Sometimes I&#8217;ll feel like maybe, let&#8217;s say if I didn&#8217;t just draw Black figures and I just drew, let&#8217;s say white figures, I might be able to get more publication. I might be able to get more views on videos. As you see, I think when you are watching, I guess the trend with TikTok, as you&#8217;ve seen with Black creators, they have such a harder time being able to get the same amount of money for brand deals or the same amount of views. So I do feel that same kind of maybe oppression in a sense as a Black artist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I hear that a lot on TikTok, and in a way it makes me wonder why people even, well, I wouldn&#8217;t say why people, why Black creators still mess with the platform, considering how unfriendly it seems to be. But I guess it just has a great reach?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
It does have a great reach. And then I feel like if this is with TikTok, why wouldn&#8217;t it be the same with Instagram or any other platform? So I think it&#8217;s just something, just an overall, I guess the thing that one day I hope whatever end, it&#8217;s going to be a really appeal battle to end discrimination. But I guess for me, I&#8217;m on TikTok because there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it, but what I can do at least try to reach the people who would be interested in having my art in their home.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That makes sense. And I&#8217;d imagine you&#8217;re also reaching people there that you might not reach on your other platforms. Maybe they&#8217;re not on Twitter that often or Instagram or something, but they&#8217;re on TikTok.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s why I try to post everywhere. I&#8217;d be posting my artwork on LinkedIn and people are on LinkedIn just trying to find a job, but I&#8217;m like, hey, you never know who could be watching.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Very true. Look, a lot of people get jobs off LinkedIn, so-</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
They do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; there is no problem with posting there at all. None.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Right? And then at the same time, you might be able to find a job on LinkedIn by posting art, so you never know. So I just try to post everywhere I can and just see what could come from it. It doesn&#8217;t hurt. I mean, it doesn&#8217;t cost anything to pose, so might as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I need to adopt that mentality. I need to think about it that way.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Your collection with Target, like I said, I saw that on TikTok. I saw that on Tabitha Brown&#8217;s TikTok. How did that come about? Did that partnership happen?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
What&#8217;s so funny is that I didn&#8217;t even talk to Tabitha. There was nothing. It was just all of a sudden I wake up in the morning and people are in my DMs sending me the video, like, &#8220;Do you see Tabitha Brown posted this?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, what? And I look and I&#8217;m like, oh my God, this is so cool. I was sitting there texting my friends, writing people, &#8220;That&#8217;s my cousin. I&#8217;m Domonique Brown. She&#8217;s Tabitha Brown. Don&#8217;t play.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
See, I didn&#8217;t even think of that. I didn&#8217;t even think of that until you said it, so.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Right? I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s my cousin, y&#8217;all. I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t tell y&#8217;all.&#8221; No, but it was something really, really cool and it just felt good to see. She could have just went in that store and just bought, or just basically just highlighted her collection. She has her vegan food collection this year. So it was really nice that she went over to the Black History Collection, she highlighted a few creators and then she walked to the back. Or she could have did it in reverse, she could have highlighted her collection first and then threw us at the end. But it was just so sweet that she started off by highlighting small businesses.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. How did you first get to working with Target?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Honestly, they found me through another brand collaboration. I had a brand collaboration with Jiggy Puzzles. And for that deal, I had created a piece where it&#8217;s literally two sneakers walking through California, and it was called Cali Views. I reached out to them, I showed them the art piece, and then Jiggy Puzzles put my artwork on their next puzzle collection. And someone, a Target buyer, saw it, bought the puzzle and fell in love with it and decided to reach out to me and see if I was interested in doing a collection with them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now I see the items that are on Target&#8217;s website now. You&#8217;ve got two pieces of wall art, you&#8217;ve got an art kit, there&#8217;s some coasters, there&#8217;s a wall calendar. We&#8217;ll make sure to link all of that in the show notes, so people can go ahead and grab those if they&#8217;re not able to get them from their local Target.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you maintain a sense of authenticity and individuality in your work while it appeals to such a mass audience? Target is mass market, it&#8217;s as big as you can get. How do you maintain yourself in your art through that?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I think what helps me a lot is that my artwork, I guess what makes it so authentic is that I am a Black woman and I&#8217;m literally just drawing from my own experiences and basically just illustrating what I would want to see. And I think with my background in marketing and also just studying PR and advertising design, I feel like I kind of have that idea of always trying to create something that is marketable to a wider audience instead of just creating just for me. I feel like if I was just drawing for myself, it probably wouldn&#8217;t be as clean, I will say. It would be more of me just doodling or sketching something out. But with me having that mentality of I&#8217;m designing something that will literally make someone happy and feel like they&#8217;re represented. I&#8217;m always trying to illustrate that. And at the same time, the work that I&#8217;m putting out, I guess, speaks to me as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, earlier as I was doing my research for this, I thought it was super interesting that you were running this mega business of DomoINK while also having a nine to five. But as we started recording, you told me that&#8217;s now changed, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yes. That has now changed. I think what really pushed me to create DomoINK was that I had the ability to work from home. By working from home, it takes away the whole commuting, you getting dressed from work, you taking that long drive home for. My job, it was based in Orange County, that&#8217;s like an hour drive or two hours in traffic. So I mean, just being at home, it gave me so much more free time than I ever had when I was just working in an office.</p>
<p>I mean, it&#8217;s bittersweet because it was, the opportunity for me to work from home came from the pandemic, but you&#8217;re stuck in the house all the time. So with me being stuck in the house all the time, and then also the workload had kind of decreased as well because of people just calling into&#8230; I guess from my job, it was just less work to do because there wasn&#8217;t much to do because of the pandemic. So it gave me it lot of time to really just figure out how can I run a business? And I just went forward. I&#8217;d never run a business before, except having an Etsy store where I&#8217;m selling pens and earrings a couple years back. But I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing, and I just was just going along. I&#8217;m like, okay, I&#8217;m going to start selling artwork. I&#8217;m going to start selling apparel. Now I&#8217;m going to start selling plates, I&#8217;m going to start selling puzzles. And it just blew up into what it is now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Was there a particular moment that it blew up for you?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I will say by 2021, it felt like it really took off was because I started getting published in different articles for BuzzFeed and just doing a lot of brand collaborations. I think with me collaborating with different companies, it brought a lot of awareness to DomoINK. And also just brought trustability towards it. Just basically, I think people started to believing in what I was pushing out. You can go on Instagram and see someone has a shop, but you&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;That&#8217;s really cute.&#8221; But I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Am I actually going to get the product?&#8221; All the time.</p>
<p>So I think with me just getting so much, I guess brand awareness, it really just took off from me where people were buying all the time from me, especially around Christmastime when I did CNBC Make It. I had so many sales every single day. My original artwork was selling and I sell my original artwork up to $5,000 and just to wake up and see that, and my account was just absolutely insane. So I guess if I had to pinpoint a certain moment of where I felt I really made it with DomoInk was CNBC.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. That is amazing. That is really amazing. Sounds like that big press really kind of helped out because it got your work out there nationwide, probably worldwide.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, it really did. Because I was getting orders from Australia and United Kingdom. I&#8217;m like, you guys want to pay that international shipping? It just felt really good because it was like, there&#8217;s so many artists in this world, and for someone to sit there and just want my artwork in that small space of their bedroom or large space behind their couch. It was just a really good feeling to know, okay, what I&#8217;m creating is meaningful out here. It&#8217;s not just something I&#8217;m just throwing against the wall. So it just felt good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s learn more about the artist behind the art. I mean, we spent this time talking about DomoINK. And we&#8217;ll get into more of the brand collapse and stuff you&#8217;ve done later, but tell me more about where you grew up? You&#8217;re originally from Pomona, California, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yes, I am from Pomona, California. It&#8217;s a cool city. There&#8217;s nothing to do in Pomona. I will say that Pomona is known for the LA County Fair. I would say that was the big highlight of it. But I think what shaped me as an artist to want to illustrate more, I guess be more of a Black like&#8230; oh, I guess I&#8217;ll say I&#8217;ll draw more Black art, was that when I was growing up, it wasn&#8217;t that many Black kids where I was growing up. Pomona is Hispanic. It&#8217;s basically the majority of Pomona is Hispanic. So for me, I was growing up, my best friends were all Hispanic. But I think I guess my first culture shock was me being around&#8230; basically being a majority of Black people was when I worked at the Post Office, surprisingly. That&#8217;s when I started working out in LA. So that&#8217;s when I did my shift.</p>
<p>I think it was very educational too, in a sense, because before I&#8217;m always around Hispanics. I guess I&#8217;ll say my culture was Hispanic in a way, when I&#8217;m out at school and everything, but obviously when I&#8217;m at home, that&#8217;s Black culture time, me spending time with my cousins in LA and stuff. So I&#8217;ve always kind of just been out in LA really most of my life. I grew up in Pomona, but I spent a lot of time in LA working or hanging out with family.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now were you doing a lot of drawing and stuff as a kid too?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I was doing a lot of illustrations. I think for me, drawing was my escape from school. Even though I have a masters, I never was a school kid. I will say I don&#8217;t know how I did it. I look back and be like, how did I do that? I never focused, I will say. I could look at my college notes or my elementary notes and there&#8217;s always a drawing on the side of it. That was literally my escape from having to be bored in class or just be bored, just anywhere was, it could be a long drive from my home to Vegas for vacation and I&#8217;m drawing in the car. So art was definitely an escape, and it was just fun for me. I never really thought about being an artist when I grew up. It was just like, oh, a little passion project, I guess, I&#8217;ll say a hobby.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, so it was a hobby, but you didn&#8217;t necessarily think, oh, this is something that I could do for a living?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
No, because I guess for me, it was like, okay, how do you even be an artist? How do you become, I guess now the huge artists are Kerry James Marshall or Bisa Butler, how do you get to that level? I just thought it was just like, you have to know somebody. And I&#8217;m like, I live in Pomona. There&#8217;s nothing going on out here. Am I supposed to get discovered at the fair? Where am I supposed to get discovered? So I felt like where I was, there was nothing for me. So I was like, what I&#8217;m going to do is I&#8217;m going to study into the Plan B options of, okay, I could be a graphic designer anywhere. I can do marketing for any company. But to be an artist, I don&#8217;t understand how to do that. So I&#8217;m going to focus on something that I can easily go on Indeed and apply for.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I gotcha. I gotcha. I mean, I grew up in a small town too, smaller than Pomona, but I grew up in a small town. And I know what you mean, when you have this kind of creative aptitude, it&#8217;s hard to tell, if you don&#8217;t see it around you, if you don&#8217;t see examples around you of how can I turn this into something? Is this just going to be a hobby that I do because I don&#8217;t know how I could do this for a living? So I get exactly where you&#8217;re coming from there.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;ve mentioned your MBA. You went to Cal Poly Pomona, majored in public relations, and you said you have an MBA, that&#8217;s in marketing from CSU Dominguez Hills. How has your education in marketing and PR helped you out as a design entrepreneur?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I think it helped out a lot. I think with me going to school, while I was in school for, I was in school from 2011 to 2019. So I think of me just always constantly working on, I guess, campaigns for my homework, my presentations, I&#8217;m always trying to create ways to, how do you&#8230; I think one of my class projects was like, how do you save Chipotle? When they had that whole E. coli PR crisis. We had to make a fake campaign, create fake ads, how to bring a customer base back. So I think with me just always loving how to build a brand has led to me doing it with DomoINK to where I have full control of it in a sense. I&#8217;m not working with some other company&#8217;s logo or anything. It&#8217;s me. Everything is me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look at your body of work, I mean of everything that you&#8217;ve done so far, is there a particular project or a piece of art that you&#8217;re the most proud of?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I would say my deal with Target is probably my biggest one, I will say. Because for me, I always grew up going to Target. I worked at Target, so it&#8217;s a full circle.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That is a full circle moment. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. I used to work at Target. And I think it was just funny because when I worked at Target, I didn&#8217;t care. I started working there, I was 18. Yeah, I was 18 years old when I worked there. It was like my second job I ever had. And I just came to work. I didn&#8217;t care. I was a cashier, I was just ringing up people. And I didn&#8217;t even show up my last week. I was a seasonal employee, and they were like, &#8220;Okay, you&#8217;re done with your seasonal time.&#8221; And I was like, okay. And I just never came back. They were like, &#8220;Oh, are you going to come back for the last week?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m just going to just go.&#8221; So I left on a bad note. It was just so bad. So it was just funny. So when Target reached out to me and I told them my story about me working at Target, I was like, they&#8217;re probably going to say no to me. They&#8217;re going to look at my record and be like, &#8220;She never came to work. She didn&#8217;t even show up her last week of work. She&#8217;s terrible.&#8221; But I&#8217;m a new person now. That&#8217;s how I looked at it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, we can&#8217;t be held responsible for those early jobs in our career. I mean, yeah, charge that one to the game. You&#8217;re good with that.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
We got to, yeah, I was like, that was 10 years ago. Now I&#8217;m older now. But I think that probably even helped me too with me getting to deal with Target was just me just talking about, I used to work there.</p>
<p>It was definitely a full circle moment for me. And then also I like Target so much because the product line is a representation of the variety of styles that I do. Like the coasters, the line art. The art prints is my artwork that I did on paper that has just been converted to art print. The mugs is my fine artwork. And the calendar that they sell has more of my digital artwork and different styles. So it was just really nice to just have the full representation of me and then just have DomoINK to be inside a Target. It wasn&#8217;t just like, oh, they just through my artwork on something and then it&#8217;s just my name on the corner. If you look at the packaging, it says DomoINK. It has my name. It has a picture of my face. It was just really cool to just see how far my business has grown since the pandemic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now a lot of artists I&#8217;m seeing now are wrapped up in a bunch of different kind of, I guess, tech intersections. I guess that&#8217;s kind of a good way to talk about it. I know last year there was a lot of talk about artists making NFTs. And then this year, well also last year, probably going into this year too, a lot of talk about AI generated art, stuff like that. Do you think about the future of the art and design industry and how it might be impacted by tech? Do you see your work in those capacities?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, I guess the first thing will be like NFTs. I wish I was ahead of the game with that. I have a friend who recently made $100,000 in one day selling NFTs. And I&#8217;m like, how the heck-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Woo!</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
&#8230; Yeah. I was like, dang, what was I doing during that time? But I feel with, I guess when the economy probably gets some stability, I think NFTs will probably definitely grow. I went to DesignerCon a few months ago, I think it was in November, and people were just standing in line just trying to get them a rare NFT. So I definitely think it&#8217;s probably something that will stick around once the economy gets back together, as you see with Bitcoin dropping or if you got your money in stocks, it&#8217;s on the negative right now, the economy.<br>
But I think with the AI generated thing, I think it sucks because in a sense that let&#8217;s say that person was going to buy a digital portrait from someone, but then with this AI generated art, they can just make their portrait for free or just download an app and pay $8. So I think it definitely hurts artists who their business is based off of commissions. And then also this whole AI generated thing is also stealing people&#8217;s art to make those art, I mean the little AI thing. So definitely, it&#8217;s cool, but it&#8217;s definitely hurtful to artists overall.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. One interesting thing that I saw from that, I think it was late last year, is not just people of course sharing this art widely over social media, but also just how many people, and I&#8217;ll be blunt, how many Black people were like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe y&#8217;all are paying for that. You paid money for that?&#8221; The gross devaluing of creative work is mind blowing to me, first of all.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Oh yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know. Did you see that? Did you see those kind of things going on?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I did. I did see that. I think it is definitely true, even for, let&#8217;s say, even for me as an artist, someone asks me to draw them a picture, and I&#8217;ll tell them, let&#8217;s say they want something super crazy, they&#8217;re like, we want a three-foot drawing or something. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You know that&#8217;s going to cost a couple thousand. That&#8217;s time.&#8221; And they&#8217;re just stunned by it. It&#8217;s like, you&#8217;re paying for my time, and also you&#8217;re just paying for me just having to use my supplies. I&#8217;m shipping it to you. You have to think about it. Just because I draw for fun doesn&#8217;t mean I want to draw you for free.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. And also just with materials and stuff like that, and time? All that costs money.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. And then I think people have taken the fact that it is your time. And also you&#8217;re paying for the person&#8217;s past too. The person spent 10 years to get to this level. So you&#8217;re paying for that experience as well. Because I mean, yeah, you can go to a college and maybe get a kid to draw something for $50, but will it look that great? And then even if it is really great, how do you feel good ripping them off? They still spent a good amount of time doing that. You wouldn&#8217;t want to work for $5 an hour. So why would you want an artist to do so?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. One thing that I&#8217;ve been telling some artists is that inevitably people are going to still, I mean, they&#8217;re still going to use this AI generated art. Because to me, this is just the next step from people doing Facetune or a little FaceApp or Photoshop, whatever here and there, this is kind of the next step from that. Because you&#8217;re already seeing people use them for avatar pictures and stuff like that. I&#8217;ve seen them on dating apps, so people are already-</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Oh my God.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; Yeah. People are already going the distance with this. But I told some artists, especially ones that do commissions, I&#8217;m like, look, if anybody brings you AI art, just don&#8217;t do it. Because somebody&#8217;s going to come to an artist and be like, &#8220;Yeah, I made this with Lensa or Midjourney or whatever, &#8220;Can you change this? Can you touch this up?&#8221; And I&#8217;m telling them, don&#8217;t do it. Just say no.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. And also I guess too, I guess a lot of this AI art is from stolen artwork. So you don&#8217;t want to attach your name to something and then someone comes out and says, &#8220;You just stole my artwork. All you did was change the color of the hair. You want to get involved in it.&#8221; And also you&#8217;re just basically supporting people getting their artwork stolen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I heard that Getty Images is suing Stable Diffusion and I think another AI art maker. I think it&#8217;s Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, suing both of them because their system scraped some Getty Images stuff. And now when people try to generate the images, they&#8217;ll come out with a mangled Getty Images watermark. Because they put that big watermark my on all their pictures. So I think it&#8217;s certainly something that, I don&#8217;t know what legislation&#8217;s going to do with relation to that, but I mean, I kind of feel like the cat&#8217;s out of the bag, people are still going to use it. Now, whether or not they value it? That&#8217;s a whole other story.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, I don&#8217;t know it will be valuable if you became an AR artist, but I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s so new. For me, I haven&#8217;t really dabbled with it too much because every time when I tried, I do not how the portrait looks. I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t know who this person&#8217;s supposed to be. But I definitely see where it&#8217;s going to be a lot of, I guess, issues with it. But I don&#8217;t know. I feel like people are using it for their profile pictures. It kind of reminds me of back in the day where people would use the cartoon filter for their pictures.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Or the Snapchat filters or stuff like that. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. I think it&#8217;s more of a little trend for right now. And then once eventually people just get over it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Which, it&#8217;s actually interesting, the week that we&#8217;re recording this, Snapchat is actually discontinuing one of their apps. It&#8217;s called Snap Camera. You can download it for your laptop, so you can use Snapchat filters on your webcam. They&#8217;re discontinuing that. They&#8217;re like, we&#8217;re not doing this anymore. I think part of it is because they fired thousands of people last year. But I&#8217;m wondering though if we&#8217;ll start to see some companies pull back on AI for art purposes. I mean, I think AI is already being used in a lot of stuff anyway. Photoshop has been used in AI for years now with Content-Aware Fill and stuff like that. But yeah, it&#8217;s going to be interesting to see what happens in the future, especially as more companies start to throw legislation, or throw lawsuits, I should say, behind this stuff.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yes, it is going to be interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now we&#8217;re starting to see a lot more Black fine artists in their work kind of being exhibited to the mainstream. I&#8217;d say this has really picked up over the past decade or so. We have Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald, they painted the Obamas. You&#8217;ve got television shows that feature Black art. We had a fine artist on last year, Dawn Okoro, her work was used in, I think it was The First Wives Club on BET, I think it was used for that show. You&#8217;ve collaborated with a show. You collaborated with FX Networks to do some work for their show Snowfall. What do you think about this kind of exposure?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s amazing, I think, especially for the artists, because shows will pay you to have your artwork in their show. I think for me personally, my artwork was in HBO&#8217;s Insecure. So in one of the episodes Issa Rae walks right past, it was an illustration I did of Nipsey Hussle, or even for-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
&#8230; Another show I had done was A Black Lady Sketch Show. So first season three, my artwork is featured throughout the show. So it was definitely cool because a lot of people reached out to me because they recognized my artwork. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh my God, your artwork&#8217;s in this scene right here.&#8221; And I was like, okay. Like I had said earlier in the interview, is that with your artwork being in so many different places, it starts to just build awareness towards you to where people can understand the value of your work. It&#8217;s just very helpful, I&#8217;ll say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can imagine, like you said, your artwork&#8217;s all over the place. Do you just find out about it when it&#8217;s shown or do they give you a heads-up?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
They do give you a heads-up because a lot of times&#8230; I knew that my art artwork was going to be in Insecure. I didn&#8217;t know which episode it would be. I never got that kind of information. I mean, I watched Insecure anyways, so I would just sitting there watching it the whole season and it was literally, I think the artwork appeared in the second or third to last episode. So all that whole season, I&#8217;m just looking everywhere. I&#8217;m like, where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Or for Black Lady Sketch Show, I was just looking around too, where is it? I want to see a piece. Because they had bought a lot of my artwork for it as well. So it&#8217;s really cool. I think it feels good that people can recognize your artwork. It&#8217;s just weird in a sense of, wow, you know my piece that well? You can just see it blurred in the corner and you know that&#8217;s me. It&#8217;s a feel-good moment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, that&#8217;s got to be a great moment. I mean, your work&#8217;s on TV, your work&#8217;s in Target. That&#8217;s major. That&#8217;s major, major, major.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the folks that have really motivated and inspired you over the years? I can imagine doing all this, you&#8217;ve probably got a great support system behind you.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I will say my dad definitely, I will say, as my day one motivator, I think. Especially when I was in high school, I had did a program called Ryman Arts. So every Saturday I would go to USC and do classes. So he would drive me from Pomona to LA, it was an hour drive. And also even my mom too as well. They would just drive me to LA and back. So they always pushed for me to be an artist. Because I was taking time out of their day. That&#8217;s their weekend from work. And they would just take me down there and then they would stay down in LA for three to four hours as I did my class at USC and then took me back home. Because that was when I was in high school. Also, they&#8217;ve always, for my mom, for Christmas every year, she would always buy me, I guess an artist kit they would sell and it would have crayons, markers, color, pencils, and this big old, I wouldn&#8217;t say a booklet, but it was a big old cassette kind of thing. And you picked it up and-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know those art kits, they&#8217;ve got all the waxy color pencils and stuff in them.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
&#8230; Mm-hmm. Yeah. So I used to always get every single year, when I was growing up, my mama bought me one of those. And so I think they always pushed me to always be an artist. But they definitely were always very pushing me to basically have a career somewhere. And then I&#8217;ll say now with me having a fianc√©, I think when I met him, I think I wasn&#8217;t thinking as big scale. But having him around, I was able to set up my own booth. I had to a booth at 626 Night Market. That was before I was DomoINK. I think I just threw a banner up, it was like Art by Domonique. Come through. I was selling art friends, earrings and pins and stuff. But if I didn&#8217;t have him, I wouldn&#8217;t of had nobody set up a big old booth for me. He had made the booth by hand. He had bought some pipes and connected them and boom, we had a tent.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. He set up all the whole everything inside of the booth. And I&#8217;m not crafty, no one in my family&#8217;s that crafty, so it would not have came out as well without him.</p>
<p>I will say my family has been a huge force behind me just being an artist. Even when I had my first solo art show in 2018, my dad and my fianc√©, but he was my boyfriend at the time, they were there all day just hanging my artwork on the wall, putting the hangers on the back of the pieces. So me just having, I guess a whole village behind me. Or even from my extended family, my aunts, they&#8217;ve always come out to my shows, buy pieces. And also my friends just posting my artwork on their Instagram or sharing it. Or even from my Target collection, it just felt really good that took the time out to drive to their local Target and just buy a mug, just buy something to just show support behind me.</p>
<p>And also just me just being on social media. A huge support system is just people, followers, they&#8217;ll send you a sweet message out of nowhere. I look at my DMs and see someone just write me and say, &#8220;Thank you for posting the things that you&#8217;re doing because it inspires me.&#8221; So that is a huge motivation just overall of people just telling me, keep going.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ll say this to anybody that&#8217;s listening that has a friend that is an entrepreneur. Buy their stuff. That is the best way that you can help support what they do. I mean, I think social media posts and things like that is great, but actually putting some money in your pocket, best way to help out.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Such a great way to support.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, no, it is. When I did my solo art show, it was my first art exhibition. It was in Pomona, which was cool. I had friends from high school just come down and just buy a print. I was selling little small prints for $5, just starting off. And they just came down there and bought an art print just to say, &#8220;Hey, keep doing it.&#8221; And it does, it means a lot to you. Even it&#8217;s go small purchase. It&#8217;s just really nice to feel like, dang, I made a connection in this person&#8217;s life that they came out here and bought something. They might not even like it, but they&#8217;re just doing it just to basically push your dreams forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What advice would you give for any designers out there that are listing, they&#8217;re hearing your story and they want to break into design entrepreneurship and work with brands like you have, what would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I will definitely say be okay with the answer of no or rejection. I think when I first started out, I was just posting my artwork and getting no likes on it, when I first started. It used to bother me at first. I&#8217;m like, why am I even posting it? It made me want to give up. Or let&#8217;s say a brand does reach out to me and they say, &#8220;Hey, we want to use your artwork for this billboard.&#8221; And two weeks later you don&#8217;t hear nothing from them no more. So you got to be okay with the rejection at first. It&#8217;s definitely not going to be like you post your artwork, that one piece, and it just blows up and you&#8217;re drawing for Target next. You may get lucky, I mean, that&#8217;s like a 1 billion chance, but you definitely have to be able to handle the slow growth. That&#8217;s the hardest part.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s what makes people give up is that first part of you&#8217;re selling&#8230; For me, I started off on Etsy and I was telling my art prints, I didn&#8217;t get no sales for months. And I could easily just shut it down, but I was like, I&#8217;m just going to keep my listings up and something has to hit eventually. I just kept drawing and drawing and stuff. But what really helped me too a lot was when I first started out, I had a nine to five. So that kind of kept me grounded to where I didn&#8217;t become desperate for my business because I had a steady income coming. So I think that helped me a lot with just being able to handle that slow movement.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you appreciate the most about your life right now?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I think I just appreciate me just sticking to my passion of just marketing and design and art has led me to having my own home in California. I think I&#8217;ve just been really just taking a moment to just appreciate how far I&#8217;ve come. When I first started drawing or maybe just looking back at me, when I was in college, I didn&#8217;t have no money. I would buy one burrito and eat off of it all day, when I was in my [inaudible 00:44:40]. It&#8217;s just weird right now with me trying to do a careers transition to where I want to go into more of an entertainment and tech field of doing marketing or being an art director, it&#8217;s a really good feeling to know I&#8217;m being sustained by my art. It&#8217;s super weird to just be at this point and still be in, like I said, I have a house in California. I always said to myself, California is really, really expensive and it just seems weird to get this far and be able to have these kind of accomplishments and accolades under myself. And this year I turned 30 and it&#8217;s a good feeling to know I got this far knowing where I came from.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s the journey. It&#8217;s the journey.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s the journey. And you to definitely have to appreciate every step of the way. I think it&#8217;s really easy to get caught up in what you want in front of you, but you&#8217;re not thinking about what you have right now is what your past you was dying to have.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Do you have a dream project that you&#8217;d love to do one day? I think you kind of alluded to one earlier.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Oh my gosh. I think my passion project right now is, well, I guess what I&#8217;m really trying to build up to is being in art museums. And a big one is Art Basel, I really want to get in that. I just really want to just get my artwork in front of some people in the gallery. That&#8217;s just a really good feeling when I go into gallery and have my artwork in there and I see people just standing there looking at it. It&#8217;s kind of cool. And so I really, really want to get back into the fine arts, that&#8217;s my thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you exhibited any art locally in Pomona?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I have, when I had my first solo art exhibit. And then also I had my artwork in the Chaffey Museum of Art out in Ontario, California. That was recently, so I exhibited eight, nine pieces there. Well, my latest one was in Ontario, that made me really want to get back into drawing more on paper to be able to get into more museums. Because it was a really good feeling because&#8230; And also it led to a lot of people reaching out to me interested in buying my work. So I was like, oh, this is another place to keep building brand awareness towards me. And also even for DomoINK, because I always try to make sure to throw that in my bio, that I&#8217;m a founder of my own home decor business. So I definitely just want to just kind of, I guess get my hands into everything that I can that&#8217;s within my education and skills.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, gallery work aside, where do you see yourself in the next five years? Is there any particular kind of work you want to be doing or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yes, I really want to, in the long run, eventually I&#8217;ll probably get out of the, I guess corporate space and really just focus on DomoINK. I really want to also just start my own marketing firm too, with a lot of people reaching out to me, trying to find out how they can do the same thing and how do they monetize their art. I really want to be able to become a mentor and offer courses and just educate people. Because there&#8217;s so many people who just don&#8217;t know where to start. Like for me, I didn&#8217;t know where to start, but somehow I was able to make it work. But I just try to think about the people who don&#8217;t have that aha moment just by sitting there. So I just wanted to be able to offer more resources and help people just like me be able to get some money and just be able to have financial freedom, because everyone deserves to be able to afford shelter, food, everything. So if I can help someone have their own place, I&#8217;m happy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, your work and everything? And of course we&#8217;ll put links, like I said, to the Target collection in the show notes, but where can they find out more about you online?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
To find out more about me and my artwork and also shop for my artwork in home decor and apparel, you can go to DomoINK.com. It is D-O-M-O-I-N-K.com.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Domonique Brown, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Really thank you for sharing your story. I think it&#8217;s one thing to see the success on social media and people can kind of have one perception about it, but I hope that from people listening to your story and hearing just how upbeat and authentic are about the work, that they&#8217;ll see that this is something that maybe they can achieve too. I mean, the success that you&#8217;ve gotten over these past few years is really inspirational, I can&#8217;t wait to see what you do next. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me. Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Well, number one, thank you for having me on, Maurice. My name is George McCalman. I am an artist and creative director based in San Francisco. I live part-time in the Caribbean, the country of Grenada. And I run a design studio, which affords me the privilege of doing a lot of creative things at the same time. And I&#8217;m also a fine and commercial artist, and I&#8217;m often the artist of projects that I am designing and am the creative director on. I do a lot of other things, but that&#8217;s it for right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, first off, happy New Year to you.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Happy New Year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;re recording this right near the start of 2023. How have things been going so far?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been great. I&#8217;m in a very different realm than I was even a few weeks ago. I just had a couple weeks of a break from a book tour that I have been on and a press tour in support of my book Illustrated Black History: Honoring the Iconic and the Unseen. And so I&#8217;ve had a little bit of a reprieve, and so for the first time in many months, I have had the opportunity to really synthesize and make sense of the whirlwind that has come from the second half of this year of this book being out and me going out on a book tour and a national book tour. So I&#8217;ve just been really reflective for the last couple of weeks, and so this conversation is really timed well because I&#8217;ve been just thinking a lot about my experience of being a published author and people interacting with this book and having their responses and what I have learned from their response to this book. It&#8217;s been really incredible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I know you&#8217;re currently recording in Grenada. I would imagine having a Caribbean paradise at the finish line of a book tour is a pretty good motivation.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s actually just a reprieve. I start back on the book tour in February. So this is actually not even the midpoint. I&#8217;m going to be on tour for this book most likely another year just because I feel really passionately that this subject matter should be revered every day of the year and not just localized to a month or a period of time. So I am taking the message of that to the streets.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. When you look back at last year, is there anything that you want to try to change for 2023?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yeah. Expansive. I don&#8217;t know that I would use the word change for myself. It&#8217;s expand. I learned a lot and I was involved in all aspects of the making of this book, which is a really unique place to be. Most authors are not involved with all of the backend, the making and the design and the marketing. And so it&#8217;s been a really comprehensive experience too. And if I would say any adjustment, it would just be more, basically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ll make sure that we have a link to the book in the show notes. Yeah, let&#8217;s dive more into it. Tell me about the book. I think the name is self-explanatory, but tell me more about the book, what was your idea behind it, all of that.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
The book came from the word &#8230; The first sentence of the introduction of this book is I had a curiosity, and that is the very simple truth. I was just curious to know more about black pioneers. And I was just coming to a point where I started realizing that there was an artist inside of me, and so I decided to merge these twin curiosities of, I want to test out the parameters of me as an artist after basically not making art since I graduated from college 20 years before. So I&#8217;m a classically trained artist. I&#8217;m a painter and a drafts person and a sculptor and a photographer. But when I went out into the professional landscape of being a magazine art and creative director, I didn&#8217;t think there was any room for me to be a fine artist. And at the time, there just weren&#8217;t people who looked like me in this realm.</p>
<p>And so I knew that would be a hard road, and I decided to go with the convention of working in the corporate world just to establish myself financially and it was an adult decision. But I came to a point a few years ago where I started realizing that there was more that I was interested in. It felt like there was an ocean that I had not touched. And I decided in a flash of inspiration to make this project my first assignment as an artist. And so I researched and wrote and painted a different black history pioneer every day for a month of February, and it just started ballooning. I think that&#8217;s the right word. It started expanding from there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How did you go about researching and selecting the people to feature in the book? Because as I&#8217;ve looked through the book, I have the book actually, you have a wide range of people that you feature.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I really know that the person that I am personally and professionally has really been framed by my time working at magazines because it&#8217;s basically, I got both military and library training at the same time, if that makes sense. There&#8217;s a rigor to when you are working under deadline, you have to really be sharp, you have to have your focus, you have to know what the context is of what you&#8217;re doing. You have to be really communicative with the people around you. And you have to make sure that what you&#8217;re writing is all the time. And so it really trained me to know some of the shortcuts of researching and trusting my instincts around that. And for me, I was interested in people I didn&#8217;t know that much about. Even if I knew their name, even if I knew some of their story, there&#8217;s always more to learn.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the thing that I&#8217;ve learned in my 15 years as a magazine person before I opened my studio, that even when you think you know everything about a public figure, there is always more. And so it was a trust in the information I was learning, but it was also a trust in myself. And so I was always just looking at the periphery, looking at the fringes, asking myself questions. Who is Edna Lewis? What was Gordon Parks thinking as he was moving through the world? I found myself asking intimate questions to myself of the people I was researching. And so I found myself drawn to aspects of their story, and I was always looking for not just their accomplishments, but their personality. So many of our pioneers were always looking through a contemporary lens, but life was just so much harder then.</p>
<p>And so I can&#8217;t imagine what Gordon Parks&#8217; everyday life was. He was always the representative, and there&#8217;s always a burden placed on black people in America that we have to represent our community. And I can&#8217;t imagine what that was like 50 years ago, what that was like 75 years ago, 150 years ago. How much harder it was to be seen as an individual when your community is always being judged against the majority white community. And so it&#8217;s always this push, it&#8217;s always this burden, it&#8217;s always this pressure. But then you look at these accomplishments and so many of these people, publicly anyway, were really graceful. And so you have to develop this superpower when you&#8217;re out in the world. And I found myself thinking, what did these people have to compromise? What did they have to give up? Who did they have to be to be the people that we know and sometimes take for granted?</p>
<p>I was always looking for the hidden messages of who these people actually were, and that just always sparked my interest. It just made me hungry and curious. And even as I was painting them, I found myself drawn to nuances of personality. Gordon Parks was really charming, and so the portrait that I did of him, there&#8217;s a twinkle in his eye. I was looking to bring out the anger and the jokingness and the sadness and the power and the force. I really wanted to capture human personality in these paintings and really individualize them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Aside from just how poetic that is, that is extremely profound of you as an artist to want to approach it in that way. Even as you mentioned that, I&#8217;m thinking of my personal experience, but I&#8217;d say maybe a couple of years ago, this was right around the summer of 2020, I was doing a lot of research looking at old issues of Ebony Magazine and Jet Magazine from the &#8217;50s and the &#8217;60s. And one thing that stuck out to me that I thought was really interesting, I saw an ad for &#8230; It was some kind of alcohol, maybe gin or something like that. But it was Langston Hughes.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Langston Hughes was selling alcohol. And I don&#8217;t know why that broke my brain for a second because in a way you think of, oh, Langston Hughes, Harlem Renaissance, profound poet. Why is he selling alcohol in Ebony Magazine?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes. We don&#8217;t often think of our pioneers as whole people. People who have made mistakes and people who have had different lives and weren&#8217;t always doing the things that we focus and categorize them in terms of their professional accomplishments. And you start seeing people are just flawed. Every human being is flawed. We have complicated relationships with our icons in that we have to place them on a pedestal to basically show ourselves and to show the larger community how great we are. And so we always have to work harder to show these things. And then when you see Langston Hughes out of context, it&#8217;s confusing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It caused me to pause for a minute. Not so much the why behind it, but it made me think &#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I wouldn&#8217;t think of him as a spokesperson for an alcohol company. I&#8217;m thinking of him as the poet. And not even thinking of like, oh, well, what are the circumstances that brought him to do this? Because I&#8217;m not looking at him being in Ebony in that way as a negative, but it just surprised me to go through the pages and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, Langston Hughes is selling gin.&#8221; It was gin or something. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Because Langston Hughes had to pay his bills too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly. Exactly.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Homie had to pay his bills, and so lots of people did lots of different things to survive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What would you say is the most interesting or surprising thing you learned while doing this research? Aside from what you just mentioned, which I said is extremely profound.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Oh gosh. I learned so many things it&#8217;s hard for me to pull out. If anything, it just broadened my fascination with basically how we think of our cultural figures. Back to your point of the kind of artist I was at the beginning of this process that I was looking to render a kind of wholeness of people. I was just always interested in the emotional language of portraiture and even how we as black people render each other is going through a current renaissance because we have not always &#8230; We haven&#8217;t been given the room and encouragement frankly, to render ourselves. And so I knew it was maverick of me to basically not flatten everyone and not render the same style. That would&#8217;ve been easy for me to do, but I knew that that was not the right thing for me to do for this project. I really wanted to make sure that I was showing the complexity of who these people were and I was also trying to show the humanity and make that as important as the historical details. That I was basically equating the emotional parts with the historical facts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you hope people take away from the book? I mean, aside from buying a copy, what do you want people to take away from it?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Well, I honestly think, Maurice, that we&#8217;re super casual about this subject. Not that we don&#8217;t know how important it is, but at the time that I started this project, I realized that there wasn&#8217;t a book like this and that I wanted people to have it because I thought that we all deserved to have something like this, that we deserve to have this resource. Even though we as black people, we carry our history in our bodies and we have a very particular way of an oral history of passing information down to each other that has survived the ravages of time and racism. This book in and of itself, I didn&#8217;t feel comfortable thinking about it until after the book came out and several people have told me that this book is in and of itself a pioneer. Because we just don&#8217;t have this information accessible in this way. That there wasn&#8217;t a book outside of historical, academic and children&#8217;s categorization, that there wasn&#8217;t an accessible book just to buy and share about American black history. And so that&#8217;s what I want people to know, that this is still a rarefied thing. This is not an everyday thing. This is a pretty amazing resource that we now have. And I made this book for myself as much as for anyone else. I wanted a book like this. And so that&#8217;s partially why I did it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I also love that the typography that&#8217;s in the book for the titles as well as on the cover is from a black typographer.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
There are two black typographers in this book. And because I&#8217;m the designer of the book, I was clear that that aspect had to be represented. That I didn&#8217;t just want to talk about it, I wanted to show it. It was more important that people knew that that sensibility &#8230; There&#8217;s this reductive conversation that came up during 2020 again that was like, where are all the black designers? And I was like, &#8220;Screw you all. There are plenty of us around. You just need to stop being lazy and do your research to find them because we&#8217;re all here.&#8221; And I know tons of black designers, and so that&#8217;s not a thing. There should be more of us, certainly. But this idea that somehow everyone just woke up and started looking for us, I was genuine. I was like, &#8220;Fuck you.&#8221; I wanted to know. The two black typographers, one has been in the game for over 30 years, Joshua Darden, and he has a very successful &#8230; Which he sold a number of years ago.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Darden Studio.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Darden Studio. And the other one is a more recent designer and typographer by the name of Trey Shields. A vocal type. And Trey&#8217;s hook, and it was a hook that he has just expanded beautifully, was to honor the civil rights protest signs and digitize them and make them accessible to everyday people. And so the book is filled with typefaces. There&#8217;re three or four typefaces in this book that both Trey and Josh designed.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Yeah, Trey&#8217;s the homie. I&#8217;ve had him on the show before.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
He&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
He&#8217;s amazing. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit and learn more about you. Learn more about your origin story. Are you originally from Grenada? Is that where you grew up?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes. I was born and raised here. The first decade of my life I lived here, and then my mother and I moved to Brooklyn. I grew up in East Flatbush in a West Indian neighborhood. And all my formal education was in New York. I went to Marine Park in Brooklyn and then Midwood High School, which was a medical science high school. Webster attended Midwood High School. That&#8217;s my one celebrity, useless factoid. And then I went to St. John&#8217;s University and graduated and then started working in the publishing field.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you always have an interest in illustration and design growing up?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Always. I was that kid who drew in the margins of every page of every notebook I&#8217;ve ever had in my entire life. And it was just raw. It just came out. I had no formal training until college, but I was just obsessively drawing. And I drew superheroes and I made up characters and it was all very detailed, and I would just create these worlds and I would be lost in them to the eternal frustration of my mother. And it just came from me. It came from me and it came for me. But I had no encouragement into this world, and I didn&#8217;t know enough of it to realize that I could make a career out of being an artist. I saw no road into it. And so it made sense to me to just walk away from it when I graduated from college.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s talk about college. You mentioned going to St. John&#8217;s University. We had another guest on recently, Sharon Burton, who also told me about her time there. Yeah. What was it like for you?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
My college education was a dysmorphic experience. I didn&#8217;t know what I had until it was in the rear view mirror, as is perfect parable of youth. We have no context to know what it is that we&#8217;re learning until life crashes into you when you have something to compare it to. And for me, I had an education that I was constantly frustrated with because it felt that it was out of step with the cool art schools that were in Manhattan. Number one, I was in Queens, which felt so far removed from the center of the art world, which was Manhattan at the time. And so I&#8217;d go into all these galleries in Manhattan, and I had friends who were at Parsons and SBA and Pratt, and it just felt like I was at this Catholic university that had a tiny fine art and graphic design department, and I just felt like my education sucked.</p>
<p>And it wasn&#8217;t until I graduated school and started working, I realized how amazing my education actually was and how unique it was in the landscape of how people are taught fine art and graphic design. And one of the main things that differentiated my education is that I learned philosophy and theology alongside art history, fine art and graphic design. It was one of the most comprehensive educations I could have received. And it took me a few years to realize that I was actually ahead of the curve and I&#8217;m actually really happy that I did not go to a more prototypical fine arts school. I got a fantastic education at St. John&#8217;s.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. How&#8217;s that saying go? Hindsight is 2020?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
It sure is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve heard that personally because I didn&#8217;t even study design. I went to a liberal arts private college. I went to Morehouse. And I initially went there because I wanted to &#8230; And this was late &#8217;90s, early 2000s. Because I wanted to be a web designer. I had started learning HTML in high school. I taught myself HTML in high school and learned Photoshop. I designed my high school&#8217;s yearbook and the paper, and I really wanted to go into it but the scholarships that I got weren&#8217;t for art school. I actually never even applied to an art school. And then I got to Morehouse, majored in computer science. And in my mind I&#8217;m thinking, oh, well, it&#8217;s all the same, right? It&#8217;s all computers and design. It&#8217;s all the same. And I quickly realized after the first semester, it was not. I switched my major to math, which is what I got my degree in. But I know what you mean about looking back at the education and seeing how it served you versus the time that you&#8217;re there and you have this comparison on what your peers are doing, on what others are doing or what you think they&#8217;re doing that you feel like you should be getting at that formative stage.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So after you graduated, you talk about going and becoming an art director. Did you go right into that right after you graduated?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I did. It&#8217;s pretty common now, but it was a little more unconventional back then. This was the mid &#8217;90s. St. John&#8217;s had a internship requirement that your final year of school was spent in the field the entire semester as if you worked. And so the entire semester, I ended up having three options. I remember being going to interview at these three distinctly different locations, and it was kind of a sliding doors. And even then I knew that I was basically deciding my path with these three. One was an ad agency, one was a magazine, and the other was a small boutique design firm. And I remember being confused about which direction I was going to go in. I really did not know. And I walked into the Office of Money magazine, which is where I ended up interning. There was just a vitality. The office was a newsroom and there were people walking around and talking and gossiping and stuff being put up, and I could see layouts, and it just felt alive. It felt like an organism. And in my early 20s, I was just kind of like, yes, I think this is the environment that I need to be in. And I didn&#8217;t know anything about magazine design at that point, but it just felt like I needed to be there. And so I said yes to it, and I think it was one of my first really adult decisions.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s really interesting that senior year you got to have that choice. That&#8217;s something that I know that a lot of students now don&#8217;t get. They don&#8217;t get to see the working world-</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
They really don&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Before they graduate like that.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
They don&#8217;t. Yeah. Because I teach also. I&#8217;m a professor of graphic design. And one of the big issues I have &#8230; And it&#8217;s not an easy problem to solve. I am critical of it while knowing that I don&#8217;t have the answers myself. One of the fallacies of school is that it doesn&#8217;t really prepare you for the real world. It&#8217;s like one of the last bastions of this purity of education. And it often is counter to how the process of the professional world runs. I quickly learned when I started Money Magazine that there was no graphic design class I had that prepared me for how the magazine world worked and how the design process actually worked. I realized how luxurious school is. It&#8217;s a place where you can sit and think and talk and show your work, and there&#8217;s no real disruption. There are no real crises. There&#8217;s nothing for you to solve outside of the assignment that has been given to you that you have months to ponder and to ruminate on.</p>
<p>And so the idea of instinct is just absent in the school diaspora. And so when I teach now, I teach differently than I learned, and I try to infuse as much of a real life sensibility. The other issue with schools is that a lot of people who teach don&#8217;t practice. And so you have a completely different and often very dissonant where the education is rigorous and it is really valid, but it is outside of basically the professional norms of how you would actually solve problems. But then the people who are in the field don&#8217;t have time to teach because they&#8217;re working. And even for me, teaching was a really difficult thing for me to do with the entrenched deadlines of my studio process. And so I understand that it is a very difficult thing to do. I recently took part in a review of students at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard a few weeks ago at the end of the semester in December.</p>
<p>And this was an active conversation that I was one of six jurors, and we were all in different strata of the professional world, and we were really debating and having this conversation about how what best serves the students. If you&#8217;re only learning from people who are not practicing, I&#8217;m sorry, the education is only so valuable. But then if you&#8217;re only learning from people in the field, you don&#8217;t learn what being spacious in your thinking and being intellectual and being academic, you don&#8217;t learn the value of that in the design process also. And so the answer seems to be a balance between the two, but that is not always the case depending on where the school is and at what stage the professors are and where the students are. So it&#8217;s a very complicated metric to figure out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting you say that because I&#8217;ve certainly encountered that even with some &#8230; Honestly, some schools that have interacted with Provision Path in different ways. You name a top design school in this country, they&#8217;ve reached out to me in some capacity about the show. Which is great. They like what the show is about. It&#8217;s filling a gap in their curriculum in some way that they&#8217;re not. But then if it comes down to me lecturing or teaching or something, it always seems to boil down to the fact that I don&#8217;t have a design degree. That they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, but &#8230;&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, stop wasting my time.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Stop wasting my time. And those kind of rules and terms don&#8217;t really serve anyone anymore. I mean, just the landscape has changed and design, because of technology, is just so accessible. And I know lots of brilliant designers who did not go to art school, and I don&#8217;t believe that you need to have a design degree to be brilliant at what you do. There are lots of people who have defied the convention of formal education and produced really entrancing, relevant, resonant work. And to me, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about. And so I don&#8217;t subscribe to this hierarchy of academia. I mean 30 years ago it was used to be exclusive and keep a lot of people out, and that was seen as a value, but I don&#8217;t think it serves anyone right now. Culture has changed and education has changed. And because of technology, everything is just more accessible. And so it&#8217;s really about what you are doing with the technology. It has nothing to do with did you go to school or not? That&#8217;s just such a reductive argument.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I agree. I agree. This actually is making me think of a question that I do want to explore more on the show this year. And since you&#8217;re one of the first guests on this year, I&#8217;ll ask you. I&#8217;m curious what you think about the future of the art and design industry and how it&#8217;s going to be impacted by technology. I think we&#8217;ve seen in at least the past year, maybe two years, talk about web three and NFTs and most recently AI generated art and things like that. How do you think these industries are going to be impacted by tech?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I think it already has been. What we call entrepreneurship is actually just hustlers. That&#8217;s what technology has given us. It&#8217;s given smart hustlers who are pulling and stretching and tweaking and bending the rigidity of so many of our institutions and our disciplines. The word I use a lot is it has expanded the notion of what design is, who it&#8217;s for, who it&#8217;s not for. And technology has brought so many things to people who would not otherwise have them. It just brings an aspect of the world to your doorstep. Technology for me, because I grew up outside of it and I was an adult &#8230; People who were born into technology, that&#8217;s what they know. That&#8217;s the real world. To me, it&#8217;s not the real world. It&#8217;s an aspect of the real world. And so I think of social media as tools.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think of it as real life. I think it&#8217;s a facsimile of real life. And so the language of how I talk about it has given me clarity in that I&#8217;m not confused about its place in my life. I started learning graphic design before we got our computer labs. And so I had two years of playing with typography, playing with a lot of the conventions of what is now basically archivable materials because nobody does it that way anymore. But because I learned design with my hands, that is how I continue to interface with it. I still draw out everything I do first. And that dexterity, frankly, has made me a better designer. I don&#8217;t rely on technology as a starting point for anything that I design. I bring it in to help move the process forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Good answer. I like that. You started talking about tech and that question just popped into my mind to ask you about that. But to go back to your career as an art director, you have a very storied history as an art director for several magazines. You mentioned Money Magazine, but you&#8217;ve also been an art director at Entertainment Weekly, at Mother Jones, at ReadyMade, just to name a few. When you look back at that time being a director for all these magazines, what stands out to you the most?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I can&#8217;t give just a simple answer. I can give a collective answer. Because I learned a lot. I learned a lot of things. And I don&#8217;t think in terms of best or worse because I think life is too complex for that. But what I did learn was agency. The word agency. Meaning that I am not stuck when I don&#8217;t know how to solve a problem. That there are ways and there are many paths to telling a story, and there&#8217;s no one way to do anything. And depending on the context of what you&#8217;re doing, I learned how to be a better communicator. Because when you&#8217;re working with a lot of people who are reliant on you, you learn that you are a cog in a wheel, but that your role, nobody else working with you has that. So everyone is really important to the process at different times.</p>
<p>And so you learn the economy of collaboration. That collaboration can be a really beautiful thing. And that there&#8217;s an excitement when you are working with people who are really good at what they do and that want to tell stories as well as possible. And that telling stories is one of the most unique aspects of being a human being. And that that is basically how we thrive and survive as people. We share information and we share stories with each other. And that&#8217;s where I learned that. I&#8217;m not sure I would answer this question in this way if I hadn&#8217;t worked at magazines. And I utilize magazines also to learn. And I did. I used them for two things within myself. To learn the process of what I was doing. And I moved around a lot.</p>
<p>I never worked at a magazine more than two years because I always wanted to learn what I was doing through a different landscape. There are lots of people that get a job and stay there for decades. I am someone who I learn what I need to learn and then I move on. I have always been that way. And so for me, it was what can I learn about the subject matter? I learned about the financial world, honestly, working in Money Magazine. I learned about the inner workings of celebrity culture, working at Entertainment Weekly. I learned about the wellness world at Health Magazine. I learned about technology working at Wired, working at ReadyMade, working at Afar. I really immerse myself in the subject matter to learn more about how these stories focused on this particular field. What was the combination, what was the metrics, what was the engineering of the subject matter? And so I was always kind of process nerd, if that makes sense. And that&#8217;s what I was always looking for. And with magazines, the process can become repetitive because you&#8217;re doing the same combination of things. And so the first year I was learning about the magazine and the second year I was learning about the subject matter. And then like clockwork, I&#8217;d come to the end of the two years and I&#8217;d move on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, was this sense of agency the inspiration behind you starting your studio?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes. I reached a point where I realized I wasn&#8217;t learning anything more. I wasn&#8217;t learning anything new. And I had all these skills that I wanted to apply in a different way. And it was working at ReadyMade that gave me the inspiration to open up my own studio, which was the second to last corporate magazine job that I had. And ReadyMade was a magazine about do-it-yourself design. It&#8217;s basically recycling. What we now call upcycling. It&#8217;s taking something that is at the end of its road as it&#8217;s being used and refashioning it for something else where it has an entirely new shelf life and you can use those things. And it was really just clever. It was just really clever design solutions. It&#8217;s taking cloths and making a kite out of it, or taking old jeans and turning it into place mats. Just stuff like that that is seen as quaint now, but was really at the vanguard of this recycling movement that is just more every day and more common.</p>
<p>It was recycling before recycling, even in California, was as ubiquitous as it is now. And I got to work with a lot of makers. People who just made things and who were just passionately, quietly &#8230; And not starting businesses, but just people who were making things for their own edification, for their homes. And I was honestly just really inspired. And I was just kind of like, oh, I know a lot of people who are working for themselves. And when I started thinking about it, I would talk to friends and contemporaries and professional acquaintances and everyone said, &#8220;Do it, do it. Do it. When you work for yourself, you will never go back to the corporate world.&#8221; And they were right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are the best types of clients for you to work with?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
It has both changed and remained the same. My interest is in culture. The identity of culture. And so I have coined a phrase just internally in my professional world that I am interested in culture clients. And in the early days it was &#8230; I live in San Francisco, so there are lots of artisans. There are people who are making small batches of things. There are restaurant owners. I was always working with clients who were working for themselves and needed help with the language and the messaging around branding. And so I worked with restaurants and I designed products and chocolates and tea, but I was really kind of more comprehensive. It was less me coming in to just design a package and it was basically working on the whole branding from the logo to the identity to the strategy to the messaging to the website, just the whole thing. And I realized that I was drawing on my editorial background to tell the whole story.</p>
<p>And so it expanded to &#8230; I started working with the tech world and then quickly stopped. Because I realized that they &#8230; I remember having a meeting with Uber. This was like 10 years ago. I was working with TripAdvisor and Uber. And these are big names, big clients at the time. I can tell you, TripAdvisor, I consulted with them for almost two years. They didn&#8217;t know how to assign photography. And so I worked with them comprehensively working with a photo editor to basically get them a library of photographers, come up with a system of rate assignments. Just basically the basics that one of the largest companies in the travel world had no awareness of. With Uber, it was they had been focused on the service for so long and they were starting to atrophy some of their customers because there was no story. There was nothing.</p>
<p>And the people who started Uber did not think that that was important until suddenly it was. And I remember having a meeting with them where I was like, &#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re just taking my ideas. I&#8217;m just here speaking to them.&#8221; And I was like, I don&#8217;t trust this field. I don&#8217;t want to have my intellectual property just ripped off and I&#8217;m not on the inside, so they&#8217;re not going to value what I&#8217;m doing. They&#8217;re going to treat me like a vendor, and I&#8217;m not anyone&#8217;s vendor. And I was really clear about my value to myself. And so I stopped working with the tech world for a few years and really just focused more on the one-on-one. And I worked with larger companies, but it was still where I had direct access to the founders and the CEOs so that I could thread continuity between what I was doing. I didn&#8217;t want to work with any intermediary people, so I had to be conscious of the scale that I was working in just to make sure that the projects didn&#8217;t get away from me. And I was also clear with myself that I wanted to keep my studio small, because I wanted to keep it manageable and basically control and frame the quality of the work that I was doing. I didn&#8217;t want to be embarrassed by anything that I was doing if it got too corporate.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I like that idea of culture clients because yeah, working with tech companies, they will just relegate you to vendor status and-</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
And they will just steal your shit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, they&#8217;ll steal it.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
No compunction about it. And it&#8217;s the people who don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing that want to steal your shit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I know in my instance, when I have worked with tech clients, it felt like &#8230; Or at least I entered into it thinking it would be more of a partnership. We would maybe bounce ideas off of each other or things like this. And in some instances, they just wanted to just cut the check, which I mean, look, I&#8217;ll take your money. I don&#8217;t have a problem with that. But I was really thinking that it would be more based on how the initial conversations went, why you sought me out, et cetera. And then it just ends up not being that. They just want to have it to be a bullet point on a DEI presentation.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
It is rarely that. And this is even before DEI so there was no representative of that. And that was the other reason. That I was often the only black person. And I was like, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want to do this.&#8221; I left publishing because I was tired of being the only black person. And for me, the tech industry has just become the new media publishing industry. I can see the corollaries and a lot of the people, a lot of my contemporaries have gone over and taken our playbook into the tech world. I mean, Apple very much has snapped up a lot of the most prominent magazine editorial art directors in the field in the United States. And so many of their campaigns, I&#8217;m looking and I can see the editorial strata of how these stories are shot and presented. It&#8217;s all going in that direction. And it should, because it&#8217;s the best form of storytelling. Advertising as a medium, as a typical form, I think is not very good at storytelling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, they are not. In addition to the work that you do through your studio, and you alluded to this earlier in the interview, you&#8217;re a columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle. How did that come about?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Well, it came about the year that I started the original 29 day project of Illustrated Black History. I tell you, Maurice, it was just a year where I just lost my mind and just began drawing and painting obsessively, just everything. I was just manic for it. And it was like it had been bottled up and it all just came out. And so that year I took a sabbatical, which means that I stopped taking on work. And when I tell you that I had no money, I mean I had no money. I was just living off of my savings. It was a really reckless thing to do, and I&#8217;m a pretty cautious person. And I knew that it was the right thing because it just came so easily to me. I fired all my clients and just started everything from scratch. And so I gave myself the time to do that, and I was also trying to figure out how to make a living with it.</p>
<p>And so I ended up doing a series. A series of series. And that is also a playbook from my magazine days. You tell a story in multiple images, threading a narrative and a continuity from beginning, middle to end. And so I did several series on my family, on Illustrated Black History, and then I started documenting the visual identity of San Francisco. And I was really fascinated by the human ecosystem of the Bay Area. And I&#8217;d been working on another series about how the tech industry started in the Bay Area and how it could not really have started anywhere else and just all of these threads were coming together. And I had this epiphany one day where I knew that I wanted to do a culture column on the makeup, on the genetic makeup of San Francisco and the Bay Area.</p>
<p>And I had been inspired by a morbid thing. It was when Bill Cunningham, who used to be a columnist for the New York Times, and he was a style photographer and he documented black style in Brooklyn and Harlem, and he equated black style with high fashion, which is something the fashion industry did not do and still does not do, even though they think they do. I was just like, &#8220;Oh, I think this is what I should do.&#8221; And I remember writing a pitch and deciding whether I was going to send it to the New York Times or the San Francisco Chronicle. And because of my magazine background, I outlined everything to myself and I wrote a pro and con list about the San Francisco Chronicle versus the New York Times and how much creative freedom I was going to have. And the whole idea for the column was that I would be writing, illustrating and designing this column, documenting various events that gave you a larger sense of what the Bay Area was all about and what made it unique and special and also frustrating and just all of the things that just brought all the complexities in.</p>
<p>And I sent that to the woman who became my editor, and she wrote back immediately and she said, &#8220;This is brilliant. We&#8217;re going to do this.&#8221; And I remember thinking at the time, &#8220;Holy shit. I didn&#8217;t think she&#8217;d respond this quickly, and now I have to do this on a monthly basis.&#8221; And it was one of the best experiences I&#8217;ve ever had. I would go out to cultural events several nights a week, and I just became this man about town for years. And I would show up as a reporter with my notebook and my pens, and sometimes I would live draw and sometimes I would draw later on and I just drew this column every month and designed it for the style section of the Chronicle, and I did that for years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. When it comes to work between what you do in your studio and what you do for the newspaper, is your approach different for each one?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I work in parallel lines, as I&#8217;m sure my answers are starting to illustrate. I&#8217;m always on the inside and outside of what I do, and I&#8217;m looking at both sides of it at the same time. And I think I developed that skill as a magazine person because there&#8217;s not just the story that you&#8217;re working on, it&#8217;s the process of how the story is being made that is as important as the story that you&#8217;re making. And as a designer, you are at the intersection of words and images, and so you&#8217;re never just looking at one aspect of anything. And it has just expanded my brain, I think, where now I can&#8217;t help but think of everything through this parallel thread of thinking. And so in terms of making this column for years, I knew that I was training myself to do basically all aspects of what I was doing.</p>
<p>I was always an art director, so I would have been the designer of the column, but I would&#8217;ve been working with a writer and working with an illustrator. But in combining all of those skills, I was sharpening my capabilities, but I was also training myself for this kind of repetitive monthly grind where it just became less of a grind. I remember the first year I was just stressed out all the time, and then suddenly it settled and it was not a stress anymore. And the column used to take me several days to do. And towards the end of that initial run, it would take me 24 hours to do the whole thing. And it just became a little more fine tuned. I really was able to pace myself. I knew what I needed to do. I knew what I needed to accomplish. And so you just anticipate what you need and then you do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you say your artistic style has evolved over the years?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
To answer your previous question, I do &#8230; And I&#8217;m answering both at the same time. I think I have developed a way of backing into the style. I often don&#8217;t know what style I&#8217;m going to do when I start something, and this book is evidence of that. I really just feel my way into what I was doing. The original column had a lot of different styles, but I basically invented a newspaper style because I wanted it to be stylized. I had to do things quickly, it had to be out of a economy of time. So I developed a shortcut of illustrating that for the longest time my contemporaries thought was my style. And then when I started working on the book, even close friends were like, &#8220;Oh, this is totally different from what you have been doing with the Chronicle.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I was like, &#8220;Yeah, this book is actually what my work is actually.&#8221; But I&#8217;ve been doing this shorter version of it for a while and it has just become what I&#8217;ve been known for. But the truth is I tend to start from scratch every single time, and I do it in my design world and whether I&#8217;m designing something, whether I am illustrating it, fine art, it is a brand new thing every time I&#8217;m sitting to do it, even if I&#8217;ve done it before. And so I&#8217;m considering all of the layers. I was like, what is best going to serve this story? Is it something that&#8217;s in pencil? Is it something that is in paint? Is it typography? I just think freshly about everything that I&#8217;m doing, and I throw out what has come before. I honor what has come before, but I don&#8217;t get stuck in the nostalgia of what I&#8217;m doing. I will throw everything out and start it up again if I think that that is the right thing to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the people that have really helped motivate and inspire you over the years?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
There are so many hidden figures in my life. The truth is, it&#8217;s not a lot of artists. The artists who inspire my work are not contemporary artists. They&#8217;re people that I grew up admiring. And where I find my inspiration is not really in other people, it&#8217;s in nature. The natural world really provides a lot of my motivation. But in terms of the people who have inspired they&#8217;re close family friends, they&#8217;re people I consider mentors in my life that have just always been many times the last few years where I&#8217;ve just admitted to my internal community, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing. I&#8217;m just literally making this up. And there have been many times, there were many times that first year of launching out as an artist where there wasn&#8217;t a month that went by that I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think this is going to work. I think I need to stop doing this. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to figure out how to make a living. I don&#8217;t think this is working.&#8221;</p>
<p>And no one person would let me do that. Everyone was just like, &#8220;Nope, nope, nope. Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.&#8221; And I&#8217;m grateful for that because that the first year I was absolutely flabbergasted how I was going to make this thing work. And I could see the talent and I could see that there was something there, but how all the pieces fit together in terms of continuity and financial stability, I didn&#8217;t see it. And then I got the column and the column I didn&#8217;t give the context for. I started six months after I started being an artist. And that was the first light bulb where I was like, oh, I think I know how to package this work.</p>
<p>And then I started getting more assignments and then it just picked up from there. And there were many stages of the process where something else would happen and I&#8217;d think, &#8220;Oh, okay, yes, that&#8217;s how this fits in.&#8221; And, &#8220;Oh, right. And then I can do that.&#8221; And then when I got my book deal, I realized that my column had been training me to do this book and that I had certainly designed lots of books, but this was the first time that I was all things and that I&#8217;d been doing a version of that for the last few years. And so I had been prepping myself for this larger project that I think it would&#8217;ve been much harder to do if I had not been doing it. So I just started seeing how all the pieces were fitting together.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you appreciate the most about your life right now?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
That I get to do what I love. I am happy. I am as happy as a pig in shit. I feel really fortunate that I am passionately in love with the creative world that I&#8217;ve given myself. I get to work with all of the things and the skills that I&#8217;ve been given. And there&#8217;s so much I&#8217;ve learned over the years that I get to relearn and apply in a different way. And I&#8217;ve learned that I get bored really easily and I&#8217;m not bored by anything that I do right now, which tells me that I&#8217;m doing the right thing. Learning is an absolute essential part of what I do, and I place myself on the ground floor of everything that I do because I see myself as a student also. And so I remain energized by what I do. I have a genuine love of what I get to do on a daily basis.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing? What kind of projects do you want to work on? Where do you see yourself in the near future?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I have to say I&#8217;m already doing what I see myself doing in another five years. I&#8217;m going to be making a lot of books. I&#8217;m designing a lot of books. I am making a lot of books. My next book is actually on the publishing industry. And I&#8217;m also starting to expand into three-dimensional spaces. I&#8217;m finishing up my first stint as an exhibition designer. I&#8217;m designing a museum show that is premiering in another few weeks in California and it&#8217;s a major show for a major artist by the name of Mike Henderson, as a black artist who is having a renaissance right now and he requested a black designer specifically. And the cultural aspects of design is something I&#8217;m really keyed to and always representing the black perspective so the people know that design is not neutral. I went to school and grew up hearing this fallacy that design is objective and neutral, and I know that it is not.</p>
<p>And so I teach in that way, I design in that way, I educate in that way, I work in that way. And so I just see more three-dimensional spaces. I see designing interiors, I see designing fully comprehensive experiences where you can see the two dimensionality of the design process in terms of type and art on the walls, but also the three dimensional aspect. The mood and the tone and the feeling of what you should be feeling, of what the average person can walk into a space and experience. That is what I&#8217;m going to be doing a lot of in coming days and weeks and years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, your work, the book? Of course, we&#8217;ll put the book in the show notes, but where can people find out more information about you if they want to follow you?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Well, the book itself, the book was published in late September of 2022, so it is everywhere. And the book, I&#8217;m really happy to share, has gone into its second printing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you so much. The response has just been &#8230; It has been a very emotional few months as people &#8230; Because you make a thing as you know as a designer, but then you don&#8217;t really know how people are going to respond to it. And so I have just been amazed and rendered mute many times by the messages that I&#8217;ve received and the responses of the people that I&#8217;ve met out on the tour. And so this book is everywhere. You can get it at any bookstore, anywhere, all over the country. Of course, I always tell people to support their independent bookstores, so if you are buying it, you don&#8217;t have to buy it from the devil, Amazon. There are lots of local bookstores that would love to have your support. And as far as just my social media feed, all of it is the same, whether on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. It is McCalman.co. M-C-C-A-L-M-A-N-C-O, McCalman.co.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, George McCalman, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show for-</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Thank you so much. Thank you, Maurice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. One, for just sharing your story of how you come into art and really studied it and then going on as an art director, but then also the process of the book. And I think to me, what is probably most important about this conversation is how you&#8217;ve taken that flame of creativity and found a way to really expand it out as far as you can into as many different places as possible. Like you&#8217;re teaching, you&#8217;re doing client work, you&#8217;ve got the book, you&#8217;re a columnist, and now I feel like this expansion into 3D space, even as you mentioned, definitely seems like the inevitable next step for where you&#8217;re going. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Your questions were incredibly thoughtful. I&#8217;m really grateful for your interest in talking to me, and thank you. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m going to say. Thank you so much.</p>

Chris also spoke about growing up in Brooklyn, joining and serving in the Army for over a decade, and talked about how his style has evolved over the years. He even shared the one project that he&#8217;s the most proud of out of his impressive body of work. Chris is a true example of how staying adaptable and building great relationships can be a recipe for success!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Hey, first, thank you for having me, Maurice. Really been digging the platform since I&#8217;ve been introduced to it. Once again, thank you for having me, man. My name is Chris Charles. I am a photographer, creative director, designer. I just try to bundle it all up into&#8230; As a creative designer or art director.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. How are things going so far? I know it&#8217;s just the start of the new year, but how are things going for you?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, so far so good. I was very intentional about taking some time off leading into the new year, so I can kind of rest a little bit, spend time with family. So, thankful I have been able to get that time in and spend time with the kids and the fam. But yeah, so far so good. It&#8217;s kind of taken me a day or so to still get into the flow again of work, and consistently checking emails and communicating again. But yeah, I&#8217;m ready to get it popping.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I told myself this year that I&#8217;m going to start turning my phone off one day of the week. So I&#8217;ll turn it off Saturday night, turn it back on Monday morning. And I tried that, actually, a few days ago, just so people know we&#8217;re recording this at the top of the year, but I did it over New Years. It was so peaceful. That Sunday was so extremely peaceful. Monday was super productive, and it was so peaceful that I didn&#8217;t remember to turn my phone on until Monday afternoon or evening. And I turned it on, and I mean the flood of notifications. People were like, &#8220;Are you all right? Is everything&#8230;&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m fine. I just turned my phone off for 36 hours.&#8221; It&#8217;s good, the world can wait.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
You are much better than me. So I have measures implemented to where my phone isn&#8217;t as invasive as I know people who have all the alerts on, the lock screen thing. And so what I&#8217;ve done is I turned off notifications on my lock screen, the one that kills the battery. I keep my phone on silent with the exception of a few key numbers; my mom, my partner, my daughter, people who they will need to get to me just in case something happens. Other than that&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know if I can just turn my phone off. I think for me, it&#8217;s easier to just have it readily available so people can reach me in the event that they have an emergency. But kudos to you, man. I don&#8217;t know how you did it, but you did it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s an experiment. I just tried it once. So we&#8217;ll see if it sticks.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I&#8217;d have to send a mass email or text message to everyone to let them know, hey, I&#8217;m out the loop. I&#8217;m not communicating for X amount of time, so don&#8217;t expect a response but in the event of emergency, call this other number. I have to have an emergency contact person in place just for that, but.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I might end up doing that too because certainly I turned my phone back on, and I guess the way that my phone is set up too, I can get text messages on my computer, I can get some notifications, but it just wasn&#8217;t on my phone. And so I still was able to do some things, I just couldn&#8217;t or didn&#8217;t respond back to people right away and stuff. But let&#8217;s just say I&#8217;m paying for that today. I&#8217;m having to do a lot of catch up today.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, a long day of responding to folks, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But that Sunday was so peaceful. I was like, I&#8217;m doing this again. I can&#8217;t stress how no pings or nothing. That whole Sunday, I cooked breakfast, I listened to some jazz, I was chill all Sunday. I&#8217;m like, I want that feeling every week. I&#8217;m going to try to see if I can stick to it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I think you can do it. I think you can do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at last year, what do you want to change bringing into this year? You mentioned taking some time for rest.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m part Jamaican so I don&#8217;t know any other thing than to work all the time. Running my business but also working another job across town, and I just left that job before the new year, just because it just didn&#8217;t make sense commuting that far several times a week. But yeah, I think for me, working smarter not harder for 2023. I think 2022&#8230; And most of my career, I spent a lot of it doing all of the heavy lifting. I&#8217;ve had assistants in the past who helped manage communications and emails and I&#8217;ve worked with tons of young artists who volunteer their time, and some I&#8217;ve actually mentored and was able to get them going with their businesses. But I think it&#8217;s time to build a team. And I think it&#8217;s time to start delegating versus me being the lead communicator, the lead invoice generator and the lead key artist on set and then the key editor. Time is so much more important to me, I&#8217;m realizing, especially now that I have a young baby, six months old.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow. Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you, thank you. His name is Cerulean Amir, and he&#8217;s amazing. But yeah, I think moving into 2023 I definitely want to facilitate me being more present, and the way these knees are set up, doing all the squatting and getting all the angles, I would rather be able to guide that process through other people who are under the umbrella of my business.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hear you.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the goal.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s talk more about your work in your studio, Chris Charles Co., which you&#8217;ve ran now for 15 years, so congratulations on that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me a little bit more about it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So, ultimately, and this kind of plays into the vision for this year and moving forward. I&#8217;ve always kind of been a multidisciplinary artist, I mean with roots in obviously photography, design, music. I produce music as well. I&#8217;ve worked with a few artists and I&#8217;ve always felt that the three words that I&#8217;ve used to encompass my business are style, creativity and soul. And for me, that&#8217;s kind of the type of person when it comes to aesthetic that I always wanted to be. Even when I was a kid, I just wanted to be cool. And that being influenced by music and jazz and seeing how cool those people were.</p>
<p>I always wanted to have whatever business I ran encompass those kind of things. Just like a cool energy, a cool vibe, some fly music going on, some fly art, whatever it is. So yeah, I think my business, while I also focused on trying to strive to be technically proficient, but it was also about creating a vibe or a feeling to the point where whatever I put out in the universe via the internet, it&#8217;s a reflection of those three things, style, creativity and soul. So I&#8217;ve just kind of ran with it and it seems to have helped me find my voice over these years. So that&#8217;s pretty much&#8230; Be it design, photography, music, show-making, those are the things that I&#8217;ve really pushed to have come to the forefront.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So given all of that, what are the best types of clients for you to work with? I know you mentioned musicians, but are there other types of clients that you find you work best with?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Honestly, I work just other artists in general. DJs, musicians, visual artists. I&#8217;ve worked with other photographers doing portraits and collaborating with them, painters and also high-level business people. For some reason, it&#8217;s more like a, wow, this person is amazing. I could learn so much from them, and they hired me to do this work. You know what I mean? So it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s feeding my desire to learn more and have goals based off of what I&#8217;m seeing this person has done, and I&#8217;m actually doing what I love to do while learning. So yeah, I would say anyone in the arts, like I said, high-level business people. I&#8217;ve worked with district court judges, I&#8217;ve worked with mayors, mayoral candidates, city council people, attorneys, high-end real estate folks, and all of these people have great lessons that I can pull from to use at some point in my business. So this is great. I love that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So given that variety, how do you approach creating a new project or working on a new design project? Because I would imagine with each of those types of clients, the setup might be a little different, I&#8217;m guessing.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah. One thing I used to struggle with&#8230; Well, I won&#8217;t say I struggled with it, but one thing I had to really understand was find a way to maintain whatever vision or artistic integrity I had while still fulfilling my clients&#8217; needs. And sometimes those things don&#8217;t always align, and I&#8217;ve had to adapt and adjust in order to facilitate my client being happy and just doing the work. But yeah, I think for me, I just like to assume that people who have hired me, it&#8217;s not like sight unseen. They&#8217;ve seen examples of my work and they&#8217;ve seen&#8230; Or other people who I&#8217;ve worked with and they&#8217;re like, hey, I want that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve had some clients who have no&#8230; Whatever I do, whatever they want was the opposite. So that I think has been a big challenge over the years. But ultimately, it&#8217;s just about adapting and adjusting, interjecting those three things, style, creativity and soul while still keeping whatever format my client wants to maintain their brand and push their image forward. So it&#8217;s a lot of, I&#8217;d say, adjustment. I don&#8217;t want to say shape-shifting, but it&#8217;s more like a, yeah, I can do this, but I can still slide some of these elements that I always kind of hearken to for this person.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like that&#8217;s a common thing with multidisciplinary folks. It&#8217;s like we know that we can do a lot of different things, and sometimes the client is aware of that and sometimes they just want the one thing that they want, but it is a lot of adjusting to try to make sure you&#8217;re fitting in with the scope of the project, their involvement in terms of how things are going. It is a lot of&#8230; It&#8217;s a constant adjustment, I find.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, it is. And I don&#8217;t know, I think by nature, just based off of my travels, even as a child I&#8217;ve always been very adaptable, but I&#8217;ve always tried to stick to a certain thing that, okay, well I&#8217;m going to do this but I&#8217;m going to do it this way. And it kind of made me a rebel. When I say that, I mean I&#8217;ll follow the rules but up to a certain point that I&#8217;m just going to just do it this other way because I think it&#8217;s more efficient. I kind of relate that to working with clients and just adapting. And yeah, I hear what you&#8217;re saying. I know you want the logo with the money, the dollar signs raining and all of that, but maybe we can simplify it a little bit. Here, let me show you this. So I found using examples of other brands within that person&#8217;s market helps kind of dial those things in for me too, so I don&#8217;t have to really have too much conflict.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you handle the business side of everything? Because the work definitely is the creative part. That&#8217;s what you specialize in. But, when it comes to marketing and contracts and finance, how do you balance that with the more creative aspects of your work?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It took me a while to actually find a rhythm with managing all the things outside of the art and creating, but eventually I was able to figure out a way to say, for example, automate my booking process so I don&#8217;t have to have these conversations and these email threads that just lead to dead ends. Usually if someone clicks and books, they&#8217;ve already made their mind that they want book me. So that saved me so much time. I&#8217;d also, say, having an assistant, I had a really great assistant and then she moved on to greater things. But I really learned to appreciate how&#8230; For one, she was really good at what she does, and she actually is based in Atlanta, so she was working virtually. But that type of communication, I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;m a horrible communicator, but sometimes I&#8217;m too busy out working to communicate in a timely manner.</p>
<p>And having someone who that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re doing for me made it so much easier. But other than that, it&#8217;s just kind of trial and error. It&#8217;s like, hey, I&#8217;ve gone through so many phases with trying this invoicing system or trying this business bank account to see that works in payment gateways and figuring out the most seamless, easiest way for a customer to pay a deposit and then book it online without having to have conversation, after conversation, after conversation. So yeah, it&#8217;s been a journey. It&#8217;s definitely been a journey, but I&#8217;ve been able to figure it out just based off of trial and error and kind of doing what works, but also evolving, being open to evolve. There&#8217;s a few things I want to add into the mix this year. Definitely want to get someone to do the actual books and have an accountant, or someone who I can contract to have to do the accounting. Because I&#8217;m pretty much doing it all of that myself as well, so.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now outside of that, being in the arts and being self-employed, that&#8217;s a lot to balance, I think particularly with just the way that our attention economy kind of works. What are some of the biggest challenges that you&#8217;ve had to face staying independent and doing this for as long as you have?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Dealing with the economy. I think managing&#8230; Be sustainable, which is every business during economic downturns, and that&#8217;s another challenge. I&#8217;d say just dealing with the ebb and flow. My business is a cash flow-based business, and most businesses that, but fortunately I don&#8217;t have much overhead, so that makes it a lot easier. I&#8217;m not producing a physical product that requires me to buy inventory and surplus. So that in itself has really helped me manage the challenges of an economic downturn and keeping clients and being able to have clients who just keep coming back. And some of my best clients are those repeat clients. But ultimately also over-saturation. Over-saturation. When I started doing photography professionally, there were just maybe a handful of really, really great photographers in my area who I looked upon for inspiration, and I saw they had things established. They did great work.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now, it&#8217;s like you can just close your eyes and point your finger one direction, and you&#8217;re probably pointing at a photographer. You know what I mean? So staying relevant, being open to new ideas is kind of, like a lot of artists, I think specifically more with musicians and kind of trying to grow their art and their craft while still maintaining that voice that put them on in the first place. So for me, I don&#8217;t want to look at it as competition. However, it is somewhat of a competition. This is a free market. So if I want to be competitive in this market, I have to pay attention to what other people who are 20 years younger than me are doing. And if I have a client and suddenly I see my client shooting with this 20-something year old, I&#8217;m like, oh okay, great. Yay. But also, I&#8217;m like, huh, how&#8217;d that happen? What do I need to do to where I can keep this particular client or clients? So yeah, it&#8217;s a few challenges.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know when I was actively having clients and doing client work, one of the biggest challenges, aside from what you mentioned, is just making sure that they still keep you sort of top of mind with what they do. Because I think, like you said, there&#8217;s over-saturation sometimes in the market and there&#8217;s a number of different people that folks could choose from to do kind of the same work. And so I think it&#8217;s really important also to just have those relationships. The relationship building part is so important with so many other people out there, because the benefit I think that we have, you and I, and probably others of our age group, is being able to build those relationships as opposed to just putting out whatever the newest, hottest, latest, fastest tool or product is that can get the job done.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it&#8217;s about relationships. You mentioned one of the clients you&#8217;ve had has been a mayoral candidate. I did a mayoral race back in 2009. The person didn&#8217;t win, the candidate didn&#8217;t win, but she ended up working then for a nonprofit organization and I had that organization a retainer for five or six years. And then every place that she ended up going, I kind of followed her in some aspect in terms of like, oh yeah, I could do this work, I could do this work. Or just keeping top of mind so they know, oh, well I know someone who could use you. So then that relationship building really comes into play because your name gets mentioned in rooms and other places that you&#8217;re not necessarily available.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Exactly, exactly. And yeah, I think I&#8217;ve definitely been fortunate to have had several of those types of clients where I&#8217;m talking about 10, and you mentioned the foreign exchange. It&#8217;s almost like 10 years we&#8217;ve been working together. And then of course, with Nikolai individually and with Phonte individually, it&#8217;s been like I&#8217;ve been their go-to guy, and I appreciate that. I have some clients who, once again, are in the political scene and some musicians who, there&#8217;s no question they will call me, and I don&#8217;t take that for granted. But also it&#8217;s because we can sit down and kick it after we do a long shoot. We go grab some food, we have a couple of beers, and we kick it for a little while and just decompress and catch up. I value that.</p>
<p>Because to me, that&#8217;s connection. And for me, especially when it comes to doing portrait work and photographing people, it&#8217;s important that I established that rapport, which could potentially lead to a cool relationship and friendship. But I can&#8217;t get a good picture of someone if we&#8217;re doing a session, if we haven&#8217;t had a conversation that kind of face-to-face, and that way we can feel each other out. I can see where I need to go, how I need to handle this particular photo shoot. Yeah, I&#8217;ve been able to, like I said, make some really great, great friends because of that relationship aspect that you mentioned.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I just started back doing some client work through my studio now, and one thing I&#8217;ve been doing is going back through my old contact list of clients. And the first of the year, best time to do it, best time to restart a dormant relationship or a dormant former communication. Just hit them up, Happy New Year, how are things going? This is what I&#8217;m doing. Because people just kind of have that energy at the top of the year to want to do something new, try something new. So it&#8217;s a good time now to make those relationships happen or to try to at least begin to forge them.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Absolutely. Yeah. Just before Christmas, I sent out some tests, newsletters with some things just to see, once again, updating that client list and seeing do I need to remove or add some things and change and seeing the response and looking at the numbers. So yeah, you nailed it, man. Definitely going to be doing the same this year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to get more into your work and some of the clients that you work with. Of course, you mentioned foreign exchange, which we&#8217;ll talk about later, but I want to hear more about your origin story. I know you&#8217;re in North Carolina now. Is that where you&#8217;re from? Is that where you grew up?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
No, I actually grew up in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. ell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Spent my formative years in Brooklyn, but also going back and forth between Brooklyn and Jamaica. We usually go every summer, or every other summer. And Brooklyn is a melting pot of West Indian and Caribbean culture, anyway. So yeah, growing up in New York was such a great experience for me. I think I tell people I grew up, I think in during the best era to grow up, which was the late &#8217;70s going into the &#8217;80s. Because once again, I literally would&#8217;ve had a Irish neighbor across the street. Their neighbor was Italian, who was my first babysitter. We had a Puerto Rican family on the corner. We had the Haitian family right there. You had my family, which was a mixed ethnicity. You had people from Aruba, people from Barbados. It was such a melting pot of culture. So I was exposed to a lot of different languages and a lot of different foods and energies. And thankfully, my parents and I, we traveled.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d get on a plane and go somewhere, go to LA, go to Jamaica, and my dad had family in Pennsylvania, so we&#8217;d be in the mountains. Just being in that type of environment or those types of environments where I&#8217;m surrounded by so many different things, it influenced me and grew up in a very musical household and very artistic household. And I played guitar, took formal guitar lessons for years, and my household was the type of household that always had music playing, be it jazz or reggae music. So my parents loved to dance. We do the New Year&#8217;s Eve party at our Puerto Rican friends&#8217; home, and they&#8217;d be dancing salsa all night. So I just love music and culture. So, I couldn&#8217;t help but be influenced by all of that growing up during that time in New York. So went to high school, did that. Played football in high school, actually. So I wound up going to college initially at a Kentucky Wesley College with a partial scholarship to play football. And that was a disaster because that was my kind of first time away from home.</p>
<p>Being in Kentucky as a New York dude was kind of different for me. I made it through football camp, and I was like yeah, I&#8217;m not feeling this, and I went back home. So I had to regroup, and my parents were looking at me like, okay, so what are we going to do? You can&#8217;t just be laying around here. You know what I mean? You got to do something. So I said, okay. Always loved architecture, always loved art and clean lines and drafting. I took drafting in high school, so I pursued a degree in architectural engineering, the New York Institute of Technology in Farmingdale, it&#8217;s a [inaudible 00:24:32] entity, and that was great. But I also have a military family. All my uncles were in the military. My dad was a Marine, my brother was in the army, and that&#8217;s also something I always knew I wanted to do. I was a boy scout and I loved wearing a uniform. I was one weird kids who just loved putting on a uniform and being fresh. So yeah, I did college and then immediately joined the Army.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So this is, what, &#8217;93, &#8217;94. And wound up getting a job doing surveying, but it was for artillery. So I kind of got hoodwinked. I kind of got made switch with you have engineering background. Yeah, this could be a great job for you. But I&#8217;m sitting next to a [inaudible 00:25:18] blowing up stuff, you know what I mean? But ultimately, it was good. I had a good time, did a couple of overseas tours, and I made sergeant. And so now I had to manage a team, and that kind of taught me leadership and politics when it came to, not just the military, but corporate, I came to find out later.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s where corporate gets it from, so that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Structures, politics of it all. They parallel each other. So anyway, I decided maybe I want to change jobs. So in the military, they have what you can do as reclassifying. So I reclassified as a communication specialist, and more specifically a network switchboard engineer. So like an internet guy, basically. And that was great because it basically helped me transition out of the military eventually with those same skillset sets. And I was able to apply them. But meanwhile, I was also a paratrooper, so I was jumping out of airplanes and went to jump master school. So I was jump master qualified. I was aero [inaudible 00:26:16] qualified.</p>
<p>So I was propelling out of helicopter, jumping out of airplanes, doing all the cool stuff, even though I had these technical jobs, because that was kind of that guy who just wanted to do the hard stuff as much as possible while I still had the young legs. So yeah, eventually 2003, after my last deployment in Iraq&#8230; Well, 2004 is when I began&#8230; I came back, I think April, and put in my paperwork to get out the military because I just felt it was time. My daughter was very young at the time. She&#8217;s 21 now. But I just didn&#8217;t want to be away from her and missing her grow and potentially not being able to see her again, not making it back from the deployment is very real.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Especially right around that time in the early 2000s. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah. 2003, 2004, maybe going in 2005, &#8217;06 was a rough one because the warfare over there with the IEDs&#8230; And it was really bad at one point. And I was there for that when you never knew if you were going to get blown up in a convo at some point. And that hit me. That was real, that was real to me. I said I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m a smart guy, I think I&#8217;ll be able to figure something out, especially with the skillsets that I gained in the military. And that&#8217;s what I did. So I got out of the military in November, 2004, and haven&#8217;t looked back since. I transitioned almost immediately into a corporate IT job.</p>
<p>And that was great. I did that for about five years. And then 2009, the 2008, the bubble burst and the economy tanked, and I wound up getting laid off. So here I am, had a corporate job, great benefits, great pay, and now I got laid off. Never happened to me before. I didn&#8217;t know what that felt like. And it was horrible being called into the operation manager&#8217;s office with all of us who got laid off. It wasn&#8217;t just myself, walking back to your desk and you see all your stuff packed up in a box on the table with a security guy waiting to walk you out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It was embarrassing. You feel powerless, you just feel like, wow, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing? Wound up getting laid off. And I had to really, really sit on it for a minute. And then I realized that was a universe kind of pushing me in the direction of becoming an artist full-time. Now keep in mind, when I was working at this particular company, I became good friends with the art director there, and he knew I was kind of dabbling in photography, and he invited me to drive to Boston to shoot a wedding because I guess he&#8217;d seen some of the work I was doing just for free. And he thought I had an eye. So he took me, and that was the first paid gig I ever had as a photographer shooting that wedding. And that&#8217;s when also the light bulb clicked.</p>
<p>Was kind of already getting over the job, it was very stressful as far as just the IT and networking, dealing with clients, having to take the blame for other people&#8217;s mistakes or whatever. So when he says, hey man, I&#8217;m going to cut you a check for $1500, just drive to Boston in my Audi. I was like, oh shit. Okay, let&#8217;s go. Hey, maybe I can just keep doing this. And then a few months later, I wound up getting laid off. So it was all serendipitous how it happened, even though I wasn&#8217;t seeing that at the time. But it definitely helped guide me into the direction I kind of eventually went. So I took my GI bill and took a little bit of time off. Because I did get a bit of a pension, not a pension, but a severance day. So I was able to survive and pay my bills, but eventually enrolled back into college and wound up getting a degree in graphic design while slowly building my business and getting to know the community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So that was a very big transformative time for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And in hindsight, like you said, it worked out in the end. Something I want to just touch on, you mentioned though that time between, I would say roughly the mid 2000s, 2004 to 2008, 2009, that was such a&#8230; And I can&#8217;t stress this enough for designers that were not around during that time. That was such a wild time in terms of just design, I guess you could lump tech in with it, but particularly web design, graphic design. So many things were changing in that just five-year span that you were lucky if you could stay at the same place for that long because the technology was changing, the browsers were changing, the actual hardware itself was changing, the software was changing. There were so many changes that took place that it would be hard to keep up with everything that&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. And I don&#8217;t know, for me I think what helped me was being in school&#8230; And at the time I was still using Windows, for example, but we had iMac Labs where I was able to kind of&#8230; I was like, oh, this is nice. Okay, cool, cool, cool. But not only the technology, but I guess you said the design language, right? Like I said, I loved architecture, I loved clean lines. I loved a certain minimalist aesthetic. And I started noticing design shifting to that versus heavy drop shadow and beveled fonts. And a lot of overly-designed things that have, and I attribute that to Apple, actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I think Apple&#8217;s brand pretty much influenced the design world when it came to aesthetic and minimalism. Being able to be able to sell something and tell a story as cleanly as simply as possible and maybe using really great imagery overlay with text. So that whole look&#8230; Like when I started seeing that and I realized that that&#8217;s kind of how I love that, that&#8217;s what it was for me. So it made my transition fairly easy. Because I just wanted to stick to that aesthetic. It was just, like you said, learning the technology and learning in Design and Illustrator and all those things. I was pretty good in Photoshop already. But those other Adobe products, they were kicking my butt for a while. But I think I got a handle of them now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember the macro media stuff when it switched over to Adobe. I used Fireworks a lot in one of my old jobs. And then Fireworks pretty much became obsolete. Adobe bought Macromedia and changed a bunch of stuff over. And then I was a web designer at the time. There was the whole switch from table-based layouts to CSS-based layouts. Which then changed the browser because the browser then was less about just display and it became more of a canvas. It became more of somewhere you can create things just on there and not have to transpose. I remember cutting up tables in Dream Weaver and exporting them over and making sure everything was right. But now you could use CSS and you could float things and create divs&#8230;</p>
<p>And it was just such a big shift&#8230; It was a really seismic shift, I think, in design online during that time. And yeah, also the switch from the nineties style of design, especially with tables and things like that because they borrowed a lot from print, to more clean lines. Because it&#8217;s just based on what the browser did, because the browsers then had to catch up. This is after the whole browser wars of the late &#8217;90s and stuff. But browsers became less about, oh, this is just a place you can view a website. It&#8217;s like, no, this is a place where you can build a website. There&#8217;s technologies, there&#8217;s like a stack in the browser where you can make things. It was just such a&#8230; I look back at that time fondly, but also in hindsight, there was a lot going on.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t think&#8230; for me, I wasn&#8217;t aware of it at the time. I was just like, oh, okay. This is cool. Oh, this is&#8230; Okay, cool. This is cool. That&#8217;s cool. I even look at&#8230; I use Photoshop a lot, for example, and I look at Photoshop from back then to now and how much I can do that I really couldn&#8217;t do without having to download a plugin or something. And the same thing with everything in the Adobe Suite. I was using Premiere for a while and I just couldn&#8217;t, didn&#8217;t jive with me. So even now transitioning over to Da Vinci Resolve has been like, my head explodes every time I use it. So it&#8217;s so phenomenal. And it doesn&#8217;t bog down my CPU. I don&#8217;t have to open up a whole nother program to do as much. I can do it all in here. I can do audio the same time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
This is awesome. For 300 bucks, I don&#8217;t have to do a subscription, a yearly subscription. I [inaudible 00:34:48] with it. So I&#8217;m just really thankful for it. I love technology, so I&#8217;m thankful for technology. I&#8217;m kind of a computer nerd. I was as a kid, backtracking real quick, I used to write programs on the old&#8230; Gosh, it wasn&#8217;t an IBM computer. It was a Commodore.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, the Commodore 64?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. Definitely showing our age. Because that one [inaudible 00:35:12]. Yeah, I&#8217;d go to the library and rent and take out these coding books and you&#8217;d spend three hours writing code just to make the colors on the screen. And that was fascinating to me. Just learning syntax. And anyway, so it helped me, even in corporate. When I was working in corporate, I had to&#8230; The company I was working for, it was a proprietary voiceover IP network, one of the first in the country. So I would have to be able to trace a call from London to California, and I could literally look at the numbers on the screen and see the nodes as the signal is&#8230; Well, the communication is traveling and seeing where it breaks. And that always remind me of when I was a kid. Wow, this looks just like when I was programming my Commodore 64. But yeah, I&#8217;m just nerding out a little bit on the tech. But it&#8217;s a great timing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it was. Even visually with&#8230; Flash was just everywhere. Flash was such a huge component of creating experiences online. And now in 2023, really years prior to that, I&#8217;d say probably as early as maybe 2020 or so, Flash is just a distant memory.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
During that transitional phase when I was going to school, I actually gig doing graphic design and marketing for a local recording studio. And I had to do Flash. And I was like, what the hell is this? I&#8217;d never really had much experience with Flash and I thought it was kind of an antiquated technology, even back then. But they insisted on using it for their banner ads and whatever. But me being at that job was also a big turning point for me because of just where I was. And then being around musicians and kind of transitioning into connecting with artists who needed photography and design. You know what I mean? So yeah, that was a good time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s bring it back to your studio, then. So you had that spark to start your studio then after doing that photography gig, you&#8217;ve kept it going now for 15 years, and your client list is extremely impressive. Just some of a few, I&#8217;ll name off here. Moleskine, which are the notebooks, the Italian leather notebooks, Apple Music, Spike Lee. And of course, musicians, The Foreign Exchange. They&#8217;re one of my absolute favorite groups. I&#8217;ve been a fan since Connected. I&#8217;ve been such a fan. This is complete fanboy moment at this point. How did you get involved with them?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of a funny story. So back in late 2009, I was kind of slowly making a name for myself as a photographer. I&#8217;m a music nerd, and I was dating someone at the time, time who knew Phonte.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Actually, I think they dated years before she and I met. But anyway I was also on&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if you remember the Okayplayer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, I remember them.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I was on Okayplayer, and I go into the, what do they call it, the rooms or whatever, the chat rooms, I guess, and just nerd out on music. And at the time that&#8217;s pretty much how the product exchange met on Okayplayer. And they recorded their whole album by just sending tracks and vocals across the ocean, because Nicolay was in the Netherlands at the time, living there. So anyway, so it was cool being able to connect with these artists like Little Brother and Questlove, and kind of just being involved in conversations and casts happen about music. And the person I was dating at the time would randomly post my photography into the forums. Like hey, my boyfriend did this picture, blah, blah, blah. And apparently Phonte was paying attention. So one winter, like I said, I think late 2009, we went to a gig.</p>
<p>It was a Red Bull event, and it was a battle of the bands featuring The Foreign Exchange and a punk rock band. And it was brilliant because what they had to do was play each other&#8217;s music and interpreted however they saw fit based off of the genre. Right? So it was cool hearing The Foreign Exchange&#8217;s band, which was amazing, playing these compositions that the punk rock band made. And then vice versa, you know what I mean? Really good time. Of course, I brought my camera, took some really cool photos of the bands. And then as we were leaving, I hear someone calling me and it&#8217;s Phonte. He and I had never met, but he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey man, you Chris Charles? I saw you coming you up here. We got a new album coming out, man.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Word? Okay. Hit me up, man.&#8221; And that was it. That was the beginning of that relationship. I just loved the process. So I worked with almost all the artists under the, not just The Foreign Exchange, but their record label.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So Median when he was on the label, just finished working with, well last year, last summer. BeMyFiasco, who is Phonte&#8217;s prot√©g√©, musically. And yeah, pretty much have done every project after Leave It All Behind.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So did all the photography, the design. Think the first one was Love in Flying Colors. That was the one. And yeah, did all the pre-flight, the layout, the photography, excuse me, and then yeah, all the way up to their last one. So it&#8217;s been a great journey with those guys. And we just did a photo shoot a few months ago, actually. Because they have some things that they&#8217;re going to be doing here. So it was good reconnecting with those guys again. But yeah, it was just, once again, those types of circumstances that the relationship building aspect of it is what&#8217;s important. And we&#8217;ve always had a great relationship. Really great guys. So yeah, those guys are cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m trying to think how I first found out&#8230; I think I found out about Foreign Exchange either through&#8230; It was one or two ways. One, there&#8217;s a music store here in Atlanta called Moods Music.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, I know it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, Darryl.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a hot spot, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s the spot. That&#8217;s the spot. I&#8217;m gatekeeping a little bit now that I&#8217;ve told the whole world on the podcast, but that&#8217;s the spot though. That&#8217;s the hot music spot in Atlanta. But I either found out about them. It was either through there or through this website that a couple of friends of mine founded called SoulBounce. I can&#8217;t remember if it was through one of the two. It was one of those two that I remember first hearing about it, because like I said, I&#8217;ve been listening. I&#8217;ve been a fan since Connected. Leave It All Behind, still gets rotation in this house to this day. &#8220;House of Cards,&#8221; oh my god, love that group. And even all the other stuff that Phonte did. I know Phonte and Zo! did this &#8217;80s cover album. That was really good.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It was Percy Miracle, and I forget the other name. But yeah, Phonte had the Jerry Curl wig on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, they did Stepping Out. They did Africa from Toto. Yeah. That was&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Those guys are so talented, man. Even now with&#8230; What&#8217;s that show? I know Zo! and Phonte been writing a lot for this new kind of musical skit comedy show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, is it Sherman&#8217;s Showcase?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Sherman&#8217;s Showcase, yes. And then of course, I designed the Eric Robeson Phonte record, Tigallerro. I did Phonte&#8217;s last single. Any visuals that came out pretty much revolving around the phone exchange or Nicolay&#8217;s or Phonte individual projects, I also had the privilege of working on. So, such a good time, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, man. I think of all that. You mentioned Eric Roberson and now I&#8217;m thinking of all the soul music that was also just kind of in and around during that time. That was such a&#8230; When I think on that time, that was late 2000s early 2010s. That was such, for me, that was just such a pivotal time. I think I was just turning 30 right around then, too. I was like, oh man. Such good music. And that&#8217;s so cool that you were just a part of all of that. And you get to work on it all. Do all that stuff.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It&#8217;s still surreal. It&#8217;s still surreal. Whenever I see&#8230; When President Obama had one of their songs on his yearly playlist, I&#8217;m like, what? I&#8217;m looking at a photograph and design I did and now President Obama saw that, word? I mean, that&#8217;s cool. It&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Can you give me a sneak peek on whether or not they have a new album coming out?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I&#8217;m sworn to secrecy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. All right.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s just say we did a&#8230;.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You mentioned a photo shoot, I thought I would ask.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m sorry, that&#8217;s all I can say. But yeah, stay tuned, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;re talking about Foreign Exchange and Phonte too, but Nicolay is super talented as producer. I have some of his solo albums, too. One of them&#8230; I forget what it&#8217;s called. Something with Shibuya in it, I&#8217;m not remembering&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, no. The City Lights. City Lights Volume II. Oh man. That&#8217;s one of my favorite, favorite just chill out albums. One of the songs on there is&#8230; I forget the&#8230; I have to go back and remember the name. Because I know the song when I hear it, I can&#8217;t necessarily think of the name of it, but it&#8217;s like some song. I don&#8217;t know. I call it my getting home from the club song. When you get home super late and the sun&#8217;s about to Rise, it&#8217;s like that kind of song.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I forget the name of it. But they&#8217;re all super talented. That whole clique is super talented</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
And super nice. Whenever I get to catch up with Nicolay. The guy&#8217;s really, really smart. He has a degree in musicology. He&#8217;s not just like self-taught. He&#8217;s really formally trained, but also humble and tall. The guy&#8217;s like seven feet tall. He&#8217;s like about six foot seven. He&#8217;s huge. But just the nicest guy. Same thing with City of Lights Volume too. Those guys are always gracious whenever we connect. What&#8217;s another one I did? Not the Shibuya one. I did the next one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Soweto.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yes. I did the graphics for that one as well, as well for [inaudible 00:45:08].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve been lucky, man. I&#8217;ve been lucky.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you do to stay motivated and productive with your work?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Just constantly evolving, actually, as far as what I do. For me, sometimes it&#8217;s just if I&#8217;m editing photos, I run into a creative block with where to go with a certain edit. I&#8217;ll put it down and I&#8217;ll step away and indulge in another media, be it a short film or looking at some art books that I have. But I know for me, staying inspired revolved around kind of exploring the balance between what&#8217;s in my head and what I see that catches my eye out in the world. And also music. A lot of my photography and design, I feel it&#8217;s so connected to musical energy. And at least to me, I always like to think of a song whenever I present a certain edit or if I do a print.</p>
<p>So for me, sometimes I&#8217;ll be inspired by music, or if I&#8217;m producing music and coming up with a theme and a rhythm, and I&#8217;ll start to see colors and I&#8217;ll start to say, oh, okay, maybe I think that&#8217;s rare. Then I go back to the edit and it&#8217;s like yeah, I add that touch of red to it. So, it varies. But mostly I&#8217;d say music and using contrasting mediums to kind of offset each other. So if I&#8217;m doing design, I&#8217;ll stop and do some photography or look at photography. If I&#8217;m doing photography, I&#8217;ll listen to music. It&#8217;s weird. I kind of traverse these different medium when I need inspiration from something else, from another place. So yeah, that&#8217;s one of the ways I use medium.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you say your artistic style has evolved over the years?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
When I first started doing photography, especially when I was in design school, I was implementing design elements within my photography a lot. And it was just how I saw things. I would do a portrait and find a creative way to add text to it or add texture to it using overlays. I think as I&#8217;ve evolved as an artist, I think my style has&#8230; It&#8217;s gotten a lot simpler. So I&#8217;ve simplified it. I&#8217;ve been able to deconstruct it in a way that there might be some texture, or I&#8217;ll just use a textured backdrop or a textured setting, versus actually adding the texture in post.</p>
<p>But also just kind of continuing to try to master fighting in the technical aspects of photography. And then getting into filmmaking and learning that technology and learning how to edit and just being a one-stop shop. Because I just love all those mediums, so why not learn how to do them? And then eventually that became another aspect of my business. So I think expanding, going from this photography, to design and photography, to dabbling in web design. And then, oh, short films, and then doing promo spots for clients and doing commercials for schools and things of that nature. So yeah, learning new technology is pretty much how I think I&#8217;ll be evolved over the years, specifically</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Overall, is there a piece of art or a specific project or something that you&#8217;ve done that you&#8217;re particularly proud of? Like the crown jewel in your portfolio, or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
There are a couple, actually. I think most recently I got commissioned by a really amazing local candle making company, Black-owned, to design a signature candle to be distributed through the NBA, the NBA 75th Anniversary candle series. And they gave me full autonomy to design it within the specs of the candle. And with that, I was given access to seeing what the candle kind of smelled like, and taking hints from the notes of the candle and then implementing that into the design. That to me was very exciting, very exciting. And for that to be connected to the NBA was just mind-blowing. I&#8217;d say another one is probably the Spike Lee project that between&#8230; It was joint project between Spike Lee and Moleskine where they were doing these cheap, got-to-have-it books, Moleskine books. So that&#8217;s where that connection happened.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh!</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I was able to connect with Spike Lee and his team and come up with a&#8230; I had to shoot a short film of a local artist, a Black woman artist who embodied the whole image, the vibe of Nola Darling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nola Darling, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It was cool because Spike Lee, huge inspiration for me. One of my favorite movies is near all of them, but I say from an aesthetic standpoint, [inaudible 00:49:37] blues, the way he used colors and contrasting colors to point out personality differences, and music and jazz. I think another fun time was shooting Martin Lawrence and his daughters&#8217; graduation party. And that was interesting and totally random. One of actually, it so happened that his daughter, her hairdresser was my client. They needed a photographer. And she graduated from Duke University. And I&#8217;ll never forget this, this was Mother&#8217;s Day a few years ago. And I remember going to brunch with my mom and then having to leave and drive to Duke University to their private banquet thing, golf club. And I&#8217;m looking at Martin Lawrence and his family. Oh, and Emmett Smith. Because they&#8217;re all connected. Emmett Smith, who&#8217;s one of my favorite running backs of all times for the NFL is Martin&#8217;s ex-wife&#8217;s new husband.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m looking at Martin Lawrence and his family, the kids, Emmett Smith, and I&#8217;m just there to take pictures and you&#8217;re paying me to do this. Are you kidding me? It&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s living the dream. So yeah, I&#8217;ve had some really amazing&#8230; Gosh, I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s times like these, and I&#8217;m thankful for you to these great questions because it really makes me think about&#8230; For one, if there was any time where I didn&#8217;t, or if any people didn&#8217;t respect the craft of image-making, be it photography or design, and the times that I&#8217;ve doubted it as well. Like oh yeah, people don&#8217;t take this stuff seriously. But then one day I&#8217;m in Venice Italy, because I was commissioned to be there by a client. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s like, wow, I said that but I&#8217;m actually overseas right now, and my whole job is to just be cool and take fly pictures. So yeah, I&#8217;ve had a few instances of really amazing experiences and being in rooms and work and opportunities. So yeah, I have a few, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying, I just can&#8217;t pick one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think once again, all of that really speaks to the power of relationships.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It really speaks to being able to know who, not just know who certain people are, but to maintain those relationships enough where people are advocates or sponsors for you in places where you&#8217;re not available. Especially with what you just mentioned with shooting Martin Lawrence&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s graduation, like you said her hairdresser is one of your clients, and so that&#8217;s how that all happened. They could have picked any photographer. Martin&#8217;s a celebrity. They could have picked any photographer.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
What&#8217;s so funny about that, she just called me randomly and she was like, &#8220;Hey, I got a gig for you. Just say yes.&#8221; I was like, what? She wouldn&#8217;t tell me who it was until the day before. She was like, oh, by the way, this is the Lawrence family and Smith family. Like, &#8220;Lawrence who?&#8221; [inaudible 00:52:29] I was like, oh, okay. Yeah. Relationships, knowing people and doing good work in this treating well manner.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And the Spike Lee Moleskine, I have the Spike Lee Moleskine. It&#8217;s still in the plastic. I refuse to open it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Oh, nice. Yeah, that&#8217;s definitely a collectors&#8217; item. Definitely a collectors&#8217; item.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve had a few people on the show that have done work with Spike, either presently or in the past and stuff. It&#8217;s amazing how he pulls in other Black designers to work on his projects, whether it&#8217;s like Art Sims doing projects, whether it&#8217;s you on this notebook project. I think most recently he did some work with this black typographer I had on the show, Tre Seals for his book, like design the font for the book and everything. Spike is really good about pulling in other Black creatives into his work, which I really appreciate that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
And I honestly believe, I think it should be like that. It&#8217;s always great to see and I always appreciate it. But how else are we going to continue to spread and learn about each other&#8217;s talents without actually giving each other shots and [inaudible 00:53:34] opportunities?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I love to see it. Love to see it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice do you have for aspiring creative directors or artists out there, particularly those that want to be self-employed like you are and be able to kind of forge their own path?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;d say do your homework. And when I say that it&#8217;s great to go out with passion and present it, but you have to have a plan. And that could be, do you want to be a generalist? This could be applied to a couple of different mediums, of course. But yeah, do I want to be a specialist? Do I want to be a generalist? I&#8217;ve gone back and forth between that as well. For me, it&#8217;s about also diversifying, right? I don&#8217;t just solely rely on photography or I don&#8217;t just solely rely on consulting or design, or filmmaking. It&#8217;s about building a brand based on those three words. Like I said, style, creativity, and soul. And thinking about how you want your clients to feel when they work with you and after they&#8217;re done working with you, and will that make them want to work with you again? So it&#8217;s like a lot of soft skill stuff. I mean, of course, being technically skilled and talented, those are all great things, but if people don&#8217;t like you, you&#8217;re not going to go very far.</p>
<p>So I think learning how to maintain or establish and maintain relationships with people who align with the vision that you want to sell your artwork to, present your work to, and being able to manage that and navigate that and be in spaces and present yourself well, I think that&#8217;s really important. And then also, of course, the more technical stuff about managing business, establishing an LLC, your contracts, delivering, over-delivering at times, under-promising versus the vice versa. Because people will call you out. You said we were going to get 30 pictures, you only delivered 29. It&#8217;s like, oh, okay. Gotcha. But if I say I&#8217;m delivering 15 and I deliver 30, guess what? Now I&#8217;m a rockstar. And a lot of creatives take that for granted. And I also understand that there&#8217;s time and money involved with creating and running a business. So be mindful of that. Don&#8217;t kill yourself. Rest. Take your time to step away from it and reevaluate, reassess, learn, and then ask for mentorship from people who are already doing it that are in the game.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing, like future stuff or continuation of what you&#8217;re currently on? Where do you see yourself?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, ultimately five years&#8230; It&#8217;s funny because I&#8217;ve been actually writing out my tenure plan. And in the next five years, couple things. I definitely want to have a new physical space to run a shop and have a team, a dedicated team on payroll to where I can manage and be lead creative or a principal for projects that are being done by people that are working for me. But also, I have a really big passion for veterans&#8217; affairs. So I&#8217;ve been researching ways that I can somehow participate in helping veterans, be it they&#8217;re transitioning or trying to find their way out in the workforce. Or if they&#8217;re trying to start a business, there are so many benefits out there available to veterans who they don&#8217;t know they&#8217;re there and they&#8217;re just out here flapping and trying to work, but also might have some disabilities or issues that their workplace or workplaces are required to accommodate. So yeah, that&#8217;s a huge passion of mine honestly, in helping veterans, especially veterans of color, transition and live good lives after having lived through some really potentially horrible situations because of war. But yeah, having a shop and helping veterans.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Sure. So my main website is chrischarles.co. That&#8217;s chrischarles.co, not dot-com. The person who owns that domain name refuses to give it up, so I&#8217;m stuck with the dot-co and that&#8217;s no problem. That&#8217;s fine. So that has pretty much leads you to all of the other work that I do. I have a separate photography website, which you can also find once you go to chrischarles.co. But for people who are specifically interested in photography, it&#8217;s my full name, christophercharlesphotography.com. I have a Facebook business page, it&#8217;s Chris Charles Photo. My Instagram handle is the_chrischarles, so the, underscore symbol, Chris Charles. Those are the main places to find me. I&#8217;m there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Sounds good. Well Chris Charles, I want to thank you so much for coming on this show. I think certainly everything that you have talked about speaks to two key things that I think folks should kind of take in mind, particularly as we go into the new year. One is about being adaptable, and the second is about building relationships. I think everything that you&#8217;ve described about your career to date has been a testament to both of those abilities, and you&#8217;ve been able to craft and use both of those to be able to build a career for yourself, build a life for yourself, and continue to do great work out there in the community. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Thank you so much for having me, man. This is really fun. Enjoyed talking with you, Maurice. And yeah, anything you need from me, just let me know.</p>
