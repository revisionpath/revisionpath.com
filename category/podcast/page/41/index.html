Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>&#8220;Blackness is multifaceted.&#8221; When Samuel Adaramola told me that before we started recording, I knew we were going to have a great conversation. Samuel is a talented multimedia creative, who most recently used his skills as a media producer on Bernie Sanders&#8217; presidential campaign. We talked a good bit about what it&#8217;s like to work on a political campaign of that magnitude, how he first got involved, and how he worked to get the campaign&#8217;s message out during this time of physical/social distancing.</p>
<p>Samuel also spoke on growing up in the USA and attending school, spoke on how journalism impacts his creative process, and gave me a peek into his visual storytelling process. Samuel&#8217;s energy and drive really come through in this interview, so I hope you take a listen and get inspired!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, let&#8217;s start the show. All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Hi, my name is Samuel Adaramola. I am a multimedia professional currently working as a media producer for the Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is a regular day like for you on the campaign? And I&#8217;m asking this considering for people that are listening, we&#8217;re recording this on April 2nd. We are in the midst of this coronavirus outbreak. As much as that has impacted nearly every industry in every sector, I&#8217;m just curious, what&#8217;s it like working on the campaign right now?</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Well, let me start by answering what it was like before the unfortunate pandemic. And yesterday made it a year since I&#8217;ve been in a campaign, and this is my first time working on a presidential campaign.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
And every day is different, and what we&#8217;re trying to do in the campaign and what we&#8217;re able to accomplish somewhat was, do everything internally in terms of our production, all of our design is in-house, all of our ads that we do on video and all of our social media videos was done in-house.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s a constant churning of production, and this means that we have to put on multiple hats. We have to be producers, we have to be editors, we have to be filmmakers as well. So every day kind of brought something different.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
So sometimes it&#8217;ll kind of give you a newsroom vibe where we meet regularly and try to determine what ideas do we have for today or this week based on certain policies that have been released or certain things that are in a new cycle. We want to meet regularly to determine what that is.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
And sometimes these ideas are short term, like quick turnarounds based on new cycles, and other times they are long form projects. If we want to go to a certain community and for example, I had the privilege and honor of going to North Carolina, Durham, North Carolina to McDougald Terrace, which is a public housing facility that was unfortunately been neglected. And as a result, the tenants there have been living in inhumane conditions.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
So finding stories like that or having those stories come our way where we will have to fly out to certain locations and do some location scoutings and set up interviews and things like that. So it really depends. But I would, it&#8217;ll be most likely kind of like a newsroom setting where we&#8217;re just meeting together and trying to figure out what&#8217;s the best idea to put out there.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m part of the digital team and we would, this is comprised of film editors, graphic designers, the social media team as well. So we will just come together and kind of discuss different ideas.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Now in the face of this pandemic, we have had to pivot like most people in America, and the world right now. We&#8217;ve had to pivot to a fully remote operation and we&#8217;ve tried to and what we&#8217;ve done and shout out to our team, we have kind of pivoted to focusing a live stream and doing content that way.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
But, however we have regular meetings online and we are coming together kind of keep that vibe to brainstorm ideas of how we can do it in the midst of this pandemic. One idea I wanted, I pitched in the middle of producing is, how does this pandemic exacerbate the disparities that exist in Black communities and low income communities?</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
So I was able to reach out to some doctors who serve low income and Black communities and do a Skype or a Zoom call and have it recorded and conduct interviews that way.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
So I think you know this Maurice, and I&#8217;m sure your listeners do know this as well, it&#8217;s like creativity really comes when there&#8217;s constraint and I think right now, we are in a deep constraint where we are forced to kind of think outside the box and try to find ways to really get our messaging out there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. How did you first get involved with the campaign? You&#8217;ve been there now for a year. That&#8217;s a long time in a political campaign. I don&#8217;t know if people that are listening really realize that, but given the intensity and the frequency of work that you have to do, a year is a long time.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Yeah. A year is a long time and how I did get involved in the campaign was prior to joining the campaign, I was working as a multimedia specialist for Our Revolution, which is a nonprofit that came out of the Bernie Sanders 2016 campaign.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
I wasn&#8217;t involved in the 2016 campaign. Honestly, I wasn&#8217;t really, I wouldn&#8217;t call myself a very politically active person, but I think that the opportunity came at a time. I was a freelancer prior to that and it came at a time where I was kind of, for lack of better words, fed up with the working on projects and doing things that I didn&#8217;t really care for.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
I call myself an idealist, I believe in a better world and I wanted to work in that capacity. Use my creativity for good and this opportunity came as sheer luck, saw it online and applied and I was liked enough to be asked to join.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Yeah. I was there for three years. Initially started as the lead designer there and we weren&#8217;t doing any type of video production and anybody will tell you, the landscape of social media, you kind of want to be producing videos, whether it be short term or long term. And I saw it as an opportunity to kind of pitch that idea of hey, we should do videos.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
I have a little bit of a background in it. I minored in film in my undergrad at Towson University, so I was comfortable doing it and also did a little bit of video work while I was freelancing as well.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
So I pitched it, put up a budget of what it would cost to get all the gear and shout out to Senator Nina Turner, who&#8217;s also a part of the Bernie campaign. But when she came into be the president of Our Revolution, she sat all the staff down one-on-one and one of the things that we talked about in my one-on-one with her was that it is my desire to kind of rebrand the campaign.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
And she gave me that opportunity and I was able to do that as the lead designer. This was before I switched roles, but I just wanted to kind of throw that out there as that being an experience that really allowed me to kind of flex my muscles a bit in a creative capacity and actually take on the task of rebranding of an organization.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Since Our Revolution was so closely tied to Senator Sanders, it was kind of a no brainer that people who are involved in Our Revolution take on the opportunity to join the campaign. So it was just like an easy transition, and Senator Turner who was the president of Our Revolution, joined the campaign and we were given the opportunity to join the campaign as well.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s how it happened. Luck being at the right place at the right time and rising to the occasion and stepping up to those opportunities.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds like it&#8217;s a little more than luck though. I mean you put in the work too.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Yeah. I want to maintain humility here, but I definitely worked hard. Being in Our Revolution, which was a new organization and we were always trying to, as the term goes, we were always trying to build the plane while flying it. And I&#8217;m very proud of the work we were able to do there. And a lot of people who were part of Our Revolution are on the campaign currently and we&#8217;re still doing great work.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
And it was kind of like we graduated college together and we all started the same job together because it was such an experience that, how can I say this, that constituted growth and being on a campaign allowed us to grow even further in our respective areas.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
I can speak for myself that joining the campaign as a media producing, producing some of these social media videos and being a part of some, creating some ads. I did some voiceover work for one ad, but just being a part of that process and kind of see how things that have been made in my year definitely allowed me to grow in my creative capacity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean it sounds like you have the opportunity to involve yourself in a lot of different projects within the campaign. Like you just said, there&#8217;s a little film, there&#8217;s some voiceover, you&#8217;re doing design work and for those who don&#8217;t know, I mean I&#8217;ve mentioned this on the show before. I used to work in a campaign, not a presidential campaign. I want to be clear about that. That was a mayoral campaign.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I at least understand to a degree the level of intensity that has to go into it. Of course, running for mayor and running for president are two entirely different things in terms of scope and scale and everything, but I know what it&#8217;s like, like being in the campaign office. Late hours, everyone&#8217;s working together. It&#8217;s such a, it becomes a very tight knit group of people and you&#8217;ve all went through this experience together.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting, like even from past administrations. How you hear like say the Obama administration, you hear about people that are working together or they&#8217;ve partnered up with someone else who worked with the campaign or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Going through that kind of crucible of an experience, it does spark growth because there&#8217;s just so much that&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a really like a microcosm almost of what it&#8217;s like to work for a business or to run a business. There&#8217;s so many different things you have to do.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Absolutely. I would say that it does kind of feel like a startup. I do want to backtrack. I didn&#8217;t do, or I haven&#8217;t done much design work if at all during the campaign. My task was mainly video production, so that&#8217;s where my lane was.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
But some of the designers who came from Our Revolution are the designers in the campaign and I&#8217;m able to collaborate with them with certain pieces and see what they&#8217;re working on and put our heads together for creating dope content.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
But yeah, you&#8217;re absolutely right. It is a microcosm, so to speak. You don&#8217;t know how much you&#8217;ve grown until you sit and look back. And with my one year being yesterday, I&#8217;m like wow. I don&#8217;t think I would have created this many videos or pushed myself this far. Some things that I was kind of a little apprehensive about doing initially, April 2019. I have no fears in doing that right now.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
So definitely appreciative of this experience and how grueling it is. I mean, I have no reference. I mean you&#8217;ve worked in a gubernatorial campaign and I had no prior campaign experience. So it&#8217;s funny because a colleague who was at Our Revolution who didn&#8217;t want to join the campaign, she had her experiences in campaign. She&#8217;s like, my experience is enough.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s one thing about campaigns. You either will only do it once or it&#8217;s the only thing you will ever do.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Oh yeah, and I haven&#8217;t&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Or it&#8217;s the only thing you will ever do.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Oh yeah. I haven&#8217;t done it at all, so I said, &#8220;Let me see what this is about, at least.&#8221; I believe, and again, like I mentioned before, I&#8217;m an idealist. I believe in a better world. That&#8217;s part of why I support Senator Sanders and have been a part of his network of policy and social change. Because, in him, what initially drew me to him, because I&#8217;ve never seen someone run for president who is a documented, I guess, activist for the civil rights movement. I&#8217;m referring to the picture of him getting arrested for protesting housing segregation in Chicago. Seeing that picture and be like, &#8220;Huh, he&#8217;s running for president?&#8221; And knowing that he wasn&#8217;t aware that that picture even existed. You know what they say that, show me who you are when nobody&#8217;s looking? That&#8217;s your true stuff, so that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve taken a liking to him so much initially and just grown to believing in equitable world for everybody. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here and that&#8217;s why I want to continue to fight.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When I worked with campaigns, it&#8217;s funny you mentioned that about the point of reference. There was no point of reference when I did it either because I was working on the first set of municipal races after Obama got elected for his first term. Obama&#8217;s first term, that team did so much around design and social media and getting the word out that was really unprecedented for-</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; not even just a political campaign for president, but any type of campaign like that.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Those first sets of municipal races afterwards, I will tell you every politician that I spoke with wanted to copy that Obama playbook. They were like, &#8220;How do we get votes through social media? How can we do what Obama did? I&#8217;m trying to get some of that Obama magic.&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hire someone from Obama&#8217;s team?&#8221; I don&#8217;t know, but it was a lot of trial and error and at the time when I was working in the campaign, I mean, I had my own studio. I had just started actually my own studio in late 2008 after Obama got elected.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The first big client I had was the political campaign that I worked on, and so it was a lot to come up to speed with what they were trying to do and the message they were trying to get out. I mean, it was a totally &#8230; Now that I think about it, that was over 10 years ago. It was a totally different landscape. We had a MySpace page.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Oh wow. That&#8217;s a throwback.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We had a customized MySpace page. We had a Flickr page. We had a Meetup page. Twitter was around. We had Twitter. We had Facebook. We had LinkedIn, most of the big social media places that are out now was there. But we legit had a MySpace page. It seems like ages ago, but that was over 10 years ago. I&#8217;m curious because technology has continued to change since then, I would say most notably how much more people are using smartphones. There&#8217;s a lot of push towards mobile, a lot more things going on mobile. I&#8217;m curious from your standpoint, how do you plan for mobile given that more people are used to receiving text messages and doing stuff with apps and things than they were, I&#8217;d say, even four years ago in 2016?</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Oh yeah. I mean, some things that I observed whether directly or indirectly played a part of during the time of the campaign is that our ground game is strong in terms of our organizing efforts and our fundraising efforts. One of the ways we prepared for mobile is we actually developed an app for mobile. This app, you can see all of the policies there. You can see some of the graphics that our design team has created. You could see some of the videos that pertain to some of the policies that we&#8217;ve created all on the app. Not only that, we&#8217;ve made it an engaging experience where people can sign people up to help register people to vote. If you have a network as friends, you could share all the videos and share all the graphics and stuff.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
That&#8217;s something we definitely kept in mind. Like I mentioned, we did everything in-house. We had an in-house product team that developed the technology and the apps to create it, so that&#8217;s definitely something we&#8217;ve always kept in mind. Even on the video sense is, we always create our videos to be optimized for a mobile experience. So we&#8217;re cutting things in square. We&#8217;re making sure that captions are always present and legible, so whether you have a disability or not or whether you just don&#8217;t have the volume of your phone on, we want to make sure that people are able to see or at least read what the video is about. These are things that we&#8217;ve always kept in mind when we&#8217;re constantly creating, whether it&#8217;s something that is as direct as having an app created or in the way we create videos and create content.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have to do any internationalization, because just given the coalition of people that you&#8217;re trying to reach as a president, I&#8217;m wondering if you have to do a lot of translation or things of that-</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; nature too. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Absolutely. I think one of the things that we started to do was we started to translate all of our graphics to several languages; Spanish, Arabic, a slew of others, where we started to have that in mind. With our videos as well, we will always do Spanish translations, especially if it&#8217;s a video that pertain to a specific policy or issue that affected that community. That&#8217;s always something that we kept in mind, and I&#8217;m proud to say that we did a pretty good job with it, especially on the graphic side.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you end up reaching supporters or voters who are probably not traditionally online in like this current pandemic climate we&#8217;re in right now?</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, one of the ways we did it, and I guess pre-pandemic is that we had a lot of volunteers who would make calls. That was probably one of our largest efforts in organizing. We made millions and millions of calls to organize people to vote or volunteer or get active in this political campaign. Again, going back to the app, the app was like a device that is used for you to go out and talk to people and engage with people and share what you&#8217;re seeing and share why you support the campaign. Those are the little ways that we attempted to reach people who aren&#8217;t online.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So the app then I guess has talking points, you are able to use that almost as a guide to talk-</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; to the other folks that aren&#8217;t online. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Now, you&#8217;re working in media, you&#8217;re a media producer, as you know, and as I&#8217;m sure our audience knows, between 2016 and now we have seen a proliferation of, what&#8217;s the best way to call it? Can I call it the smear campaign? I don&#8217;t know. But we&#8217;ve seen this proliferation of &#8220;fake news&#8221; and distrust in the media and we&#8217;ve seen lots of altered media, whether it&#8217;s Photoshopped images or even deep fake videos and stuff like that. What are your thoughts on the challenges of truth and veracity and media when it relates to that sort of stuff? With the public service sector because, I mean, now we see social media sites, like Facebook and Twitter, trying to fight those kind of claims of misinformation. How does that stuff work in a campaign?</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
I mean, fortunately, we haven&#8217;t had to deal with deep fakes of Senator Sanders out there. I think the onus is on people to be as media literate as possible. I think we can&#8217;t only rely on big social media companies, Twitter or Facebook or what have you, to take it upon themselves to do it. I mean, they should do it, absolutely, but we also have to make sure that we are as media literate as possible. Having the ability to identify a deep fake or to question and to evaluate and analyze the content that we&#8217;re consuming. But that&#8217;s a tall task, honestly, because as human beings we&#8217;re just predisposed to do what&#8217;s easiest and most convenient. And so, I think as in the campaign, I&#8217;m not sure how it manifests itself, but I think what we try to keep in mind is that we, to the best of our abilities, are sourcing material and sourcing facts. We constantly cross-reference with our policy team to make sure that everything that we are using and putting out is legitimate.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s part of the process of tackling the misinformation. I think if we have presidential candidates running, that should be something that is constantly at a top of mind, just making sure that they&#8217;re not falling victim to these false claims and false facts that we see online. Hopefully, in the future, and I think we&#8217;re not too far away from this is, in future presidential campaigns that there are platforms, specific things that deal with disinformation and fake news, for lack of a better word. Because it&#8217;s been abundantly clear, like you mentioned, since 2016 that facts and reality is being under attack. Journalistic institutes are being under attack, so I think it&#8217;s something that we do need a leader with a vision to fully understand that, &#8220;Hey, these places, at least some of these sources, are our friends. Their job is to inform the public in a true manner.&#8221; So yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Before we started recording, you asked me how I found out about you.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so, I said I was going to wait till we got on the show before I mentioned this. Last year in September, which seems like 20 years ago at this point, just to be hones with you. It was like late September last year. I will tell the story. I was on Twitter under the Revision Path handle and I asked, &#8220;Are there any black designers or developers on any of the campaigns of the current candidates running to become the next U.S. president from either party? If this is you, let us know.&#8221; Because I was like, we&#8217;re going into January, 2020. I want to be able to talk to some black creatives that are on these individual staffs. I mean, September 2019, there were like 30 people running. It was like a bingo card on the Democratic side.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There was a ton of folks that were running, and so I was like, I reached out to every candidate multiple times or the candidate&#8217;s campaigns at least, reached out multiple times and we heard back from only one campaign. It wasn&#8217;t Bernie, I&#8217;m just going to be honest with you.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It was Beto O&#8217;Rourke. We heard back from Beto O&#8217;Rourke&#8217;s campaign and he was like, &#8220;Oh yeah, we&#8217;ll pass it on to the team.&#8221; Other than that, I couldn&#8217;t find anyone. And so, I said, &#8220;Well, let me just go on LinkedIn and just start searching for designer with the candidates name.&#8221; And so, I&#8217;m doing that for all of the &#8230; Had a spreadsheet, doing it for all the candidates. The only one, the only person I found was you with the Sanders campaign. This was back in September of 2019 when I said there were a lot of people running on both parties. That&#8217;s how I found out about you.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Well, all right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I say that to lead into my next question though. What is it like for you being a black creative working in politics with progressive organizations?</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not the only one, fortunately, in the Bernie Sanders campaign. As far as the black creatives go, on my team in the videos, is a talented motion graphics designer. Her name is Bria, she&#8217;s on the team. A young black lady. There&#8217;s another on the design team, her name is Laura as well. There&#8217;s also Chris and [Sumarias 00:12:09]. We&#8217;re represented within the Bernie Sanders campaign in terms of black creatives. But as far as what it&#8217;s like to be a creative on the campaign, honestly I would say it&#8217;s like any other job but my more intense and a lot more is on the line. But, obviously, we are privileged in a sense to be there and serve as a voice to our communities. All black people aren&#8217;t the same, but when you have representation even from the top on down, it&#8217;s very important because it allows you to voice your opinion and perspectives that may not have been considered or of thought of before.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
So as it relates to what I&#8217;ve been doing on the campaign is that, when I am thinking of a video idea or creating some work in whatever capacity, I&#8217;m always thinking about, &#8220;Okay, how does this affect my community, black community and the black immigrant community too. Because I&#8217;m a first-generation Nigerian American, so I&#8217;m always thinking of these things in this way. How I create and how I birth ideas always has that frame of reference. I&#8217;m fortunate that there hasn&#8217;t been a lot of hurdles for me to be able to voice my ideas and my opinions and they have always been met with respect and consideration, so there isn&#8217;t really anything I could point to that&#8217;s much different from what anybody else would experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you mentioned being first-generation. Where did you grow up?</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
I was born in Lagos, Nigeria, and was immigrated to America when I was two, so I was basically raised in America. But I was undocumented all of my life. Well, most of my adult life too. So I&#8217;ve been raised as American as Apple pies, people say, but not having documentation until I graduated from undergrad. So a lot of my time in America was living in the shadows, not really getting the opportunities that one would normally get as a citizen of the country. So yeah, it was particularly difficult. That&#8217;s how I actually got to becoming a designer. I&#8217;ve always had an interest in being creative. In high school and even middle school I would like &#8230; It&#8217;s funny when I think about this, I had a head start in creating for a political campaign because one of my best friends in elementary school ran for student president. I drew his campaign posters and I would always draw on clothing with fabric paint and I developed an affinity for creating. I didn&#8217;t find out my undocumented status until I was-</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Oh, I didn&#8217;t find out my undocumented status until I was graduating high school and wanted to go to college, but I didn&#8217;t have a social security number and I didn&#8217;t find out until I was applying. That&#8217;s how my world got flipped, turned upside down: not to quote Fresh Prince.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
But I was still able to go to school undergrad because of two things. One, my late mother, who was a permanent resident and she was on disability at the time, she was giving me some of her disability checks to go towards paying tuition. I&#8217;m not saying it like it was a lot, but it meant a lot to her because it was her only source of income. But I was taxed of doing is completing the rest of it and I did that with a group of my friends.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
I was deejaying in college and we would throw parties and one of my friends, he made a flyer for one of our first parties that we were going to go to throw, and it looked like something that came out of Coral Paint. It was just a terrible looking flyer. And I knew, like I mentioned, I was creative up to that point and I just knew I had a taste of what looked good and what didn&#8217;t. And literally, when I saw him do the flyer, I was like, &#8220;Nah, we could do better than this.&#8221; I went in our school library and I looked at YouTube tutorials of how to make flyers in Photoshop and nine hours later I had a Halloween party flyer that I was really proud of and stuck with it. That morphed into figuring out how to make logos and figuring out how to create different brand assets. I just hacked my way into learning design.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
When I graduated, because I got my undergrad in mass communications with a concentration in advertising and public relations, I graduated college without a portfolio like somebody who would have traditionally gone to school for design. But I had a portfolio of several party flyers and some logos that I made for student body organizations, so I thought I had a little something. I thought I was working with something. You couldn&#8217;t tell me nothing back then, but then you get humbled when you apply for jobs and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, so that&#8217;s what real design looks like.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
But I eventually ended up working at an advertising agency in DC and my role wasn&#8217;t designed. My role wasn&#8217;t digital, my role was being a digital producer for the social media department. That&#8217;s just basically someone who project manages different projects for different clients. What that enabled me to discover was the process of creating with multiple creatives. Got to work with developers. I got to work with other designers. I got to work with copywriters. And I got to be someone who was tasked with managing the resources and the billable hours for everyone who was working on a specific client project.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
So, being able to sit in their room and meet with clients and have the ideation process of what they seek and desire, and actually see it through fruition by observing the creatives on the team there, it opened my eyes to, &#8220;Okay, I know I was doing all this stuff, making party flyers and doing all this knockoff stuff, but I&#8217;m in a room with people who have gone to school and did this stuff and super talented.&#8221; I knew then that, &#8220;Okay, I didn&#8217;t want to be the project manager of this stuff, I actually wanted to create. I wanted to be a designer.&#8221; There was only a few black people there at the time. Maybe still is, who knows? But it was myself and I think one other person. But the person that I want to bring up, her name is Kim Williams.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
I bring her up because she gave me the opportunity to go for it. I remember one day I came into work and she pulled me aside. We went into the room and she was like, &#8220;Hey, I noticed that you don&#8217;t seem like yourself or something slacking. What&#8217;s going on? There&#8217;s not too many black people here and I just want to make sure that we are holding each other up and doing what we can do to survive here.&#8221; I just opened up to her and said, &#8220;Hey Kim, I want to do what you&#8217;re doing.&#8221; She was the art director there at the time. I said, &#8220;I want to design. I want to be a part of the producing this creative stuff.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you do it?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Huh. I can, right?&#8221; But she was like, &#8220;You can do this. You can really do this. I have books. I have stuff that I can give you. You can just dedicate your time to learning this stuff and being creative and you can find yourself doing this work.&#8221; She bought me a Wacom tablet-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow!</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
And she gave me some books and she just patted me on the back and sent me on my way. And I was like, &#8220;Wow!&#8221; And to this day, I can&#8217;t talk to anybody without mentioning her because that put me in a trajectory of where I am today. If I did not have that conversation with her, if she did not pull me aside as have that, &#8220;Come to Jesus black person to black person conversation,&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t be here speaking with you right now and my career to that conversation and I appreciate her wisdom back then.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
So, I ended up leaving because of personal reasons that I had with my family, but I worked part-time at a nonprofit organization and then a dedicated the rest of my time to going ham with designing and figuring it out, taking on freelance gigs here and there just to get better. As a result, the portfolio I was able to put together from that time was what landed me at Our Revolution and being at Our Revolution is what landed me at being a part of a presidential campaign.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
So yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s quite a path.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Yeah, it is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You mentioned Kim Williams, you were at Ogilvy when this happened, right?</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think we&#8217;ve had that same Kim Williams on the show. She for a while was design director at Indeed?</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Yeah, she was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah! We had Kim on the show last year. Look at that, small world.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Small world, big world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Small world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Was your family supportive of you going into this creative route? I can only imagine first-generation, they want you to go into something that&#8217;s more lucrative and more secure.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. I&#8217;m blessed because my parents were&#8230; My dad is a hippie, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
I call him a Nigerian hippie because he&#8217;s traditional. He&#8217;s a traditional patriarchy type of figurehead, but he&#8217;s also into meditation and juicing and metaphysical stuff. He&#8217;s not your typical Nigerian man. I think for some immigrants, their experience are different. I think some people come in here with the idea of I&#8217;m coming to America to be the best XYZ. Other people say, &#8220;I&#8217;m coming to America to survive.&#8221; So, my parents were the survivors, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
My dad had many odd jobs. He was an ice-cream man at one point. He was an insurance salesman. He was a taxi driver. He was everything. So, his idea of success wasn&#8217;t really tied to being a doctor or a lawyer or engineer, which is what the stereotypical expectation is of a black immigrant child. His idea was just being happy. My mother, on the other hand, she was just more or less the same, just the idea of being happy.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
When I was in elementary school and in high school drawing on shirts and ruining my clothes and making new clothes out of old clothes, my mother says, &#8220;Yo, this looks good. Can you write some Bible scriptures on the shirt for me?&#8221; So they&#8217;ve been supportive in that sense. And I think because of&#8230; Another thing is that some people come to America with the understanding of how to navigate the immigration system and other people don&#8217;t because they&#8217;re just on survival mode. Again, my parents were under survival mode and that, unfortunately and somewhat fortunately, resulted in me being undocumented for most of my life. So, I don&#8217;t think my parents quite had time to worry about what I&#8217;m going to do with my life, but they always made sure that they provided for me.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
I always felt like I was a good kid. I knew I wanted to be creative or do something in some creative capacity, but I think I am a product of my environment. So having relatives and friends who belong to the black immigrant community and seeing that most people are in those traditional doctor, lawyer, engineer paths because of what their parents want for them, you do find that quite often. I do feel, at an earlier point in my life, felt pressured to fall in line. At one point I thought I was going to be an entertainment lawyer because that was my way of working in media and still having a respectable position. But I think what most immigrant parents and elders who come here, they just aren&#8217;t educated on how lucrative some of these careers can be.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
They may not know that you&#8217;re a developer or they may not know that you&#8217;re a designer or a media producer. They&#8217;re just not accustomed to it because all they know is that being a doctor is distinguishable and can earn you a high income. But also, somebody, even if it&#8217;s a doctor, someone had to design the tools that they&#8217;re using, somebody had to create the software that they&#8217;re inputting their patient information in. These positions are very valuable and I think it just takes people like me and other people who are in similar career paths or those untraditional paths to educate them on that. I think some people are coming around to that now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, well said, man. First of all, it&#8217;s great to know that your parents were really supportive of you being behind it. But I feel like that&#8217;s something that&#8230; and I&#8217;ve had hundreds of black designers on the show&#8230; I don&#8217;t think this is unique to black designers. But I think it is unique probably to people of color that are going into a creative field, is that unless there&#8217;s an example that they can see their parents or guardians can see of some type of financial success, then they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m good with this.&#8221; Because our parents grew up in a totally different environment, totally different.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They had to go through a lot more struggles than we had to and they sacrificed to make sure that our generation wouldn&#8217;t have to have those sacrifices. And so, maybe being seen as going into a creative field like that, because they don&#8217;t see examples of success, they probably think the opposite right off the bat. Like, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re just going to be spray painting, airbrushing shirts at the fair,&#8221; or something like that. You know?</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I see how that could turn into something much more&#8230; necessarily say much more lucrative, but that you can take that creative skill and use it in a number of different applications.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Yeah, everybody&#8217;s needed. I think everybody can&#8217;t be a doctor. Everybody can&#8217;t be a lawyer. Everybody can&#8217;t be an engineer, but I think what you said is exactly right. I think when they have a hard time seeing the success of those untraditional paths, so it is like a trial by fire where you just got to do what you want until you just are successful and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Hey mom and dad, I did it.&#8221; If you watch that Netflix movie Uncorked, it has that same feeling to it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Don&#8217;t ruin it for me because I haven&#8217;t seen it yet.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
It&#8217;s really good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I do want to see it.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
You got to watch it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m going to watch it. I&#8217;m going to watch it.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
That&#8217;s also what I wanted to talk about, the dualities of the black identity. I think sometimes the black immigrants and black Americans or descendants of slaves were sometimes pitted against each other. And I think we can realize that we have similar experiences and we can learn to celebrate our differences, and that&#8217;s all I want to do with my life.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Being raised in America and just being an immigrant, I always felt like I&#8217;m not quite American enough, but I&#8217;m also not quite Nigerian enough, so I&#8217;m just in this little box. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;But I experience both things,&#8221; and I just wanted to mention that. It&#8217;s good to share our stories and be able to celebrate each other, whether it be a creative pursuit or not. It&#8217;s just good to know that we exist. I think our communities and the black community in general is that much better by having our stories told.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. So later on you mentioned going to Twoson? Am I saying that right?</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Towson, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Towson. Sorry. I&#8217;m looking at it like, &#8220;Is it Towson?&#8221; Okay, no. So, you mentioned going to Towson for undergrad, but then later on you went to Syracuse and you got your Master&#8217;s Degree in Communication and in Journalism. How does your journalism experience impact your design process?</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Well that&#8230;it&#8217;s new. I only graduated last fall.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
But in saying that is, I wanted to go to Syracuse and to do that program in particular to be a better storyteller. I think what my experience there has taught me is just how important it is to do your research right and to consider other things, like how data comes into play with how you tell your story, or how different technology and the media landscape changing can affect how you&#8217;re telling a story, and thoroughly understanding media law will affect how you tell your story.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
So unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t experienced enough in my current career that can inform what I do with my creative path. But I do, in going through the course and finishing it, it did open my eyes to just how deep storytelling can go, especially when you&#8217;re creating from a journalistic landscape. Because a fun project I did during my master&#8217;s was looking at the data of the black filmmakers, black directors, and black casting, looking at how they fared the last 30 years in terms of reaching the top 10 status. And how, although it may seem that we are represented in terms of the film industry, we are still having quite far some ways to go, especially with the fact that there has not been a female director who is black, who has reached top 10 highest grossing films. And there&#8217;s only&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
10 highest grossing films, and there&#8217;s only been one black filmmaker to do that, which was Ryan Coogler with Black Panther. So I think doing those projects, they helped me be curious about where are we now as a community and how much further do we have to go. As I think about projects and things that I want to do in the future, I know that having this education at Syracuse has given me a solid foundation in terms of understanding and learning how to navigate storytelling better in any aspects of creativity, whether it&#8217;s a film or or creating different designs or developing a website.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So when it comes to the visual storytelling, where do you typically try to begin the story?></p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
I&#8217;m trying to pull from my experience at the campaign. For me is understanding the issues that are affecting the community. And I want to pull this North Carolina video again as an example because it&#8217;s probably one of the videos that I&#8217;m most proudest of that I was able to do in terms of visual storytelling. When I found out that this was what this community was going through, the first thing you want to do is research. And when you research it allows you to think of some pointed questions that you can ask the subject you&#8217;re interviewing. And that&#8217;s just the set up, because when you are going to film and interview someone, what they say could be completely different from what you expected. What you go in there thinking it&#8217;s going to be, the story ends up being something completely different. You may experience this doing the podcast, but I think when you are able to have all those elements come together, your research, the questions and the interview and the response, and you&#8217;re able to transcribe that and find a story, you can then find supplemental materials there. So I think it all begins with just doing enough research on the issue that you have at hand, and I think doing enough research, whether it&#8217;s even a video or a design, can steadily inform which way you go about creating.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you&#8217;re in the DC area, you mentioned being in Silver Springs, Maryland, but in the DMV area, outside of the work you&#8217;re doing with the campaign, what is the design scene or the creative scene like there for you?</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
For me it&#8217;s everybody&#8217;s&#8230; I think DC is unsung, man. DC doesn&#8217;t get the love that it should. It&#8217;s a very, very creative town, a creative city, this DMV area, especially within the black community. I think people, if you go on IG, there is a sense of community. There is a sense of people actively creating. And this is another thing and I wanted to bring that up as it related to the conversation about career paths and what&#8217;s distinguished and what isn&#8217;t. You still find that people who are engineers, their side hustle is that they paint or that they bake cookies or that day design shoes or have a fashion brand and you find a lot of that in the DMV area, especially within the black community that they have.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
It&#8217;s like they live a double life. They have their nine to five, I&#8217;m going to clock in and clock out at my engineer job. But as soon as they&#8217;re out, they&#8217;re out being creative and hustling and bustling. So I think you do find a lot of that in DC where people have that dual identity in terms of being a creative and being someone who&#8217;s has, I guess, a distinguished career in engineering or so. And you also have like&#8230; I think me being here, this is a very rich African immigrant community, and being raised in that environment, I&#8217;ve always felt comfortable being around here and&#8230; From churches to little grocery shops to even now venues and clubs that are owned by Africans. You see that community also as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What keeps you motivated and inspired these days? These are some interesting times that we&#8217;re in right now. You&#8217;re also working for a political campaign, which is always full of ups and downs in the campaign. I don&#8217;t care where you&#8217;re at in terms of rankings or whatnot. What keeps you inspired, motivated these days?</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Oh man, it&#8217;s tough these days, man. Things just seem so dreary and we don&#8217;t see a way out right now, but I just look back at my past and the nature of how I got to this country and how I am able to be where I am now despite the obstacles that faced me with my immigration status or what have you. And I look at my father and my late mother and the things that they were able to do to provide for me with the little that they have. What keeps me inspired is knowing that I have the opportunity to build generational wealth, and I&#8217;m not just talking about wealth financially. I&#8217;m talking about wealth with knowledge, the first one with my Adaramola last name, to have a bachelor&#8217;s and a master&#8217;s degree. So that is legacy. That is wealth to me.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
And when I think about the future that I want to have for my future kids and my future wife, I think about that and to be able to say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ve had these experiences while taking a path that wasn&#8217;t traditional or or easy,&#8221; is what keeps me motivated. I want to do so much and I&#8217;m grateful to have this experience in the campaign because I&#8217;ve learned so much and what I&#8217;m going to be able to take in the future is exciting and what I want to build for my legacy and the community for black people in general, to share the stories and to have more people, to be able to say, &#8220;Hey, that&#8217;s somebody that looks like me that&#8217;s representing a different sector or telling stories that are nuanced in a way that haven&#8217;t been told enough because people think all black people are the same.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
So when I think about all of those things together, my history, my path, and what I want to create for the community, that definitely keeps me motivated, especially in these down times where everyone&#8217;s just sitting at home and it just seems it&#8217;s Groundhog&#8217;s Day, the movie, where you&#8217;re just repeating the day over and over and over and over and over again. I look at the books on my bookshelf and say, &#8220;Hey, I haven&#8217;t read that book. Maybe I can learn something about it.&#8221; You know what I&#8217;m saying? And have that experience of reading the book inform how I want to create in the future. So little things like that will keep me motivated. And just honestly, people like you, Maurice, people who are out there creating and seeking out the stories even when people weren&#8217;t trying to tell you what black designers are in the campaign, you went and saw it yourself.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
I mean honestly just knowing that people are creating their own platforms. And when I see people who are doing things that I want to do or are somewhat adjacent, I don&#8217;t get jealous. I get inspired. Man, that was tight. Let me see if I can do it better. So just the creative community, the black creative community as a whole just always motivates me, and I just want to always see us win no matter if you&#8217;re a black immigrant or you&#8217;re born and raised in the South or wherever you&#8217;re from. I think black people, when we learn that we can create more and create together, I think it&#8217;ll be a phenomenal thing and definitely something to keep me motivated and inspired.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Amen to that. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? It&#8217;s 2025, hopefully all of his pandemic mess is a faint memory behind us, but what kind of work do you see yourself doing in the next five years?</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Honestly, man, I&#8217;m working towards this right now, I want to have my own media company and I want to be able to use that media company to tell black stories in new and unique ways that are informed by my experiences of being raised in America as a black immigrant and bridging the gap between black identities. I want to do that work, whether it&#8217;s through video or audio storytelling with podcasts, but just continue to contribute to the zeitgeist of black creatives and continue to offer something new and to create more room at the table for different kinds of black creativity. So in the next five years, I want to spread that good juju to the world and be working for myself and employing other black creatives, other creatives of color to lead that legacy of telling unique nuanced stories of the black community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, well just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m fairly active on Twitter. My handle is samoriginals, one word, S-A-M-O-R-I-G-I-N-A-L-S, and it&#8217;s the same with Instagram. I&#8217;m not as active on Instagram, but you&#8217;ll see me there, and you know my website, samadaramola.com. Just look out, I&#8217;m working on some things in the future and yeah, if you are politically activated, vote, make sure you vote, make sure your voice is heard and make sure you&#8217;re registered because we don&#8217;t want another pandemic that is mishandled.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Listen, I know this is a design podcast and I don&#8217;t mean to get political, but for y&#8217;all that are listening, if the last three months have not shown you how important it is to get out and have your voice heard in terms of the future of this country, I don&#8217;t know what will. I don&#8217;t know what celebrity needs to dance a jig in the streets or whatever to get you to get out there and vote, but it is necessary. Just look at what the last three months have been like in this country, and you should go vote. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m saying. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m saying. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m saying.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Not just in 2020, too. Every two years you got to put that in action. Just vote, be active in your communities. The situations have always been worse for for black people even before the pandemic, and this pandemic is just going to further exasperate the disparities that we have in this country. So get active. Like Bernie says, never lose your sense of outrage. Don&#8217;t lose it. All we have is our life on the line, so just get active, get informed. Still create, but don&#8217;t lose your sense of outrage.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Well Samuel Adaramola, thank you so much for coming on the show. Again, I know we are recording this during very trying times right now that we&#8217;re all going through in this country, but I think just your message and your drive and really just your enthusiasm for making sure that you&#8217;re telling stories is something that we need now more than ever, whether it&#8217;s on a political campaign or not, just people that are out there that can show, not just how different we are, but also how we&#8217;re very much the same in many ways is really important, and I&#8217;m really going to be excited to see what you do next. I feel this is just the start for you, for whatever next is going to be coming big.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Oh man, thanks so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Thank you so much. Thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Samuel Adaramola:</b><br>
Yeah. Thank you for having me, Maurice, and I look forward to hearing myself. All right, take care.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 public health crisis is affecting us all, taking us out of the lives we led before and forcing us to move forward through a fog of uncertainty as we try to find our way back to some semblance of normalcy. Such is the case with this week&#8217;s guest, Arielle Wiltz. While she is typically based in NYC, she was sheltered in place in New Orleans when we spoke. We started off discussing her work at frog design, including how she&#8217;s taking the current relocation in stride with everything else happening at the moment.</p>
<p>Arielle also shared how she transitioned from being a dancer to being a designer, talked about her volunteer work with ADCOLOR, and she shared some of the new things she&#8217;s learning to help keep her focused and motivated during this time of transition. Arielle may say she just fell into design, but it sounds to me like that&#8217;s just the kind of inspiration others need to hear in order to see themselves in this industry as well!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
My name is Arielle Wiltz and I am an interaction designer currently at frog Design. It&#8217;s a design consulting firm, one of the largest ones globally actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Now, what&#8217;s a regular day like for you there? And I know that this is probably a odd question to ask given what we&#8217;re going through right now with this pandemic, but talk to me kind of like what your regular day-to-day is like.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah. My regular day-to-day before the pandemic, well it&#8217;s usually, typically within frog, we&#8217;re in teams. So the teams are filled with like strategists, depending on a project, industrial designers, VD designers, interaction designers like myself.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
And we usually really coming together to brainstorm on whatever the project that we&#8217;re currently working on. So sometimes there&#8217;s a lot of white boarding the day and sometimes it&#8217;s a lot of heads down. It&#8217;s like executing the project. Other times you may be, for myself, especially being an interaction designer, we&#8217;re doing user testing, trying to understand how the users feel about the experience that we&#8217;re creating.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So it really varies every day how we work and function. But usually when you&#8217;re on a project at frog and you&#8217;re with your team, you&#8217;re with your team for months. So you&#8217;re with that team the whole entire time. So it&#8217;s usually like you in your little corner with your team working, brainstorming, ideating.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like there&#8217;s a lot of just heads down work that you get to do to focus on a project.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah, it is a lot of heads down. So one of the things I&#8217;ve found is like me working by myself, a lot of times frog is really big with collaboration. They believe in a lot of bringing ideas together especially from different disciplines. It&#8217;s rare that I&#8217;m just working with people who are interaction designers. I&#8217;m usually working with people who are in all different types of disciplines.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
I haven&#8217;t had the luxury to work with industrial designers but I have worked with strategists before and VD designers of course and design technologists. So a lot of times we&#8217;re really working together. And then once we come with an idea or concept, we&#8217;re go into like execution heads down.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
But I think it&#8217;s so beautiful. One thing I learned from frog that I absolutely love, it&#8217;s creative process. When I was in school studying, I used to feel like it just came from thin air. How do you go from A to B? What is happening?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
But with frog and working collaboratively and frog is really big on design research and pulling from all the research to really conceptualize and coming out with these amazing ideas. Because one thing about frog is we push for the next big thing. So I think that&#8217;s really phenomenal that I had the opportunity to learn this there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How did you get started at frog?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Actually it&#8217;s very interesting. I just really applied more so. So my journey to user experience interaction design is really a fluke. One thing about the career that I&#8217;m in or the discipline I&#8217;m in, people go to the top schools. Right. People go to School of Visual Arts, schools in Europe, school in Asia. They really work vigorously on their portfolio. They attend a lot of internships.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Me, I just studied graphic design at Loyola and I didn&#8217;t even want to do it anymore. So I was really big into art nonprofits, helping out my community, decided to move to New York because that&#8217;s what I always wanted to do. So I moved without a job or a place to live. And with my first job just doing digital project management, I just fell into it. So I fell into it and I just build my way into becoming a designer. A lot of ups, a lot of downs because I didn&#8217;t have a lot of the resources like people at those types of schools.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
But in 2016, when I found that I was able to build my foundation regularly at a full time job, I worked really hard at it. So when it came time for when I applied at frog and I learned how to present how to articulate my story, I think that&#8217;s what really won them over.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What kind of projects are you working on right now at frog? As much of that as you can mention.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So, I can&#8217;t mention much but frog&#8230; I could tell you about the type of projects. So a lot of projects within frog, which is different from other companies that I work with. Because, like I said, frog is not one of the largest but one of the top design consulting firms in the world.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
But what they do is people come to us and really want us to reinvent and reimagine. So think of any type of healthcare. How can we reimagine healthcare for the 21st century? Frog is known for building one of the first Macintosh and working with Steve Jobs. So that&#8217;s the history of frog really from industrial design to now into the digital age.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
And so a lot of projects when companies come to us and, whether it&#8217;s finance or entertainment or like I said, healthcare is really just reimagining the experience. Reimagining how it can be done, coming up with completely new concepts that hadn&#8217;t ever been done before. So that&#8217;s why I say the creative process is just so unique to me and so amazing on how do you actually get there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now you&#8217;re also the lead of frog&#8217;s Diversity and Inclusion group there in New York. As much of that as you can talk about, I&#8217;m really curious because I don&#8217;t hear about this a lot at design agencies. How did that group begin? And as you&#8217;re sort of leading it up, what sorts of things does the group do?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So frog initially did start having a D&#038;I, this amazing creative director in Austin, who I had the pleasure to work with, Alexa, she used to own it. But I feel like in New York we didn&#8217;t really have anything. So one day, again, one of my mentors at frog, John Wasserman, he was like, &#8220;Who wants to lead D&#038;I?&#8221; Because we had a Slack channel.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
And so at the time I was on a bench and I was like, &#8220;Sure, I&#8217;ll lead it.&#8221; And so we started to have just workshops with people there. Frog, they&#8217;re diverse in a sense but when it comes to the numbers, as far as blacks, Latinos, is very low. So we were just like, everyone in it, no matter if you&#8217;re a designer or not. We all came together and we were just discussing what does diversity mean to us and et cetera.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
And so from those conversations I started two programs. One was breaking barriers, which is just a talk series open to the public where we invited people, but we for sure had people speaking, people of color. Because one thing in design, I didn&#8217;t believe 20% of it is people of color. And as far as blacks, there&#8217;s only 5%.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So my goal was for us to actually see it because I think that&#8217;s the big thing a lot of times is I don&#8217;t see it so I don&#8217;t think I can do it. I really pushed for that to just have all different types of people of color to sit in those chairs and actually speak about their story.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So, that was very successful and my baby. My favorite thing is for our mentors where it was a selective program where we reached out to, again, like I said, when it comes to these companies, a lot of times they hire from the top schools and I was like, &#8220;You know what? Let&#8217;s look at the state schools. Let&#8217;s look at the local community college schools, because the truth of the matter is there&#8217;s talent and innovators everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So we found, I believe, 28 people apply and we narrowed down to two amazing mentors, shout out to Sarah and Lisa. And they worked vigorously with two creative directors and came up with amazing portfolios who are now working at amazing companies. So on Buzzfeed and I believe Grey Advertising.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh nice.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. And that was the first time doing it. It was really prototype. I just hit the ground running as we were going up, I created it and made it. I did have help for, like I said, the mentors, the mentorship program was a lot of work. And we all have design jobs as well. People have like departments just to do that.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
But we worked really hard at it and I&#8217;m just so proud of my mentees and the difference that they&#8217;re making. Just being their authentic selves in these spaces. And I think that&#8217;s brings me joy, honestly. Seeing other people coming through the doors who look like me or represent another culture. That&#8217;s what design needs because it could be very Eurocentric.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, it totally is Eurocentric, in the United States absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Totally, totally Eurocentric.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now these kinds of D&#038;I groups, I mean I feel like I hear about them a lot from tech companies. Tech companies will have some type of a group. Actually we had, back in December, Kendall Howse who works for Red Hat and he heads up their D&#038;I group. But there&#8217;s something that I kind of hear from tech companies. I don&#8217;t really hear it from like agencies or design consultancies like what frog is. Why do you think it&#8217;s important to have this kind of group at a company like frog?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Oh, it&#8217;s so important because us as designers, especially in today&#8217;s age, everything that you do, everything that you experience has been designed out for you. Where it&#8217;s like urban design, industrial design, the product that you&#8217;re using, the experience that you&#8217;re having.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
For example, tele-health that everyone&#8217;s using right now, especially with the pandemic. It&#8217;s like everything&#8217;s been designed for you. And if the majority of people who are designing are white male, consciously or unconsciously, you don&#8217;t know, it becomes bias. Correct.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So I think it&#8217;s so important to have a diverse representation, not only just of as race, as ability, is of anything just to diversify it so other people can feel included and an experience and don&#8217;t feel left out. And especially since technology has taken such a hold with our society, people are being left out, which is so unfortunate.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So I feel like one of my missions, especially as a designer is to make sure I do my part in bridging a gap. And so to me that was what the mentorship was as a part, to bridge the gap as far as what product design and brand design. Even with brand design and making sure that images of different types of people from different cultures are included.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So I definitely feel like it&#8217;s important. Especially when you&#8217;re working at a company, that whole goal is to innovate. One thing I love to say is diversity is innovation. Just imagine having a group of designers, engineers, industrial designers, strategists, all in a room from all different types of backgrounds, including economical backgrounds. Because that&#8217;s a issue too. Really thinking and brainstorming and strategizing a problem. Imagine the solutions that can come out of it. So that&#8217;s why I feel like it&#8217;s just extremely important, especially now to diversify the industry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s the best thing about what you do at frog?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
You know what? I have to say, I work with extremely, extremely amazing creative people. I have been blessed that I have worked with people who really&#8230; I had two for sure managers or creative directors that have really pushed me to think at levels that I couldn&#8217;t even imagine. Also just, like I said we worked collaboratively, working very closely with the visual designer-</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
&#8230; collaboratively working very closely with the visual designers, because that&#8217;s who I often work with. I learn so much from them. So I think that the thing that I really enjoy working with is, I feel like I&#8217;m blessed to have worked with, for example, I said Alexis from Austin, a creative director that&#8217;s no longer there, Jared, my manager, Henry. To work with people like that who really push me and just really, I feel like I&#8217;m being taken to another level from that. Then working with my coworkers, too. My VD coworkers for the most part.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the ones who I usually would work with. I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s really cool about it, because you&#8217;re working with the top people there, so&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So given that collaboration is such a big part of not just the work that you do at Frog, but also it sounds like just the culture of working at Frog, how have things been different now with this pandemic? Because now, I&#8217;m assuming, you&#8217;re working from home. Probably everyone is working from home, I&#8217;m assuming, right?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Right. Everyone&#8217;s working from home right now. Yes. Yes. Oh man, it&#8217;s been so different working from home. I feel like I&#8217;m working more working from home than&#8230; I&#8217;m not really having a lot of downtime. I&#8217;m on a screen the whole entire time, and we have a lot of meetings. This project I&#8217;m working on now, we have a lot of meetings just to make sure everyone&#8217;s in the loop, and like I said, with agencies it&#8217;s usually a lot of fast paced work as well.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So I won&#8217;t say difficult, I would say new, you know? It&#8217;s different. It&#8217;s different in a sense. I feel like say this pandemic lasts until June, July, people would get used to it, but it&#8217;s definitely new. I know the company did set up parameters of how to work from home and they leased out different softwares in order to do it, which is all cool, but just really adjusting yourself to do it.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
I usually would wake up early, have breakfast, do this, do that. Now I&#8217;m so tired because I feel like I go, go, go, go, go the whole entire time. It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m leaving work then coming home, my work is at home. So that&#8217;s been really new for me, but yeah. We still have meetings. Every [inaudible 00:17:17] is basically running the same way as it was running before, it&#8217;s just the adjustment of working from home that I feel like everybody at my company, or everybody everywhere if they don&#8217;t really work from home, is kind of struggling with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Does it feel like Frog is extending some kind of, I don&#8217;t know, grace during this time? Because this is a big shift for everyone, I&#8217;m assuming. It&#8217;s not just the change in working from in an office to working at home, but having the right set-up in terms of your desk or chair or laptop or monitor, or even now you live in New York but you&#8217;re currently in New Orleans. So now you&#8217;re not even at your place, you&#8217;re at a different place, trying to adjust to this. So hopefully Frog is extending some grace with how you all are working from home, and not expecting right away the same level of creative output, I guess. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah, well you know what? When you work at, like I said, a company like Frog, they&#8217;re always going to expect top notch creative output, you know? That&#8217;s just how it is. But I think what&#8217;s beautiful is my creative director right now, every single time we check in, she really does a check in. Like, &#8220;How are you?&#8221; It&#8217;s not just like a regular, &#8220;Oh, how are you doing today?&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Seriously, how are you?&#8221; If you&#8217;re feeling stressed or whatever, &#8220;Okay, maybe you need to take a walk. Maybe you need to step away.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So I think it&#8217;s really the creative directors who really taking in and up to account different things, like, &#8220;How are you doing right now? What&#8217;s going on with you?&#8221; If you don&#8217;t feel well&#8230; Really checking in. Checking in way more than before. That&#8217;s what I love about the creative director now. Every day she&#8217;s really just checking in and saying like, &#8220;How are you?&#8221; And really having a conversation about it.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So I feel like that&#8217;s really important right now because not only at Frog, I feel like any company or most companies, it&#8217;s still work. People are still going, people still trying to make deadlines, and it&#8217;s really hard right now because&#8230; I&#8217;m fortunate right now that I don&#8217;t know anyone who&#8217;s sick or anything like that, but for people who do, or people who are going through it, are sick themselves, or&#8230; Man, I can&#8217;t imagine. Even the health system, like we were saying earlier, being so overwhelmed right now. So I think everybody at some level is feeling it, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
But yeah, like I said, the creative directors, they&#8217;re aware of it and I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s good about it. We&#8217;re human-centered design. We&#8217;re making sure things are human-centered within the teams too, so that&#8217;s really needed right now, and it&#8217;s happening.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s what I was saying. I hope that companies are extending just that grace because it&#8217;s&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. We know who people are at work in an office, but people&#8217;s home lives and their work lives are completely different. Some people use work as, I won&#8217;t say as an escape but that kind of feels like the best way to put it. They may not have the best home life, and going to work is the thing that&#8217;s sort of their brief respite from whatever they might have to deal with. Whether that&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know, kids or a spouse or dealing with aging parents or anything like that. There&#8217;s a lot of things that can go into play, and working from home, it&#8217;s the option that we have to take right now-</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s a lot. And then on top of all of that, just the overall impending news of the pandemic and what&#8217;s happening.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It wears on you.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Oh, definitely. It definitely wears on you. I remember one day before I came to New Orleans I was in New York. It was right before I started on a project so I was reading through files and getting prepped for it, and I was watching MSNBC the whole entire day. It created so much anxiety for me. It was when people were still trying to figure everything out, and that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s a big concern. Like I said, I&#8217;m fortunate, but 100% there are mothers who are working from home now, dads, and people who have a ton of different businesses that they are running right now, and now to work from home and do everything plus manage your kids, managing like you say, your aging parents, or possibly even if someone is sick right now.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So that definitely goes into play with everything, but like I said, being the design nerd, I think it&#8217;s the time where people should, like I said, start mobilizing more. So utilize your skills to help others right now. There&#8217;s right now [inaudible 00:22:00] going on with UX for Change, and they&#8217;re working, partnering, with data center, I believe, that&#8217;s really heavy hands on what&#8217;s going on right now. And actually all these designers, data scientists, engineers are coming together to actually help solve a problem.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So I feel like this is the time, now, where people should start doing this. I know a ton of fashion designers right now within the health system that things are going on, just making face masks right now. So I feel like this is the time for us to really hone in and come together and help solve these issues, like you said, because I can&#8217;t even&#8230; Like I said, I&#8217;m not dealing with that but I can&#8217;t even imagine for someone who is dealing with something like that right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. The last time I went out was the 14th of March. I remember this because I was already a bit skeptical about going out because I had just come back from LA a few weeks before that and I was sick when I came back. Now, when I came back, the sickness that I had, I sort of chalked it up to allergies because we have terrible pollen in Atlanta. But I chalked it up to allergies, just the fact that I was in and out of planes, I had switched hotels during the trip, I was at a conference. I figured all of these things just came into play with, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m feeling kind of sick.&#8221; Not flu-like at all, but just more annoying than anything else, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I had been getting better leading up to the 14th, and I remember this because I was going to go vote. They had early voting then because our primary is on the&#8230; Or was, I should say, on the 24th. They&#8217;ve now pushed it back. So I went to go vote early in the morning. It took me, I don&#8217;t know, maybe five or 10 minutes, and I remember walking into the voting area in the library and the women there were like in hazmat suits.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
These are the poll workers. Gloves, huge jugs of hand sanitizer, masks, hazmat suits. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Is this ground zero?&#8221; It felt like I walked into an emergency room or something. But I remember going to vote, came home, and if I would have known that would have been the last time that I really could have left the house I would have, I don&#8217;t know, made a liquor store run or something, but I would have done something else.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s just that all the news about all this is happening so quickly with shelter in place and what&#8217;s going to happen in terms of financial stimulus. This has affected so many other businesses out there. I mean, I feel very fortunate in tech that the company I work for hasn&#8217;t been affected by it in terms of furloughing employees or anything like that, but depending on how long this goes on, there&#8217;s no telling what this looks like. There&#8217;s no end in sight.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now hopefully, knock on wood, by the time this podcast comes out we&#8217;ll be outside chilling. Hopefully.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But right now, I&#8217;m on day 17 and I&#8217;m just like, one day at a time, I&#8217;ll just see how it goes.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah, for sure. I spoke about how with design we could provide tools with healthcare workers or the government, but even just simple pleasures like&#8230; Not being able to have a human connection, you didn&#8217;t even realize how good it feels to go by your friend&#8217;s house and just chill, hang out, give them a hug. These little things you really miss doing. But one thing I love is how technology right now&#8230; With Instagram Live and D-Nice and the Quarantine Club, having a club at your house, feeling human, having some type of connection again with someone other than the same people you see all the time in your house. That feels warm to me. Really needed right now, you know? To still feel like you&#8217;re human, not just really just stuck in the house and I can&#8217;t go anywhere except just get groceries [crosstalk 00:25:57] if that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. If that, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, I haven&#8217;t been going out to the grocery store, only because I&#8217;ve been trying to heed the advice of stay in, order, because that&#8217;s the best way. They can drop it off. So, but even doing ordering through Instacart or something, they&#8217;re like &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing here. Half the stuff that you wanted to get is not here.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s just a lot going on right now that can make it tough to focus on work because there&#8217;s so much other stuff that&#8217;s happening and you&#8217;re just at home. It&#8217;s all like that&#8217;s the epicenter of everything, because you can&#8217;t really go out and do anything.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah. I think another thing that this hasn&#8217;t&#8230; When I speak with my friends right now it&#8217;s really helping us focus on self care tools and what to do right now to really just not increase your anxiety with everything. My theory, like I told you, I was fine until yesterday when I really started thinking, &#8220;How long is this going to last?&#8221; I started freaking out because I was like, &#8220;Wait, how long is this going to last and I&#8217;m going to have to be here and do this and that. What about my normal life? What about what I was doing all the goals that I had summer? What I&#8217;m trying to do?&#8221; So it&#8217;s a adjustment, but I feel like I am learning more self care tools that I probably needed while I was in New York, because New York itself can be hectic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well yeah, that&#8217;s true. That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So yeah, so really readjusting it and when we come out of this we&#8217;ll definitely continue doing those things because even, this is so basic but even like eating. I noticed that when I&#8217;m New York, waking up and then going on the subway, then work, then sometimes I&#8217;m working past normal hours depending on the project, I just forget to eat. That&#8217;s so crazy and insane, but it really does happen. So since I&#8217;ve been working from home I make sure to have my meals and do things [inaudible 00:27:58] and really just take care of myself, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
And I think that&#8217;s, no matter what we do or what you&#8217;re doing, make sure you take care of yourself. Especially in this because your immune system is what&#8217;s going to help you if you do get sick and you don&#8217;t want to, by any way, shape, or form, have it down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, and you&#8217;re in New Orleans, which as of the time that we&#8217;re recording this is one of the big hotspots for the virus now.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yes. Yes, New Orleans is because people are assuming, I don&#8217;t know for sure, but people are saying because of Mardi Gras with so many people here it was able to spread it rapidly. Yeah, so it is one of the hot spots. New Orleans, I think the difference is New Orleans is more spaced out. So for example, my mom, she works out every morning so she might do a little run, but no one&#8217;s outside. We live in little subdivision and it&#8217;s spaced out.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Unfortunately people are not staying at home like they should, but yeah, it&#8217;s pretty bad in New Orleans, actually. Really bad, actually. I know a couple of friends of mine who know someone who has it right now, or even died from it. My mom mentioned one or two people, so it&#8217;s really bad here now. Especially when you&#8217;re in a city. What I love about New Orleans, it&#8217;s so warm here, so hospitable, and for you not to be able to do something that&#8217;s so natural down here, it&#8217;s been very difficult and hard.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Or even for example, I know, which is so hard, but people can&#8217;t even see the grandparents right now. New Orleans is very family knit community, and so people can&#8217;t even see the grandparents or even take care of their grandparents. I know when my grandparents were alive my mom used to go and take care of my grandmother, so I couldn&#8217;t even imagine being in something like this and we can&#8217;t even take care of my grandmother who was differently able. She was in a wheelchair. So I can&#8217;t even imagine people who are dealing with that right now and how difficult it can be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you been able to at least keep in touch with her, like call or anything?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Oh no, she&#8217;s not here any more but I&#8217;m just saying.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, oh. I&#8217;m sorry. Oh.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, no-</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
More.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh. Oh, I&#8217;m sorry. Oh.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah. No, no, no. She lived a long, beautiful life though. But I&#8217;m just saying, I&#8217;m just thinking about the times when my mom did do that. That I know so many people are probably doing that now and can&#8217;t. That&#8217;s difficult because you don&#8217;t want to go there because you don&#8217;t want to get her sick sick in any way. But at the same time she needs to be able to do certain things because she&#8217;s differently able. She&#8217;s unable to move because of the wheelchair. I think that&#8217;s really difficult right now. Because not everybody can afford to put their loved ones in nursing homes or can do certain things or provide assistance. A lot of people are doing it themselves. To even be in a situation like this right now, it has to be very difficult.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. To kind of switch gears here a little bit, I know we really ended up talking about this for a good bit of time, but you mentioned New Orleans, you&#8217;re from New Orleans, you grew up there. What was it like growing up there as a kid interested in design?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Oh wow. Oh, so it wasn&#8217;t so much that I was interested in design. I was just a very creative kid. One thing I do is write. I write Medium articles. I used to write a lot of stories. I was in dance in school. I thought I wanted to become a professional dancer, even studying in college. I was a dancer. Also I was part of different activities within church. I feel like that all kind of brought in my skills to become a good designer. That&#8217;s one thing that I&#8217;m really big on is STEM to STEAM and including the arts because I feel like that all contributes to innovation. Even if the person decides to become a scientist or technologist or engineer, having the arts really help push your creativity. Because that definitely helped me because, oh man, I used to dance. There&#8217;s this program in New Orleans. New Orleans have a lot of free dance programs and it&#8217;s NOLA NOBA.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Man, I used to dance every single day. Go to dancing school, dance, dance. Very disciplined. Studied ballet, studied modern, studied jazz, and just that discipline, that creativity, I really felt brought into my skills as an interaction designer more so innovating different ideas within technology.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was just going to ask, how did you go from dancing to design?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Oh wow. When I was in college and I was studying dance, I became injured in one of the programs and so when I was injured they was saying, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re going to have to like&#8230;&#8221; How this program went was fall, you take this course. Spring, you take this course. Back and forth. They was like, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re going to have to sit out for a year.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;A year?&#8221; I was so focused on graduating on time, which still did not happen, but I was like, &#8220;A year? I don&#8217;t want to wait a year.&#8221; I was so upset and I was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m just going to change my major.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t even really know what I wanted to do but I knew I still wanted to be somewhat creative. So little that I knew because I didn&#8217;t know really much about all the different types of designs and I was like, &#8220;Oh I heard of graphic design before. I guess I&#8217;ll get into that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Again, like the story of how I got into anything was all a fluke really. I was like, &#8220;Okay I&#8217;m just going to get into this. I&#8217;m going to become a graphic designer I guess.&#8221; I wind up, because I transferred schools and I was at Loyola studying graphic design and I wound up not being so into it because I guess I didn&#8217;t get the full grasp of it at the time being so young. But once again I fell into interaction design. I was like, &#8220;Oh wow.&#8221; Using my analytical skills because I am quite a nerd when it comes to research and analyzing and then being creative and combining both together. I thought it was just like the perfect job for me. Like, &#8220;Oh my God, this is like everything that I&#8217;ve been wanting to do.&#8221; Because I&#8217;m very analytical and I like a process. It was like this is the process to get to point A to B. It doesn&#8217;t come from thin air. It&#8217;s very rigorous. But it&#8217;s some type of silver lining to it.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah, that was my experience more so. But yeah, New Orleans definitely helped me out, especially when we were speaking earlier about my involvement with diversity inclusion because I attended NOLA NOBA. Again, design is again very elite. I mean not design, dance. Dance is very elite. For NOLA NOBA to have programs in the inner city with top design dance teachers who taught in New York, Europe, et cetera, teaching us. That was just everything. It felt like things were possible that you probably thought you couldn&#8217;t even do. That&#8217;s one thing that I really admire and really grateful for having that background as being a dancer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What did your parents say when you kind of switched it up like that? I mean from dancing to design. Did they have anything to say?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Oh no. My dad wanted me to be a doctor. He had his heart set on it, so my parents, they weren&#8217;t into it. They weren&#8217;t into it at all. They weren&#8217;t into me studying dance. They weren&#8217;t into me&#8230; They really didn&#8217;t get into it until&#8230; They weren&#8217;t into me moving to New York at all. I think they really didn&#8217;t realize my journey, my path that I chosen until like I started becoming successful into it and now they go bragging. Like, &#8220;Arielle, what do you do again.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m a designer.&#8221; &#8220;What is that again?&#8221; I have to explain it over like, &#8220;I&#8217;m an interaction designer.&#8221; &#8220;What does that do?&#8221; &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s computers.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;It&#8217;s more than computers.&#8221; &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll just say computers.&#8221; They&#8217;re very proud but my parents have been supportive. But I feel like most parents of people of color, especially like black parents, they want you to be a doctor, engineer, think that they know you should do. When I was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to become a designer,&#8221; it was like, &#8220;What is that? We don&#8217;t get that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think also part of it probably is them just&#8230; I think it might be less about wanting to be a doctor or engineer and more about being in a successful role where you can take care of yourself and hopefully them too.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s more about the possibility or the probability of that because I mean we know that there are working artists and designers out there, but when we think about jobs that have some level of respect or prestige or make money, it does end up being those kinds of doctor, lawyer, engineer kind of things. It&#8217;s less about being a designer or an artist or an illustrator or a musician or anything like that, you know?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah, 100%. But that&#8217;s the thing that I love about what I do is because yes, I am a designer. I&#8217;m an interaction designer. But the reason why I truly decided to go this path and with my career is because I always loved helping people. That was one of my passions because in the beginning I was working at art nonprofit and making sure I was bringing the arts into the cities where people weren&#8217;t exposed to or kids aren&#8217;t exposed to it more so. So I was thinking about going&#8230; I was working at campus at the time, a digital project manager. I already started assisting the UX design, so I already was kind of doing it. So I just wanted to learn more about it. Like I said, I&#8217;m a researcher so I was on a computer. I found this company and they created this really, really amazing technology that allow patients with, I believe ALS, be able to communicate their needs in control. Things like for example, turning the lights on or off or turn on the TV or not using technology.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
When I saw that I was like, &#8220;Oh my God, I&#8217;m still contributing in some way.&#8221; I may not be the doctor in the hospital, but I&#8217;m creating the technology for the doctor in the hospital. That&#8217;s when I was like, &#8220;This is what I need to do. This is what I want to do in my life.&#8221; That&#8217;s when I rigorously pursued it. I feel like really letting people know the different opportunities in me in choosing to become a designer is one of the big things. Or even being in the creative field because I feel like sometimes people just think we just color and draw all day, but that is not the case at all. Like no. No, I definitely do not do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When did you decide to make the move to New York? Because it sounds like you kind of had your roots there in New Orleans with your family and going to school there. Why the move to New York?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Again, like I said, this has been my journey. This is probably the beam of my journey. A fluke. I was just like, you know what? I was working at amazing nonprofit called Young Audience of Louisiana, amazing nonprofits. I was working there and I was making decent amount of money to be in New Orleans. Moved from office manager to marketing associate. Because one thing you realize is when you have any type of degree in design, the first thing they make you do, no matter what you want to do, you could definitely step out of design, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, you studied graphic design? We need help with this.&#8221; They pull you back in. It was just like I was working one day and I always wanted to move to New York since I was a child. I just went to my mom because I was still at home. I believe I was 24, 25 and I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m moving to New York.&#8221; My mom was like, &#8220;With what money?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m just going to start saving and I&#8217;m going to move.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Then I went and I picked the day in the calendar I was like September 6. That&#8217;s when I&#8217;m moving. My mom was like, &#8220;Why is it set for 6th?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. This is just the plan.&#8221; I did it. It was just so crazy. I tell my friends, I can imagine now my best friend Tracy, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Where are you going to live?&#8221; It was just, I didn&#8217;t have a place to live. I didn&#8217;t have a job at the time. Everything kind of fell into place because of course I wasn&#8217;t homeless. But yeah, I was working in restaurants for a good time when I first moved to New York. Shout out to the restaurant industry. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
What I did know is I did know that I wanted to be in digital so I did have some type of plan. I was like, I want to work in digital, but I didn&#8217;t know about all the different types of disciplines. All I knew was I studied graphic design. I don&#8217;t like graphic design. So those were the two things I knew. I knew I wanted to work in digital and knew I didn&#8217;t want to be a graphic designer anymore. From my research I was like, &#8220;Oh, I want to become a project manager.&#8221; But I thought that was being a product manager. I didn&#8217;t know the difference. So I just started applying for those jobs.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
That&#8217;s really how it all happened. Basically just fluked. It was just like something in my spirit. I&#8217;m very intuitive so I try to listen to my spirit and just go forward with that. But go forward with a plan though. I do have plans in place when I do things. When I decide I&#8217;m going to do something, I go forward with a plan and make a schedule and really sketch it out moving forward. But yeah, that&#8217;s really how it happened.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I saw from looking at your LinkedIn, you worked at a company called Tigerspike for over two years as a UX designer. What did you take away from that experience?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Oh wow. Tigerspike really gave me my foundation because when I was a canvas at the other companies too, it was really me just trying to find myself. Like how do I fit in in this world? I was studying at general assembly part-time because I couldn&#8217;t afford the full time program. Working full time. Trying to become a UX designer at the time. Then finally doing just some freelance gigs or contract gigs. But once I got to Tigerspike, that really set my whole foundation of being a designer. One thing I had to say about Tigerspike. Tigerspike, it&#8217;s now smaller in the US, but it was the first time I met another black designer. I know that may sound crazy but that was&#8230; I remember it like yesterday.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was going to say, not for this show that doesn&#8217;t sound crazy.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah. I know. No, no. It was definitely not. I remember I was&#8230; So the recruiter at Tigerspike, She helped me get a contract job and so my contract was ending. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh Tigerspike&#8230;&#8221; She now worked at Tigerspike and she was like, &#8220;Oh now we&#8217;re hiring for this project. It&#8217;s going to be contract to full time. I&#8217;ll let you know if you qualify.&#8221; So we were talking back and forth because they needed someone more senior. I knew I did not have anything for a portfolio. I had one general assembly project and I made up projects.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
She told me, say it was Monday, she told me Monday I had an interview. Then so on Tuesday, I stayed up all day and night creating a project because I know I didn&#8217;t have a portfolio and I know I didn&#8217;t have anything. I just stayed up all day night working on it. Right. No sleep. I go in the next day delirious but determined to do well. I was so shaky and nervous because when you go into the space, it&#8217;s predominantly [inaudible 00:13:21]. It&#8217;s not me. I don&#8217;t see myself. I walked in and I see this black woman, her name Rachel Robbins, automatically just like relief came through me. It was my first time seeing a black designer and she was high up too as well.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
I presented her my work, her and two other designers my work, and it was just such a calming relief to see someone so familiar in that space that I think that&#8217;s one of the reasons why I did so well because I was no longer nervous and scared. I felt like, &#8220;Okay, she&#8217;s there. I don&#8217;t know how her experience, I don&#8217;t know her background, but this woman looks like me, so if I don&#8217;t get in here, I could make it within this industry.&#8221; I think that really helped me get my foot in the door. Like I said, it was like the foundation of design for me. Very rigorous but amazing team, amazing company. I was even able to travel to London. It was my first time in Europe and I worked there for three months. So just the opportunities were endless working there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Sounds like you came out of that with a lot then.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
A lot. Yeah. I was, like I said again, just very blessed on his journey. The journey has up and downs, but the highs be really high sometimes. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;Wow, I can&#8217;t believe I just moved here when I didn&#8217;t have a place to live and now I&#8217;m in London.&#8221; That was just really amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny you mentioned that. The place where I work at now, Glitch, the first week was split between me being in New York and being in London. The first day at work was they flew me up there, did paperwork and everything in New York that Monday. Flew overnight to London, was in London. That was my first time in London. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And that was my first time in London, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. That Wednesday actually was a conference that my CEO was at and my boss was attending. So it&#8217;s my first time meeting these people and it&#8217;s at a conference where I&#8217;m expected to represent the company on day three of working at the place. And then flew back on the Thursday, Thursday afternoon/evening. And then, was in New York on Friday. And then back in Atlanta on Saturday. I was like, &#8220;This is wild.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Wow, I know. And for you, you hear about&#8230; I know being from the South and being from New Orleans, you hear about people who live like that, traveling all the time for work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
And going to big cities, but actually for you to experience that, it&#8217;s like wow. Especially how old was I? Probably 27, 28 experienced, something like that first time. And no one in my family ever did anything like that. So for me to do it, it was just a surreal experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I also saw that you do some work with ADCOLOR, you&#8217;re on their advisory board. Can you talk a little bit about that?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Sure, yeah. So on the ADCOLOR advisory board, what we focus on is the Futures. So Futures are junior level people who are in their careers and we focus more so on building skills for them to develop so they could carry on throughout their professional career. Especially, another big thing is diversifying the industry, not just what people call it, but also different genders as well as different abilities. And the list can go on and on. And so what we do is, our goal is to create these programs for them. So when the conference come in, we have the Futures come a little early and create these programs to help them develop these skills, as well as we help out really voicing and speaking out for ADCOLOR and what it&#8217;s about. Isn&#8217;t it amazing? I&#8217;ve only been in it one year so far. This is my second year.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s been a really amazing experience because we&#8217;re working with people in all different industry because you&#8217;re also&#8230; It&#8217;s primarily ad, but now especially technology people in tech companies like Google and Facebook on the board, as well as people in different marketing industries as well, people with different backgrounds. But we all have the same mission and goal and that&#8217;s just to diversify an industry and the importance of diversifying industry. So I think it&#8217;s an amazing experience because it&#8217;s again, holds on to what I really believe in. What we say in ADCOLOR is rise up and reach back. And that&#8217;s one thing that I feel like I just been doing before ADCOLOR. Now and probably after ADCOLOR, I&#8217;ve been doing that with my life, just really trying to rise up to the best that I can, but always trying to reach back to others to make sure they can come on as well and try to really narrow the gap. So that&#8217;s what ADCOLOR is about and it&#8217;s been a dope, dope experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you kind of look back over your career, I know you&#8217;ve been mentioning getting into design and the opportunities that you&#8217;ve had as a fluke, but when you look back over your career, what are some of the biggest lessons that you&#8217;ve learned about yourself?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Biggest lessons I learned about myself, resiliency for sure. Because as I&#8217;m telling a story, there were a lot of lows. There was a lot of times, especially when I first moved to New York, I was really struggling financially and trying to make it. And there were times where I just really thought maybe I need to go back home, maybe I can&#8217;t do it. But I&#8217;m telling you hard times really help you. You know how they say hard times help build character and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, whatever.&#8221; Because you&#8217;re going through the hard time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
But when you look back you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, I know.&#8221; It really did help me built my resiliency. I feel like everything that I went through, no matter it was like the harshest of making it into New York or it was very heartbreaking for me because I did wanted to go to one of the top design schools. And when I was speaking with my mom at the time, it was like, &#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t afford it right now.&#8221; You can&#8217;t really afford it yourself, with how you&#8217;re trying to pay for things. So how it&#8217;s going to happen? So really me trying to strategize and figure out ways on, okay, I want to become this use experiences. I want become this interaction designer. I want to work at these companies. How do I get there?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So really building that skill of becoming strategic. And I feel like also the skill of being a fighter, man. Really being a fighter in a sense of standing on what I believe in. As far as, like I said, diversifying the industry, making sure more of us are in a space and not just talking about it but actually being about it. Actually trying to create these programs. Like I said, the mentorship program for our mentors was very prototype. It was not a refined program by any means, but I just created it. And now we have one Latina and one Middle Eastern, amazing women working in the industry now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So you got to start somewhere. So one thing I will say is you learn to just go for it. This is what I want, okay, kind of like about to get into design thinking. But this blue sky, this is I want. Now okay, how do you get from point A to point B? How are we going to get there? Kind of like the creative process that I&#8217;ve been speaking about. How are we going to get there? What are you going to do? And those are the things that I really learned from my experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What keeps you motivated and inspired these days?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Especially these days, oh man, man, man. Yeah, you&#8217;re able to think a lot now. So now I feel I&#8217;m really honing on what&#8217;s my Northern star and that is diversity and inclusion. And how do I do that? Kind of like go to parks, that&#8217;s my choice of weapon. My choice of weapon is design and innovation and technology. So how I&#8217;m utilizing it is, I&#8217;m trying to focus on product inclusion now. That&#8217;s one of my main goals. I&#8217;m actually now that I have so much free time, I&#8217;m starting to take courses in algorithm design, AI, and machine learning because that&#8217;s the latest revolution that&#8217;s happening right now for us.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
And again, we as a people are being left out in a lot of things. There&#8217;s a lot of biasness happening when things are being built. So I&#8217;m trying or not trying, I am learning these skills and learning how to apply them as a designer and how I can utilize my human centered thinking into it. So that&#8217;s what keeps me motivated right now. And I now know what I love to do. I now know who I am and how can I play a part of it. So now it&#8217;s just honing in all these different skills to make things happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? It&#8217;s 2025 hopefully, we are well past this pandemic by then. Where do you see yourself? What do you want to be doing in 2025?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Ooh, I would love to become a director at some level. That would be a big goal of mine. I also would definitely want to start probably creating a more formal program with the mentorship program. Whereas kind of like, you could say a school, but more on the free end for us and really provide all the professional resources that the top schools will have.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
That would be something that I want to do. And also like I said, I have all these amazing skills that I have learned from Tigerspike and from frog of how to innovate and come up with ideas and concepts. And there are so many amazing people who come up with these dope, dope, dope ideas in tech or just services. But then they need help with the creative process of how to go about really executing it or how to really solve this problem like what products need it.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
And so I want to start offering a service to more so focusing on us and focusing on us as black people, focus on us as brown people as well, and really providing those services because we need all of us in those entrepreneurial spaces as well. So providing those types of services. I&#8217;m actually kind of starting on that with a friend of mine. She&#8217;s investment banking, so she&#8217;s more so knowing how investor relations and how that work and I&#8217;m more on the creative side. So hopefully by 2025 we are fully established and functioning and really one of the top companies doing it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, look at that.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Sure, so I&#8217;m on LinkedIn, my name is Arielle Wiltz. Also Medium have me writing articles. And right now they&#8217;re in pandemic, but I&#8217;m definitely going to start back up writing more articles on diversity inclusion within design and the workspace and now product inclusion. So on Medium, my name is Arielle Wiltz. And as well as I&#8217;m finalizing my website, it will be www.ariellewiltz.com</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Arielle Wiltz, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I know that we&#8217;re recording this during a very tumultuous time right now just in terms of our society and everything. But I mean, I have to say talking to you has been so refreshing today. Your enthusiasm and your drive for really just kind of carving your own path to becoming a designer is something that I think I needed to hear today. And hopefully for people that are listening, they can hear that too. Hopefully, they can pick up on just how excited you are about the work that you&#8217;re doing and I really think that you&#8217;re going to go far if you keep that attitude, that positive attitude, it&#8217;ll take you far. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Thank you so much, Maurice. This was a pleasure.</p>

<p>We talked about how she&#8217;s adjusting to working from home and self-isolation due to the coronavirus pandemic, and she shared the differences and similarities working at Zillow versus her previous role as an art director at Amazon. Bekah also spoke about growing up between the United States and Brazil, attending college in Washington DC and getting into design, and adjusting to life in Seattle and attending graduate school. Bekah is all about building authentic community, and I can&#8217;t wait to see how her work makes an impact in the world!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
I am Bekah Marcum. I am a product designer at Zillow currently and also the community organizer for the Black Designers of Seattle Network.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Talk to me about working at Zillow. What&#8217;s a regular day like for you there?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Totally. It was a little bit more different than the environment that I&#8217;d been in before. It&#8217;s hyper, hyper collaborative in a lot of ways, so whether I&#8217;m working straight up with another designer or if I&#8217;m really collaborating with my content strategist and PM partners, everyone&#8217;s in the same space here in the same building, same floor together, so it&#8217;s a lot of walking around and chatting with people. But essentially, a day in of a designer at Zillow is, you get in, you have a fantastic view of the water in Seattle and then whether it&#8217;s going to a stand-up or any of those other type meetings, you grab a project. You might have some design critiques throughout the day with partners or other leadership. And, honestly, really just start collaborating on some pretty fun projects.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now I have to couch this in our current reality of when we&#8217;re recording this for people that are listening, we&#8217;re recording this on March 19th and you mentioned at Zillow the view and it&#8217;s hyper collaborative and you&#8217;re working together. Seattle is, or at least you know a couple of weeks ago was one of the big hotspots for COVID-19. I&#8217;m pretty sure as other cities have taken suit with this now they&#8217;re forcing people to work from home, to socially isolate themselves. What is the vibe like in the city right now?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been pretty weird. I think especially Zillow because although we do have people who work remotely, it&#8217;s not really a remote culture. And so it&#8217;s been a complete change from seeing each other and being in the office every day with each other to having to change everything into a online experience. So it&#8217;s definitely been crazy that restaurants and bars and other places were closed down. They&#8217;re only doing takeout right now. For us, we&#8217;ve been, along with a lot of the other tech companies in the area like Facebook and Amazon, we&#8217;ve all been working remotely for the last two, two and a half weeks. And so it&#8217;s definitely been, I think there&#8217;s a level of just stress that is definitely permeating everyone. We&#8217;re in such a lucky position to be able to work from home. But you have people who are small business owners here, you have people who can&#8217;t work from home and almost like the collective worry for our community has definitely been present.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. How are you feeling with all this going on?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
I feel that I was super lucky. I live a little bit outside the city. So for me, I have a yard I can just go out and escape to without having to worry about social distancing. There&#8217;s a bunch of stress again, from the small business owners and community. For me, I am so addicted to coffee and so I&#8217;ve made best friends with a lot of the different coffee shops and restaurants in the area and the baristas and so, just worrying about them and worrying about how this is going to affect not only the individuals but then also the small companies economically. For me, I was used to working remotely before in a prior job and so I had a space ready to flip the switch in that way. But it&#8217;s definitely taken a lot of, or I&#8217;ll just say it&#8217;s definitely been a transition into trying to work remote with all the stresses that are added onto it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has the team handling it, coming from this very hyper-collaborative environment and now being distanced in this way? How are they handling it?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
I think a lot of people are handling it pretty well. We have a massive amount of Slack channels over random things. The other day we were sending weird childhood photos to each other just to bring some of that community online. In in other ways, I think it&#8217;s been really great to see the team give each other a lot of grace because other folks&#8230; I don&#8217;t have kids, but a lot of people are at home with their young children. Zillow is a very family-oriented company and we&#8217;ve had many a kid come and do a cameo. Sometimes it was someone&#8217;s puppy and so it&#8217;s been fun to almost see each other in their home environments. But even my husband, who&#8217;s over at Amazon, one of their senior leadership sent out an email that just said, &#8220;You know what, guys? We&#8217;ll be fine. Let&#8217;s just make sure that we give each other grace in this time because we know things might take longer because there&#8217;s so much other stuff happening, so let&#8217;s just be patient with each other and just get through it together.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I definitely think that grace is needed for many of the reasons that you mentioned, going from working in an office to suddenly having to work from home and also not really being able to leave the house. That&#8217;s a big, drastic change for a lot of people that shakes up their routine, it affects them mentally, it affects the output of work that they&#8217;re able to do. So it&#8217;s good that the companies are empathetic enough to say, &#8220;We know this is a tough situation.&#8221; Not being completely hands off, but certainly exhibiting some grace in what is a very stressful time.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Totally. Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely been very, very nice to feel like we have that type of support and understanding.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What sorts of projects are you working on at Zillow?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Totally. I work in the growth and acquisition space for a product called Zillow Offers. Zillow Offers is essentially only really available in a few different cities right now, but it&#8217;s a new product to Zillow and it&#8217;s a program where we&#8217;ll actually buy houses from customers and then also sell them. The goal, the overarching goal in Zillow, is to help movers get to where they want to be. However, we can make that process easier for them, let&#8217;s do it. The whole premise of our program is that you don&#8217;t have to do any home showings, you don&#8217;t have to do repairs, you can essentially just pack up and leave. Some of our customers have given a lot of feedback where people who, some of them might have been in the military, some were moving for a job and they just really needed to get to the next place sooner. By not having to go through that whole traditional selling process, it removed all those different barriers for them and they were able to move faster. That&#8217;s essentially my product that I work on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Prior to Zillow, I know you mentioned your husband working at Amazon, but you worked there as well.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
I did. I was at Amazon for four years or right around four years, first as a contractor the first few months and then I went in as a designer, then left as an art director. Funny thing, my husband came in a few years after I did and when he was interviewing I was like, &#8220;Hey hon, why does it say that your hiring manager is on the same floor as me?&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll be on a different floor.&#8221; And we ended up being on two very different teams but being on the same floor for about six months. So we&#8217;re also pretty used to working in a similar space together.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s it like working at Zillow and how is it different from Amazon? Zillow is more of a startup, I would imagine. And Amazon is this big corporate behemoth.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
It&#8217;s very different. The cultures, if you even look at the leadership principles of the two companies, they&#8217;re very, very different. It shows up starkly. For Amazon, it was this huge, huge, huge company and sometimes you may not feel like you have full ownership over a certain product. I guess scope is a big thing for Zillow Offers. I essentially own a whole section of the product and so what I decide, what I really work and help to create just goes up and is the entire thing versus a small piece of it.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Another thing is Zillow&#8230; If you&#8217;re talking about workplace things, Zillow is much more of a nine to five and so there is a great work balance there. It&#8217;s been listed on different lists as a top place to work for families. I was really weirded out that people left their computers on their desks and went away for the evening. I felt like the first times I did that I was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll hide it in my little desk drawer.&#8221; And people were like, &#8220;No, you just leave it.&#8221; Have that work-life balance versus different times for Amazon it was very dependent on the manager that you had, on the project you were working on. So it definitely had a lot more creeping as far as your off time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That work-life balance is&#8230; I&#8217;ve found certainly as I&#8217;ve gotten older it&#8217;s more and more important to be able to really have that split and that separation and it feels like now, to go back, unfortunately, to talking about the coronavirus, I feel like everyone&#8217;s work-life balance is thrown off now.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s a weird thing because it&#8217;s now all in the same place and you don&#8217;t really have a way to separate it. I&#8217;ve found a way to try to separate it. I told you before you started recording, I&#8217;ve been working from home since 2008 so I kind of have a pretty good way of compartmentalizing it. But then you just have all the added stress about everything that&#8217;s happening outside of your home and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, how do I focus? How do I try to concentrate on the task at hand?&#8221; So it&#8217;s, yeah, it&#8217;s&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Totally, I feel like, yes. Right. At home, you have the dirty dishes, you have the laundry that hasn&#8217;t been folded in a week. Or at least I do. You have the animals and everything else. For my husband and I, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;All right, who&#8217;s going to use the office for a meeting. If you&#8217;re having a meeting out there and I&#8217;m having a meeting in here, how are we keeping the animals quiet?&#8221; It&#8217;s a whole collection of stuff also. I find it super hard because it&#8217;ll get to 5:00, 6:00 and I&#8217;m like, all right, when am I actually going to close my computer because I&#8217;m not at work and I don&#8217;t have to leave work on time to be able to hit the commute right and get home. You&#8217;re already home. So I definitely have had to, for my own sanity, just shut everything down. Put &#8220;do not disturb&#8221; on my Slack so that after a certain time in the evening, I&#8217;m just not getting those messages.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s the best way to do it. Just shut it all down and physically try to go somewhere else, a different place, a different spot. That really does help out.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
As long as you&#8217;re in your home because there&#8217;s still social distancing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Exactly. So where did you grow up?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
I actually grew up in two very different places. My parents had a nonprofit that really focused on just community good. And so I was born in California and spent the first nine years fully there. But then I ended up going back and forth to Brazil for a month or two out of the year when I was nine. And then when I was 16 I actually moved permanently there for the last two years of high school. So, for me, my childhood was very much made up of two very different places, very different cultures.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. High school in Brazil, what was that like?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Oh, goodness. It was very interesting. When I first moved down there, I homeschooled for the first year because it&#8217;s very like a transitional year. Senior year I went to a high school that my mom taught at. For me, it was really, really interesting because my parents again were in the nonprofit space. And so my whole life there was working with kids in the slums. Some of my best friends were ex-street kids. That was what I was used to. But then when my mom started working at the high school because she&#8217;s a teacher, my sister and I went there for free. I think my graduating class was 17 people and those kids were essentially the richest kids of the area because I went to a &#8220;international&#8221; or American school. And so for me it also felt like I was straddling two very different worlds when I went to school, then when I went to the afterschool program that I would help run with my parents in the evening. So it was definitely a very, very interesting, interesting experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you graduated high school, did you move back to the States or did you stay in Brazil for a while?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
I pretty much went straight back to the States. I ended up going to DC for school, so I&#8230;.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
&#8230; dates. I ended up going to DC for school, so I was at American university for undergrad where I studied film and anthropology. Essentially I wanted to find a way to tell a story, but then I also wanted to tell it correctly and know how to do the research in order to portray it in the most unbiased way possible. And so I did that double major. So I was in DC for that and then stayed about a year after I graduated, and that&#8217;s when I eventually moved to Seattle.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now I&#8217;m curious about the storytelling. Being someone that was going between two different countries growing up, were you kind of exposed to a lot of art and design that made you want to go into doing film?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
So it actually wasn&#8217;t really the art, it was just the stories of the people who I met. I just fell in love with hearing different people&#8217;s stories and hearing the way that they saw the world. And so I think straddling those two very different socioeconomic classes made it so that I realized that the other one just had no idea how the other one lived. And I think especially in Brazil, that stratification is so great and also exists not only socioeconomically, but also racially. And so for me, I just wanted to kind of tell a story to demystify and de-other a whole group of the population.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
And so it was actually a project I did it my senior year in high school where in art class we had to do a video project, where we&#8217;d film it, we&#8217;d edit, it and do all this other stuff. And so it was a group thing, but I asked the teacher if I could just do a solo project. And I ended up going and featuring one of &#8230; Essentially he was kind of like a sibling at that point. I&#8217;d met him the first year I&#8217;d gone to Brazil when I was nine, he was 10 or 11, and we&#8217;ve basically been friends since then. And he had been a street kid or lived on the streets from the time he was six to nine, by himself with other kids his age. And then he ended up at this home for ex-street kids.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
And so for me I was like, &#8220;You know what, I just really want to tell this story. I just really want to tell where he came from, the amazing trajectory and this amazing change that he&#8217;s actually brought to his life.&#8221; He started in the slums and living on the streets when he was so young, but now he had been a part of a college prep program. There was so much, and it was just such an amazing story.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
So I took my really, really crappy little point-and-shoot camera and I went and I just interviewed him. We went to the favela where he grew up, and he brought us to his mom&#8217;s house, and we met a siblings, he showed us where he had actually lived essentially in front of a shop, where he slept at night for the three years he was on streets.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
He told stories over &#8230; He is kind of a hardcore-looking kid. He has this Nike scar, it looks like a Nike symbol on the side of his cheek. It&#8217;s huge. So he looked pretty hardcore. And when you actually talk to him you realize that no, he only got that from falling out of a tree when he was playing. And the only thing he actually stole ever was a Hershey&#8217;s bar, but he felt so guilty that he actually left money for them later on. So someone looking at him might think and really stereotype him in a certain space. But then the real story was just totally and completely different.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s one thing I really, really loved. And I actually showed it at a little coffee house presentation thing with parents and stuff when I was in high school. And for me I was terrified because I was really showing this group of the richest people in the city, I was essentially throwing the socioeconomic differences and the racial differences in their face. But then it showed, I was in a cold sweat. But then afterwards people started coming up to me and they were like, &#8220;How can we help? How can we do things for him?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
And so it actually ended up helping him raise money for an English language trip over the summer in the US. And so it definitely made a huge impact even though it was really bad video, the audio was terrible. But the story really came forward and I just saw the impact that this could have.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. That&#8217;s quite a story. Do you still keep in contact with that kid?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
I do. I do, yes. He&#8217;s definitely one of those folks who just became very much like siblings. And so now he&#8217;s living in Brazil again, him and a few others. It&#8217;s been really great to see how they kind of grew up and then are helping people who are in a similar situation. And so another person who I knew around the same time, all that he does is really go to the streets and really try to build relationships with other kids who live on the streets, or in the favelas, to essentially try and be a catalyst for some change in their lives.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. So let&#8217;s go back to the time when you&#8217;re leaving American university and you&#8217;re about to head out to Washington. Was that a big change in terms of time? Or did you have a few design gigs between there, before you made the move?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
So in DC, I didn&#8217;t get into design until a lot later on. I think it was the last two or three quarters of school. I essentially realized that if I was going to be some starving documentary filmmaker, I&#8217;d have to learn how to make my own poster. And so I took a design class, ended up really liking it, and then went from there. So at first I was able to mix it up with some of the storytelling internships I had. I had actually ended up doing a small animation and putting it up for, it was some type of awards thing at my school and actually won Best in New Media. And the prize of that was an internship at a design company.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
So that was my first kind of design gig was me in a small basement making a lot of different illustrations for one of the Smithsonian&#8217;s. And so I don&#8217;t even think they actually ended up using it, I think they went a totally different direction after I left. But that was, I think for me a great experience. Just learning from the designers there, but then also learning a new program. I basically tried to do as many kind of small contracting stuff or freelance gigs. It was very nice having parents who were in the nonprofit sector because they always needed marketing work. So a lot of the early things I had was just making some marketing materials or teaching materials for them. So that definitely gave me a lot of practice.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
And then for me it was a lot of, because I really didn&#8217;t know what a good designer was, especially what a good junior designer was, I really was just looking at different people&#8217;s portfolios online. I was going on Design Inspiration and also Pinterest, trying to find designs I really liked. And so I just gave myself projects that I could just try and emulate the style or something of, just to try and build that portfolio out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a really good idea. I tell people that a lot in terms of how do they find some kind of project or thing to work on that lets them do a lot of different skills. I&#8217;ll tell people, &#8220;You kind of have to make it yourself. A lot of those opportunities don&#8217;t just come to you pre-made. So if there&#8217;s something that you&#8217;re really passionate about, turn that into a project and work on it. And let that be the thing that you help kind of build your skills up for.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Yeah, totally. For my parents, they would want, I don&#8217;t know, a presentation slide. And I was like, &#8220;You know what, it might be better as an animated video.&#8221; So I would just work through animation skills and learn animation while making them a video. Or I know there was a big wave of popularity for minimalist movie posters and stuff. And so I was like, &#8220;You know what, what are my favorite movie posters? Or what are my favorite movies? Let me just make a few posters for these different TV shows. How would I take this concept and then do it in my style? Or really, anything else.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
So it definitely helped to build that out. And people actually loved seeing all these little passion projects when I first got started. So at first I was worried that it wasn&#8217;t showing professional work, but people really, really tended to enjoy just seeing that I had that excitement for what I was doing and the passion to actually just go off and do it on my own.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. Those are skills that employers, and I would say even people that just want to work with you on a collaborative basis, they want to see that passion. Because honestly the skills are, I hate to say transferable, but they kind of are. There&#8217;s a lot of people that can work in Photoshop or Sketch or what have you and make something that looks really nice, but is this something they&#8217;re passionate about? Or are they kind of just an adequate set of hands that are able to put something together?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
No, totally. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So we&#8217;ve had a couple of people on the show who have moved to Seattle, and they&#8217;ve often talked about the &#8220;Seattle Freeze&#8221;. Which for those that are listening it&#8217;s kind of this, I don&#8217;t know, I guess you could call it a-</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Constant social distancing?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, constant social distancing. We&#8217;ll say that. When you first moved to Washington, did you experience any of that?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Oh, totally, totally. I&#8217;m from California where you just call someone up when you&#8217;re on the way to their house. Or like, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s go grab something to eat right now.&#8221; And then in Brazil it&#8217;s a very kind of warm culture, you&#8217;re always hugging people, doing kisses on the cheek, all that stuff. And then in DC there&#8217;s still that environment if you&#8217;re heading to the Southeast where there are mostly black people. And so people are always talking to each other in the grocery stores and everything else. And then you come here and it&#8217;s like crickets.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
It was definitely hard in the beginning just trying to break into a field that I had no idea how to break into while also trying to deal with, what is networking? How is everything not awkward? Also, how do I actually build both connections and friendships in a place that is known for being very cold? So I would say that Seattle has been practicing for the social distancing for awhile, I swear. In some ways we&#8217;re a little ahead of the curve on that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you did a recent interview with another podcast called Designer&#038;Designer, and you were talking about your experiences working as a black designer, working on designing things, but often being the only one. I can only imagine, one, you&#8217;re coming to this new city where people may not be super hospitable, and then you&#8217;re also working in a place where you&#8217;re the only black person there or the only minority there. What did that feel like in those first few, I guess months or so when you were in Seattle? Did you feel like you had a community that you could turn to?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Honestly, no. For my husband and I, we moved to Seattle without really knowing anyone. And so it was a very, very isolating experience. And also to add insult to injury, I was freelancing when I first came here and still trying to build that portfolio and find a job. Because we were able to move with his job, but I was still looking one.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
And so it was absolutely isolating. I would go to networking events and there would be no one who looked like me there. I would go to like open houses at different design firms or anything else, and I would be the only me in the space. And I would like to say that that changed a lot. But throughout the first job I got as a marketing assistant or a production designer to the time that I spent at Amazon, I had not worked with another black designer in that entire time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. And this was the impetus behind you starting Black Designers of Seattle?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Yes, in a lot of ways. So as a designer I kind of had always heard of the other elusive black designer somewhere in the company. There was always another one, you just didn&#8217;t know them. &#8220;I know that they&#8217;re out there somewhere.&#8221; But then I ended up getting promoted to art director, and then I started looking around, and I was like, &#8220;Wait a second. Where are the other black art directors?&#8221; And no one really knew where they were. And so I did some digging and I was like, all right. I was able to find one other black designer in the entire company.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
And so I think I started to realize at that point that the thing that I was experiencing wasn&#8217;t just my story, but it was evidence of a larger trend. And so from there, before starting the group, I actually had only known two black designers. One of them was my little brother, and so he barely counts. And so I essentially just started to reach out to other black designers that I knew or could find technically, within the company. I was like, &#8220;All right, I think there&#8217;s a few of us because I&#8217;ve heard about you, but I&#8217;m actually going to make the effort and reach out now.&#8221; And then I just started doing that on the larger, LinkedIn scale, going through many pages of designers in Seattle being the filter and trying to find other folks in other companies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
See, I&#8217;m so glad you mentioned LinkedIn. Because people will often ask me how I find people for Revision Path, and they&#8217;re always surprised when I tell them I look on LinkedIn first.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Oh yeah, totally.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I go look at someone&#8217;s connections and look at their connections, and try to find who I think might be a good fit or who might be a good guest and reach out to them. People sleep on LinkedIn &#8230; I&#8217;ve long since the deactivated Facebook, LinkedIn is kind of where I am now these days in terms of social stuff. But how is the group going so far?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
It has been insane. It&#8217;s grown so much. Like I mentioned, at first it was just me. I had a Google Sheet of all the different bios of people I was finding who are black designers in the city. So I just called it my &#8220;black designers black book&#8221;. And so I&#8217;ve essentially just been reaching out to people. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;You know what? We just need to have a happy hour.&#8221; So a year and a quarter ago or so, I just reached out to 35 people that I was able to-</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
&#8230; they just reached out to 35 people that I was able to find. I was lik, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m Bekah, we&#8217;re going to meet up. Let&#8217;s all meet up at this date, this time, this place.&#8221; And I was expecting for it to only be me and one other black designer that I had gotten to know over the course of me finding people. But then 25-ish people showed up and all of us were shocked. All of us were like, &#8220;Wait, there is this many black designers in Seattle? Period. What?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
And so, that was amazing. And then, since then we&#8217;re actually, so we have a LinkedIn group and I think we&#8217;re around 75 strong at this point.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Yeah, thank you. It&#8217;s definitely been a very crazy, exciting thing to actually start to find and build that community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you heard of the Bay Area Black Designers group?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
I have. I have. I&#8217;ve actually been really bad and not reached out too much to them, but it&#8217;s definitely on my to do list, maybe with all this extra time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So I know the woman who started it, Kat Vellos, she&#8217;s been here on the show before, and then also Kendall House, who is, I think he now heads up the group, but he&#8217;s also been on the show as well. And just recently, I&#8217;d say maybe a few weeks ago, we had Fonz Morris, who&#8217;s a growth design lead at Coursera, who also spoke really super passionately about the group and how helpful it was and everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I&#8217;ve also spoken to some Seattle designers who honestly spoke super highly of you.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Oh, wait. What?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Just a few weeks ago we had Tim Allen on the show who&#8217;s VP of design at Airbnb, and then Timothy Bard Levins, who&#8217;s at Microsoft was like, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ve got to be interviewing and talking to Bekah. Oh, my God.&#8221; So the work that you&#8217;re doing is definitely being seen by people and being congratulated out there in the community. So that&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Oh, that&#8217;s funny. Well, okay, funny story abut Tim. He&#8217;s actually now at Facebook, and between that, between Microsoft and Facebook, he was at Zillow. So he actually was the one who pulled me over to Zillow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh really?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look at that. Small world.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a very small world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, how long has the group been going on now?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Just about a year and three months, honestly. So it&#8217;s been the first year we were really focusing on just getting each other together and having sporadic happy hours. We had one big event the first year, and then this year we&#8217;re focusing on how we can actually start to bring some order to the madness and have consistent events. But yeah, we&#8217;re definitely still in infancy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. I know there&#8217;s a group in Seattle, you may have heard of it, called HERE Seattle. Have you heard of them?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t think I have. I do not think I have.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So HERE Seattle is a, I guess it&#8217;s more geared towards tech, I&#8217;m not 100% sure, but I know that four guys run it. Seth Stell, Todd, Todd Bennings and two other people who I can&#8217;t recall, but I know that they do something not necessarily similar to what you&#8217;re doing with Black Designers of Seattle because you&#8217;re focusing more on design. I think for them they focus more on DNI and tech in general. And so, design sometimes ends up being a subset of that, but that might be a group worth reaching out to connect with, HERE Seattle.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Totally. Yeah, it&#8217;s been a really amazing, I feel this year I&#8217;ve really started to connect with other groups like that. There&#8217;s a few other ones who are doing similar things and so, as we are upping our cadence on events, it&#8217;s been fun to see who we can partner with, who have similar initiatives, and then also how we can then go back and reach out to the community.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a few arts-based organizations that work with K through 12 schools in the area, and so it&#8217;s, how can we actually come together as a community, as a group, and then start to help out these other organizations as they do stuff?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I really want to make it back up there to Seattle one of these days.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
You should.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, hey, once this global pandemic thing blows over.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Don&#8217;t come now. I will not come and see you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I do want to try to make it back up there. I was talking to some people at AIGA Seattle, right before all of this COVID-19 stuff broke out about possibly coming up there and doing a live show. But I feel like now everything is canceled until further notice.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In the future I definitely do want to make it back up there. I&#8217;ve been to Seattle only once. I was in college, and this is actually a funny story. So I was in college studying math and my junior year was when 91-1 happened, and when that happened I had zero prospects lined up for jobs because the scholarship program that I was in, I was interning at NASA.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so, I was thinking as soon as I graduate I&#8217;m going to go work for a NASA facility and that&#8217;s what life is going to be. But then 9-11 happened, they pulled the funding from the program and now all of a sudden it&#8217;s my junior year of college. I have no job prospects lined up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I started worming my way into these different interview books, which different departments would have books that you could sign up for, put your resume in and you would interview with certain companies, but it has to apply to whatever your major was. And for math they didn&#8217;t have that. They were just lik, &#8220;Oh, you should go to graduate school.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t really want to go to grad school right now. I&#8217;ve been going to school for 15 years in a row. I don&#8217;t really want to continue to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh well, I don&#8217;t know what to tell you.&#8221; So I snuck my way into the computer science department, got in good with people there and managed to get into an interview book there. And I did an interview at Microsoft, and I remember that being, they talk about these techie interviews always being something that throw you for a loop? Like Google, I think at one point in time there was a rumor about there being this infamous one question, one interview question that they asked you.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Oh gosh.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And when I interviewed with Microsoft, they did that. So I remember, Oh God, I don&#8217;t know if she&#8217;s still there. I remember her name was Chesca. That&#8217;s all I remember is that her name was Chesca. And we did the interview and she asked me only one question which was, &#8220;How would you design an alarm clock for a blind person?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Oh my goodness. Tim asked me the same question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are you serious? Wow, okay. Wow, that&#8217;s a big coincidence. But yeah, she asked me that question and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Huh.&#8221;, and she slides over a piece of paper and a pen. Just talk through it. Talk through how you would do it, and keep it mind, this is, what year was this? This was 2001, maybe 2002 I think. It was 202 because it was right before I graduated.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So this was 2002 and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh my God.&#8221; This is way before Siri and Alexa, and what have you. So I&#8217;m trying to think about voice this and you could do the commands, and all this stuff. And I write it out, sketch it out and she&#8217;s recording all this and so she&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, okay, thank you so much for coming in. We&#8217;ll be back to you.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wait, is that it? That was the only question?&#8221;, but I did get an interview at Microsoft based off that question. So they flew me up to Seattle.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I remember the way that they did it was this almost like a game show. You did the first interview and if you passed the first interview, you went to the second one, and then the second to the third, third to the fourth, or whatever. And it was all day.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Yeah, totally.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Maybe nine a.m. to seven p.m., or something. And I was losing steam somewhere in the sixth interview. I remember they were asking me about Notepad and how would you change Notepad if you were someone that wrote in a language that went right to left instead of left to right. And I don&#8217;t know what my answer was, but it clearly was not the right answer because I didn&#8217;t make it to the next interview.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Oh no. Oh no. Yes. Oh my goodness. Yeah. Tech interviews are definitely, they&#8217;re very legendary as far as being an incredibly long day. So I&#8217;ve done interviews at, I went through the process at Facebook, I was at Amazon, Zillow, and it was all pretty much the same in a lot of ways. But with Amazon I was actually, after I contracted, I was thinking that my team who I was contracting with wasn&#8217;t going to hire full time.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
So I actually started talking to another team at Amazon, and so they decided to put me through the loop, and then my team found out, I was like, &#8220;Hey, just FYI. They&#8217;ll reach out to you to see about my performance and stuff.&#8221; And so, they actually hurried up their hiring process, then joined my loop. So I was actually interviewing with two different teams on the same day in the same room. And so, that just made my interview process even longer. I think I had seven back-to-back interviews or something crazy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
It was so much information too, the portfolio review at the beginning. It was, in the same way, a very, very long day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. I didn&#8217;t know that that interview question is something that was still being thrown around in that way. That&#8217;s wild.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. Tim actually, when I went over to Zillow, he handled the white boarding and product thinking session, or part of the interview. And he did ask me, he was like, &#8220;You need to,&#8221; I think he added complexity. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;All right, you need to design an alarm clock for a blind person that only has one button.&#8221; And so, I couldn&#8217;t do boys, I couldn&#8217;t do, oh there&#8217;s a tactile interface. It was supposed to be an analog alarm clock.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
So part of the beginning of that conversation was like, &#8220;Wait, what? It&#8217;s just an old one that you your grandparents would have with red numbers.&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; And then, I had to essentially just whiteboard that out. But I find it so hilarious that you also got that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, and I&#8217;m trying to remember how I answered the question. I think I was saying something about eye tracking because the person is&#8230; No wait, no wait, not eye tracking, because the person is blind. I said something about doing a lot of voice prompts. I remember that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Something about voice prompts and being able to talk through how this would go. So you&#8217;d have to have some conversation flow chart of how to set the clock and all this stuff, and then maybe it would have some type of a haptic feedback because you would be able to touch it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So maybe not necessarily braille but a series of vibrations or something like that to let you know that commands are being done properly, or things like that. And this was so long ago up here. I mean they liked it, but it wasn&#8217;t enough for me to actually get a job there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But that was years and years ago, 2002. I also interviewed for Real Player that year.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And no one uses Real Player anymore. So that let&#8217;s you know how far back that was.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Oh, I love that they&#8217;re using it 18 years later though. Or at least Tim is using 13 years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
So much later.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So now you&#8217;re also in grad school, is that right? At the University of Washington?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Yes I am.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s that going?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
It is going well. I actually took this quarter off just to, there was a lot of changes at work so I decided to really try and focus in on that. And so, it&#8217;s been going really well. I essentially went back to grad school because I saw the lack of black designers and I was like, &#8220;All right, can I not only build a community but also do some research to actually find out why that&#8217;s the case.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
And so, I also was thinking that people are also a lot more willing to open up to someone as a grad student, if I&#8217;m a grad student versus, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m an art director at Amazon asking you these questions.&#8221; And so, I was also very aware of my own positioning, actually going to folks in different companies and asking what their experience was.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Being a student definitely helped me maintain a certain level of, I know. They just weren&#8217;t scared of me, and so, but also it gave me that space to do that research, and then to start exploring things, and then also have it not directly associated with my day-to-day job.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s gone great. For one of the first projects that I did was a quick and dirty research over why there is no black designers, where they are. And then, I was actually like, &#8220;Okay, if there&#8217;s no black designers, whether it&#8217;s because of culture, socioeconomics, just our racial history here in the US, what can we actually do to start to change that and change that story?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
And so, part of that solution was building a community, because I feel like there&#8217;s a lot of people who were super excited about giving back to the community as far as like, &#8220;Oh, I went to go volunteer for an arts-based organization.&#8221; or, &#8220;Oh, I want to go be a mentor for folks.&#8221;, but people don&#8217;t know where to go for it.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
And so, my thinking was, if I build a community then I&#8217;ll bring a lot of passions into a certain space and from there, people can then organize and start to have these larger conversations. And so, really the first event that I ended up doing over at Amazon last August was a direct result of some of the research and solutioning that I did as part of one of those classes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. That&#8217;s interesting that the work that you&#8217;re doing with Black Designers of Seattle in a way came out of the research that you&#8217;re doing at grad school.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Yeah, no, it definitely, definitely did. I mean, that was the whole reason I wanted to go back. I think a lot of times I just wanted the accountability of actually doing the research and the actually having time set aside to really focus on this design, and diversity and inclusion, and so really going to school, having classes. I would essentially pick to really fit a need that I saw in my own journey as I explore diversity in design, and all that stuff.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
And so, as I went I was like, &#8220;All right, this will really be good for this, that will be good for that.&#8221; And so, I really tried to pair up what I needed in the real world with the classes I was taking so those projects and those outputs from those classes would be immediately applicable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. Can you talk a little bit about, I guess some of your research? I&#8217;m curious to know what you do have found from researching the lack of black designers in the industry.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Totally. So a big part of what I was doing was just trying to capture and just hear the stories of current black designers, and then how they got to design-</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Stories of current black designers and then how they got to design and all that stuff, and so a lot of designers I found didn&#8217;t go to school for design. And that pretty much corresponded with a lot of my research where a huge percentage of African Americans, blacks in the US, when they go to college, right now in our generation, they&#8217;re first generation. And so their parents didn&#8217;t go to college, and so if you have 40% of those folks were in college, they&#8217;re probably not going to go for an arts degree. If their parents, their community are really sacrificing to get them to college, they&#8217;re not like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, I&#8217;m going to go for an arts degree.&#8221; It was like I&#8217;m going for finance or business or something along those lines because there&#8217;s the larger kind of view of design is that a business degree will get you where you want to go economically.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Whereas, like an arts degree historically, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re doing an arts degree, so you&#8217;re going to wait tables or something.&#8221; When I even went to film school, I got some side eyes from some people be like, oh, really? Are you sure you want to go to film school? Really? You&#8217;re not going to make any money. But it&#8217;s the perception of design just even within our community can be so different. Whereas now, because I did get an arts degree and then I am also in the position I am now, I&#8217;ll go home, and then I&#8217;ve aunts, uncles who are like, &#8220;Oh, my gosh, you should really talk to your little cousin who draws abstractly because like they could be a designer, too.&#8221; So their perception of success has definitely changed just by seeing someone go through it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I always will say on here you can&#8217;t be what you don&#8217;t see. So being able to kind of see someone else that looks like you in a position like that really makes such a big difference in knowing whether or not this is something that you can actually do for yourself. So yeah, I feel where you&#8217;re coming from. Tell me, what lessons did you learn this past year? How do you feel you&#8217;ve grown and improved?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
I feel like even though I started a community of black designers, I feel like I didn&#8217;t really realize the benefits of it. And right now just seeing how there&#8217;s subgroups that have come off of the Black Designers of Seattle community, I think I&#8217;ve seen and really just loved and been built up by a huge group of people. Even in this social distancing time, I was just texting a group of folks who I&#8217;ve met through the Black Designers of Seattle network because on Monday we&#8217;re all going to get together and drink wine over FaceTime. And so, it&#8217;s just I think the importance of community is one thing I&#8217;ve really realized, and also it doesn&#8217;t take much to have an impact. You just got to do something. You just have to give life whatever, just like something to work with.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
When I first started the community, I was like I can&#8217;t organize a bunch of stuff but I can tell people to show up at a restaurant or at a bar where I&#8217;ll make a reservation. And so that was, honestly, the bare minimum that anyone could really do, and that small thing had a huge impact. And so I think just doing something has really been big. Even when I was first trying to get into design, I was so paralyzed by the amount that had to be done. But just by doing little things like finding a design I really liked then emulating it, I was able to take small steps into the place that I wanted to be.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
I guess other than that I was at Amazon for four years, and I&#8217;ve been at Zillow for around, I think, six or seven months now. And I have definitely just enjoyed being in a different space, learning fully different things, kind of being out of my element. I think I&#8217;ve kind of forgotten, because I was on the same team for about four years, what that was like. But I definitely see huge benefits because of it. So I think that was more a reminder.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you spend time on when you&#8217;re not working?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Yeah, my husband and I, we actually recently bought a Sprinter van that we&#8217;re tricking out. It&#8217;s kind of like pit my ride for vans, to make it more adventure vanny. So I&#8217;m like, not only the only one, sometimes of my being black at work, not so much anymore at Zillow, but I&#8217;m also the only black chick in the forest usually. So I do a lot of rock climbing, mountain biking, camping and all that stuff. And so right now, we&#8217;ve been using the time that we would normally be commuting just trying to build out our van. So a bed&#8217;s going in there, a kitchen&#8217;s going in there, well, bathroom&#8217;s going in there. And so we&#8217;ve just been doing a lot of woodworking and all that stuff to get that together.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. That sounds like a really cool project to work on.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
It&#8217;s really fun because being a digital designer, I can build out like a CAD model of what I want the van to be, what I want a small house project to be. But then actually getting wood, getting metal, whatever else and actually just physically building it is a whole other level of fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And also with everything that&#8217;s happening now, great timing.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
I know, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Great timing because&#8230; I mean it&#8217;s one thing to be socially distanced in your own home, but if you have a van now that you can at least kind of go around to other places, get some fresh air and stuff, that&#8217;s a benefit.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Yeah, I know. It definitely is. It&#8217;s a little kind of rugged RV is what it essentially will be. And so there&#8217;s a lot of places where it&#8217;s like, well, we have a full kitchen. We don&#8217;t need to go say hi to anyone. I can get my coffee here, my lunch here, everything else. So we&#8217;ve definitely been scoping out different state parks, national parks in the area and trying to find what&#8217;s open. Because it&#8217;s like, oh, yeah we could go to, I don&#8217;t know, Yosemite and social distance or something and just be in our own space. We wouldn&#8217;t drive that far because that&#8217;s 18 hours. But being able to have or feel like that freedom is possible, it&#8217;s been nice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. So one of the kind of ongoing themes that we have here on Revision Path for this year is equitable futures. I got this idea, actually, last year. I went to a conference at Harvard called Black and Design, and one of the sort of things that they were talking about a lot was black people in the future. Where do we see ourselves, et cetera? We&#8217;re coming up on 2020 that&#8217;s a very kind of big futuristic year as people think about that with pop culture, et cetera. So how are you helping to build a more equitable future through the work that you&#8217;re doing?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
I think a big thing facing Black Designers of Seattle, or just in general, is awareness. And so a lot of, in building community, is just increasing that awareness both of each other, but then also have different jobs. It&#8217;s been really great to be able to connect someone who is just trying to get into design, or they&#8217;re super young just out of college trying to find a mentor, and connect them with someone who is very established in that field. And to build that relationship there, to start kind of helping each other get to the places that we want to be. So I think just providing opportunity is a big part of what I&#8217;ve been focusing on.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
But then also a lot of my role with the group has not only been the community organizing, but also the event organizing. And that&#8217;s been mostly on kind of the community plus allies or community plus conspirators is what I like to call it, where we not only have the Black Designers of Seattle community, but we also have other folks from the diversity inclusion space and then also the wider community in some ways. And so I think just having discussions around being the only black designer and all that stuff in that space is super, super important. So I think just having that discussion on a larger level and just building awareness of this is a problem. If you only have one black designer, that is an issue. You should be focusing on having a diverse workplace, not just racially but age-wise, socioeconomically, everything. And so I think just creating spaces for those conversations to happen is one of the other ways I&#8217;m trying to help contribute to more equitable future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Well, it&#8217;s 2025. Where do you see yourself in the next five years?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Oh, that&#8217;s so hard. There&#8217;s a lot. I&#8217;m not sure. I feel like so much of my life has&#8230; If you asked me five years ago where I would see myself now, it&#8217;s so completely different. It&#8217;s so very different, and I&#8217;ve just been really enjoying that journey. I really hope that five years in the future our community is not just larger, but it also has greater impact. I hope that I&#8217;m in a place where I&#8217;m able to see the community be a space where people are going to find mentors or mentees, and finding different ways to get involved with schools and stuff, or just having awesome conversation.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
I think for me, personally, I don&#8217;t know. I definitely love being a designer. I don&#8217;t think I want to be a manager, so that&#8217;s definitely not in there. But just having a larger scope on projects and just really being able to have a position where I&#8217;m able to strategically really kind of look at the future of a project would be super exciting. And hopefully, by then my van is done and I&#8217;m just traveling around in some ways working from the van from a lot of awesome locations.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>
Totally. So my website is rebeccamarkham.com, and I&#8217;m on LinkedIn, Instagram@Bec&#8217;s. Yeah. And also there&#8217;s a Black Designers of Seattle group, both on Facebook and LinkedIn. It&#8217;s just Black Designers of Seattle, so it should be super searchable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Well, Becca Markham, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. When I first heard about you, it was, actually, I mentioned this during the designer and designer interview, I first heard about you when I heard about the group, and I was like, I got to have her on the show because I feel like there&#8217;s more of a story there. And so getting to learn more about how you grew up and the work that you&#8217;re doing right now. And even with the work that you&#8217;re doing through the group that you started at Black Designers of Seattle, there&#8217;s two things that really stick out to me. One is that building authentic community is something that is super important for you, but I think also just super important for all of us. But also really kind of owning your identity is what has made you such a unique person and has made you someone that people are kind of flocking to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I really applaud the work that you&#8217;re doing behind BDS. If there&#8217;s anything that I can do or anything that Revision Path can do, definitely let us know. This is more of the kind of community stuff that we really need to see. I mean, even in the midst of coronavirus, take us from online to offline, but being able to foster that community is something that&#8217;s really important, and I&#8217;m glad that you&#8217;re really kind of able to shepherd the cause. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Bekah Marcum:</b><br>

<p>Desiree Gibbs is laser-focused on who she wants to be and how she expresses herself. Those skills come in handy not just in her work as a UI designer, but through the projects she oversees and clients she serves as the proprietor of <a href="https://www.nublac.studio/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">N√º Bl√§c Studio</a>. </p>
<p>We spoke on St. Patrick&#8217;s Day, so our conversation actually started off with both of us discussing how to navigate this new social distancing reality due to the COVID-19 public health crisis. Desiree also talked about growing up between Japan and the United States, attending the University of Texas at Arlington for design, and even how former guests <a href="/gus-granger/" data-wpel-link="internal">Gus Granger</a> and <a href="/jacinda-walker/" data-wpel-link="internal">Jacinda Walker</a> helped show her the importance of seeing more Black designers in this industry. Desiree says she wants to ultimately become the most solidified version of herself, and with her skills and drive, she&#8217;s well on her way to making that happen!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m Desiree Gibbs. I am a UI designer located in Dallas, Texas.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is the Dallas design seem like, I&#8217;m curious?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
In some ways, it&#8217;s very large. In some ways it&#8217;s very small. I would say that it&#8217;s innovative when you meet the right people, very inspirational, again, when you meet the right people, but otherwise, they do a lot of different work, sometimes in behind the scenes, sometimes at the forefront. It&#8217;s pretty much a huge mixture depending on your immediate circle.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you find that it&#8217;s more like tech-oriented or more like artsy?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
I would say a little more artsy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
But now that tech is pretty much booming there are a lot of large companies that are trying to add their headquarters to Dallas. It&#8217;s starting to turn a little more tech now that those companies are relocating and adding new offices out here. I haven&#8217;t seen that change much yet, but that&#8217;s definitely something on the agenda that&#8217;s in the near future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, and now currently you&#8217;re working at Citi, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me what it&#8217;s like, what&#8217;s your regular day to day like there? I&#8217;ll mention that we are recording this, it&#8217;s March 17th and we&#8217;re recording this. So we are in the midst of a global pandemic, which is causing a lot of companies to have to now shift to working from home for a lot of their workforce. But as much as you can talk about, tell me like what it&#8217;s like working at Citi?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
So before this all happened, Citi was really interesting to me because a bunch of us were hired at the same time. So there was a lot of newbs hanging out together, which is awesome because then you&#8217;re all on the same page, you don&#8217;t know anything.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
So in the beginning, it was a really cool mashup of getting on board with how their culture is, as well as like kind of forming our own little groups and getting to know each other since everyone&#8217;s new. From there, once we&#8217;ve split up into our teams or our lines of business, they like to call them domains, we really just learn our team really well.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Luckily, I&#8217;m on a team full of nerds and being a nerd, it&#8217;s awesome. All pretty artsy nerds. Pretty like Star Wars, sci-fi, some sort of tech nerds. So we all really get along really well. I never would have thought I&#8217;d find a team like that in a place as corporate as Citi, but alas, it does exist.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
So for me that was a really happy thing that kind of blew my eyes open about Citi, especially since I used to work at The Beck Group. The Beck Group was a really corporate based company. They built half a Dallas, so it&#8217;s a very old company as well. So I kind of was expecting Citi to be just as corporate-like, very straight forward. But they are quite the opposite in all the good ways.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. What kind of projects are you working on?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
So currently I work with some of our partner work. I think like companies that everybody knows about, like American Airlines and we have a card with them, and then newer partners as well. So that I&#8217;m pretty much excited for.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m allowed to mention them, so I&#8217;m not going to mention them, but there&#8217;s some small hosting type companies that I&#8217;m really excited to work on, as well as internally we have some products that we&#8217;re opening up, some new things, some old things.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
A lot of what I&#8217;m doing right now is like updating new products to match a new look really. Citi&#8217;s been around for quite a while and they&#8217;re looking to revamp their look. So it&#8217;s an exciting moment to get to be on a team that kind of just pulls open the curtain for a new design for an entire company. So that&#8217;s pretty much where we&#8217;re at right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Now, as I did mention we&#8217;re recording this during this time where a lot of companies are now basically mandating that their employees now work from home because of COVID-19/the coronavirus. It&#8217;s caused, I mean what I can really only describe as massive social, political, commercial and financial upheaval in general. How are you feeling?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
It&#8217;s kind of weird for me and I would say even though I&#8217;m an ambivert, when I&#8217;m working, I like to work physically where I need to work because of the environment. The environment is really important for me to make sure my mindset changes and the people I&#8217;m working around, like my team is really cool. And so, you kind of miss those like small conversations that happen, that kind of add a touch to whatever you&#8217;re working on, or even just your mood in that specific moment.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
And so, now that we&#8217;re digital, we completely miss that, that just so happen to walk by moment or that random foosball game that helps you distress. And so, now it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m sitting in my room on my couch because I don&#8217;t have a desk. Thankfully I have wifi and a TV table I can pull out and kind of get settled into a workspace, but it&#8217;s a little odd.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
It&#8217;s definitely different in that &#8230; Like I said, I mentioned to a couple of people outside of work too that it&#8217;s different even when I&#8217;m off work, like I&#8217;m used to a routine and routine is very important for me. I&#8217;m a very methodical person when it comes to things like that.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
And so, when I get in a routine for work, that&#8217;s how I know what to expect every day. And so, now it&#8217;s kind of an adjustment to create a new routine to get my head into the work mode as well as my surroundings as work mode as possible to make sure that I&#8217;m productive and still be able to reach out to my peers and my coworkers to get feedback and check-ins. So it&#8217;s a little weird.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are you finding that the team is also kind of going through I guess, that same change where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Now we&#8217;re working in an office together.&#8221; I mean you mentioned this is a group of people that you really like and now you&#8217;re all at home, working. How is the team kind of been doing?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t think any of them like it really, and I&#8217;ll say this because, so Citi actually implemented a alternate work routine to where one team &#8230; they split the company in half much and split certain teams in half and Team A would come on one week, Team B would be working from home, and it would switch every week.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
So we had only gotten about two weeks into that before everybody was just like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s just stay home.&#8221; I mean, even during that week people were like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to handle this. This is weird. The building feels like a ghost town.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Some of the people on my team they&#8217;re socializers so they need that people on people interaction and it&#8217;s hard to work at home in an environment you&#8217;re not used to working in and being either distracted by other people who sound like they&#8217;re having fun outside.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Because here sometimes some kids, some families, their kids are on spring break and those spring breaks are actually being extended because of to prevent the spread of the virus. So it&#8217;s actually going to be two weeks of kids&#8217; spring breaking. So it&#8217;s very odd. I don&#8217;t think any of us really like it all that much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, they&#8217;ve closed the schools here and I&#8217;ve heard, I don&#8217;t know, it hasn&#8217;t been super noisy. My apartment overlooks the pool in my complex so it&#8217;s usually only noisy in the summer because like kids are at the pool. Right now, the pool is not open so it hasn&#8217;t been super bad. The play area in my complex is a little bit further away from where my window is, but it&#8217;s a big shift. It&#8217;s a big change.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean one like you said for the fact that there&#8217;s kids around because school is being extended for spring break, in some places schools are closed. But then also just the adjustment of now taking what is your living space, which was not a workspace and now having to not only sort of convert it into a workspace, but then you have to still be expected to keep the same work output as if you were in the office.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a lot. I will say too that in the design world, it&#8217;s normal to work on more than one screen. So while we&#8217;re there, we&#8217;re working on three screens and it&#8217;s easy to be a little more productive because you can easily switch between screens really well.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Now that I&#8217;m on a laptop, it&#8217;s a little bit harder to navigate, and since I&#8217;m doing design, it&#8217;s sketch. So sketch, you&#8217;re working on multiple screens at multiple times. You have all these layers and artboards. It&#8217;s very easy to switch between that on multiple screens or even just two screens. So I will say that that&#8217;s another thing that I know a lot of my coworkers are having &#8230; it takes a minute for them to adjust to that as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Are you finding that your employer is at least sympathetic to the situation? Do they know that this is something everyone&#8217;s going through and so we&#8217;re all kind of in this adjustment period?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Definitely. One thing I really appreciate is that we&#8217;ve actually been having weekly call-ins, like all-hands call in to where our lead update us on what&#8217;s going because one of our locations, our main locations is in New York.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
And so, New York has been one of the top states really that have been on the news about the breakout. So from there, they&#8217;re really sympathetic to people who want to work from home to be more cautious and people who have kids who are out early because of it.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
So they&#8217;re able to work from home and this is in the beginning stages. Now, one thing I appreciate because I also practice it, is meditation. So one week for one of these calls, we opened up the call with just a few minutes of meditation, whether you&#8217;re into it or not, or if you want to try it, you can, if you don&#8217;t, that&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
But a lot of people are experiencing a lot of anxiety from other people, and even if they&#8217;re not watching the news, they&#8217;re experiencing some panic or some negative emotion that affects them. So that&#8217;s one thing I definitely noticed about them off the back, is that they&#8217;re definitely empathetic to the whole situation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s great. I think that meditation idea is really, really good too, because like you said, there&#8217;s multiple stressors that are at play. The thing about working from home, and I mentioned this to you before we started &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; at play. The thing about working from home and I mentioned this before we started recording, I&#8217;ve been working at home for a long time is that it takes a good while to get set up into a work from home routine. And that companies really should not expect employees to just fall right into line I would say within the first month of doing it. It takes a while, because it&#8217;s not only a behavioral change in terms of just being able to focus while you&#8217;re there. But in many times it&#8217;s also a change of your physical surroundings. Like you said, you don&#8217;t have a desk, you may have to get a desk if this is an extended thing.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If you&#8217;re doing something where you&#8217;re transferring a lot of files, you may have to get a larger internet package. If you have roommates or you live with elderly parents or something. That&#8217;s another stressor that you have to deal with now on top of work. Work is now not the escape from that. It&#8217;s right there. And if you have kids too, your kids are going to be there with you all day in the house while you&#8217;re working.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Got to feed them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, got to feed them, got to tend to them. They&#8217;re going to want to see what mom and dad is doing and everything. And also some places just don&#8217;t have great wifi.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
True.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So there&#8217;s a lot of things that have to go into working from home and it really takes time to get a setup. The fact that so many companies I think moved to it quickly is good because it did show that people are taking this seriously. But it&#8217;s a big shift. You can&#8217;t just go from in the office on Monday to now being on Zoom on Tuesday and think everything&#8217;s going to be the same. It&#8217;s not. And I think what we&#8217;re seeing now, especially if you look on Twitter and stuff, is that people are, I guess they&#8217;re dealing with it in their own way. Finding whatever stack of books they can make so they can have a standing desk or doing something where they&#8217;re drinking during the day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know, people are coping in very interesting ways. Because again, it&#8217;s not just that you&#8217;re working, but also the other stress of just being in the situation is, it&#8217;s a lot. It&#8217;s a lot and I don&#8217;t want to dwell on it for this because this is about you, but this is something that is going on right now and I did want to make sure that we kind of give at least some space for it.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Definitely, it gives some context as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
I wouldn&#8217;t be working from home. Some of the things I have to do now are definitely dependent on the fact that we&#8217;re in this situation right now. So I definitely agree with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. So I want to go more into your career, because you mentioned the Beck Group, but before that I want to just go back to the beginning. Where did you grow up?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
That is a tricky question and it always is for military brat.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
I grew up in multiple places. I spent most of my childhood split between Japan, Virginia, and Texas.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
My dad was in the air force and so my family moved around to wherever he was stationed.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When did you first feel like you were exposed to design in a way that you understood it?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Man, I&#8217;ve been drawn since I was a little kid. I was a artsy little freak. I still have drawings from when I was in man, probably like first grade, second grade, somewhere in my mom&#8217;s storage attic, wherever. Of me drawing sailor moon with color pastels, I&#8217;ve always been the artsy-fartsy child or the family. Everybody else was way over there. But as far as design, I knew that design was a little bit different for me though. Because when I was in middle school, I used to think about doing code. So where I&#8217;m at is very much a marriage between the analytical side of design as well as the artsy-fartsy part to where everything&#8217;s &#8230; Looks pretty or it&#8217;s coordinated, things like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so when you were in school, I guess in high school you decided you wanted to go to college also for design. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
So-so. Now I think about it, it wasn&#8217;t really a decision I made. I just expected that that&#8217;s where I&#8217;d be going anyway.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
So I actually did architecture first for a couple of years and then actually switched to graphic design at the same school. I wanted to graduate on time was one of the reasons, and I found that I really like architecture, but I wanted to be a little more artsy as well. And with design, I actually got to take more of the classes that I wanted to take on top of being a little more creative from the front end of it than I would have an architecture.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You would not be the first person that has been on the show that started in college in architecture and then veered sort of towards design. So that&#8217;s an interesting kind of a, I don&#8217;t know, maybe there&#8217;s something about. Maybe you tell me, is there something about architecture that just doesn&#8217;t lend itself to that kind of more creative design that you do now?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
I would say in the beginning I definitely thought that it was too analytical for me with &#8230; I mentioned that I&#8217;m ambivert, which is someone who&#8217;s pretty much 50% introvert, 50% extrovert. Our brain is also the same way. I use pretty much both my left side and my right side of the brain equally. So I&#8217;m complicated in the fact that I need something to stimulate both, no matter what I&#8217;m doing. So with architecture it was a little too analytical for me. In the stages I was in, it was too far on that side of the brain. So when I switched over to design, I was able to really more or less choose the balance between the two. So, that I think definitely architecture was that thing. But I will say architecture did help me realize that I do love rules and the rule-based structure organization of UX design is really, that&#8217;s where that marriage is for me. That&#8217;s that connection from architecture definitely led me to UX design for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was just about to ask if you saw any kind of parallels between UI and architecture, but it sounds like that rule based kind of methodology is what really works for you.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Definitely. I mean, for me a lot of the way they teach art now in college and in schools, they teach you the rules first and then you learn how to break them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
That&#8217;s pretty much, before I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s BS. That doesn&#8217;t make any sense.&#8221; But now as I kind of think about design, specifically UX design as well as architecture is that once you do know the rules. Once you know how to build a building that&#8217;s not going to collapse on people, then you can lend yourself to doing the creative crazy stuff that you want to do. Whether it&#8217;s the interior or the exterior to be able to do that, pull out that creative side.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So at the time you&#8217;re at the University of Texas at Arlington, what was going on in your life? What was that time in your life like?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Wow, that was a tricky time for me. So college they say is the best time of your life. Me, I stressed myself out, so it wasn&#8217;t really great for me. But it did help me see things in it from a different perspective. I think one thing that I learned from going to school is that not everyone&#8217;s there to help you, which is a really, really tough thing to learn as you&#8217;re trying to figure out who you are and what you want to do. And that goes from people I meet, from students to teachers. The way college is portrayed is that it&#8217;s this perfect thing that it&#8217;ll teach you all the things and you&#8217;ll get a degree and you&#8217;ll get a banging job right after. And that just wasn&#8217;t the case for me. It wasn&#8217;t easy. It was very tough. I also wasn&#8217;t the kind of person to ask for help. And then when the time came that I did ask for help, it was I asked the wrong person.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
So for me it was tough. There were some great things. I do love learning. So for me learning things from different perspectives and learning about different cultures, which is where that military brat part of me comes in, that I loved. I actually took an archeology class, which has nothing to do with architecture and nothing to do with design, but in some ways it really does. So it was kind of interesting to see and learn all these different things from these different classes and be able to kind of cross them over sort of like the UX design. Like I say, I&#8217;m going to keep coming back to that. The crossover of information. I love reading about that. I love learning about that. So that was the pro of college for me, meeting all the different people, and learning all the different things. The cons was learning my weaknesses really in the hardest way possible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I gotcha, yeah. So what was your kind of first design gig after you graduated?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Actually, if we want to count when I wasn&#8217;t in college, because while I was &#8230; My last couple semesters actually worked in the art history office of my school and I was actually redesigning their new website and updating their old one for the museum. And doing various other art projects within the department. That was very diverse actually as far as projects. So loving that I found the next job I went to, which was more of a startup. From there I did a bunch of different projects. I can&#8217;t even, and this is actually after my apprenticeship with the Beck Group. The Beck Group was really, like I said corporate. There&#8217;s a lot of corporate material, small stuff.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
I did a lot of production design as well, so that&#8217;s kind of why I skipped over it just a little bit because the [inaudible 00:23:02] from graphic design at my school and how diverse those projects were pushed me into Codestream Studios, which is where I was also an instructor. I actually taught web code on top of graphic design and design thinking. So whenever I got to do the artsy part of it, I was able to do that and teach that at the same time of teaching web. I would say that was my official first gig outside of UT Arlington, because that was something I did for pretty much full time as much as I could on top of the other job I had on top of that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And what did that experience really teach you at Codestream Studios? What did that experience teach you?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Since I was the only graphic designer there, I definitely learned a lot about what other people think graphic design is. A lot of people think it&#8217;s marketing, social media, anything that you can think of that&#8217;s artsy, they think it&#8217;s graphic design. So I learned that not only was it my job to do some of these things, but also to educate the people around me about what it really was. I&#8217;m not an expert at social media. I can create graphics for that and create a concept, but as far as campaigns that I might need some help on.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
So it was really interesting to learn that I can create all these things, but a lot of people think that I&#8217;m doing 10 times more. Like you&#8217;re wearing these 10 different hats for sure. But the depth and how tall these hats are, how much information these hats are full of. I think that&#8217;s where there&#8217;s a disconnect, so that was definitely the main thing I learned while I was there. Also, kids are great. I think it&#8217;s very strange how much we like to put them in a box when it comes to certain things. So teaching kids, like K-12 it wasn&#8217;t just one grade, it was K-12. Teaching them really reminded me how much I like learning and how much learning could be fun if it&#8217;s taught the right way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s really something about seeing how kids learn that really kind of brings that out I think. Because however you&#8217;ve learned your knowledge, whether it&#8217;s self-taught or if you&#8217;ve learned it through a formal program. Being able to distill that and then teach someone else, especially someone much younger. That&#8217;s a skill in and of itself. But it also I think requires a lot of hindsight to be able to kind of tie those two things together. Because once upon a time you were that student that was learning. And so-</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; how would you have wanted to be taught in that kind of way?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
I think a lot of it has to do with how you want them to see you, but how you want to show them that you see them. Because a lot of kids get ignored in the classroom too. And even at this job, it&#8217;s easy to forget about experiences and people that you&#8217;re not living their everyday life. So while I was at this job, I also thought about &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
&#8230; life. So, while I was at this job I also thought about ADA compliance. It&#8217;s not really talked about when it comes to design. In school, they don&#8217;t talk about that at all. And when I say school, I mean college. They didn&#8217;t talk about that at all. They say contrast and the colors that go together, color theory, blah blah blah. But they don&#8217;t talk about who you&#8217;re designing for past the normal, quote &#8220;normal.&#8221; Don&#8217;t think about just the normal people. Think about past that. So that&#8217;s another thing that I thought was really not necessarily annoying, but it definitely opened my eyes up more to learning past just what they want me to learn. Learning past just what they want to have at the forefront. Because there&#8217;s more diversity than the person who has two legs, who can see all colors, and has a stable job and two and a half kids and a dog, and a white picket fence. I think learning in that job, it definitely reminded me of that, which a lot of people don&#8217;t get.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You also worked for a group called the Brass Tacks Collective. Can you talk about that?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
This was a really great experience. The Brass Tacks Collective, which is the first company of its kind, it&#8217;s described as a design experience agency. We used to call it a teaching agency as well. But you go in with the concept of learning as an apprentice. You get to explore the different roles within the design industry while working on real client work, but also figuring out what you like to do at the same time. We had a bunch, [inaudible 00:27:41] people from different backgrounds, different age groups, different experiences, and so it was a really great opportunity to meet people who are not the same as you, and learning from them and them learning from you. Additionally, learning skills you wouldn&#8217;t think you would need to learn as well.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
So we actually had a lot besides the design aspect of it. We had a lot of classes that met outside of whatever we were learning. So if we had a videographer, she would also be learning about graphic design and sketch, and how do you sketch, and all the other Adobe products that they may or may not use on top of what is service design, or how do you run a business? And a lot of range of workshops and topics to touch that you can ever think of. It was really great. It&#8217;s one thing that I wish we had more often.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I agree. This is something that I&#8217;ve covered on the show before, just talking about how people find their way into the design industry. And so for you, it sounds like you, well one, you went to school for design, but then also you had these internships and apprenticeships that have given you the space to fail in a way. And I hate to say it that way, but I do feel like it&#8217;s important though.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Because if you come out of school and you get your first job, of course the expectation is that you&#8217;re going to kill it, you&#8217;re going to crush it. But as you&#8217;ve also just stated, the school design environment and the work design environment are two totally different things. And so it takes time to I guess steel yourself to what it means to be a working designer and what all that comes with.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Definitely agree.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So who are some of the people that have really helped motivate and inspire you throughout the years?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
That is a fairly long list. For me, one issue that I ran into a lot in both architecture and in design at my particular school, is that they didn&#8217;t really teach about people of color really. So I was very blind to the representation of people who look like me who do architecture or design. So I was kind of lost, really. I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to find my design voice without help or without trying to figure out&#8230; Even other classmates. One architecture class, someone pointed out that I was the only black person in there and I didn&#8217;t even notice that. And this was in 2000 and, what, 2012, 2013. So you would think it wouldn&#8217;t be that bad but-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I would actually, I would think it would be that bad. Unfortunately I would. That&#8217;s still one of the bad things about the industry is, even in this modern state, it&#8217;s still very, very white.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Yeah. So I had that issue. But then one of my teachers, Pauline, she had this idea to have a diversity inclusion panel event. And she had, Jacinda Walker and Gus Granger were my two main levels of inspiration. Because I had no idea&#8230; Actually I think Jacinda flew in out-of-state because she&#8217;s, I think right now she&#8217;s in Cleveland, Ohio. Gus Granger is actually in Dallas. And I hadn&#8217;t heard of him until the panel.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
So, first experience, first level of definitely inspiration is seeing the differences in how they move in the design world. She&#8217;s really a huge educator and advocate, which I am passionate about that and I&#8217;m still learning more about that. And while Gus does a lot of design, he&#8217;s a chief creative officer. So first two levels. And now today I would say inspiration, pretty-much every black person I meet who&#8217;s a designer because we all have very different experiences, but also similar experiences.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
And I&#8217;ve been meeting a lot of people at Dallas Black UX, which is a new group that we have here. I think it&#8217;s only two years old actually. And [inaudible 00:32:01] that I met a few of other people who all, a couple of them flew out of state as well, but Adrian Guillory and Mike Tinglin, I believe they both founded that. And that&#8217;s something that I frequent now because that&#8217;s my current inspiration, is meeting people like me, younger than me, older than me, because I don&#8217;t see that anywhere in any of the jobs that I&#8217;ve ever done. I don&#8217;t see black people and it bothers me. It makes me feel a little lost. So I had to go out and find them. I don&#8217;t even know how I found Dallas Black UX, but that continuously has been my inspiration really within the past six months as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You mentioned Gus and Jacinda, both of whom have also been guests here on Revision Path. And it&#8217;s interesting that you mentioned those two because I do feel like they operate at very different ends I guess of how the design community is. Gus, like you mentioned is professional chief creative officer. He helmed an agency in Dallas called 70kft. I think now he works for a different company called Cyxtera I think. Something like that. I don&#8217;t remember the actual name of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I just saw Jacinda last month actually. We had our live show in Los Angeles and I hadn&#8217;t seen her, I don&#8217;t know, God, maybe in about almost a year since then. But yeah, Jacinda&#8217;s someone who is always super outspoken and really is an educator and a teacher. And she&#8217;s doing a lot of great work now with, I don&#8217;t know if I can mention it, well I guess I can mention it. She&#8217;s doing a lot of work with the Smithsonian actually, with the National Museum of African American History and Culture, helping them with different design programs and things of that nature. So it&#8217;s interesting to see how folks can navigate in this space, and it&#8217;s good that you looked at both of them as inspirations because they&#8217;re both very inspiring, so good job with that.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
And kudos to them. Thanks for coming down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have a dream project that you would love to do one day?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Oh man. I come from a family who&#8217;s all about service and philanthropy. My grandmother&#8217;s a teacher, or she retired a while ago, but she was a teacher. My dad was in the Air Force. He actually won an award for most volunteer hours. I didn&#8217;t even know that was an award in the military, but he did it. So for me, my dream project would have to be something very, very giving. I haven&#8217;t figured it out yet, but it would have to be so punch-in-the-face awesome with that level, that I would quit my job. It would to be that good. As far as the company, I haven&#8217;t found it yet. Maybe a B Corporation company might be something close. But that&#8217;s my life goal right there, is to work on a project that helps a lot of people. Cliche and corny but-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Honestly, not in this day and age it doesn&#8217;t, it really doesn&#8217;t. Because I think what a lot of designers are starting to see is that the skills that they have can have a lot more use in the world than just an ad campaign or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Yep. A lot of people think that&#8217;s all it&#8217;s worth, is to make something look nice. Get me more views, get me more impressions, make me more money. And to me that falls flat on humanity. There&#8217;s so much more you can do with art than people ever mentioned, that, like I said, I want to punch people in the face so that they know that art is not just, you don&#8217;t have to be a starving artist. People still say that and I think it&#8217;s a huge misconception. And with my rebellious nature, I want to lend my argument to the fact that it can do so much more than that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you wish you would have been told about working in the design industry before you started?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
There are a lot of things. One thing I learned recently from Terell Cobbs, he was one of the speakers, Terell Cobb, sorry. He was one of the speakers at our most recent Dallas Black UX event. He mentioned having a tribe, well not necessarily a tribe, he called them, oh, a board of directors, people around him that he can go to for accountability, advice, suggestions. Someone who&#8217;s going to give him the real truth no matter what it is. I&#8217;ve never really experienced that. So for most people it kind of comes easily if they have a lot of friends, or if they have family who are very outspoken, who are very straightforward with them. I come from a family of introverts for the most part so that doesn&#8217;t come naturally. And so I had to learn to, I wish someone had told me to learn to find that, to learn that skill of reaching out to people a little earlier just to get their feedback, and really finding a group of people that support you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are you finding that now through work?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Definitely. It&#8217;s taken some time to get used to because I don&#8217;t like selling myself. It feels strange to put myself on the spot and brag. But if I&#8217;m not my own number one fan, who&#8217;s going to be my number one fan?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
True. That&#8217;s true. And I&#8217;ll tell you a little secret too, because I used to be the same way. I hated, well I guess you could say putting yourself out there, but I hated going to events where you have to network because it always felt like I was schmoozing and that it felt inauthentic. But what I&#8217;ve come to realize now is that as long as I&#8217;m talking about something I&#8217;m very passionate about, or if I&#8217;m working on a project or doing a project that I&#8217;m very passionate about, that sells itself, and that in turn sells you. I hate to say sells, but being able to exhibit the passion through the work lets people in, in a way. It&#8217;s a good proxy for that.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:12:17]. I never thought of it like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you do to get your creativity back if you&#8217;re feeling uninspired? Do you watch a certain thing, listen to music? What&#8217;s your routine there?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Definitely both of those things. I&#8217;m a movie nut. I love watching different things. Korean dramas are pretty-much my favorite right now. Actually, really Asian dramas in general. There&#8217;s a very cliche, very standard way of doing movies in Hollywood, that I like to divert from that. And Korean dramas, they&#8217;re crazy on another level. So watching things that are of different countries or different, really, really my number one go-to. Also music as well.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
&#8230; really, really my number one go to. Also music as well. Apparently I listened to 55 different countries last year on Spotify. I don&#8217;t know what those countries are.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
I thought it was just five. But, apparently that&#8217;s also my go to. Another thing I like to do is just to read online. There are a lot of random things you can find online from Manga. I like reading different Manga from different countries as well. There are some good Chinese ones out there. Additionally, recently I&#8217;ve been into Mindvalley. And so part of my creative process is thinking about what&#8217;s under the creative aspect of it. And maybe it&#8217;s not the creative that&#8217;s lacking, maybe it&#8217;s the structure behind it sometimes. So, additionally I&#8217;ll look for different techniques to do different things to get out of my vision bubble to see someone from a different perspective, how would they look at it as well. And sometimes that can change the creative aspect to better match multiple views or perspectives, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, that makes sense. What do you think you would have been if you weren&#8217;t a designer?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Definitely a fine artist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, so still doing something in the creative realm then?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Yeah, I think I would also probably be some sort of musician as well. It&#8217;d probably be like some weird mashup of both. Art can be crazy and non methodical, while learning how to play an instrument is structured and very pinpointed to certain movements. Right? So, definitely one of those two.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What instrument do you play?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
I also have a violin.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
I&#8217;d probably play the string instrument, some sort of string instrument for sure. There&#8217;s something beautiful about a violin that just irks me in the good way. Very beautiful sound. It can be high. It can be very low. It can be vibrating. So, probably some sort of string instrument for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Earlier we talked about interning, and I mentioned about how internships and apprenticeships can be these spaces to fail when you&#8217;re just starting out, which most designers don&#8217;t really have in the corporate workplace. But if you knew that you couldn&#8217;t fail in your professional life, what would you try to do?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Ooh, as far as job wise or-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Anything.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Anything?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
If I could do anything. So this has been how I do my freelance but, you know how Issa Rae said, &#8220;I&#8217;m rooting for everybody black.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
I would design for everybody black, because I&#8217;m tired of seeing these ugly club flyers on my windshield. I mean, our cultural is awesome. So, to bump it up and give it the love it deserves, I would definitely be designing for black people full time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, would it just be flyers or were you looking-</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Bigger than that. Pretty much everything. I would say I would have a full stack level of designers from engineers, product designers. That would be a really cool place to work. Just the Wakanda of design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m surprised no one has really tried to come up with that, especially since Black Panther came out.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Right. You know, who&#8217;s to say we don&#8217;t know it exists. I know someone who-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true. That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Bree Moore, she&#8217;s a fashion designer coordinator. She&#8217;s a business woman. She&#8217;s been doing something very similar with her brand. She does work for a lot of black businesses. I think she&#8217;s ahead of her time really, because she&#8217;s been doing that since a few years ago and she&#8217;s community-based as well. So she&#8217;s really giving the love back to Dallas, that it&#8217;s given her.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Who knows? There may be a small little company out there who&#8217;s doing it already. You just don&#8217;t know yet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who knows? They might be listening. You never know.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
This is true. Keep it up, whoever you are.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? It&#8217;s 2025, hopefully we have blown past this current dystopia. What do you see yourself doing in the next five years?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
In the next five years? I hope to be the most solidified version of myself, really. I mentioned earlier that college was really stressful for me. Working an apprenticeship and a startup both at the same time was a little rough. Between being out of a job for six months, I really opened up my schedule to do some personal growth, as well as professional. So, since I&#8217;m still in like the early stages of that, in about five years I picture myself to be exactly where I&#8217;m supposed to be, wherever that is. Still figuring it out a little bit. But I know for sure it&#8217;s in the world of art and design.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
I hope to be in my tiny house, traveling remotely, educating people, inspiring people to love the earth we live on, on top of doing whatever they love to do. That&#8217;s definitely the vision I see for myself within five years, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I like that. Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
So which work? Not risking. So, I do a lot of things actually. Outside of a designer, I design jewelry as well. Honestly, if you can find me by that page and you can find me everywhere else. I do design through NU BLAC STUDIO. It&#8217;s N-U-B-L-A-C dot studio. If you just Google that, you&#8217;ll find me. That&#8217;s also my website, NUBLAC STUDIO. From there, it links to my Etsy page where I sell my jewelry and my Instagram page where I showcase my jewelry. Actually, those are really the two spaces I live. Instagram and my website.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you say there is a link to the Instagram on your website?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Yes. From my about page it links to &#8230; Anything I do creatively it&#8217;s under Dezi Unique, D-E-Z-I Unique. And that&#8217;s where I do my art, like my black goth portrait series and my jewelry design, eco-friendly jewelry design, because I&#8217;m a bit of a hippie, too. And then most of my actual UI/UX design is on NUBLAC STUDIO.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. You can&#8217;t leave without not talking more about the black goth portrait series. You buried the lead here. I want to know more about it. Tell me about this.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Sure, sure. So, in the beginning I mentioned I&#8217;m a UI designer. If you just met me, I would consider myself a serial entrepreneur. From a very, very personal note, I would consider myself an Afro hippie goth.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
From there, it&#8217;s pretty much me, modern hippie tree hugger, plus the goth side of myself. So the alternative side of myself. So, from there I actually designed jewelry when I was in high school, and it&#8217;s grown from ear chains to jewelry I made on accident, really. I was trying to make a pyramid and it turned into these cool spike looking things that I&#8217;ve kind of expanded into that.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
And then growing into that more alternative lifestyle, I recognized that I was goth. And from there I wanted to showcase people. Black goths get a lot of crap because one, we&#8217;re black already, but then two, because black people can&#8217;t be goth. You hear that a lot still. Black people can&#8217;t be alternative. Black people can&#8217;t be nerdy.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
So from there I submitted for a scholarship while I was at UT Arlington to do this project, and I ended up winning. And I was able to interview some cool goth people, and I painted a portrait series of them in their cool goth outfits and their beautiful faces.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. And that&#8217;s on the website, too? NUBLAC.STUDIO?</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
No, that&#8217;s actually only on my Instagram.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
The Dezi Unique Instagram. I have a little story that&#8217;s focused on my works in progress as I&#8217;m working on it, as well as the final products. So I got six paintings, two per person for now. But that&#8217;s another project that I hope to really expand on, because I didn&#8217;t get to do as many people as I wanted. It&#8217;s difficult to find black goth in Texas, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That makes sense, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
The alternative scene here is very white, so I have to do my research in that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Maybe if more people, they listen to this interview we can get you some more black goths to paint.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
That would be dope.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, well Desiree Gibbs, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. I&#8217;ve mentioned throughout this interview that this is happening at this really interesting junction in society right now. But I think also just from hearing your story, you&#8217;re at an interesting place in your career right now as well. You told me this before we started recording that this is your first full-time salary gig. And now this is happening where you&#8217;ve got to work from home and you&#8217;re trying to adjust to that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I think your perseverance, just from what you&#8217;ve told me about your creative background, your creativity with this portrait series and with the jewelry designing, you certainly strike me as someone that is able to easily change to the situation. And so, I feel like we&#8217;re just seeing you get started with what you can do. And granted, this time is a very weird time for everyone right now. But, I feel like you certainly have what it takes to go forward and to accomplish those dreams that you want to make happen. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Desiree Gibbs:</b><br>
Thank you. I really appreciate the way you put that. I love that.</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Hi. So my name is Ashley Bozeman. I am an art director here at the Martin Agency, which is located in Richmond, Virginia. So as far as the title of my actual role, so basically I work in the creative department at a creative ad agency. I&#8217;m usually paired with a copywriter and together we are the ones who are briefed and tasked to basically come up with ideas for campaigns, commercials, social posts, really anything you can think of. It&#8217;s our job to basically come up with that creative idea. And then specifically as an art director, it&#8217;s my job to bring that to life visually. So how does that look? Who is being represented? What are the color choices? What are the style choices? Cinematography, &#8230; working with directors and things like that, but we basically just, we&#8217;re the ones who control how everything looks. Whereas our partners are copywriters, they are the ones who control the tone of voice and what that sounds like and the scripts and things like that. So together we&#8217;re the ones, kind of the big brains behind a lot of the things you&#8217;ll see on TV as far as commercials and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like your work is a lot of, I guess meetings and sort of heads down work sessions. Is that true?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah. Yes, definitely a lot of meetings, but it&#8217;s also a lot of concepting. So it&#8217;s a lot of just, I was briefed earlier today, we&#8217;ll get a brief and then we&#8217;ll look at our calendars, &#8220;Hey when you have some time.&#8221; We&#8217;ll put two or three hours on our schedules and then we&#8217;ll just find a room in the office and literally just sit and come up with ideas. Ideas that are large and kind of lofty that we&#8217;re not sure if the clients would ever even buy or do. And then ideas that also fit the brief exactly. So we basically, we&#8217;ll just kind of get together and just kind of brainstorm of different ways we can kind of find the best solution for that problem in the brief to be solved or for something to be showcased in the best way possible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now this brief document that you get, this is coming? I&#8217;m assuming this is coming from the client or is this someone else is kind of putting this information together for you?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah, so internally we have our strategists, so our strategists are the ones who had to work with a client and then they come and work on their own research and insights. So, basically develop a kind of, just kind of a brief, so it just, it&#8217;ll give us insights. It&#8217;ll have the actual problem they&#8217;re trying to solve. It&#8217;ll have a target demographic about when we&#8217;re trying to do said thing, have a timeline, maybe important events that are happening around that time too. That then they kind of all compile it together to kind of create this kind of, it&#8217;s usually about five or six page long document that we can also then use to kind of go back to, to kind of make sure that whatever ideas we do come up that they fit the brief and they fit that target &#8230; clients. And they fit the platform that they asked us to create on. Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of a mix. A lot of it does come internally, but they definitely have to use findings and have these conversations with the clients to make sure that it&#8217;s good to go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, from what I heard, you were the first black woman hired there as a creative in the history of the agency. Is that true?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yes. So that&#8217;s actually pretty crazy. It&#8217;s pretty crazy considering I started in 2018, in the beginning of 2018. And I think I didn&#8217;t find that out probably at least a year and a half? A Year and a half maybe into my career here. But so it was kind of a shock. But I think also too, it was something that was also still really exciting. And I think that my friends and my parents, especially my mom, was trying to hype me up about, where initially I felt kind of scared. You know? You kind of feel worried like, &#8220;Oh okay, I don&#8217;t know if I really asked to be the first.&#8221; But something my mom always says is, &#8220;Well somebody has to be the first, so why can&#8217;t it be you?&#8221; So I think that things like that are also just so important when it comes to just kind of remembering your place. And then again, not take it as a negative, but just to know that like, &#8220;Hey, this is pretty exciting. We&#8217;re starting new things and somebody has to do it.&#8221; And all of us are more than capable in being that person.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the brands or clients that you&#8217;ve been able to work with?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
When I first started out I primarily was working on Land O&#8217;Lakes Butter. So I know a lot of unnecessary facts about butter. Which is so funny with creatives and that&#8217;s why I love creatives, especially in the ad industry. Because everybody knows wild things about wild things, random things. It&#8217;s just so interesting. So I know a lot of things about butter, I worked on butter for almost a year. And then last year I did a lot of work for Discover Card, I&#8217;m a little knowledgeable actually in credit cards. So that&#8217;s kind of exciting. This year and at the end of last year too, I&#8217;ve been on more Oreo work, which has been fun and exciting. And then a lot of different other things. As we were pitching for Old Navy, I helped out with that some and that was really fun. And so many that they literally just have us go back and forth. I&#8217;m working on Penske now. I&#8217;ve done UPS. I&#8217;ve done Ritz Crackers, I&#8217;ve worked on that for a while.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
So, there&#8217;s definitely a lot of brands that I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to touch here, which has been fantastic. But then also too, we also just have a lot of cool brands too that I&#8217;m excited to hopefully touch this year, DoorDash and CarMax and things like that. So yeah, it just kind of changes and it&#8217;s nice because I&#8217;m never just on one thing. I&#8217;m usually on a few different things, so that, and I think especially when you have a mind that&#8217;s literally all over the place, it&#8217;s nice to be able to divert your energy into other paths rather than just one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there a specific type of client that you enjoy working with? Because I would imagine in an ad agency you&#8217;re working with, like you just mentioned all these different clients, they&#8217;re in all these different industries. There&#8217;s a lot of variety there.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah, there are. Yeah, there is. It&#8217;s interesting too because I think I find that, that almost changes sometimes. I think there&#8217;s been parts of every client that I&#8217;ve worked on so far that I really, really have enjoyed and I really, really liked. I think Oreo is really fun because they are kind of design heavy and I do love design and they also really love big ideas. So that&#8217;s kind of a really fun place to kind of come up with these larger ideas. But I think also too, I really love projects that use their platform to kind of spread a larger message. And I think that that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s really nice because it&#8217;s kind of few and far between. A lot of times people just want to make sure that their brand or their product is put, placed first, which I totally understand. But I think at the same time, I also love, love, love when a client can tap into an issue that is relatable for them and appropriate for them and they want to do something about it. And I think that that&#8217;s really fun and I think that&#8217;s what gets me most excited when I get, on [inaudible 00:08:52] like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I have to ask this question because you&#8217;ve spent a lot of time talking about really sort of kind of the great things about your job and what it is that you do, but what&#8217;s the worst thing about being an art director in an agency?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I would say the worst thing would probably, honestly and I think you can ask any art director this, I&#8217;m pretty sure they&#8217;ll say the same thing. I think the death of every art director is making comps and making comps is literally just the art of basically intense hours of photoshopping and searching for images. And let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve come up with this grand idea, you said, &#8220;Okay, we want to make a truck that has a slide on the back of it.&#8221; And of course every client is just like, &#8220;Okay, I don&#8217;t know what that means. Can we see what that looks like?&#8221; So again, that&#8217;s our job so now we have to find a truck, I&#8217;m going on Getty and search all these things and find the perfect truck then photoshop that truck to make it Oreo branded, let&#8217;s say. And then put a giant, and then find another image of a slide that still fits and then still have it look somewhat realistic.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
So, I think that part can just be just such a time consuming thing because you can search for pictures for hours and you can get stuck in this hole for hours. And so I think that that might be the most difficult part, because how can you move fast but then also make something look as nice. So I think that that&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve really been working on this year too, is just my speed but then also to my craft and making sure that those two things go together. So, that can just be a little time consuming. But like I said, I think a lot of art directors can feel my pain when it comes to making comps.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So when you&#8217;re working together with the copywriter, are there, it sounds like you&#8217;re also kind of the designer too. There&#8217;s not designers that are in house that are helping out or you&#8217;re kind of?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yes. We definitely, we have a whole super, super talented design team and we also have a very super, super talented studio art team. The studio art, so that&#8217;s a group of people that will more so be the ones to kind of help us with those comps and kind of help us get things together and make sure the images are perfect and the files are perfect before they send them off to be shipped to whomever. And then our designers are more so, they&#8217;ll kind of sit in concept with us sometimes. So sometimes they&#8217;ll even be in the brief if it&#8217;s big enough, they&#8217;ll be in the brief with us and so then they know that they&#8217;re kind of concepting and thinking about it design-wise. Whereas we&#8217;re kind of focused on still the imagery, but also too the core of the idea. That&#8217;s still a big part of our job description as well. So we still have people who can help us out, but nine times out of 10 they have to kind of, they still have plenty of things they have to do on their own. So it&#8217;s just, I think as an art director you kind of have to be multifaceted. But I think a great art director is also a great designer and vice versa. So, it&#8217;s an interesting role because it kind of dips into a bunch of different things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Was design kind of a big part of your childhood? Growing up, you grew up in Milwaukee from what you told me before we started recording. Was design kind of a big part of you growing up?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
So, you know what? Not necessarily design but more so just art. It&#8217;s interesting because, so I&#8217;m the oldest of five and both of my parents are super smart. My dad is an engineer. My mom has always been great at math and science and so I feel I came out and I was just this little, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s draw.&#8221; I just always felt, &#8220;Wait, what happened? How did I not get that gene?&#8221; But it&#8217;s fine. I think what&#8217;s interesting too is, now that I actually sitting here and talking about it, I think because of my dad&#8217;s job, we moved around quite a bit. And by moving around, we&#8217;ve probably moved around almost every three years. So, I was constantly going to new schools in new states and trying to, I was always the new kid, but I think I found comfort in art. I think that was something that wasn&#8217;t reliant upon somebody else. So if I were to move that summer or something, I could still draw, it was something that still keep me occupied. It was something that I really enjoyed, seeing a picture and then trying to, then bring it.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Seeing a picture and then trying to then bring it to paper. So that was something I think kind of like that all kids do. But then I noticed that that was one thing that I really kept with. So I kept with it throughout middle school, I kept with it throughout high school, I even kept with it through, actually, through college, which I had then realized like, &#8220;Oh, maybe I should have majored in art. Maybe this should&#8217;ve been a thing.&#8221; But I still took, like I literally took an art class every single semester and there&#8217;s only one semester I did it and I literally could feel the difference. I just didn&#8217;t feel the same. So that&#8217;s when I realized, &#8220;Okay, like this is probably going to be a part of me forever.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
So yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Were your parents kind of really supportive of you going into art, like that?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
They were. They were and I thank them all the time and I&#8217;m just so appreciative. They&#8217;ve always been super understanding. They&#8217;ve always been very supportive in that, and so I always say it. Before I left or right after I had graduated from Hampton, I had gotten a degree in Public Relations, which I still really liked. But you know, I just, I don&#8217;t know, there was something about it where I was just like, &#8220;Okay,&#8221; I basically made a deal with myself. I said, &#8220;Okay, so I&#8217;m job hunting. You know, I&#8217;m looking for a PR job but I&#8217;m going to take art classes on the side because I think that that&#8217;s something really important to me.&#8221; So I was looking for jobs in different cities and I lived in Atlanta and so, of course, I was probably looking up the art schools before I was looking up the jobs, but &#8230; so that tells you a lot right there but &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I found through a Google search, I was like looking through like art school and then up popped up two different things. It was the Portfolio Center and then the Creative Circus. And I remember reading through, because as I was doing like the job search or like as I was looking at like descriptions for the PR jobs, it was interesting because art director would never be that far because it&#8217;s still all in communications. And so I would always see that job position, that job role and I was just like, &#8220;Wow, that sounds so cool. It literally sounds right up my alley, but I don&#8217;t know how would I become an art director? That doesn&#8217;t make any sense.&#8221; And like, &#8220;That&#8217;s really cool. I don&#8217;t know how people get into it, but whatever.&#8221; Once I found the Circus I was looking through and it was basically, I was just like, &#8220;Oh, so this is a two year program where I could learn how to be an art director.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I said, &#8220;That sounds lit. That&#8217;s exactly what I want to do,&#8221; and so I remember I had like, I found it, I thought about it, like I prayed on it and I sent my parents this really long text one morning. I was just like, &#8220;Hey, I found this school. I know I wasn&#8217;t planning to go right back to school, but I found this school. I&#8217;m in Atlanta and I can study as an art director there. And I think that like, I think it&#8217;s legit. Like I think this is something I really want to do. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;m really interested in. What do you guys think basically?&#8221; And they were just like, I mean, &#8220;Okay, crazy girl.&#8221; They&#8217;re just like, that&#8217;s fine.&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
So like I was like, I was the one who was like really stressed, like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, like hopefully they&#8217;ll be okay with it. X, Y, and Z.&#8221; They were like, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s fine. Like, sure why not?&#8221; And so for that, I&#8217;m very thankful because I just know it&#8217;s hard. I think it&#8217;s hard really for anyone to kind of tell like their parents and stuff, especially after we just spent all this money at a four year university that, &#8220;Hey, I want to go to a portfolio school where, you know, also mind you, you don&#8217;t get a degree in.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
&#8220;You, more so, just get a certificate,&#8221; and it&#8217;s kind of crazy. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, so we&#8217;re about to put some more money back into schooling that you technically don&#8217;t get another degree in.&#8221; But I was trying to explain the importance. I was just like, &#8220;Well, look, like still like there&#8217;s like a 99% placement, 95, 99% placement rate after graduation. I think it&#8217;ll be great.&#8221; So yeah, they helped ride that wave with me ever since then and even before and still now. So for that, I&#8217;m very grateful. I know that that&#8217;s very much so a privileged that I don&#8217;t take lightly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I want to go back to the Creative Circus, but even before then you kind of glossed a little bit over the fact that you went to such a prestigious HBCU for undergrad. You went to Hampton University.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah. Those were some of the best years of my life so far. I think that&#8217;s where Ashley came to be Ashley. I think I had grown up in predominantly white institutions and places and schools. My mom was the one who actually really pushed for that. She was very adamant and &#8220;Hey, I know that, like, obviously, like we couldn&#8217;t help like by school district with so much like while you were in high school and stuff,&#8221; but she was like, &#8220;If you decide to go to HBCU, just know that this is probably one of the only times in your life you&#8217;ll be surrounded by so many beautifully educated brown and black people who look just like you and you just won&#8217;t necessarily get that opportunity anywhere else.&#8221; And the more I thought about it, it was interesting. I was a little nervous because I was actually going into the Hampton, I was worried that maybe I wasn&#8217;t &#8220;black enough.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
You know, I didn&#8217;t necessarily have a lot of black friends growing up and I technically wasn&#8217;t in all those spaces and necessarily didn&#8217;t know all the music and things like that. Of course, I was still like with my family and stuff, but you know, it&#8217;s still not the same if you don&#8217;t have like a core group of friends and stuff in high school and things like that. So it just wasn&#8217;t the same. And so I was a little worried about that, but honestly it turned out that there were a lot of Ashleys at Hampton and it was fantastic. And I think I wasn&#8217;t the only one who felt that way, but that fear was just a projected fear that I had. It was never anything that actually happened. There was still a place for me as there was a place to someone who grew up in all black schools their entire life.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I feel like that kind of flowing into Hampton was more, way more seamless than I thought it would be. But yeah, Hampton was an incredible experience. I have lifelong friends from there. I have bridesmaids, I have probably maid of honors, like I just have some of my best friends I&#8217;ll have for the rest of my life. I just love also, too, I think also, too, I came into terms of also celebrating just who I am and also being black and like how much, like how much power there is in that. And so Hampton taught me a lot of that as well. And so that&#8217;s really exciting and it&#8217;s interesting, too, it even transcended into some of my art, too. I notice growing up I actually drew more white women, more people who probably weren&#8217;t of a black ethnicity. It was interesting to kind of see how my sketchbooks have changed, too, by just being introduced into that.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
And then also like again, it&#8217;s important to know like &#8230; Well, it&#8217;s important as a child, even just growing up as a teenager, what you see and what your perception is on things and how much that affects you. But it was crazy how that was affecting my art and how I never really drew girls that necessarily looked like me, but now like if you asked me today like that&#8217;s all I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s very, very, very interesting to see how just that influence that I think that I had [inaudible 00:06:55]. I think that that was probably the best decision I could&#8217;ve made. And that&#8217;s one of the best decisions I&#8217;ve made. Like flat out, in my 26 years or so.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You make an interesting point there about HBCUs. I mean, so I went to an HBCU also. I went to Morehouse and HBCUs in general are &#8230; I mean maybe this is just us speaking as black people, like they&#8217;re very warm, comforting open spaces for everyone.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if people that maybe don&#8217;t know the HBCU experience or just aren&#8217;t familiar with HBCUs in general really see that. But like it&#8217;s such a unique sort of family thing. I think one just among students and alums at a particular school, but also between HBCU graduate students and alums of other schools. Like we see like a certain kinship in other people that have went to HBCU. I don&#8217;t know if that, if that kind of makes sense or not, but, no. Essentially because you said your mom kind of really wanted you to go there to sort of soak up that culture. I&#8217;m curious to know like because Hampton has such a well known design program, I mean we&#8217;ve had several people on the show who have graduated from Hampton that went on to graduate school. Actually, you mentioned the Creative Circus, nikita Pope, she&#8217;s a Hampton grad. What was the program like there for you? Like did you feel like it really prepared you once you got out there as a working art director? As a working designer?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah, so I think what&#8217;s interesting is I think as most &#8230; Well, I was 17, 18 year old going into college, I think I knew that I wanted to be kind of creative. I knew I liked things that were more like thinking based than creation based, but I don&#8217;t think I ever really knew how to fully get into it. And so with that being said, I think some of that, it was also, too, of my own misunderstanding and kind of almost like canceling it out completely. Whereas I think maybe I probably in those four years, I look back now and I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Man, I wish I would&#8217;ve learned Photoshop and Illustrator and Adobe Suite during Hampton rather than trying to learn it at the Circus.&#8221; And so I think that was almost kind of my misstep in like not maybe taking full advantage of all the programs that were there currently in Hampton as I was kind of more so just focused on like just fine art and just drawing and painting and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
So looking back I&#8217;m just kind of like, &#8220;Man, if I would have only really known that like I could have done this and then went here and then that would&#8217;ve made sense then I think I absolutely would&#8217;ve set it up that way.&#8221; But I think, I know it&#8217;s not just me. I know it&#8217;s a lot of people. I think it&#8217;s just like you realize and you&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Oh, shoot, this was an option and this was a path.&#8221; And like looking back I definitely would have done some things differently as far as like my track and kind of like my major, definitely my minor. I think that they have a great solid program and I do have friends and I do know people who have successfully gone through the program, but they&#8217;re doing great now still, too. I just think I just wasn&#8217;t like for sure, for sure just yet, while I was at Hampton. It just wasn&#8217;t able to fully tap into all the resources.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think that&#8217;s probably like, I don&#8217;t want to say a regret, but I feel like that&#8217;s a regret for &#8230; Sometimes I think for people that are at schools, they don&#8217;t feel like they&#8217;ve gotten a chance to really utilize all the resources. It&#8217;s sort of one of those, you know, hindsight, this 20-20 kind of things. You look back and realize how good you had it in a way. But I mean what you learned at Hampton though at least kind of propelled you forward to then go to the Creative Circus.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Oh, yeah, absolutely. And I think also through Hampton, I think that also, one of big &#8230; Well, a really big takeaway that I got from Hampton is learning how to just work with people and learning to really come into your own. I think I feel like that that was almost like, I think college in general, it just, it comes at the right time and then always feels like it ends too early. But I&#8217;m sure that it ends right on time, but it definitely prepared me to work with people and professionalism and kind of again, like you were mentioning earlier about that sense of community that now I carry into when it comes to, here amongst all the employees here, Martin, but also especially our black employee network.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s something that I really lean into hard because I think it reminds me so much of Hampton. So it&#8217;s something that I really kind of latch onto and really try to kind of just, I don&#8217;t know, just really attach myself to, because it really feels like home.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So when you ended up going to the Circus and you were here in Atlanta, I&#8217;m curious like what was that time like for you? Because Creative Circus, I&#8217;m thinking, I&#8217;m sort of trying to line it up. So this is like between 2015 to 2017 what was that time like in Atlanta for you?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Atlanta was a great time. So it was interesting because Atlanta necessarily wasn&#8217;t in one of my cities to live necessarily. But I realized that I had really made a home out of Atlanta by the time I &#8230; like those two years were up and I miss it almost every day. But I think my time there was just such a whirlwind, was probably the best way to explain it? It was like anything I&#8217;ve never, like I&#8217;ve ever experienced before. It was just, I just call it, it was just like this crazy two-year bootcamp, I felt like.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Because the Circus is also set up by quarters, so it&#8217;s pretty much year round, and so that was something new. I think also too, that&#8217;s the biggest city that I lived in and I lived in my own. Also, too, kind of just going off a whim and doing something that I personally did never knew of anybody doing before and kind of leaping out to take that chance was also really scary. And so I think, what I was like 22, I think I&#8217;d just turned 23 the day before my first day of class. And it was just a crazy time. But again, like that was just another time where I learned so much and I got to be just so creative and that&#8217;s something else, too, that I miss. There were like, there were barely any restrict</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
&#8230; that&#8217;s something also too that I missed. There were barely any restrictions. There were barely any like, &#8220;Oh we can&#8217;t do that or you can&#8217;t use those colors. You can do that.&#8221; Like everything was open for grabs. There was time to actually do things and even as rushed and as stressed and as busy as we were because we were all those things all the time for those whole two years. At the same time, I think that I still made incredible, incredible friendships and experiences that like, again, kind of like the Hampton, I think that that play in my life will stay with me forever too. I think that that was such a big, important time as far as my career development and also my development as a creative.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I really think that that was also the time that I really fell in love with design and digital design and graphic design and digital art and how to transfer my traditional skills and kind of put it more into like this modern day age. So it was like this big squirrel, but it was fantastic. And again, I think that that was also a great choice that I&#8217;m very happy I did.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now when you look back over your career, look back over your education et cetera. Who are some of the people that have really helped motivate and inspire you throughout the years?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah. So I think a lot of times when I think about those people, a lot of times they are just people who have just been just kind. And a lot of times it&#8217;s friends, it&#8217;s family, everybody in between. So I would say that first off, of course my family is always super supportive, always have been day one, very thankful. Then I feel like I had my Hampton core group friends, they were always so supportive. I would call them in tears or super stressed out about a project and they would always pick up the phone, always be encouraging like, &#8220;Hey, we don&#8217;t really understand 100% but we know that you&#8217;re doing the right thing. So just keep going.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
And then as I got to the circumstance stuff, I&#8217;ve met amazing creatives who are just all like just fantastic. And so I&#8217;m learning from them every day. And it&#8217;s really nice to also go through this journey at the same time with them and hearing similar stories. And I think that that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s more empowering that I think people may not realize, but having a group of people who are doing similar or pretty much the same thing as you but different places, it&#8217;s really cool to see us all grow all over the country. I have some really fantastic, fantastic coworkers who have now turned to friends who have now turned to family. And a lot of those people here at Martin, they are like brothers and sisters. They are like big brothers and sisters. They&#8217;re mentors. And I just am so thankful for all of them and I think that they are really single-handedly helping me navigate my career, which is priceless.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I just learned so much from each and every one of them and I&#8217;m so thankful for their presence. But I think it takes a village and it&#8217;s been taken a village. So there&#8217;s a ton of people that I feel like I&#8217;ve been blessed with that can help me out with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have a dream project that you&#8217;d love to work on one day?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yes, I feel like I&#8217;m not 100% sure what that is, but as far as like a name, I think my dream project would be visually stunning, very well designed. And then also too it would be for a bigger cause. It would either be for like a nonprofit, it would be either some kind of announcement. I&#8217;ve also always dreamed in maybe doing design or art direction for an art museum. Even like I&#8217;ve also been watching a lot of music videos lately. Low key I would love to art direct a music video. And then two, I think also my dream is to work on a movie one day.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
It kind of like it spans, it can be anything from like a book, like a very beautifully like well art directed well laid out books all the way to helping out to say that I was able to help out with even like a Pixar film if I could. Like be in the room to help out with like art direction or color or things like that. Things like that just really get me excited and those kind of projects too I think would help also to remind me of why I love my job in the first place and it all comes back to being able to make something and I think that that&#8217;s what I love the most is just physically making something and that&#8217;s why I love being an art director. I love coming up with ideas but also really, really love making things. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I have to ask since you mentioned a music video, which artist would you work with?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I mean obviously I love Beyonc√©. I would do anything she would ever ask me to do. In drop of a dime if she called me right now, I would run to LA or wherever she&#8217;s at, but there are some really, really, really cool artists out here that I really love. So I recently watched &#8230; I believe her name is Victoria Mon√©t. She just had a music video drop for her new song Moment and visually it&#8217;s beautiful. She did such an amazing job. Her art direction is fantastic. Like things like that I would absolutely work with her in a heartbeat.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
And also too, I&#8217;ve been watching a lot of Brent Faiyaz. He also has some really cool artsy and kind of grungy art direction, which I would also be very into. And obviously Solange also does a great job. There&#8217;s just a few different ones. And then even too, people I would also say don&#8217;t sleep on even some of the rappers like Playboi Carti, he also does a great job as far as like his editing team, kind of like I love the effort that&#8217;s being put behind a lot of these music videos. They&#8217;re just so visually engaging.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s just interesting because we don&#8217;t necessarily have that like 106 apart or MTV playing music videos all the time. You kind of have to go out of your way to kind of watch them. But I love that we&#8217;re still putting the effort behind them even if we&#8217;re not being watched all the time. You think that that would kind of die off, and in some aspects it has. And I think people that&#8217;s why maybe we don&#8217;t even have as many music videos on a consistent basis than we think we should. But I think I love music so much. And so to be able to tell a story within a song, I think that that would just be such a fun challenge and you can take that story so many different ways as people do and find meaning and find purpose for everything. But I think that that would be something really, really fun to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I am seeing how the music videos now for certain artists are certainly, it&#8217;s bringing me back to like the Heyday of the 90s when we had like Hype Williams video that you had like really dope videos by Missy and everything and it&#8217;s like you get so in throbbing. Of course you love the song, but then visuals along with the song, it makes each video like an event of sorts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like we have to really give it up to Michael Jackson for making videos releases and events like a prime time of it that people used to tune into. I remember as a kid tuning into watch Black or White or tuning into watch Remember The Time, but like yeah, now you really kind of don&#8217;t see that. It feels like the big thing now is the surprise drop. I mean like Beyonc√© did it of course. And now everyone else is trying to find some way to get your attention really quickly. So it&#8217;s not only, yes, we want you to look at the video and consume the music. But it&#8217;s really about gathering your attention for a period of time.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah. And similar to how you felt like that. That&#8217;s how I felt in Atlanta when she dropped Lemonade. I vividly remember that night and I went over to my friend&#8217;s house saw that at HBO, we&#8217;d all brought stuff to eat and watch and I just remember just texting my mom like, &#8220;Oh my God, do you see this?&#8221; I think that that was fantastic. I think that also just goes to show the true craft and then like again that wanting to make something. Again, this is nothing she ever like necessarily had to do, but I think a lot of it for her and just like Michael, I think it&#8217;s that wanting to tell that story and go that extra step.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Like yes, I made the song and yes I made the lyrics and I have to sing and perform it, but now it&#8217;s just like I want to bring it to life visually. And I think that that&#8217;s really, really exciting. And I think you don&#8217;t see that necessarily all the time. But all that to say too is like Lemonade, like that was an event and I just don&#8217;t remember the last music video since then. That has really felt like an event. I don&#8217;t know. Like I feel like my memory might be a little jog right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, I think you might be right. Videos come out all the time, but it&#8217;s like they get shared on Twitter or something and you watch a vivo link, and you&#8217;re like, okay, then you go about your day. Like it&#8217;s not really something that you really are tuned in for or anticipated seeing. Because for the artists they want to surprise you with it. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, surprise. I put out a new music video.&#8221; And you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, okay.&#8221; And you watch it and then that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah, I know. I know. And that&#8217;s why I think her idea of like a visual album was fantastic. And then to also see all the songs coming to life from one bigger story, which I think also too, a lot of that just goes back to storytelling and the art of doing that, which is really fun. Whether you&#8217;re telling your own story or you&#8217;re entrusted to share someone else&#8217;s story. I think there&#8217;s a lot of power and there&#8217;s a lot of connectiveness that comes in being able to kind of bring those words and those experiences to life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I think we&#8217;re also fortunate to be at a time where the technology is also accessible enough where you don&#8217;t necessarily have to have the huge studio and the crew and everything. I mean people are shooting great music videos on iPhones with gimbals, like the tech and the hardware, I should say, has gotten a lot more accessible for more people to really kind of get into it.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Right. Yeah, exactly. It is really cool to see how quickly things move every day. And I know people talk about that all the time, but really things move so fast and so it&#8217;s just like you&#8217;re just trying to ride away. I would say 15 seconds, but I feel like it&#8217;s less than that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It is now. I mean you&#8217;re starting to see artists that are like &#8230; Actually I read this article and I&#8217;m sort of plugging work here for a minute, but I read this article on Glimmer, which is my employer&#8217;s glitch, but we have a lifestyle publication called Glimmer and one of the recent articles is about how artists manipulates their songs and their DJ system makes sure that they&#8217;re getting like the maximum out of streams and everything like that. So it almost feels like the music is not in as much about expression as much as it is about just charting or getting numbers, reaching some like arbitrary success metric.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s good that you have the artists that are sort of outside of that, that are more interested in creating experiences. Like you mentioned Solange, you mentioned Beyonc√©, I think Janelle Mon√°e is like another artist that tries to do that. Like just tries to elevate what she&#8217;s doing past just a track or an EP. She wants to make it like an experience.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Exactly. It&#8217;s artists like that I really latch onto and I really respect them and their path because I think that that&#8217;s just like the definition of a true artist. Like you just legitimately want to make something for the sake of making it and expressing yourself. And I think that that&#8217;s so exciting. And also too, especially when you do a despite, maybe low views, may or may not help streams or whatever. I feel like in this day and age, if you&#8217;re really taking the time for music videos, a lot of times you&#8217;re just doing it out of artistry, which I respect. Especially really, really nicely well. Not just also like we&#8217;re just blowing this giant budget we have, getting this quarter of a million, million dollar budget. But outside of that we&#8217;re actually using it to actually sit down and craft a story. Those are the artists I respect the most.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you wish you would&#8217;ve been told about the advertising industry when you first started?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I wish I would&#8217;ve known how quickly things move. And how things, things as far as like projects almost do like making me here today and gone tomorrow. It&#8217;s such an interesting thing and it&#8217;s such an interesting career choice because you are investing yourself. So like creatively and kind of like emotionally a little bit and mentally can be very straining and physically you can be very tired. So you&#8217;re just putting in all this energy-</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Basically you can be very tired, so you&#8217;re just putting in all this energy, and then into a thing that&#8217;s not even necessarily always for certain. So projects can still fall through. [inaudible 00:39:12] can be like, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re not going to do this.&#8221; Or they can be like, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re going to hold this for later. Oh, well, we don&#8217;t have the resources to do that right now, so we&#8217;re going to go ahead and table it.&#8221; There&#8217;s just so many factors that go into everything and way more factors than I think that people realize.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Every time you see a really good commercial on TV now, I actually applaud it and I respect it because there are just so many factors that played into having great work get out there. So it&#8217;s just kind of hard. But that&#8217;s something I really respect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you make time for joy?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I make time for joy by, I think keeping to the things that I still want to do, regardless. I&#8217;ve learned that this job can be very stressful and there can be a lot of projected stress. It can be very rush, rush, rush, this, this, this. But I think what gives me joy at the end of the day, and when I go home and I go to sleep, is just my relationships with people and my friendships with people, and knowing how much those matter to me.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
So what brings me joy, I think, is doing whatever I can to maintain those, and to commit myself or be committed to still honoring the things that I still love to do on the side and actively making time for those things. So it can be kind of tough when you feel like you&#8217;re super swamped, and you have a lot of things going on, and a lot of projects, but I think it&#8217;s possible just with a little planning. A lot of things are possible with just like, &#8220;Okay, well let me move these things around so I can have some space.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
And I also too, I think what I&#8217;ve been realizing lately, is just sometimes it&#8217;s solitude and sometimes it&#8217;s also just taking a step back and just finding joy and peace in also replenishing yourself. I think a lot of times too, we weigh outcomes, we define ourselves by the outcomes of our project. A lot of times, a lot, a lot, a lot of times, it&#8217;s because something fell through. A lot of times it&#8217;s not our fault, it&#8217;s just external factors. So I think it&#8217;s important for me to also find your way into other things, that I feel like maybe I do find more control in and putting more of my, some of that same, maybe not more, but at least some of that same energy that I put into for work things, that I will still put in for things like my side project, or if I want to just have a, I call them paint parties. My paint parties, it&#8217;s just me painting on my floor by myself.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
So overall though, I really do think that there&#8217;s joy all around us. I think it&#8217;s just our &#8230; Sometimes it can kind of feel scheduled or kind of like a responsibility. But in living in a world where things are so crazy, and things do move around so fast, and things get rescheduled, and this, that, [inaudible 00:02:58], you&#8217;re trying to keep up with things, I just feel like, &#8220;Well, hey, if I have to schedule time for me to [inaudible 00:42:03].&#8221; And if I put on my calendar, &#8216;Go have fun&#8217; then that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do. But I find joy in my friends, and also, I find a lot of joy going to concerts too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I love seeing live music, so that&#8217;s something that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever get tired of, so I&#8217;m always at somebody&#8217;s concert. That&#8217;s something I plan to keep up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to somebody that wants to break into the ad industry today?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I would say, &#8220;Okay, cool. I&#8217;m glad that &#8230; I&#8217;m so happy that you&#8217;ve seen and considered this as an option.&#8221; I think that there are resources, and I think also too, it&#8217;s interesting now because I feel like the game is really changing as far as the way that recruiting is going. I think agencies, even Martin, is researching and finding new ways to recruit and find talent. It&#8217;s interesting, a lot of times it almost always felt like this secret almost. It&#8217;s just like, &#8220;How do you get into that? How do you do it?&#8221; But I think agencies are now trying harder to be more present, be more present at places like HBCUs, to go to more to a whole plethora of high schools and middle schools, to career fairs, which I&#8217;ve been to both and I&#8217;m helping with those efforts. Something that I&#8217;m also very passionate about.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
But I think that it&#8217;s definitely possible. I think if able, I think portfolio schools are a great, great, great in, a great in to the ad agency life. They really are a great pipeline to get in the door. But outside of that, just really tapping into those creative strengths, working on your craft and your skill, and then just feeling confident in concepting and coming up with ideas.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
But what&#8217;s lovely about ad agencies too, is what we tell everybody, is that there is usually a place for every type of person here, even if it&#8217;s not in creative. There&#8217;s usually some kind of space that everyone fits into. And so with that being said, I think it&#8217;s just so viable and it&#8217;s just, again, even if you&#8217;re not in [inaudible 00:44:10] department, I think there&#8217;s something to be said to be around so much creative energy and be in such a flexible environment. I really truly think, and I know a lot of people out there to feel the same way.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
But I feel like this is legitimately what I need. I feel like &#8230; I always tell people too, &#8220;In your heart of hearts, if you feel like you&#8217;re meant to do something, you might as well just start now because you&#8217;re going to end up doing it anyways because it&#8217;s not going to go away.&#8221; So, it&#8217;s just like, &#8220;All right, well if I&#8217;m able to start now, let&#8217;s just start now.&#8221; So yeah, but there&#8217;s a place literally for everyone and I think that&#8217;s what I love most about my job. Nobody, no two people, come from the same background or the same [inaudible 00:44:51]. It&#8217;s just different. But there&#8217;s all these different people but they all have a space, and so I think that that&#8217;s something to be said.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? Like it&#8217;s 2025, what kind of work are you doing or working on?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
2025, at that point I feel like there&#8217;s probably a good chance I&#8217;ll probably be either in New York or LA. I would be working on some really, really cool, potentially lifestyle-esque brands. Whether that be like a Target, or do an interesting media company, like a Refinery29, or potentially even maybe even trying out what it&#8217;s like to be an art director at a magazine company like Elle or Ebony or any of those. And am I able to still empower people there too?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I&#8217;m excited because I think by then my creativity will have branched out to something that&#8217;s still art direction, but I think might be a little different. And so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to figure out now, is what is it? I know I love creating, I know I love making things, but what are other ways I can also explore that too? And I also too, maybe I&#8217;ll have a side project by then that&#8217;ll just blow up, and then I can just be an entrepreneur for the rest of my life. You just never know and it&#8217;s just really exciting. But there&#8217;s so many opportunities to be creative but in different ways. So I&#8217;m excited to really explore those out in the next five years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
My portfolio, which I&#8217;m working on updating currently, my portfolio is ashleybozeman.com. So A-S-H-L-E-Y B-O-Z-E-M-A-N.com. And then my Instagram is @AshleyCierraa. So A-S-H-L-E-Y C-I-E-R-R-A-A. So those are the two places that I am the most, especially Instagram, but I&#8217;m usually always around.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I&#8217;m always down, I always answer almost every DM. Or if anybody who ever wants to chat or has any questions too about just getting started, that&#8217;s something I love to do. And I love to get people excited and just talk about it as a career. But I love to help out in any way that I can. I think that it&#8217;s so important to still reach back. And I know that I&#8217;ve only been doing this for two years, but if there&#8217;s some way I can help, I definitely will.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. All right, well Ashley Bozeman, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you really for sharing your story about what it&#8217;s like being a young black woman working in the advertising industry, and then also sharing the things that inspire you. We have people, I think really of all ages, that are listening to this show. We&#8217;ve got students, we&#8217;ve got captains of industry, et cetera, and we try to hit just a lot of different points of creativity and design and everything. So it&#8217;s always good to hear from the perspective of someone that&#8217;s, I wouldn&#8217;t say just starting out in it, but you&#8217;ve been in it for a while now.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah. But basically, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, but I mean to get the perspective of what is it like for you now at this stage? I mean, 2020 for all intents and purposes, is the future, in a lot of ways.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah, I know. It&#8217;s scary.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, and I mean it&#8217;s good to know that you&#8217;re at a position where you&#8217;re able to craft the images that a lot of people see when it comes to representation for a number of different brands and companies, et cetera. That&#8217;s a really big mantle to hold. So it sounds like definitely you have the creativity and the skills to make it happen, and I&#8217;m going to be really interested to see what you work on in the future. So thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Oh, my God. Thank you so much for having me. This has been fantastic. It was lovely to talk to you and yeah, just thank you so much for having me on this platform, and hopefully that this&#8217;ll help or inspire someone else.</p>
