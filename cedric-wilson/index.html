Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>Sometimes you cross paths with people, and you never know if or how you will reconnect in the future. I have wanted to have a sound designer on the podcast for <em>years</em>, and through a series of conversations, now I have one &#8212; one that I&#8217;ve worked with in the past! </p>
<p>Meet Cedric Wilson, lead producer at Lantigua Williams &#038; Co. We talk about some of Cedric&#8217;s most well-known audio projects, and he shared how he got into music theory in high school, which evolved into studying sound design and becoming a producer. Cedric also gives some basics on sound design, and shares why it&#8217;s such an important part of the world now. There are a lot of avenues for getting into sound design, and I&#8217;m glad Cedric is here to help introduce some of them to the Revision Path audience!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Hi, I&#8217;m Cedric Wilson. I am the lead producer at Lantigua Williams &#038; Co. What I mainly do is sound design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s the year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Lot of iPhone recordings. It&#8217;s been good. It&#8217;s been interesting. My current position actually was remote, and I started like a month right before the pandemic started. It&#8217;s been a wild ride for sure but a good year. Good year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I&#8217;m curious, how has it been working in audio since the pandemic started? You mentioned those iPhone recordings, but has it changed in any other ways?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I would say that a lot of the projects that we work on definitely have sort of expanded in geography. A lot of the projects we work on would be, &#8220;Okay everyone, come to the studio,&#8221; or, &#8220;Hey everyone, come to this one spot where we&#8217;re going to record.&#8221; Now, because everything has to be remote anyway, it&#8217;s given us a great opportunity to be like, &#8220;All right, let&#8217;s just record this person in LA,&#8221; that we wouldn&#8217;t have access to beforehand. So a lot more just open. Yeah. Open, I&#8217;ll say open.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I would imagine when you&#8217;re recording you&#8217;re doing all this digitally. I know for some shows, for some podcasts that I&#8217;ve talked to for example, some producers, it actually has been pretty easy to kind switch to a more mobile type of a platform in terms of recording and stuff and not having to be in a physical studio. They say it&#8217;s been a lot easier because you can record over Zoom, or you can do like you mentioned, record on an iPhone or something like that. Have you found that to be the case?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah. I was really nervous at first, because a lot of the stuff we were doing in person I&#8217;d be running around, putting microphones in people&#8217;s faces. I think the biggest thing I was worried about was that people can understand, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to take a selfie video,&#8221; and understand, &#8220;Okay, I have to be in the frame, and I have to have good lighting.&#8221; But I don&#8217;t think we have, culturally, that sort of same education around sound, so I was very, very nervous being like, &#8220;All right.&#8221; So for the remote recordings, the power is in your hands completely, so like, &#8220;Ahh!&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I think it&#8217;s definitely turned around. At first, it was a bit bumpy, but it&#8217;s worked out. Quite honestly, when all of this is eventually said and done, I think a lot of it&#8217;s going to stick.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I can see that being the case. Earlier this year, I actually recorded two podcasts, I produced two podcasts, and we did it&#8230; I mean, it was completely remote, but the main producer we worked in was in Los Angeles. I was in Atlanta, and then the host of the show was in Berlin. So we were working across like a huge timezone, and the majority of the guests were in Europe, so we were working across these timezones to try to get things working. There&#8217;s no way that would&#8217;ve been able to work if we had to do it in person. You know what I mean, it would&#8217;ve been impossible.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Lot of transatlantic flights on that one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s been great. Like I said, I was really nervous about it at first and was trying to build a system of like, &#8220;All right, let&#8217;s have this recording. Let&#8217;s have this backup so just in case something happens, we have this.&#8221; We still had weird things happen throughout the course of all of our productions, but it&#8217;s worked out, which is great. I guess it&#8217;s the staying power of audio.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Flexible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me about sort what a typical day has been for you recently. You mentioned being at Lantigua Williams &#038; Co. What&#8217;s a regular day for Cedric?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
So I started that right at the beginning of the pandemic, January of 2020. And it varies, some days are pretty mix heavy, where I&#8217;m still leading all the technical, audio engineer-y type of things on certain projects. Let&#8217;s see, sometimes I do just more listening and note-giving on a technical and production level for other projects. Way more emails than what I was doing when I was a freelancer. That was definitely an adjustment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Sort of like a lot of systems building, figuring out what tech needs we have as the year goes along and as things change. Moral support for producers on their projects, sort of workshopping and figuring out what sort of techniques they should be using or can use when they&#8217;re putting the pie together. So yeah, I would say about 50% of my day is hardcore in the Pro Tools sessions, making things sound good, and then the other 50% is just working with producers and other engineers and sound designers to make sure they have what they need to get their shows made.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is a big misconception around production like that, that you think most people just don&#8217;t know?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Mainly that it&#8217;s low-lift or easy. I always make the joke that making media and audio is not rocket science, but there is a certain skillset that you have to have, or should have, and I know it gets a little bit tricky because some of the tools can sort of be a barrier to creating the things we want to create, working with the people you want to with, but work goes into this kind of stuff. I usually say that as much time as people use and need in the video world probably is a comparable amount of time in the audio world too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s a good thing for people to note, sort of going back to that show, those two shows that I mentioned earlier. We would record maybe for about an hour or so, like for each episode, but then there&#8217;s so much time behind the scenes of listening back through it and editing and everything like that. Even then, the final result ended up being maybe like 10 or 15 minutes long.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yep.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That can happen sometimes. It&#8217;s not as simple as just sitting down, pressing record, and then that goes right out. Hopefully, there&#8217;s something, some level of finesse that you do to the audio.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One of the big projects that you&#8217;ve done over the past year is this audio series called Driving the Green Book. Can you talk to me about that?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah, so that was one of the first big projects that I got involved with as soon as I started the job. So yeah, I would go in and record our host, Alvin Hall, at Macmillan Studios. At Macmillan, like the publishing, and they had a little studio for us to record in. He and Juleyka did all the editing for all this tape that they gathered in the field, and so then it just all got to me. Parsed it all out, made the edits they wanted, and just put it all together, just a lot of cutting in Pro Tools and picking out the music. I wrote some original music for that one too, so that was definitely like a big project to start off with, but I&#8217;m really proud with how that one came out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When did that come out? That was some time last year, right?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah, it started publishing August, September.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s almost a year old now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, so it ran&#8230; Now that I&#8217;m thinking about what was going on at the time of year, it sort of ran concurrently with Lovecraft Country, that debuted on HBO.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Oh you know what, yeah I think so.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m guessing that wasn&#8217;t on purpose.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
No. No. Oh man, it was just funny, I didn&#8217;t watch the full season. I did watch the first few episodes. It wasn&#8217;t for me. Yeah, that&#8217;s kind of&#8230; They were going on around the same time. Geez. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, if you&#8217;ve seen it or any of the listeners have seen it, it&#8217;s on HBO Max, go check it out. They did get a second season, so you can watch the whole thing. There&#8217;s an element of it that sort of deals with&#8230; I think it sort of deals either with the actual Green Book or a Green-Book-like publication that one of the main characters is writing, and that sort of ends up being sort of the vehicle that moves the plot along, at least in the early part of the season.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah, now I&#8217;m thinking back on it, I remember one of the first conflicts that they got into was because they were out on the road super late in a sundown town, and I was like, &#8220;Oh yeah, that&#8217;s why the Green Book existed.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting, I mean, there&#8217;s sort of the case now where you&#8217;ll have these shows come out and then they also have a companion audio podcast or something that goes along with it. I think that&#8217;s both a blessing and a curse, in a way. I think it&#8217;s a blessing because sometimes, especially for more shall we say niche kind of shows, i.e. not for white people, but like more niche kind of shows. That sort of extra explanation that would come through a podcast can be helpful to understand the source material. But then I also feel like it&#8217;s too much. It&#8217;s too much. Let folks watch the show and gain their opinions about the show from the show. Like does the show need to also have a corresponding podcast and a syllabus and, &#8220;Oh yeah, read this before the next episode.&#8221; Then it becomes homework.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It feels like there&#8217;s a fine line to draw.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I think for TV, I feel similarly, where I just kind of like want to watch it and not critically think about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Sometimes, depending on what the show is. But then I think I love sitting down and watching mix breakdowns. A lot of my music production is hip-hop-based, and it&#8217;s sort of frowned upon, but when people break down the samples that people use and how they flip them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a little bit like sample snitching. It&#8217;s just something you don&#8217;t really do, but I enjoy it because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, cool, I would&#8217;ve never thought to break up a sample like that in that way.&#8221; So yeah, I&#8217;m kind of half-and-half on them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sample snitching. I&#8217;ve never heard of that, but as you&#8217;ve articulated it, that makes a lot of sense. I&#8217;ve started seeing some videos on TikTok where people do that.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like they&#8217;ll have a song, then they&#8217;ll sort of break it down and show how the sample ended up becoming a part of this more popular song.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
What was it, it was a Rihanna song&#8230; I can&#8217;t remember the song, but they broke down the&#8230; And I was like, &#8220;Oh my God, who would&#8217;ve thought of that? I would&#8217;ve never thought of that. That&#8217;s so cool.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Like just watch someone&#8217;s train of thought when they&#8217;re making music. I think it&#8217;s just so interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, I think you have to be listening to something almost in like a multidimensional sort of way to be able to pick and isolate that part and think, &#8220;Well, what if I change the tempo, or I change the pitch in how I could possibly use it in something else.&#8221; But a lot of older music, particularly from the &#8217;80s and before, is ripe for sampling, which of course is what a lot of people end up using it for. There&#8217;s this, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a fairly new genre, but I certainly discovered it fairly recently, but there&#8217;s this genre called future funk that is basically just re-sampled music from like the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s, but they&#8217;ve maybe changed the tempo or sped it up or they added a beat to it or something like that. It&#8217;s interesting, because it has that nostalgic sound, but it&#8217;s clearly been transformed into something completely new.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah, I love it. I mean, I think the art of sampling is just top-tier, honestly. Just even thinking about how it started, like with scratching and someone just accidentally did that, and people were like, &#8220;Oh wait, but what if you do this instead? What if you take that recording and make new music with it?&#8221; And it&#8217;s just an infinite amount of possibilities, I think it&#8217;s so cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Speaking of taking older stuff and kind of breathing new life into it, there&#8217;s a project that you did a few years ago called The Weeksville Project. You and I actually had first&#8230; Well, we &#8220;met,&#8221; I&#8217;m using air quotes here. We &#8220;met&#8221; through one of that shows producers, TK Dutes, who is a brilliant audio producer in New York City. She and I worked together at Glitch for a good little while. How did you-</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Keisha.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, how did you get involved with The Weeksville Project?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah, well, let&#8217;s see at that point I was already doing some stuff in the podcast space and actually already had met Keisha through, I&#8217;ll call my music mentor, Willie Green, Paul &#8220;Willie Green&#8221; Womack. And we met at the Audio Engineering Society Convention. I think it was 2015. I think, it was a while ago. So I met her through all the music stuff, and then once I started doing more podcasts and radio things, I was like, &#8220;Oh wait, TK does this stuff, let&#8217;s talk.&#8221; So she&#8217;s definitely been a mentor in that space for me. She knew that I was really interested in sort of expanding the work that I was doing and wanting to do more podcasts, radio things. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, you want to sound design this project for us,&#8221; and I was like, &#8220;Sure, why not? This sounds dope.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now that was also&#8230; I mean not like Driving the Green Book, but it was sort of a similar project that&#8217;s kind of talking about history, right? Like talking about the Weeks&#8230; I forget the name of the neighborhood, but it&#8217;s like right around, or what the old neighborhood of Brooklyn used to be. Is that what it is?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Right. So it used to&#8230; Oh man, I can&#8217;t remember the location where it exists now. But yeah, it was the first free black community in New York, and it existed in Brooklyn. Yeah, it was like a fictionalized version, so the writer&#8217;s elements are from history. Historical fiction, oh my God, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s called. And I actually never connected the two like that, but yeah, they both did have that historical element to it. That was kind of fun, too, because a lot of picking the music for it we&#8217;re like, &#8220;All right, what would exist during this time? What would a car sound like at this time?&#8221; But then also it wasn&#8217;t the type of project where it was like, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re in the past.&#8221; We wanted it to sound like it was actually happening, and it&#8217;s happening around you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
So yeah, that was a lot of fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to say that show came out right around the time there was another show. Bronzeville, that&#8217;s the name of it. There was a podcast called Bronzeville, and I think it was based off of fictionalized&#8230; Not a fictionalized, it was a fiction-based podcast, but it was based around, I think, a neighborhood in Chicago, if I&#8217;m not mistaken.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I&#8217;ll have to check that out. I had not heard of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s called Bronzeville, and it was all celebrity actors, Larenz Tate, Tika Sumpter was in it, Laurence Fishburne. Pretty good show, I think they only had two seasons, and then they kind of faded away. But I like those kind of period piece sort of shows, because I always love how they do the sound design, especially when they sort of switch to the radio and it has that old-timey radio voice that I love how with audio you can make subtle tweaks like that, and it kind of takes you&#8230; It mentally takes you back to a certain time like that.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, right now you&#8217;re the lead producer, as you mentioned earlier, at Lantigua Williams &#038; Co. But prior to that, how do you end up working on projects? Is it mostly like a word-of-mouth kind of thing?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Towards the end of me freelancing it was, but at first, it was just a lot of trying to figure out who needed things to get mixed and could I mix them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
At the time, so really what started it was working on The Nod. I was freelancing for Gimlet. I actually found out about that job through Twitter. I&#8217;m only laughing because I was supposed to be working at the time that I saw this tweet, but I was at my old campus job. They had a media production company, and I was like helping out with lectures and guest speakers, and I was like, &#8220;Oh great, no one recorded this correctly, now I have to fix this audio,&#8221; so that was the job that I had over the summer. I didn&#8217;t have a lot of hours, and I kind of was like, &#8220;I need to be making more money.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I just happened to stumble upon, it was James T. Green&#8217;s tweet, and it was like &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re looking for an engineer for this project for a podcast. Bonus points for any person that&#8217;s black and queer, this and that.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;All right, I fill a couple of those boxes, let me see. I&#8217;m an engineer. I&#8217;m black, let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
So I applied, or emailed. I emailed him and then was in touch with Gimlet&#8217;s head engineer to do a mix test, and it was very funny. I started the mix test for what would become The Nod, and then I was on a trip back&#8230; So I was taking a trip, and we were listening to For Colored Nerds. My partner was For Colored Nerds, and I was like, &#8220;Oh wait, I know these people, how do you know these people?&#8221; He was like, &#8220;Oh well, I listen to this podcast, I&#8217;m a big fan.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Oh.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Oh, that mix test that I&#8217;ve been talking about, this is actually their thing, so don&#8217;t tell anybody.&#8221; But that was really cool.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
And yeah, I think once after doing that show for two-and-a-half years, then I just started to meet people and gigs would&#8230; Not like role in, like I wasn&#8217;t turning people away. I was still pretty new to the industry, but that&#8217;s when I got to meet really great people and got to work on other really cool projects, like that&#8217;s how I met CC Paschal and I did a project with them in Endeavor, and Mass Appeal. Let&#8217;s see, I&#8217;m trying to think of what other&#8230; There was a lot of just small things I did for Gimlet while I was still freelancing for them. And yeah, it just was a lot of just getting out there and meeting people, different On Air Fests, podcast meets, people&#8217;s houses. Yeah, it just was a lot of just doing really good work and figuring out where the people were to be like, &#8220;Hey, do you need me to mix something?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. As you go from project to project in that way, do you find that they tend to be wholly different as you go to each one?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I would say so. I think people&#8217;s techniques sort of vary and sort of like where the engineer or sound designer or composer would sort of fit into the equation. So for a lot of projects, I was like the last person to touch the things, like the last line of defense to a really great sounding show. There were also certain instances of Nod or Weeksville where I was super involved a lot sooner, so that way I had a really good idea of what needed to be done and what direction I wanted to go into as the thing was being put together. So it was not, I don&#8217;t want to say projects that have the engineer come in at the end as an afterthought, but it is definitely a much different experience to be involved mid-production as opposed to like at the end.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Just to kind of switch gears here a little bit. We talked about, now, the work that you&#8217;re doing, but I&#8217;m curious to kind of learn about sort of like your origin story, like how you first got into all of this now. So you&#8217;re originally from New York City, right?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
No, I&#8217;m from Long Island, so close enough.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is Long Island not?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, look. Okay, I&#8217;m from the south. I&#8217;m from Alabama, so forgive my geography faux pas, because I was just fixing to be like, &#8220;Is Long Island not New York?&#8221; But that&#8217;s Staten Island, my bad. Sorry.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sorry, don&#8217;t kill me New York folks, don&#8217;t kill me.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Queens and Brooklyn do exist on the tip of the other end of Long Island, but it&#8217;s different and I grew up in Long Island proper. I do not ever claim that I was born in or grew up in the city. I just want to put that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Got you, got you. My bad. Sorry, sorry. So you grew up in Long Island?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Grew up on Long Island.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Grew up on Long Island.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Based here in New York, and what really got me into the sound stuff was music. I&#8217;m a saxophonist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
It was my first instrument. I started in fourth grade and stuck with it all the way up until college.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
And started learning music production through music theory in high school, so that was a new program that the school was piloting. Based on the zip code I was in, I had got afforded a really good education, and a really good music education with really great music educators, which I know is not the norm. Looking back at all that stuff now, it&#8217;s like something that I&#8217;m immensely lucky to have experienced and grateful for.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
But yeah, so like when they were piloting music theory in my high school, my teacher, Ed Schaefer shout-out, taught it through composition. That&#8217;s when I started learning how to use a DAW and this is how a microphone gets plugged in and all that stuff, so like we were producing music but then learning the terms of the music as we were making it. That&#8217;s probably what definitely got me started into all this. So I did that a lot of times in the lab after school, it was great. It was like my second home.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
And then that led to me going to Fredonia for their Sound Recording Technology program. It&#8217;s actually kind of funny, I was going to do music education for a very long time. I made the decision, I think it was senior year. Yeah, like before I stared applying, I was like, &#8220;You know what, actually I think I just want to do music production.&#8221; Not that I don&#8217;t like teaching. I love to teach, and it&#8217;s something that I still do. But I was like, &#8220;You know what, I want to make some music.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
So Fredonia was the school that I ended up going to for undergrad, and it was on the list because my high school teacher went there and was like, &#8220;Hey, you should go. They have a really great program for education.&#8221; And then when I swapped, it stayed on the list, because they had really good sound recording program, which actually I didn&#8217;t get in at first. Their program was like a music/science recording hybrid. You had to get into school academically, which was fine. You also had to get into the music program, and my audition was okay. I was a good musician in high school, but it&#8217;s like when you leave&#8230; Big fish, small pond kind of thing. You leave the pond, you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh wow, these people are GOOD good.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I remember, so the first day&#8230; Oh, I went to still try to get into an ensemble, because I was like, &#8220;All right, I&#8217;m not going to be able to start the sound recording program or the music program, I&#8217;ll try again in the spring, but I still want to play in an ensemble.&#8221; So I went through that process, and it was also a mess because I didn&#8217;t realize that you had to get material weeks ahead. That&#8217;s neither here nor there, that audition was terrible. But the saxophone professor knew who I was, and apparently a seat opened up in the studio on the very first day. So I get this email from him, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, so I remember you from the blah, blah, blah. Here&#8217;s the thing. We had a seat open up, do you still want to do the sound recording thing?&#8221; Because I learned later that I got into the sound recording program fine, it was that my music audition wasn&#8217;t good enough to get in.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I was like, &#8220;Oh, well, yes.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Go email this person and run around and do all these things and figure it out, because I&#8217;m not going to help you do that.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s fine.&#8221; So yeah, it was a hectic first day of class.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds like it.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Ten hours away from home. But yeah, so I did that for four years. It was a really cool program. Got to work on musicianship skills and learned how to record, mix and edit, all that kind of stuff. And then I left spring of 2015.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Went back home and was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to do.&#8221; At that point, I already had met my music mentor and was coming in and assisting on sessions, just watching him work, but it just was hard. It was just going back-and-forth from his place in Brooklyn to my place in Long Island. And then I was like, &#8220;Well, I kind of want to get down to the city. How am I going to do it?&#8221; I still don&#8217;t know if this was the right choice, but I was like, &#8220;All right, I guess it&#8217;s time for grad school.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I decided, I was like, &#8220;Well, I could go continue and do more of what I&#8217;ve been doing in music,&#8221; and I was like, &#8220;Nah.&#8221; Not that I was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m great at what I do. I&#8217;m the best,&#8221; but I just was like, &#8220;I kind of want to learn a couple of different other applications for sound or get into something new.&#8221; So then I stumbled on the New School&#8217;s Media Studies program. It was like, &#8220;Cool, I can work on sound, and they have like a really cool film program.&#8221; I was really interested, at the time, in making documentary stuff.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
So I started that program, and I remember there was a media design course where they walked you through all the different things that you could do in the program, so it was like video, sound, graphic design, all of that kind of stuff. It was like a sample course, and at the end of the semester, we had to make an EPK for an artist. We had the artist in, and all the video people are hovering over a camera talking about apertures and lighting and this, that and the third. I&#8217;m sitting here like, &#8220;Oh man, no.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;But I can put that microphone in the right spot and make sure that this guy&#8217;s going to sound real crispy.&#8221; At that point, I was like, &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s so many other things I could do with sound instead.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
So for a long time, it was a lot of video work, helping on friends&#8217; films, doing stuff like that for the school, and just took more classes in that vein instead of doing video stuff, and that&#8217;s how I started really learning about, &#8220;Okay, this is what sound design is, and this is what sound designers do. This is how music gets incorporated into things like this.&#8221; I took a very beginner radio course, too, and learned a bit about that world specifically. But yeah, so it was a lot of just being like, &#8220;Look, I need to work, and I want to get out of my house.&#8221; So I had to figure it out, what other things are people doing in sound, and it worked out I guess. But you know, that&#8217;s how I got to here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, it sounds like you just sort of had this momentum that just kept going, and you just kept along with it. I mean, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m sort of getting from your story here is that it was sort of one thing. You went to SUNY Fredonia, and then you&#8230; Did you have some audio jobs between there and going to grad school?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Just with my mentor. I would come home from breaks, or be home for the summer, and just help out with either sessions, like recording sessions, or building mix sessions for him, watching him work. That was really the main thing. I got really plugged into the indie, pop scene down in Brooklyn for a while. I mean, just doing music has sort of always been the connective tissue between everything that I&#8217;ve done. Yeah, it actually wasn&#8217;t all audio either. I mean, in that six to nine months that I was home, I was also working at Forever 21 for a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
And then I got an internship through a friend of mine from the same Fredonia program that was a manager at a post house in Manhattan, Big Yellow Duck. Interned there for a while, and then it eventually turned into a job that I started&#8230; It turned into a job that eventually conflicted with school, so I ended up&#8230; That post house was the first place I was like, &#8220;Okay, this is what sound designers do.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
They were doing a lot of stuff for animated projects, and I was like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; When I was doing that job, it was like a lot of studio management, but then it was like, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re working on this show, can you put all the footsteps in for this cartoon?&#8221; So yeah, someone has to like-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So kind of like some Foley work, too, it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah, a lot of Foley work. It was really cool. One of the shows that, while I was there, they were working on was Doc McStuffins, so the lead engineer over there would just have a three, four, five crates of toys to add the sounds in. It was really cool to watch him work. It was dope.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice, nice. Why is sound design important? And I&#8217;m asking this because I&#8217;m assuming that we have, for people that are listening to this show, a large amount of visual designers, probably coders or technologists, et cetera. Why is sound design an important thing to know?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s important because when the sound is off, you know it. You might not know why, or you might even watch something and be like, &#8220;Wow, something&#8217;s off,&#8221; and might not even realize that it is the sound. But it just carries the whole&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say carries everything. That&#8217;s a little grandiose. But if you have this amazing film, and it&#8217;s shot so beautifully and the actors are doing their thing and everything&#8217;s great, but it sounds like garbage, you&#8217;re going to know. You&#8217;re going to be like, &#8220;Oh wow, something was not great about that.&#8221; And I think that permeates so much of what we interact with, be it like film, video games, YouTube videos, all kinds of stuff. It&#8217;s literally everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I tell people that will tell me or they&#8217;ll tell other people how they&#8217;re not creative, for example, or they don&#8217;t have any sort of design language or whatever. I tell folks that everything that we&#8217;ve been using since birth has passed through some lens of design, and so because of that we may have intrinsic knowledge about what good design and bad design is. We may not always be able to articulate it, and I feel like sound design kind of fills that gap a little bit, because we tend to associate sounds with memories, sounds with objects, sounds with other types of things, so being able to design something with sound to elicit that response. I feel like that&#8217;s a powerful bit of sorcery to be able to do something like that.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
It is. I&#8217;m only laughing because you said the word sorcery. I get called a magician all the time. But yeah, I mean doing a little bit of like even studying sound art or just those certain projects that just hit you. You&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Wow.&#8221; Sound is a really powerful medium, almost taps into a base part of the human brain, or something, to me. It&#8217;s just like when something gives you goosebumps, but you don&#8217;t know why, it&#8217;s because it just is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s so cool. It&#8217;s really cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What specifically do you enjoy about sound design? Like I know you&#8217;re kind of working as a producer now, but you still do sound design on the side.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah, I would say I like the challenge of sort of figuring out how to really immerse someone in something. Because sometimes it&#8217;s like not apparent or easy to figure that out, and it can be a real challenge to be like, &#8220;Wait, something is off, but what is it?&#8221; I remember for The Nod, they did an episode for a homegoing for Madea, so we made it sound like it was in a church the whole time. I mixed it, and we did a first pass, and I was like, &#8220;There&#8217;s something off, and I can&#8217;t figure it out.&#8221; People were like, &#8220;Yeah, everyone kind of sounds almost empty or they&#8217;re speaking ghost-ish.&#8221; I put all this reverb and things like that to make it sound like they&#8217;re in this big church space, but something was just off.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
And so I finally sat down with the head engineer, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I can&#8217;t figure this one out.&#8221; And so we&#8217;re going back-and-forth, and he just&#8230; We had like this church room tone recording just playing underneath the whole thing, and he turns it up, like way up. And I was like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s it.&#8221; That&#8217;s it, it just needed more of that room tone recording.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
It was just like, &#8220;Oh yeah, duh.&#8221; I don&#8217;t make that mistake anymore, but I couldn&#8217;t figure it out at first, I was like, &#8220;Oh.&#8221; So I like that, I like that sort of like, &#8220;Here&#8217;s this weird thing we&#8217;re going to do,&#8221; or, &#8220;Here&#8217;s just this thing we&#8217;re going to do, how do we best convey it in sound?&#8221; Just the challenge of figuring that kind of stuff out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I was thinking of a show&#8230; What&#8217;s a show that I heard recently that had really good sound design? Two shows, actually, one is a bit of a shameless plug, because I&#8230; I didn&#8217;t help work on it, but I did greenlight the idea initially when we worked at Glitch, but there was this speculative fiction podcast called Open World that has really great, phenomenal sound design. And there&#8217;s another show, it&#8217;s actually a historical kind of a documentary series, but it&#8217;s called In Vogue, like the magazine, I-N-V-O-G-U-E, the 1990s. It&#8217;s talking about basically fashion in the &#8217;90s and all that sort of stuff. They get the &#8217;90s so right. I would imagine it&#8217;s because they have access to the licenses for music and stuff, but they&#8217;ve got the music down and the sounds, and it&#8217;s so immersive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And also, I think part of it, when we talk about sound design, we talk about the created sound, but the other part of it is the authenticity of the host. So like, for this particular podcast, they have this sort of like haggard British guy named Hamish Bowles, who&#8217;s a well-known fashion stylist. And so his sort of kind of posh British accent kind of lends credence to that time. It all sort of flows together very well. I have to actually give it to a lot of limited edition&#8230; Not limited edition, but limited series podcasts. They do such a great job with sound design.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
They really do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s some others. There&#8217;s Anime in America from Crunchyroll, did a great job with it. There&#8217;s a series on Freaknik that did a really great job with sound design and just like encapsulating that time period or that moment with sound. That&#8217;s a really sort of powerful thing, because sound is&#8230; We talk about, or I&#8217;ve heard the notion about how things can&#8217;t be created or destroyed, but sound is literally something that we can make ourselves, and to be able to manipulate that sound and use that sound to bring about memories or immerse someone in a particular time period. I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s really powerful. That sort of is what interests me about sound design, is how you&#8217;re able to kind of do that sort of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s great. If I had to guess why I love it so much, I could&#8217;ve just stayed in music, but I think there&#8217;s just something about just getting the right waves to come out of the right speaker at the right time that just does something. I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s just endlessly fascinating and cool to work with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;m curious were you in marching band in high school?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I hated marching band.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Really?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Why did you hate it?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I was the type of music kid to like&#8230; I wanted to be in the ensemble room, air-conditioned.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Ah, okay.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Making music that way. I had a lot of fun in marching band, don&#8217;t get me wrong. I just never really&#8230; It just wasn&#8217;t for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was bringing up marching band largely because of talking about sort of timing and everything. Like I was in marching band in high school too, and I played trombone. I had the opportunity through my&#8230; And I have to give it to my band director in high school, shout-out to Mr. McDonald, who like really introduced me to a lot of &#8217;70s music that I didn&#8217;t know about, that I might&#8217;ve heard, like I might&#8217;ve heard my parents playing it or something like that, or heard my grandmother playing it or something.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But once I joined the marching band, he was a big Earth, Wind and Fire fan. And so I got immersed, really, in like a lot of their discography, because we would arrange that music and end up playing it on the field. That&#8217;s sort of how I sort of taught myself piano, at least I know my way around a piano. I&#8217;m not a virtuoso by any means, but I know my way around a piano to listen to something and arrange it for different instruments. I learned that in marching band, that we take that out and take it onto the field.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, would they always be perfect, one-to-one, note-for-note transpositions? Not in the slightest, especially when we tried to remix popular music. God. If I never hear Montell Jordan&#8217;s This is How We Do It ever again in life, I will be perfectly fine, because we played that song to death in marching band. It wasn&#8217;t even a great transposition either, or a great arrangement I should say. But then we&#8217;d get some of those&#8230; And I think the reason that we used Earth, Wind and Fire was because they had their band kind of mapped over to what you would have in a marching band. It has a strong brass section, and you could take the vocals and use that with woodwinds, or something like that, so it made sense in that way.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I loved Earth, Wind and Fire. Oh my God. I remember, my dad&#8230; When I was young, I was big on taking the CDs and getting them on the computer or the iPod and burning them. I&#8217;d be like, &#8220;All right, I have to burn them. I have to burn them with these settings and this is the best.&#8221; And I remember it was like this huge three-CD collection of all of Earth, Wind and Fire.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I had that. It was like this tall, brown like with Egyptian.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I got that for my 16th birthday. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Oh, man. So I used to listen to that all the time. Oh, man. Whew. Yeah no, that kind of stuff, my dad loves Earth, Wind and Fire. He was like the Motown, that kind of stuff, the funk, the soul, R&#038;B. And then my mom was like the Anita Baker, Rachelle Ferrell, India Arie person.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Actually, no, it&#8217;s funny. They definitely instilled a love of music, and I remember it was&#8230; I actually don&#8217;t remember which song it was, but it was off India Arie&#8217;s, I think, second&#8230; One of hers, the second album?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t remember, but I remember like that deciding to be like, &#8220;Oh, okay, I think I want to make music with my life.&#8221; In making that decision, I remember she was just playing one of her CDs in the car, and I was listening to one of the songs and I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m going to make some music.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Oh yeah, it was always stuff playing in the house. Not on Sundays, when it was time to clean, it was always music playing in the house.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s so funny. This was years ago, but I had her graphic designer on the show, India Arie&#8217;s graphic designer.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Denise Francis. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
That&#8217;s dope.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. The one that I remember distinctly that we would play from Earth, Wind and Fire is Star, because it had a solo at the beginning, and it would be a trombone solo that I would write in for myself, naturally. But it would have a solo in the beginning, and then like once it broke out into the verse, it was very easy for marching, because it was like, &#8220;Dun dun, dun dun, dun dun dun-dun-dun!&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so we would play like a mix&#8230; I&#8217;ll say it like this, on the field, we would play a mix of like oldies and then stuff that&#8217;s on the radio. So like we would play My Boo, this is &#8217;96, I&#8217;m old. We would play that on the field and get people hype, but then like when you were in stands and you were in your sections, your sections could do whatever you wanted to, as long as you were the section leader. And so I was the section leader for the trombones, and my nerdy, video game-playing ass had taught my section how to play the winning battle fanfare from Final Fantasy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So when the team would score a touchdown, you&#8217;d hear, &#8220;Bum-bum-bum-bum, bum bum, bum-bum-bum! Dun dun dun, dun-dun, dun-dun, dun-dun!&#8221; And people thought it was just like some John Philip Sousa, all-American kind of fanfare thing. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No, no.&#8221; Listen, because I played Final Fantasy Two to death, Final Fantasy Four in Japan, but I recorded that and then I had a keyboard at home, and I would translate&#8230; Yeah, that&#8217;s what I would do. I would do dirty shit like that. I can&#8217;t imagine songs now, like modern songs, being done&#8230; I mean, not to say that it&#8217;s not done, because marching bands do it, but I don&#8217;t know if today&#8217;s music lends to that level of instrumentality.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think the latest song that I heard that actually think would do really good in a marching band is Silk Sonic&#8217;s Leave the Door Open.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Actually, Anderson .Paak is where my mind first went.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Just generally, but yeah, ooh that&#8217;s a good&#8230; What are the kids playing in marching band these days? That&#8217;s a good question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know, because I can&#8217;t imagine any of this mumble rap stuff going over well on the field. &#8220;Nana, nana, nanananananana.&#8221; I can&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t know what that would sound like, probably would sound like a swarm of bees or something. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Some of that stuff hits, I&#8217;m sure the drummers really enjoy that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s honestly probably the stuff that has old school samples in it.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Probably. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So like, what&#8217;s the difference between a sound designer and an audio engineer, like in your eyes? Is there a difference between those two?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
There is. I think you&#8217;ll probably get a different answer from different people, but for me, I would say an audio engineer is someone who is just doing the technical stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Like record this well, clean this up, put this thing here. Even to like a certain extent, editing, for quality not necessarily for content. And I would say a sound designer is someone who may or may not have those technical skills. I always try to say that you don&#8217;t have to get into sound design through engineering. There are a lot of great people who came in as &#8220;producers,&#8221; quote-unquote, and just do really great sound design. But I would say a sound designer is someone who is able to make those creative choices and say, &#8220;Okay, we want this to sound like it&#8217;s in a church or in a cave or in space or wherever,&#8221; and then has the tools at their disposal to make that happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So one kind of is more creative, and the other&#8217;s more technical, I guess, just kind of broadly saying.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah, super broadly, because I&#8217;ve definitely seen some engineers, especially in the music world, who can just mix their butts off and do things that I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Why in God&#8217;s name would you ever think to do something like that?&#8221; But it sounds amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s like that thing where at any job, when you&#8217;re at a really high level, is creative. But yeah, I would say the distinction there is I would say more technical to like more production-y.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then I&#8217;d imagine there&#8217;s probably even&#8230; Well, I know for a fact that there&#8217;s business/branding elements that go to it, because you did some sound design work back when both TK and I worked at Glitch, you came on and worked as a sound designer for a project that we had, where you sort of made an audio jingle, or like an audio brand, for the company.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah, I think they&#8217;re called audio identities.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, audio identity. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah, that was really cool. That was the first time I did something like that, because TK was like, &#8220;Hey, we have this thing, can you do this?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yeah, sure.&#8221; So I did some research, and then listened to all the episodes of Twenty Thousand Hertz that dealt with the specific topic, and I was like, &#8220;All right, let&#8217;s go make some audio IDs.&#8221; Yeah, that was super fun. That was cool. I mean, that one was cool because the way that I just had to do it was I came at the group with three very different ideas for it. I sat down with everyone and was like, &#8220;This is what I think you all want, here&#8217;s what I think my interpretation would be, like if I were to personally do it, this is how I would do it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
And then I did one that was really abstract and just weird, because you&#8217;ve got to have one like that just to be like, &#8220;Maybe there&#8217;s something there, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; And yeah, that was a really cool process, just kind of like going back and forth and figuring out, &#8220;Okay, this is the sound that we want, and how do we get to work?&#8221; There was like a visual element that it needed to sync up with too. Yeah, that was a lot of fun, and definitely was the first time I ever did it. I think it worked out well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I would say for people that probably&#8230; I think a lot of folks have heard audio identities but may not necessarily really know what it is, but like just to kind of give a broad example. For when you watch a new movie on Netflix, and you hear that sort of opening, &#8220;Dun dun!&#8221; Or Intel has &#8220;Bum bum, bum bum!&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Or something like that. Those little types of, I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re called, like zingers or whatever. I&#8217;m just making up words, but those little audio blurbs can often be indicative of an entire brand, and what I think we&#8217;re starting to see now is a lot more companies are leaning into that, with the advent of smart speakers and things of that nature, you&#8217;re starting to hear a lot more audio identities. One that surprised me recently was YouTube.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
They have one now?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
YouTube is completely visual, but YouTube has an audio identity if you&#8217;re watching&#8230; If I cast YouTube to television, or like if I watch YouTube on Apple TV or Chromecast TV or something, there&#8217;s like an opening whoosh sound or something with YouTube, like it goes, &#8220;Shhhhwuummm, shwum!&#8221; Like it&#8217;s new, and I just recently started paying attention to it. I would imagine it&#8217;s probably to get people&#8217;s attention if they&#8217;re not looking at the screen, but it also is to just sort of signify like, &#8220;Hey, if you&#8217;re across the room and you hear this, you already know exactly what it is.&#8221; Like when you hear the Netflix sound, you know that&#8217;s Netflix. Or like if you hear a certain app or something chime or chirp, you know that&#8217;s that app, because the app has a specific sound to it or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a lot more tech companies and design companies, or at least design-focused tech companies, that are leaning into audio identities as ways to kind of brand themselves, which I think is pretty cool.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, it&#8217;s a powerful, powerful tool. I get it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, as I sort of alluded to earlier, I&#8217;m pretty sure most of our audience are probably visual designers in practice, or they&#8217;re software designers or something like that. What would you tell someone that wants to know about sound design, like what should they know when it comes to sound design?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I would say it&#8217;s bigger than you think it is. So like when I was doing a lot of the indie film stuff in school, and would work with filmmakers, people just didn&#8217;t fully know how much goes into it. If you&#8217;re making something that&#8217;s like a huge budget, I don&#8217;t think people realize the actors don&#8217;t just say their lines on set, or in front of a green screen. They go back into a studio afterwards and dub everything afterwards.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
But you know, depending on the budget, not everyone can do that. But it just is to say that the work that goes into the sound is about the same that you&#8217;ll have to put into a visual thing, so like if you have the means, a really good friend, or the budget, get you a sound person. Get you someone who can really do that work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are there certain resources or tools that you would recommend for someone that wants to get into sound design, like they&#8217;ve listened to this episode, they think this is cool, this is something that I want to maybe pick up as a skill or something like that. What resources would you recommend?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I would say YouTube is your best friend. I learned probably too many things on that site, which is a little annoying to say to someone that also went to grad school. There are so many people just doing the work of just being like, &#8220;Hey, this is what we do, and this is how it works.&#8221; It&#8217;s always been a great resource. A lot of plugin companies are now also really into the content creation game. So like usually like with waves&#8230; If you find the good tools, usually there&#8217;s good videos and things like that to go along with it. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. What haven&#8217;t you done yet that you want to do?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I would love to start getting into the more experimental stuff. I would love to do more fiction stuff. I think for a while I was afraid of fiction, just because I knew how much work needs to go into it, just like time-wise. And maybe some of the first sound design experiences I had&#8230; Not scared me off from it, but I just was like, &#8220;Uh, how do people actually do this all the time for work?&#8221; But I would love to do that kind of stuff more. I guess get less into the literal space and more in the metaphoric stuff and how does this weird sound or experience or whatever represent something, as opposed to this quote-unquote &#8220;interview.&#8221; I&#8217;m not trying to place a value judgment on narrative audio and things like that, but I would love to start getting into making more weirder things and just figuring out what, I guess, being an artist might look like more in the sound design realm. I know who I am as an artist from music, but for sound design it&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Oh, what do I really want to be making here?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I&#8217;m just like sort of figuring that kind of stuff out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I&#8217;d say to that end, where do you see yourself in the next five years or so? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I would love to be doing more things in collaboration with musicians and things like that. Song Exploder is a huge inspiration for me. I absolutely love that podcast, like listening to shows like Twenty Thousand Hertz is amazing, and even podcasts that are narrative but use music in really interesting ways.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like Dissect?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Like Dissect. I need to listen to the new season of Mogul. They&#8217;re doing a season on chopped and screwed.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I mean, there&#8217;s so much really, really cool storytelling that can happen just around the realm of sound, and not just because you can use sound in cool ways, but just because it&#8217;s also just genuinely interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
But yeah, it&#8217;s just like more immersion, more risk-taking, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, just to wrap things up here, Cedric, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
You can find out more about me on my website is probably the best spot, cedricwilsonmedia.com. I am also on Twitter, @cedricwilson64, but I will give the warning that I don&#8217;t tweet very often. But like, if anyone ever had a question, you can feel free to hit up the DMs, but I&#8217;m not a big social media person. I&#8217;m sorry for that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, no. Hey look, you&#8217;re in the studio, you&#8217;re mixing audio and stuff. That makes sense, I get it. I get it.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I host a gaming podcast. I really love video games. We should talk more about video games after this, but I do that. It&#8217;s called Gamer Friends. You can find that on any podcast platform.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was about to say, you work a podcast and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;I have a podcast, it&#8217;s on&#8230; Oh man, I can&#8217;t think of the name.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
I just can&#8217;t remember the&#8230; I think the phrase that I like is whatever platform you&#8217;re listening to this on, you can find it there as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
But you know, I&#8217;m not behind the mic that often.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s all good. It&#8217;s all good. Cedric Wilson, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you for really kind of demystifying sound design, not just for me, but I think for the audience as well. Being able to hear is one of our five vital senses. And as designers, of course, we look at visual things, we touch things, so the work that we do is mostly around those two senses. But sound is something I think, for those of us that have hearing, we sort of take it for granted in terms of how important it is and how useful it is. And so, it&#8217;s good to have someone on the show to talk about how they got into sound design, how it&#8217;s important, and you&#8217;ve been able to use it to be a creative person. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Cedric Wilson:</b><br>
Yeah, thank you so much for having me. This was great. I had a very good time.</p>
