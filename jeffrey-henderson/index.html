Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>Being confident with your creativity will take you far as a designer, and this week&#8217;s guest is a perfect example of that. Jeffrey Henderson is the founder of <a href="https://andthem.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">AndThem</a>, an NYC-based creative collective that focuses on building creativity and business within Black and brown communities.</p>
<p>We started off talking about plans for the summer, and then Jeffrey spoke about his innovative agency model and how he uses it to help give back to the next generation of creatives. We also talked about his 15+ year career as a footwear designer for Nike, Yeezy, and Cole Haan, and how he brings that knowledge to his current work with creating his own footwear designs. Thank you Jeffrey for being a shining example of what it means to use your talent to bring the world to your feet &#8212; literally!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m Jeffrey Alan Henderson I&#8217;m a creative based in Harlem, New York, team of about 10. We take on, everything from product design to content creation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s the year been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Oh, the year&#8217;s actually been pretty good. And we actually had a nice growth year. Not in terms of state business, business has always been pretty standard even when we went through trials and tribulations of COVID. But I think I brought in some young folks for the first time and made it official kind of last year. And so we had some growing pains in terms of people just learning how to be creatives in sort of corporate settings and non corporate setting. That was very new to a lot of us. And having an agency built like that this year has been a, I think, an extension of that. But now that everything&#8217;s opening, the team is definitely more seasoned, so a lot more exciting because of the things I know we can take on. So it&#8217;s been pretty good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m pretty sure people listening can hear the birds in the background. So, it sounds like you&#8217;re hit like some idealist spot right now, which is good, which is good. I think after the year. After, after the year, I think all of us have had a little bit of a mother nature&#8217;s is gladly welcome at this point. Do you have any plans for the summer with the agency?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Oh, this summer where we&#8217;re trying to get back together during, I guess January of this year, we had pretty much all 10 folks in Harlem, essentially, about five of them stayed in, we have a studio here and apartment that we actually rent out as an Airbnb, but when we don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s actually our studio. So everybody was sort of working together. And that was, I guess, when the world was still kind of closed. And so we&#8217;re going to try to do a little bit out of that again, since we can&#8217;t really travel to the places we need to travel to get work done, we&#8217;re going to just come back to New York, settle down and keep growing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now with And Them and sort of the changes that have happened over the past year. I mean, you said business has been pretty steady, and I know that you do a number of different services. Can you just talk a little bit about what And Them is and how did you come up with the name And Them?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And Them comes from when I was a Nike employee in Japan. I had a lot of free time in the mornings where I would have to work with the team that was in the U S. And so during those phone calls every now and again, I&#8217;d have an hour in between and there was a creative by the name of Kevin Carroll who&#8217;d just left Nike, he&#8217;d written a book, Rules of the Red Rubber Ball. So he became sort of internet famous at that point, hired a team, he had about six people doing everything from PR to creative, strategy. He had been working with them for about three, four months and it just wasn&#8217;t clicking. He ended up calling, I think, myself, Jason Mayden who&#8217;s now at Fear of God Athletics, D&#8217;Wayne Edwards who runs PENSOLE. And he&#8217;s like can you like, just sit on these meetings and help me out, but I don&#8217;t want to threaten my team. He started introducing us as you know, was just Jeff and him. It was just D&#8217;Wayne and him kind of nonchalantly. And so the joke was, we just became an them like this [inaudible 00:06:00].</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
I just kept it. Kept the name because it also represented the fact that when we work with, whether it&#8217;s Yeezy or FC Harlem or local restaurant around the corner, we&#8217;re not trying to showcase our brand we&#8217;re trying to showcase your brand. We were doing something with Revision Path, it would be Revision Path and them. It&#8217;s just us trying to help out folks who sort of need, I think, a boost. I live right down the street from Harlem Hospital so there&#8217;s always a siren now and then.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
In the last year we definitely picked things up because what really happened was this is probably three years ago now I was working on a project, launching Everlane&#8217;s new footwear line that they put out the tread. And while I&#8217;m working on it, Michael Price with the CEO, he keep asking me like, how do you do X, Y, Z?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And I&#8217;d be like, oh, you just call this person. And it&#8217;s like, I just saw him asking questions. And he kept looking at me like you have all these people, why don&#8217;t you set up an agency? And I was like, yeah, nah, that&#8217;s too much responsibility. Like I did all that. Like at Nike you have a report. Like it was all just too much. But a year later it was like, okay, all these people who, and it sort of came by, honestly, in that people who were working on teams individually, when I got there, they just sort of were like, yo, can I do a project with you , you have anymore? So I just kind of brought them with me. So they kind of became my and them. So I just, if we want to call it, I&#8217;d be like, yo, why don&#8217;t you sit on this call and won&#8217;t you take this and if there&#8217;s money left on the table, we&#8217;ll split it. So that&#8217;s sort of just evolved to the fact that I just had a few really talented young folk who probably weren&#8217;t either seasoned in corporate or had already tried corporate and was like some just wasn&#8217;t feeling right about it so they were like, I&#8217;d rather hang out with you, work on projects. So I became normal. So we&#8217;ll be doing a lot of product design and graphic design. And then one of my best friends, creative director, who he taught himself to be sort of art director holding the camera. He was doing, working at a not-for-profit basically counseling kids and got a camera. And we were coaching his basketball team together and he said, you know, my dream is I want to shoot the NBA in the Olympics. And he&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s my longterm dream. That&#8217;s what, that&#8217;s what I want to do in life. Three years later, he ended up doing that. Like, it was all sort of like this whirlwind of like, he worked for the Nyx, he shot for FIBA in Brazil, the Olympic basketball games, like, oh, I should&#8217;ve made my dream a little bigger than that. And so he sort of come on with his team. So all together, we tackle soup to nuts, anything from product creation, manufacturing to content creation. So that&#8217;s kind of where we are and what we do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like it all kind of came together pretty easily. I mean, since you had already this network of people and you had creatives that were drawn to you because of your work, it sounds like it didn&#8217;t take much to kind of build a team.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
I think it really goes back to one of the things that happened In my old Nike days, it was very much this thought of you kind of were put on a track or plan to be a design manager or design director. A lot of times people would be put in design manager roles so they could kind of learn the procedures, the processes, the operations part, so that when they became a design director, they at least know what those things were as we started looking at bigger picture in terms of product creation. So I kind of took a big tune to what the operation side was. I was, I think, I learned from some really great people who just knew how to grow and manage people because I needed a lot of that because I was literally making up as I went, I didn&#8217;t have a design degree. So anybody who could help me, I was in their office, left and, trying to figure out how I screwed up. I just took those lessons and while I was working on the creative side, building all those other kind of tools and components taught me how to get the most out of people and how to help them get the most out of themselves. When I ended up in random spots, I wasn&#8217;t just worried about is the color right, is the engineering proper is the functionality working, is the design modern. It was also how you doing as a person? Are you doing the right thing? And so it really like became, I didn&#8217;t realize it was that obvious until this young woman, Lauren Divine who&#8217;s great material designers, [inaudible 00:10:18] This is probably the early days we were over in some broken down office building And I was probably in and out of LA for maybe a year and then one day, I guess I didn&#8217;t show up for three months cause I was either doing something else I didn&#8217;t didn&#8217;t need to be there and I got there, she came and gave me a big hug and she&#8217;s like, finally, you&#8217;re back our manager I was like, your what? I was over here, drawing shoes what do you mean? She&#8217;s like, no, no, no, we need like this set up and this meeting organized and this, that and the other, and this is what you do. I was like, okay, honestly, didn&#8217;t sign up for that, but the reality was I did sign up for that. I mean, I just became a mentor to a few people who just sort of needed the ins and outs every now and again, it wasn&#8217;t like I was their manager manager, but I was, I don&#8217;t know, helpful in helping them get things straight when they needed it.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Especially if you weren&#8217;t in a traditional corporate environment where people were set to be your manager or mentor. So that sort of turned into an easier way to then run this sort of organization that we just pick projects and started out really me just no one, some people who were like, yo, you want to do this project? Yeah, I got nothing better to do, but I mean, it&#8217;s real. Like I ended up falling in love with things that I know nothing about just because it&#8217;s different. Like we have a project now with a friend of mine, she&#8217;s CEO at this wellness brand, wellness and beauty called ASA there and it&#8217;s all about circularity, sustainability and reality is like, I walked to the conversation, going to look, I&#8217;m not like a big sustainability dude, that&#8217;s not my thing thing. I kind of know about it and I&#8217;m more interested in it because I have learned over the last, I think two years, how much it affects black and brown communities first.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And so I have a little bit of interest in it, but I can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s like, I wake up everyday like, oh, I care about this. But ever since being in this project, like now I&#8217;m like forced to like, oh, this is real and I&#8217;m going to the grocery store I see tons of plastic and I&#8217;m like, oh, how do I fix, how do I help? How do I like live here to these compensations? So it just becomes a, I don&#8217;t know, we find ourselves in new conversations that are helpful because I think it&#8217;s, it helps us to become creative, but it also lends we have a skillset that we were using somewhere else that now we can apply it to something that we all care about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s, especially when you have a, a collective like that that&#8217;s, what&#8217;s important is that you&#8217;re able to bring your expertise and the mind trust of the people that you&#8217;re working with to a project or to a brand it&#8217;s not necessarily that you&#8217;ve done it before, but the collective knowledge is enough where you can go into the project and still know what needs to be done.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s very true. I think our, I don&#8217;t know, collective unit is hard enough. I don&#8217;t know questions, concerns. We&#8217;re not people. I think some of the more senior folks on our team, like we&#8217;ve heard it before. It&#8217;s very enlightening that we have sort of like these 22 year olds who chime in knowing that look, I don&#8217;t know everything, but here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking and it sort of like it brightens up our eyes to go, oh, never would have occurred to the old crowd in the room as to think about things like that because like we&#8217;re not digital natives or we&#8217;re not focusing in certain places. We don&#8217;t go to certain parties. We don&#8217;t hang out in certain worlds and I think they ended up bringing something new to the table while absorbing what we offer them so when they get to touch base and go, oh, let&#8217;s see what Lowy Frames is like a place that does fine art restoration and gilded frames. That is a new conversation for all of us. But the young folk, they don&#8217;t realize it&#8217;s new to us they just, everything is new to them. It&#8217;s kind of eyeopening to watch them grow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you know, and one thing that is really important to note here for people that are listening too, is that , these are young creatives and you&#8217;re giving them the ample space to make these sorts of decisions or determinations or comments or observations. It sounds like in a safe environment, if they say something that may not go over well with the client or something, they&#8217;re not immediately asked, I would imagine like it&#8217;s sort of a, they have a space to, to fail, which I think as a young creative is probably important to have because there can be so much out sort of like outdo pressure placed on black and brown creatives to kind of be brilliant right out the gate and not make mistakes.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
I think it is sort of, I mean, the conversation we were having before we got on here about the, I think understanding of what it means to be black in any corporate environment to be brown in any corporate environment, the idea that this is like a second culture, a second language that you have to bring to the table and learn, I think often the idea of assimilation or the idea of fitting in or not making people uncomfortable. Like it was so ingrained and in the reality is I think I was trying to be part of that in the nineties, I was just, wasn&#8217;t really good at it because I was trying to go, okay, I know your music I noticed that. And I really didn&#8217;t because I really wasn&#8217;t listening to it. But I think there&#8217;s this innate need to sort of like, see if you could fit in and our group is like, we don&#8217;t really have that as much as like, you need to know this part of the culture in order to do the job. If you don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t sweat it. I mean, if you make a mistake as you&#8217;re going through, because it&#8217;s all different and it&#8217;s all new, pay attention. And I think that&#8217;s the part where I, from all my failures of walking into situations and not knowing my first days, going from Nike to cohort where it was like, I wasn&#8217;t making sports shoes and that&#8217;s all I knew to oh, now we&#8217;re making a small number. Like Nike, the minimum you could do in a shoe with like 30,000 pairs of shoes, I got the cohort and I was like, oh, we did 30,000 pair. They were like, we&#8217;ll like, I&#8217;ll be celebrating with 30,000 pair it&#8217;s just a different mindset. I didn&#8217;t know. And I think I kind of have this, I&#8217;m happy to open my mouth and sound dumb 10 times out of 10, just because let&#8217;s get it out the way cause I don&#8217;t want any assumptions of me walking out the room, not really knowing, I think having my team, watching me say stupid things all the time and I do it for almost for their entertainment. I still call it tic-tac, I still talk about things, old guy, just so they know, I&#8217;m not afraid to sound stupid in the meeting and you should be okay because as long as you know, which is supposed to know and you do your homework, you&#8217;ll be good. And I think that&#8217;s, it&#8217;s really, uplifting to see these young black and brown folk be able to hold their weight and going to conversations as well as watching whoever the client is kind of go, oh, y&#8217;all know what y&#8217;all doing. Like yes we do. That&#8217;s all good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I think that&#8217;s, I mean, honestly just for me as, a designer, as a self-taught designer, that&#8217;s just even great to hear. I mean, I&#8217;ve had other studio owners and such that have been on the show and I&#8217;ve even talked to like just studio owners through AIGA and other design organizations and it&#8217;s true. Sometimes if there is a leading creative at the head, like you would be with, with And Them, there&#8217;s almost this need for them to come off as the creative expert. Like they have to be the captain of the ship and you are the captain of your ship, but at least what you&#8217;re showing is that you&#8217;ve built enough camaraderie with your crew. So you all can come together and work on things and it&#8217;s not just you dispatching people to do work. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
No, it&#8217;s definitely I think, and you talked about it, getting people to come in and do podcasts I think there&#8217;s, on top of being black or brown in the industry, I think the conversation around being a creative also comes with a certain expectation. You may actually be an introvert or you might actually just get put in boxes and the sales team and marketing team be like, oh, well don&#8217;t talk to them till you want to have something creative and cool. But then when to drag the cool out of them. And I think to me, that&#8217;s what kind of puts folks in a box they&#8217;re afraid to talk there&#8217;s like a lot of this, that and the third. And I think I was lucky enough to be placed in environments where I like for real in the last two years, that&#8217;s when my friends laugh all the time. I don&#8217;t want to be on podcasts, I don&#8217;t want to talk, I never want to hear myself talk, but it&#8217;s just what it is. But I also know that folks are like, I learned something from you can you do that more often? It&#8217;s like, all right. It&#8217;s just easier if I can&#8217;t call everybody on the phone so here&#8217;s the podcast and I&#8217;m just going to ramble on, I think for hours at a time. But I think the idea that someone can offer you an opportunity to stand up in a meeting and give your options. And I was at Nike and I do believe I should have been like not fired, but somebody should have, could have reprimanded me over and over but they were like, yo, this is, this is how you grow and these are the bullets you take, you just come in and like, say something.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And I think there was quite a few people like who were Nike like, oh, didn&#8217;t say it but I kind of felt that like, oh, like Jeff&#8217;s getting run cause he&#8217;s black. Or he used to go in there. Like I could be completely wrong, but yo, that&#8217;s how I felt like thinking that. But I also know some people were like, yo he&#8217;s in the room cause he was bringing something different and all y&#8217;all had the same skillset so even if it&#8217;s not what you think is the right answer, we&#8217;re going to let them go and if it doesn&#8217;t work cool, but if it does work, it&#8217;s going to work in a much different way than you guys. And I think I was given enough room, like the fact that I went in to quit when I was at Nike, because I was feeling like this wasn&#8217;t going the right place and they sent me to basically run for [inaudible 00:19:29] in Japan. And I was like, okay, it was wild. But I think that it&#8217;s a case where there were the right people in the right rooms who were talking about this a lot, like the difference between mentorship and sponsorship and I&#8217;m kind of back in mentor mode, but I think having the idea and notion, I started understanding once I got at a higher clip at Nike that I didn&#8217;t have to be somebody who&#8217;s mental, I just need to go into rooms and be like, why aren&#8217;t you highlighting this person&#8217;s work. And basically looking at people like they were wrong, if they didn&#8217;t, I didn&#8217;t know whether they were doing good work or not I was just asking them and if they feel guilty about it, that should probably tell them something.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
But I think that level of sponsorship became important and even though the mentoring was there, but I think having, and I know people who did that for me, it was either told them he asked her or I sort of knew, or I know that I would get no, no, no, no, no, then it get quiet for about a month and then next thing, Hey, we think you should do this opportunity. When somebody says something, clearly somebody says something so that I think is a part that seeing more of that from folks in or outside of corporate work, it&#8217;s just kind of important.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, And Them does a lot of different things. It&#8217;s hard to, I guess sort of pinpoint exactly what you do. Like if you go to the website for example, and click on FAQ it&#8217;s questions that sort of allude to the services that you could provide, like developing products, designing products, shooting actions, shooting commercial, shooting style, making logos, these are all services that we can do as long as you&#8217;re asking the question on what is it that we can do for you for your project.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Yo, I love you. You do all your homework. So reality is our main strengths, if we have people who help build Nike product, Yeezy product, Everlane, especially footwear, that&#8217;s our main bag. Then I kind of went out of my way, when projects and apparel came out, I was like, I need people who know how to do this. And I just saw that I literally went on LinkedIn and was like black and brown people who do apparel, please check here. The funniest joke about a member of our team, Shauna K is I was in the line at FedEx on 125th, and in walks behind me, Dapper Dan&#8217;s assistant Ashley. I look at her, she looks at me and she&#8217;s like, what do you want Jeff? I was just looking at her, like I wanted some, I was like, I need a black woman and she was like, I know who you need.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
We didn&#8217;t discuss exactly what I meant by that. That could have gone a thousand different ways. But I was like, I want a black woman creative who is just starting out because we need to round out this team and we didn&#8217;t have that on a team. And she was like, you need to meet Shauna K, just finish FIT, she&#8217;s looking for work, getting a bone that was probably on a Friday. Miss Shauna came on a Tuesday, W]we had our first meeting to work on a Friday. That&#8217;s how quickly it went. But I think that&#8217;s the part where we knew we had product creation folks. I wanted more folks to kind of round that out. Then John Lopez on his side, again, shooting the Olympics, work for the NYX&#8217;s he&#8217;s dragging me around like, I just rented this $70,000 camera for a day Jeff let&#8217;s go out and have some fun, like, okay, I don&#8217;t know what that means. So being able to do those big, specific things were important, but we had both worked at meaningful places. Then we brought in Brie La Bossier who is sort of like, keeps us all saying as a kind of design manager, project manager, kind of everything. So what ends up happening people like, can you do this, can you do that and it&#8217;s like, well, I remember when I first left Cole high, I was sort of like free to do anything. I was like, I am not designing shoes ever again. That was my thing I wanted to do since high school, I was going to design shoes. So I had a good 15 year ride of doing that. I was like, yo, I&#8217;m going to do everything else I&#8217;m done to wear shoes, like start my new life.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Like I&#8217;m going to do branding, graphics, marketing, whatever it is, I&#8217;m not going to do shoes anymore. Two months after that, I was on a plane to go do Yeezy, it was just ingrained in me. But in those two months I started writing more. I started this random e-comm site with a bunch of my friends just to sell t-shirts, basically to ourselves, called Good Things. I was learning how econ works. I was learning a little bit about SEO and digital and all these other pieces that just started to round out. As I started getting deeper into conversations, I was like, oh, once you get through that first layer, you kind of know enough to be dangerous. Then we thought I&#8217;d taken on projects. And like our learning path really came with working with kind of nonprofits and small businesses because I didn&#8217;t know how to make a website or do anything.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
But there was a restaurant that I ate at pretty much, three times a month, 4 times a month. He was like, yo, I need a website. Okay. Let&#8217;s build it. Let&#8217;s figure out what that looks like. Let&#8217;s figure out all the pieces behind it. And so working with people to kind of figure out and small businesses and nonprofits to kind of learn at least the lingo, how it works, sort of brought us to the stage of, oh, now with our knowledge of, anything from Nike to the New York NYX and NBA and Yeezy, oh, okay. We can start taking this to more people in different ways and definitely either being the conversation we were having before, intentionally this is going to be a black and brown group of people working on stuff. And so you can hire us intentionally cause you want black and brown.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
You can hire us intentionally because you want a diversity where you&#8217;re just hiring us because we are good, we don&#8217;t really care. We&#8217;re going to come in and it&#8217;s going to have like we jokingly laugh, we had to do a photo shoot and we&#8217;re like, who knows somebody, wait. Like we can&#8217;t just because it was for a brand. It was this wasn&#8217;t a, like we&#8217;re trying to cross over, it was like, it was literally for a brand that has, I mean, all the founders are white and it&#8217;s like, yo, we don&#8217;t want them to look like they&#8217;re doing black face by, oh, everybody in their ad is black, a brown, like this should be pretty diverse. But in order to be diverse we can through some white folks in there, like we look across the room like who do we know? But it was this funny game of like, we don&#8217;t know, no white folks, but.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I just have to pause there. That is, to me, that is hilarious because the inverse of that probably happens in every creative studio at least once a week. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
So we are like the exact opposite. And one of the things that&#8217;s like amazing is we had a basketball shoot and this happens pretty much with every client, especially in color. And some say it like, and they even say a day one, or they say it, at least when they get to a photo shoot a week or product on the table is that one of the models came out. We had a shoot that was supposed to go from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM in the park. We had some gears set up or got to shoot when it got dark. We all showed up one time at two o&#8217;clock we&#8217;re getting shots in and eight o&#8217;clock it was pitch dark. This was fall. That was probably like nine o&#8217;clock. We&#8217;re still out there still shooting good night shots. One of the models, like he was leaving on a bike.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
He was like, yo. And I had to record him saying, he&#8217;s like, yo, like I&#8217;ve been in shoots before. And sometimes it&#8217;s your homeboy and it&#8217;s cool. We all hang out in the end product is like, okay. Sometimes I&#8217;m at like these professional shoots and it&#8217;s all good, we all know each other and we&#8217;re good but you know, in and I&#8217;m out cause work to do. He was like, this was like the party with real work. He was like, y&#8217;all onto something. And it&#8217;s that vibe that again, we&#8217;re doing things like in ways cause we don&#8217;t know any better. We&#8217;ll do it professionally, we&#8217;ll have the call sheets up, we&#8217;ll have all the emails and testing codes, all the protocol, new we&#8217;ll look up at Brie because she&#8217;s worked at like startups and stuff.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
You will look up and Brie, because she&#8217;s worked at like startups and set up organization, things like, oh, you got to sign your paperwork. They don&#8217;t do the insurance. You want to showing up. At the same time, we&#8217;ll be out there enjoying each other&#8217;s company in a way that&#8217;s relaxed and a barbecue sort of atmosphere, which a lot of folks look at, like, I don&#8217;t know, but then what ends up happening? Like we laugh, cause it&#8217;s like the young crew, they&#8217;re like, yo, they go get an internship somewhere else. And they&#8217;re like, this is not we doing over here. And I&#8217;m like, okay, well we get some more projects and we can tackle some more work for you. So we&#8217;re doing something to have a little fun, but it&#8217;s definitely, it&#8217;s definitely the other side of the coin in terms of it&#8217;s just black and brown and it&#8217;s kind of what it looks like.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean what it really sort of boils down to, I think is two things. One you&#8217;re introducing to these creatives, at sort of the beginning stages of their career, a new possibility for what work can be, which is, or for what creative work can be, which is that it&#8217;s infused with play. We&#8217;ve had a lot of people on the show that are in the advertising industry and such, and they always talk about the long hours and the shoots and none of it sounds fun. They&#8217;re able to be creative, but it doesn&#8217;t sound like they&#8217;re really enjoying the job, you know? I think the second thing is that you&#8217;re inviting in this new tradition of this is what creative work can look like. So you&#8217;re saying yes, you can do this and also it can be fun. It doesn&#8217;t have to be stuffy or bureaucratic or anything like that. Yes, there are certain protocols that have to get done, but the magic and the environment that you&#8217;re able create is how you get your best work.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
This was probably midway through dependent. It was maybe three months in and the team was feeling a certain way cause we had just, well, we had set up, I was looking for a full studio for us to work out of. This was probably end of 2019. Because I wasn&#8217;t finding exactly the space I wanted I sort of was feeling a little grumpy about it, at the same time I was working with the spot on 118th Milbank Children&#8217;s Aid Society. And it&#8217;s a afterschool program set up in Harlem basketball courts and swimming pools kind of have everything. When Zion Williamson lost his shoe, he did it on the algebra courts of Milbank, but it also has these classrooms, they actually have a onsite nursing office. So it&#8217;s pretty well-developed. And so the classrooms needed a little update. So I went to the folks there I&#8217;m like, look, tell you what, instead of me paying for a regular lease, I&#8217;m just going to update one of these classrooms.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And we&#8217;re going to work here in the mornings until two, when kids show up. Would that work and they, before I could even finish, they&#8217;re like done show up whenever. So we put some big screen TVs in, we put some tables, chairs, we were getting prepared, then COVID hit. So we kind of got locked out like everybody else. So the team was still in a certain way cause they had gone to two or three meetings and would just get to know each other and they were liking the vibe, but we shut it down from soon. Brie, our project manager, also runs a community kind of center for creatives. So she was like, we gonna have book club. So Saturday mornings from nine to 11, like one Saturday morning, Saturday mornings, we started meeting and having book clubs. What was happening was there were elements that were going over the young folks head just in terms of here&#8217;s things you ought to know whether it was in design or government or sales or e-commerce, whatever things that need to be had, or we need to discuss we&#8217;d discuss it.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And so she set up these meetings and buy a book. It was more like here&#8217;s an article to read or a the Netflix video to watch. And so we discuss it and three or four in, I was like, we&#8217;re taking away from their Saturdays. I was like, maybe we should turn it down a little. So we took a week off. They complained like nobody&#8217;s business. And were like, yo, why are we doing book club? Okay. And some of this was because everybody was sort of quarantined. Everybody was locked away. And so I thought, okay, we&#8217;ll do this bit because everybody&#8217;s locked away. Once we all get to go out and see the world, we&#8217;ll slow it down, did not stop. It just became this thing that everybody did together had conversations that were sort of like, this is serious and this is a safe space.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
By then, we all got to know each other. So we give each other grief like nonstop, but it&#8217;s sort of a safe space for creatives to kind of, we show our work on Wednesday, Wednesday afternoon. That&#8217;s when we talked about work, work, work. But on Saturdays, and it&#8217;s not mandatory. Some people want a squad, like they&#8217;re like, no, I don&#8217;t need that. Cool. But the other half they show up religiously and the other place they go, well, let me see what the topic is. And then I&#8217;ll drop off. There was definitely this added piece of like, there&#8217;s just a conversation that, especially for creatives, especially for black and brown folks, being able to, I think, chop it up in that that sense is special. I mean, you kind of have to make space for that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I liked it. There&#8217;s a section it&#8217;s not on the And Them side. I think it&#8217;s on the good thing site. That&#8217;s called book club where you sort of have some writings and things. I want to talk about that later. And I know we spent a lot of time talking about And Them, but let&#8217;s kind of shift the focus here because really this interview is about you. You&#8217;re originally from Ohio. So where you grew up, what was it like there?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
That&#8217;s funny cause my wife and I laugh about this all the time is that my, wife went to stolen. So it&#8217;s a big deal. She&#8217;s from Philly. She went to Spelman. So she definitely talks about HBCU and what it meant. And it was never like my sister went to Wilberforce, going to HBCU was never anything that felt like I needed to do because, and I credit, this is like, we&#8217;re looking at 30 year anniversary. Or what is it? Yeah, 30. I graduated from high school, 30 years ago and 91. And I graduated with, out of the hundred kids in my class. It was 96, black folk, just black. Like one side of Baden was, is black, black, black, black, black, like just all black. And so, and I would joke with people like, I didn&#8217;t know, white people until I got to college, like literally, like I knew white people from the folks that went to our school weren&#8217;t that many or I saw them on TV.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
So I would joke like white people were kind of imaginary. Like, it wasn&#8217;t a real thing. I learned about cultural and all that, it just didn&#8217;t really exist. And I never met anybody who was really like that. And so there&#8217;s a certain confidence that I had of being&#8230; Only having to worry about my culture. And so when I got to college, when I got to Purdue, it was very much like, oh, here&#8217;s another culture. I was like, okay, cool. But now I just care about engineering. Like, all I want to do is get into design and Nike and I&#8217;m supposed to study this so I&#8217;ve never worried about embracing anything of them, I&#8217;m just going to focus on school. And so after two years of that, I actually, at the one year I was like, yeah, I&#8217;m done would be in the middle of nowhere. Let&#8217;s go have some fun.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
So I moved to Atlanta, nothing but black folk. And so that became a thing. And I think when I left and went to Nike, it was a strange sort of weird balance of me trying to figure out what was, what, and I honestly try to, and I don&#8217;t even know how to put it, I was trying to fit in, but I guess I wasn&#8217;t really trying that hard cause like everybody I knew was basketball, sports, marketing, brand Jordan. Like it was just all the black and brown people like it was. And I kind of hung out with whoever, but that&#8217;s just where I&#8217;ve found myself, other people who, I don&#8217;t even know if it was like, I found them as much as they were like, yo, we&#8217;re doing these things. You want to come hang out. And they were the normal things, like whatever, if it&#8217;s a barbecue or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And it was like, cool. I don&#8217;t know that I went out of my way, but it was this confidence that none of us really settled in until I moved to Harlem like three years ago. And when I got to Harlem, I was like, yo, this feels just like, they know how this feels just like being in Atlanta. And one of the things that kind of brought it up. So we did this project with the Apollo and it was about sneakers. And about education and someone had, was like we have to tell people why we&#8217;re doing something at the Apollo around sneakers. And I was like, no, we don&#8217;t, we don&#8217;t have to tell anybody. Like, if you ask somebody about sneakers and they&#8217;re black, the culture kind of says, they&#8217;re going to tell you something about it. They will tell you they couldn&#8217;t afford something.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And they going to tell you that knew somebody who had it. They going to tell you their own personal story, but we don&#8217;t have to have a conversation about why. Cause you&#8217;re the Apollo like is blackity black, black, black, black, like it&#8217;s just there. And I think that part, going back to Jefferson township, they know high aware, like our Italian immigrant history teacher went out of his way to make sure we understood that Lincoln didn&#8217;t free the slaves because he liked black people. He went out of his way to make sure like, nah, like this is what you need to hear. And that was just a school we grew up in. So like when I got to other places, like really that&#8217;s what y&#8217;all are. Whether they were black schools, white schools, like we learned it a hundred percent the way I think is discussed now. It was never a question for me or any of my friends going up.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
I would say it&#8217;s a wild ride for me. It was the best place to be from, a little too small for me. Definitely getting out to the rest of the world was meaningful, but I would not replace. Oh, by the way, they know how it has its own sort of history with crime, drugs, sneakers, and everything else to where the most prominent sneaker mall in all of America was the little mall on the west side of Dayton that had the best foot locker sales, period. When I got to Nike, sales people were like, Salem mall. They did a lot of business. If you track east St. Louis, Dayton, Ohio or Memphis, it&#8217;s where underground railroad, there were a lot of stops, three major ones. So it&#8217;s why Wilberforce the central state are there. It was a lot of black folk who work there. When drug money started coming and drugs started working their way north, those were the same three places that folks stopped. They know how it kind of grew, music and drugs. It was a big thing especially in the late seventies, early eighties.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We had one other person on the show from Dayton. hannah Beachler she was episode 300 back in 2019. You said that initially you kind of like said it really quickly. I was like, wait a minute, what else do I know I&#8217;m going to show has been from Dayton. Cause I remember at least one or two other people. But her specifically, I remember because of that episode, but were your parents really supportive of you going into design? I&#8217;m curious, you know, you said before, if you ask any black person about sneakers are kind of, they&#8217;re going to kind of already have a cultural connection to it. So I won&#8217;t ask you that specifically, but were your parents kind of behind you going this route with your career?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
In no way, shape or form based on this. My mother was a teacher and the reality is she didn&#8217;t care what I did as long as I tried my best and did my best, she was a person who, no matter what it was, she put that art on the refrigerator because you did it and you worked really hard and she was a middle school teacher. So she kind of had that in her, you can do whatever you want. I believe in you, yada, yada, yada, to the point where you almost didn&#8217;t believe whether she meant it or not. Cause she said it like everyday at all times, but you always had someone who was in your corner. So I think my mother wanted it to happen because I wanted it to happen. But you have to realize like this was 1991, sneakers weren&#8217;t a real thing.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And it was sort of a side conversation to the point where it wasn&#8217;t till I got to Cole Haan where the question is why does Nike own Cole Haan? Because it wasn&#8217;t making any money for Nike, the brand. And it was because an ADA still Knight knew that the industry common thought was if you wanted to make money and sneakers, you had to sell brown shoes, sneakers didn&#8217;t make money. And so he bought Cole Haan in order to make money. Well, fast forward, he and a few other people made sneakers like the regular topic. So sneakers weren&#8217;t a real thing and the reality is my father, who I didn&#8217;t have like the best relationship with, he didn&#8217;t say anything, he watched because I was getting this engineering degree from some prestigious schools and I had a co-op, I had an internship with AT&#038;T and he was like, oh, Jeff is set.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
So he didn&#8217;t say a word. He just let me be yada, yada yada. And so I graduated with a degree in engineering with three years of internships with AT&#038;T. And at that time AT&#038;T was one of the biggest design engineering companies in the U.S. And I did not pursue going to AT&#038;T. I took a job doing blueprints in Beaverton, Oregon, and my father didn&#8217;t say a word. He didn&#8217;t say a word. The only reason I know, I mean, I know he didn&#8217;t say a word, but maybe three and a half- four years later, my parents come out to Oregon. I think by that time we had maybe had like a first kid Draymond was like a year old and they&#8217;re watching Draymond. So I come home after work and my father had come to, I don&#8217;t know if you know anything about that campus, but the Michael Jordan building is, that it&#8217;s not center of campus, but it&#8217;s middle of campus.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And right next to it is this track under the trees and there&#8217;s basketball courts right next door. And so my father ran track for university of Michigan. So I was like, you can go work out and on the track, just pull up the car and tell the guard you&#8217;re there. And no one will care. And so I guess he did that. And then when I get home, after that day, my mother&#8217;s laughing and I was like, what&#8217;s so funny. It&#8217;s your father finally gets it. And I was like, what do you mean? He gets it now? He had never said anything to me. He never complained about me working at Nike, nothing. I would sit there and shoot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
that&#8217;s probably why he wasn&#8217;t complaining.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
I mean, he, I kind of saw it, but again, he was like, my son has an engineering degree, took his first job blueprints at Nike. And then he got a job drawing, kids, shoes at Nike, and now he&#8217;s doing basketball shoes in that, he just, it just seemed add up in his mind of what engineering degree and get like a real job in his mind, which was, being from Ohio, you can go work at a car company and do like, what are you doing out here in the Pacific Northwest? And I guess he started talking to other runners who on the track and my father was a runner and I didn&#8217;t care anything for that. So he was bonding with the people on the truck. Oh yeah. My son works over in design, like over, like in that building. Now we all know at this point, like designers at Nike are treated like they can walk on water. So when he started saying, my son works over in design, two things happened.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
One, I was one of four, I don&#8217;t know, black designers in Nike, all men. So they either knew who I was or they were just Ooh, your sons at the time. And so they started talking to him and he started realizing, oh, maybe this is a thing. And so he started asking him what they do. And they were riding up, rattling off things like I just signed a deal for the NBA or I did this and all that, big that he actually understood. And at that point, that&#8217;s when he was like, oh, now because my father and I didn&#8217;t have the tightest relationships, he never said anything to me for or against. But from that point on, I knew that at least he knew that this wasn&#8217;t a mistake that I had made. He knew that like, oh, this was something that was real. So then he wore the shoes with a little more pride. Meanwhile, my brothers are walking around like, oh yeah, that&#8217;s yours. My brother designer. It didn&#8217;t matter what shoe it was. My brother did that. You know, my brother, my brother, he did everything pretty much. He did that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me what it was like living in Atlanta when you went to Georgia tech, because you went, you lived in Atlanta during, I think it&#8217;s peak Atlanta. It is Freaknik. It&#8217;s the Olympics and I think also the burgeoning hip hop scene there with so-so Def and stuff. What was it like being in Atlanta during that time?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
So I as the biggest nerd who didn&#8217;t care, just [crosstalk 00:42:56] . I&#8217;m merely to go, I&#8217;m coming down here. I&#8217;m going to find a wife. It&#8217;s chocolate city. We&#8217;re all good hanging out. And I hung out hard for three years. As the biggest nerd, not even cool whatsoever. And it was everything you just named. It was pre Olympics. Everybody was gassed up. It was&#8230; What is it? My buddy&#8217;s roommate was a bouncer at the gold club and magic city. So we would just go sit at the bar with no money, just try and pretend like we fit in like, knowing we had zero money and we just sit at the bar and order water.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That can still happen today in Atlanta.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And we go in cause I get bored or whatever, and it&#8217;s like nothing but rich folk in here and its like, wow, and we would just leave after like 10 minutes. We were just like, making sure everything was good. But that was the level of everybody was sort of chilling. And yeah, we went back to Atlanta maybe three years after like, yes, not the same, my boys, were still living in like, it&#8217;s different now, but it was one of those. We were also in college. There&#8217;s nothing that will compare like as an adult to those three years when we were in college with no real responsibilities, other than staying alive and making sure you took some classes. Between going to school in Atlanta and moving to Tokyo was an ex-pat life is good. But those were big time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel you, man. Last week, actually this past weekend, I was talking to my best friend from college. So I went to Morehouse here. He and I were just talking cause his 40th birthday was last week. And my 40th birthday was a couple of months ago. And we were reminiscing on the past. We were looking at old pictures from back then and stuff. It was wild. So I was in the AUC, right near the turn of the century. I came in 99, 99 going into 2000 and stuff. And I worked for this website. I worked for this website called College Club. That was sort of a precursor to Facebook and I was one of the campus representatives. So what that entailed was that you went around and you basically captured campus life. We had these big Sony Marika, digital cameras that you had to put a three and a quarter inch floppy disc into and take pictures and stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So we were just looking at old pictures and stuff like that from the past, like, man, it&#8217;s such a trip how Atlanta has changed since then, because yeah, when you&#8217;re here in college, I mean, and I don&#8217;t know if it was like this at Georgia tech, but certainly at Morehouse in the AUC, the clubs would send charter buses to the campus to pick you up, take you to the club, you go and do whatever you want at the club and they&#8217;ll bring you right back to campus. So you, ain&#8217;t got to worry about trying to catch Marta, trying to catch a cab or trying to bum a ride from, from somebody to get back.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s come down during [inaudible 00:45:49] and they&#8217;d be like, oh, this is amazing. And I was like, no, this is terrible. Everybody&#8217;s life is traffic jam. And it&#8217;s all these people from everywhere, hanging out and it&#8217;s like, yo, I can go on a random Tuesday to Fitz Plaza and it&#8217;d be bought out like, we&#8217;re good. And it&#8217;s just the mall, like it&#8217;s just the mall.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I missed that Atlanta.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
I mean, I can&#8217;t tell you whether it&#8217;s changed. All I know is I&#8217;m old now</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, it&#8217;s changed. It&#8217;s changed ain&#8217;t that shame. So, I mean, there, there might still be that same liveness depending on what the event is, and this is probably pre pandemic, but now we&#8217;re probably in the gunshots. There&#8217;ll probably be some kind of violence that breaks out. So it&#8217;s yeah, it&#8217;s definitely not the same.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Harlem is tying to trying to figure out where it&#8217;s going to be in that level. Which again, when I moved here it was like, oh, I&#8217;m not sure. We&#8217;ll figure it out. Yada, yada, yada. What I really loved about being in Atlanta and I think it was a combination of the immigrant culture that was there that I didn&#8217;t know was going to be there. The Atlanta population that was like, it was Atlanta. And then it was the rest of Georgia. And if you don&#8217;t know, if you just moved it, you don&#8217;t know the immigrant population, I lived off of Buford highway.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow. Okay. Okay. All right. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
The food was amazing. And so, that had sort of, like, if you don&#8217;t know Atlanta, those things don&#8217;t mean anything to you. Harlem is kind of the same way. And so being able to pick up those pieces of going from oh yeah, I miss it. And I didn&#8217;t really realize it until I got to Harlem and started walking around. I was like, yo, this feels like swats. I feel like there&#8217;s a mall here that&#8217;s Greenberg. I feel like there&#8217;s something here and I think that goes to the creative conversations that I&#8217;m having unapologetically. It&#8217;s kind of black folk. And then I encourage what designers, Sarah she&#8217;s from Columbia. And I&#8217;m like, yo, bring Columbia to the projects that we work on, please just bring them all in there. I want to see that. I want to feel like your home is there because folks kind of want that from a creative vision at this point. And if they don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t know what to do with them. Like maybe they&#8217;re my clients.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So what I&#8217;m hearing is correct me if I&#8217;m wrong here, because I&#8217;m coming up to a question with this, but you grew up in Dayton, you went to Purdue, which is right across the way in Indiana and you come down to Atlanta and then after that, you&#8217;re sort of in Tokyo, what were you searching for during that time</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Being in Tokyo or?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talking about like the entire journey? Was there a feeling that you were chasing or what was your drive throughout that period of time?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s this unadulterated push for something different, something new. There was a Twitter post a while ago with like when somebody go invent some new animals. Cause I want some new meats. I&#8217;m tired of eating the same meats and I&#8217;m kind of like that guy of growing up. Like I always wanted the new music, but I thought everybody else did. And then as I got older, I still wanted the new music. I wanted the new shoe. And it&#8217;s like, this is definitely like a knee of all things. Like I see somebody wearing a pair of shoes that I have. I&#8217;m like, yep. I got to put those shoes away. Everybody&#8217;s on this Jordan one thing. And I&#8217;m like, oh, I just put those away. I can&#8217;t walk out the house and it&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m a sneaker dude is because I just feel a certain way.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
So going to Purdue, middle of nowhere, west Lafayette, they had what I thought I wanted, but it was also something different. Tokyo was like, yo, this is the wildest place on earth in terms of the visuals and the culture and the class and the people, language, everything was like, yo, I want to do this. And then I got done doing. I was like, yeah, we&#8217;re good. Let&#8217;s go to the next place. It just became this constant hunt for something new, which I still kind of have. But I think as I&#8217;ve gotten older, the combination of new plus know, I just like home, I like walking out the house, totally feeling like I&#8217;m at home and think all those other times it was me going what&#8217;s the next thing? When I got to Nike, the first thing I said was, I think this was a conversation with tinker.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And he was like, what do you want to do? And my first words were not basketball. Cause I grew up playing basketball. I knew basketball. It was just a second social life for me. And I was like, I want to do soccer. I want to do something I have no business doing so I can be in a whole nother world to see something totally new and meet new people or sweat up or the kids, the first place they told me the basketball, but even then I was trying to do something that I don&#8217;t know. I drove everybody crazy because I was trying to do something different. And I think what&#8217;s interesting is that question also pretty much pegs was my creative kind of processes was like. It was interesting cause Nike figured that out before I did. And so to fast-forward through all the headaches of my first five, six years at Nike, before I got to Japan was what they taught me was that if you put me in a functioning business where everything is great design is great and everything&#8217;s working, I will jack it up basically.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Cause I asked all the questions, why are we doing this? Why aren&#8217;t we doing it? What else could we be doing? Almost getting just to the point of start over. And so they figured out, yo, let&#8217;s go to places we know should be big, that need changing. But the people there aren&#8217;t ready to change it. So basically I became one of the people that Nike would throw into a situation that needed to be changed, but they didn&#8217;t know how to get the people in the business changing. And so I always say my first conversation of solving any problem is why? Why are we here? What are we supposed to be doing? What problem are we trying to solve? If we don&#8217;t get to the original why then we&#8217;re just putting band-aids on things. Just cover it out and go about, let it go to the next day.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And so I have this underlying question knowing at me like, yo, it could be better. It could be like better, better. It could be really better. So let&#8217;s get to the wire matter. And so I think going to new places, whether it was going to Purdue or going to Georgia tech or going to Beaverton or going to Tokyo or coming to New York City, it was always like, yo, I want to get to something new with something different. Then eventually it came to like, I&#8217;m ready to chill now. I get me. And so how can I provide opportunities for my young team? And I tell them all the time, I don&#8217;t want you here. I want you to go to your Japan. I want you to go to your mind. I want you to go to your, whatever that might be. And then you can come back if this is the right place, but go see the world. Cause it&#8217;ll make you stronger and give you new points of view that you won&#8217;t get if you just stay home.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s something about footwear or just footwear design that the average consumer doesn&#8217;t understand?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny. We just had a conversation about why I do shoes and it&#8217;s always this funny business thing is that I [inaudible 00:52:46] . I will measure people from the ground up. They&#8217;d be like, what shoes you got on? And it&#8217;s not always the measurement that people think, oh, you have expensive. Like, no, no, I can kind of take you. My stereotype is nothing based on anything else you have other than look, I see what shoes you have on right now and how you&#8217;re wearing them. And I&#8217;m going to make some calls about you whether I&#8217;m right or wrong. And I think that is probably been one of the best articles I always point to for people is Tressie, McMillan, cat, and room for Zuora. I can&#8217;t remember the exact title. Cause every time I look it up, I get lost.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s the reason poor people can&#8217;t afford to dress poor. And it talks about how the world expects you to, if you go into apply for a job that&#8217;s like at Walmart that pays nothing. If you&#8217;re black, you have to dress better than the job. You have to show up with something that you just have to otherwise, you&#8217;re not really right. That&#8217;s something that other folks don&#8217;t have to worry about. And I think to some degree that&#8217;s been sort of ingrained into my thinking, stems from Dayton, Ohio, like, this is kind of what I see. And I think working on shoes, whether it was one of the things we approached it easy with, it was like, it should be like the most democratic shoe that anybody can wear with colors that don&#8217;t distract or compliment or fight or cause fear. And then the project like I&#8217;m doing now like&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t cause fear. The project I&#8217;m doing now, for personal, 99 products, it&#8217;s a basic running shoe that is meant for anybody to pull it off. Whether you&#8217;re a teacher, either student, or head of the class, in the back of the class, it&#8217;s for everybody. I think that sort of thinking goes into product that most people write off or they don&#8217;t even think about, they just go, &#8220;oh, I&#8217;ll just buy whatever shoe and I&#8217;ll wear it.&#8221; Maybe 15 years ago, you could have said that about most of America with cars; that their car really represented what they were doing or where they would going. They put a lot of effort and energy into the point where people stopped caring about cars so much.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
It&#8217;d be like, &#8220;oh, I&#8217;ll just get a used car.&#8221; That still says something, it means something that people would put a lot of energy into cars. Today, people still put a lot of energy into the shoes they wear, even when they play them down.&#8221;Oh, you know, this is just like throwaway shit.&#8221; I laugh because people say, oh, I don&#8217;t really care what kind of shoes I wear.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;okay, then why don&#8217;t you wear some bright red clown shoes?&#8221; And they go, &#8220;well, that&#8217;s stupid.&#8221; I go, &#8220;oh, so you do care.&#8221; You do have a uniform. You do have an opinion of what you wear, so it&#8217;s not that you don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s just that you don&#8217;t care to keep up with the people who you think care too much about Smith. So I think in the design process, it&#8217;s sort of identifying what people want for function, want to say about themselves and how it fits into their overall wardrobe. Shoes is something else, that you may wear a different shirt every day in a different pair of pants every day. But you might wear the same shoes every day. That&#8217;s going to say something about you, like your haircut. It&#8217;s going to say something about you and you choose to be there. When you&#8217;re designing for people, you kind of have to want to be on their person, like every day, because that&#8217;s what they might use it for.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So earlier you were talking about how you were working for Nike and you were sending home shoes to your dad, shoes to your brothers, how your brothers were saying, &#8220;oh yeah, my brother designed this shoe.&#8221; All these different kinds of shoes. Can you name some of the shoes you have designed? Some of the more well-known footwear designs that you&#8217;ve done?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
The big ones are probably the Yeezy three 50 V2, to go on the Grand Max Plus 2009, those are probably the bigger ones. Then there&#8217;s 1,000,000,001 other shoes that made it or didn&#8217;t make it. The shoes that I&#8217;ve made that sold 10 times more that were like the shoes called the Nike Basketball Air Glide. Not to be confused with the Zoom Glide that came out 15 years later, but the basketball Glide was a $55 white leather basketball shoe that sold for three years more than anybody could count, just because it was at a price point. It&#8217;s interesting, I think less about those shoes. People always go, &#8220;you&#8217;re missing the lead, like talk about those shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s more like, &#8220;nah,&#8221; I&#8217;m more. And maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m old, I&#8217;m more interested in the people who I&#8217;ve helped become designers for them about their path and remembering when they didn&#8217;t know any better, just like I didn&#8217;t know any better and Ray Butts and Andre Doxy.&#8221;You need to work on this, and you need to work on that.&#8221; They took me under their wing and made sure I did the right thing. That&#8217;s my biggest high, I probably did that for my mother, but it&#8217;s more about the folks who I could teach and seeing what they do with it. And also them calling me back, I remember when somebody at Denver was like, &#8220;yo, I used to be mad at you when you told me to do things and now I&#8217;ve got an intern and I&#8217;m like, yo, I&#8217;m so sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
It just comes full circle at some point.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So after Nike, you went to Cole Haan for a couple of years, but you said Nike had bought Cole Haan, correct?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Nike bought Cole Haan in 88 and then they sold Cole Haan in 2013.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Was it a big shift design-wise going from athletic footwear to a wider range of footwear that Cole Haan would offer?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
I wanted it to be. It&#8217;s crazy because I went from Japan to Nike running, which was probably the biggest leap I made in terms of learning skill set of being in design and design leadership. Then I did sportswear for not even a year before, we just need to get out of Oregon and go to New York city and with Cole Haan. I was so excited to get the Cole Haan and learn more about dress shoes, and how the last word and how you all the technical benefits and leathers. And like that was like, it was a whole thing. I was going through women&#8217;s dress shoes. Like this is again me chasing something like new and different, like, so one day and probably a week in Mark Parker shows up and I had just probably no more than like a month before that we had presented like a line that kind of for at least five years changed, like the direction Nike sportswear that was received really well.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
We got high fives, lots of praise, yada, yada, yada. And he was in that meeting. It was like, this is really good. So about two weeks of me being at Cole Haan and I was just visiting for like a month, I was like, yo, I&#8217;m going to learn all this figure out what&#8217;s going on. It&#8217;s going to be good. Parker shows up. And he comes into like, I had this makeshift office and I had like all these pictures plastered on the wall of like Tom Ford and Gucci and churches, like wind tips. And I was trying to learn like dress shoes. And he was like, what&#8217;s this? And I&#8217;m like, yo, I&#8217;m trying to learn like dress shoes. This is new to me. Like I&#8217;m excited. He was like, yeah, yeah, that&#8217;s cool. Why don&#8217;t you do what you did in sportswear? And I looked at him like, okay.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And I knew exactly what he meant. He was like, I need you to do something different that like learn dress shoes. And he meant I should learn dress shoes. And he was also like, don&#8217;t show up and give me a wing to show up and give me something different. And so immediately we did the lunar ran light in kind of an hour because it was a marketing guy and a engineering guy were like, &#8220;yo, what if we did this? And I was like, yeah, we, I did loner for like three years in running and sportswear. Like we can do this in 10 minutes.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And so me learning everything about dress shoes and fashion, in the three years, it was all good, but it was literally like let&#8217;s do something to their credit. Everybody was right, because it became the hallmark shoe, it was the coolest shoe for all of three months. And then it just became every IT, lawyer, everybody who wanted to wear a sneaker group had to wear a dress. You wear that shoe to this day. Right. It&#8217;s still like, oh no, it&#8217;s not the coolest shoe in the world. But it&#8217;s definitely something that I don&#8217;t know. Every insurance guy has a pair.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How have you seen footwear design change over your career?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
What&#8217;s been both. Probably. It&#8217;s kind of annoying to like some overhead to solve for where design is. One way, you go to this design school, you learned these rules, you make something and you draw it, you go into the factory and you build it. Now, to me, it&#8217;s really encouraging to watch folks who basically just Photoshop some colors together and throw some shoes together. And like it equates to, they may take the Jordan One and flip it in colors. That&#8217;s new. And the purist will be like, well, that&#8217;s not design it. Just the color. And I&#8217;m like, yeah, but at the end of the day, if somebody puts it on and gets value out of it and they feel a certain way, I think that&#8217;s valuable. Even if the shoe was already designed and someone added their own touch to it.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
So I don&#8217;t necessarily think negatively about it. I do know that if you want somebody to make a new shoe, you probably should pay someone who knows how to make new shoes. But also I&#8217;ve seen plenty of designers and it was true at Nike people who would draw the most amazing shoe. And then they were colors that were terrible, like completely unwearable. And you&#8217;d be like, &#8220;yeah, yeah. Just, just send that over to my guy over here, let her do it. Let, let her put some materials on it.&#8221; You did your job, you made an amazingly functional, beautiful, physical thing. Now let somebody else add the color and whatever else that makes it wearable. And that&#8217;s a whole other job. That&#8217;s a whole other skillset that just because you drew a shoe, doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ve actually had that skillset. So I think seeing that become a more regular part of the industry of people being elevated, I think is very worthwhile.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;ve done work with Allbirds before and there&#8217;s a lot of these kinds of, I thought they came about in the last few years, a lot of these minimalists kind of shoe designs, there&#8217;s Allbirds, Greats, Vesey. There&#8217;s probably a dozen or so of them. What do you think about those kinds of shoe companies?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
I love the energy they bring in, my work with Allbirds is literally, they kind of thought they might want to do something. So they hired me for one small project and I was like, you guys will be big. Can I hang out with you on it? They said &#8220;We don&#8217;t want that much. We don&#8217;t want that bigger relationship.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow! Okay.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t need to do that. Well, and it was one of those to their credit. I think they focused on doing something that no one in the industry thought was the right thing to do. If you ask everybody in the industry, &#8220;Hey, would you make a wool shoe?&#8221; The first thing I got is it gets dirty. It gets like, don&#8217;t do that. Dave leaned in heavy and the way they did it through DTC through a community built on starting with Silicon valley and working his way to wall street.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
I think they chose a community that traditional sneaker folks didn&#8217;t have an idea about. I think to the credit of a lot of those companies, a lot of them have been people who follow in those footsteps, no pun intended to do the same thing as with like, I loved like what great submission was like, just to bring something that was quality and simple. I think they may have lost track of that along the way. I think you do, you try to run with the sneakerheads, like you get lost in like the energy and the same and the cool kid and they stock X and all the other stuff, instead of just like, it&#8217;s a business, make a dish that people want. And I think there&#8217;s credit in doing that without having to follow.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
I think a lot of the brands that are making stuff now, I kind of liked them. They also give people the benefit of they can walk out their house without having the same shoe. If you walk up, do you want me to house with a pair of SES on and no, one&#8217;s going to be like, oh, y&#8217;all got the same shoe. And if you do, there&#8217;s a bonding moment. But if you tried to bond with everybody who had on a pair of air max, you wouldn&#8217;t go that far.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I can see that. I think one thing with those sorts of shoes, I don&#8217;t know if they are sitting in warehouses or if they&#8217;re made to order. But of course, I think with the rise of these are certainly an increased public perception of easy to obtain footwear that wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be through Adidas or Nike or something like that.I&#8217;ve seen shoes on Instagram that were clearly just, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a drop shipping sort of thing, but you&#8217;ll see some shoes on Instagram. They clearly are just parts glued onto a sock that they&#8217;re selling as a shoe. And you think, &#8220;oh, this might be good in these sort of still shots,&#8221; but then you actually get the shoes and they smell like industrial strength adhesive and you have to air out your apartment that may have happened to me. I&#8217;m not saying it did or didn&#8217;t, but [crosstalk 01:05:30] that may or may not have happened. I plead the fifth, it&#8217;s my show. But, I think what it does is that at least democratizes the aspect of footwear design, where you have these independent companies designing shoes that are also able to appeal to people that are different from before, the bigger brands that are well-known for designing shoes, like a Nike or Adidas.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And it forces the bigger brands to innovate when they really may not have had the catalyst to do so. I would equate what Allbirds did for sneakers is exactly what Tesla did for electric vehicles. Toilet had been sitting on electric vehicles forever and they weren&#8217;t trying to make it the cool kid car. It was just an electric vehicle. We make it so what, and Tesla was like, no, we make the electric vehicle. And I think there&#8217;s going to be the evolution of anything else, you&#8217;re going to find some companies that make something that&#8217;s not all that great. And hey, if you&#8217;re going to go out there and try everything, you got to be willing to be like, if you&#8217;re the one who&#8217;s not going on the open, you&#8217;re trying every restaurant. Sometimes you go fast in here, your food, but if you&#8217;re the person who wants to be that person, who&#8217;s like, yeah. Before anybody else sees it, I&#8217;m going to try it. You may stumble upon the next thing. I&#8217;m curious, what are you wearing? What is your go-to shoe at this point?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
My oh Jesus, oh boy. It does get personal because I hate shoe shopping. I absolutely hate it. It is up there with going to the dentist. It&#8217;s shopping for shoes. I do not like it. [crosstalk 01:07:06] I have sort of wide Flintstone, ish feet. And so as a kid, going with my mom to the store to get shoes was always a hassle because one of my feet is decidedly about a half size, bigger than the other one. And also because my feet are wide, most shoes that come in like a medium are way too small for me. Like I can&#8217;t even get my foot in it. So I&#8217;d have to get a larger size because that would then kind of widen the width of the shoe a bit. But then now I&#8217;ve got all this like floppy toe room at the end. And my mom&#8217;s like, just put a sock in it, like just stuff a sock in it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it doesn&#8217;t get the crease or whatever. But then that [crosstalk 01:07:50] hurts while you&#8217;re walking and you&#8217;re trying to run. It&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a whole thing. So I&#8217;m not a big, [crosstalk 01:07:56] I&#8217;m not a, I&#8217;m not a big shoe shopping person. It wasn&#8217;t until I know that was well into adulthood that I saw a podiatrist and actually got like my feet measured and all this sort of stuff. And I had been wearing the wrong size for well over a decade, wrong size shoe. [crosstalk 01:08:13].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I wear about a size 10 extra, extra, extra, extra wide, like a 10 40. And usually what I was getting was, and I mean, you know, growing up, of course it would change as my foot change. But like right now I usually rock about an 11 is pretty good. But like if one was an 11 and the other was an 11 and a half, that would be perfect because even on the other foot, which is bigger, it&#8217;s still like very constricting and most wide shoes are hideous. You&#8217;re a footwear designer. Even talking about this, the desire for like medium shoes. I mean, the sky is the limit. You get to watch shoes and everything looks like orthopedic shoes. Why is that?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
So there&#8217;s a little bit of like the bell curve. And so quite typically the design goes to, and you&#8217;ll notice that most things, when they&#8217;re in a smaller size, they can be more cute, more appealing. And so,</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, they&#8217;re dope. Like I can, like, you can get them in different colors and they look nice and then you get to the wide shoes. And it&#8217;s just like, it&#8217;s like what I call the PE teachers, which are the monarchs from Nike. Like that&#8217;s all you get. [crosstalk 01:09:27] I know, I know that&#8217;s probably,</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
That&#8217;d be the cool kid shoe.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
But a lot of it is definitely built on again. If you&#8217;re making your money in one area, a lot of brands don&#8217;t then spend a lot of time in other areas. And so you get some brands who may find that&#8217;s a niche customer. So my guess is you bought more than your fair share of New Balance.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh my God. Yes. How did you know you&#8217;re reading my mind? Yes. There was a time in my twenties where I had not a lot of different colorways of New Balance, but the new balance, not the nine nineties, those were ones I ended up getting before. But like the, I forget the number. It&#8217;s like new balance five somethings. I had those in probably every color.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And it kind of becomes your uniform and it&#8217;s time to, okay. But then when is that? What ends up happening? Two things happen. Everybody who has that same point is wearing the same thing. And then you get lumped in a box.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And then it&#8217;s one of those, oh, you have wide feet. So you have to wear new balance and then there&#8217;s not enough, let&#8217;s do something different. [crosstalk 01:10:37] And so you have to refine the brands that sort of, I don&#8217;t know, care, or we&#8217;ll show you something different and it&#8217;s not easy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s the new balance Five, seven fours. I had them in so many different color ways. Cause they, I mean, and on 11 they still fit. They still were pretty wide, but I had those for a long time and yeah, there was that association, which is actually why I stopped wearing them. Well, that in my podiatrist was like, you need to stop wearing these. They&#8217;re not doing any favors, like stop wear these shoes. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
So it was funny as it was a podcast or was a clubhouse and my friend Simone runs it and she had the president of Rihanna&#8217;s brand owner [crosstalk 01:11:18] and hear her talk about inclusivity and design that what Rihanna wanted. She was like, look, there were two things that quickly and easily made, making intimate wear for a diverse population of women. Important one was really easy. And that was just shades of nude. Like just what colors you chose. She was like, that was really easy. Every brain could flip that switch immediately and go from like two shades of nude to 20 shades of nude because there are different colors of people. And she was like, that was actually, it&#8217;s more of like a decision you have to make. And then it&#8217;s a supply chain thing and some operational, the blah, blah, blah. It&#8217;s pretty easy. The really difficult one is when it comes to physical shape and sizing, because one, you have to have people in the building who can relate and understand.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
She was like, not everybody in intimates is the same size 16. Sometimes you&#8217;re 16 up top. Sometimes you&#8217;re 16 on bottom. Like it&#8217;s just different shapes. And if you can&#8217;t have a real conversation about it, cause the right diversity is in the room is not in the room. Then you just end up making, like, we just took the same thing and made it bigger. And then you don&#8217;t write answers and then you get what she put it. You&#8217;ve been with skinny people think that people want, and she was like, it&#8217;s not that blunt, but you also get what skinny people think super skinny people want. And she used those words. She was sort of getting like, yo, like it just doesn&#8217;t help. And they don&#8217;t know. So until you bring people in the room who have wider feet or like our last version of the, and that was one of the things Rihanna said is like, no, when you make the larger sizes, it better be just as beautiful when a person is when you make the medium size.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Like that&#8217;s just what it should, what should be done. And so when we were making the next versions of the point, I had a lot of flat, cause I know a few football players who were like a size 15 and I shoe only went up to a 14 and it was like, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff. Yeah. Like what are you doing this next batch? And it costs money. Like we had to make molds, we&#8217;ve gone up to a size 17 with these things shoes and we&#8217;ll try to go up more, but like it costs money to get there and you need people to actually support like, so I sent you a link, you&#8217;ll see it, the jokes, John. But that shoe comes in like four E in terms of width [crosstalk 01:13:34] so there, and you&#8217;ll try more and it&#8217;ll be different. And whether is your cup of tea or not? The idea is that when you wear them, you&#8217;ll notice some wind here and you&#8217;ll see like, oh, it doesn&#8217;t have to look hideous. It doesn&#8217;t have to look [inaudible 01:13:50] And it&#8217;s kind of, okay. So I think design can bring that to people, especially in shoes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, So, so to answer your earlier question about what I&#8217;m rocking. So I do have kind of my two that I tend to sort of vary between one is like a, all black, like Reebok walking shoe. I don&#8217;t know what the name of it is, but it has like this air bubble in the sole. So like it&#8217;s very bouncing. Like I wanted some just like straight up like black minimalists sneakers that I could just throw on with anything. And then I do have a pair of monarchs and I actually had to stop wearing because the cushioning was too much. Like it was like, my foot was in like a spaceship and it&#8217;s funny. Cause I remember when I first got those shoes, I would get so many compliments on them and I&#8217;m like, thanks. And I didn&#8217;t know if it was for real, cause I honestly got them because they came in a wide with my podiatrist&#8217;s had recommended it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And when I first put it on, I was like, oh, so this is what it feels like to walk without foot pain. Like now the shoe actually like, but I still have that one for every now and then, but I just bought three pairs of shoes recently.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if this is because I got the vaccine and I feel like I need to go out in the world, but I got three new pairs of shoes recently and they&#8217;re different in different ways. So one is a Fila shoe.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s the Oakmont mid and my, my podiatrist, I recommended it cause it had a thick sole and he&#8217;s like, you kind of need more of like a, almost like a boot type of shoe as opposed to maybe like a low sneaker type or something. And so I have those and those are great. Those are ass-kicking shoes. Like I love those shoes. And then I got a pair of Hoka, Bondi seven. I just got those a couple of days ago actually. And I might send them back. They&#8217;re too bouncy. They feel like I&#8217;m wearing moons shoes. Like if I needed to jump and reach high things, I would probably keep them. But like I&#8217;m walking and I&#8217;m like, whoa, like I&#8217;m literally, like I literally have a spring in my step is what it feels like</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s meant to be. It&#8217;s meant to do that. So it&#8217;s good in terms of the functionality. It&#8217;s not the functionality you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And then I got another like honestly I got a card in the mail from DSW that was like $25 off a shoe. I&#8217;m like, let me just get some more like knock around shoes. And I got some Sketchers, like slip ons there, the ultra flex 2.0 Mercon slip on sneaker and they&#8217;re okay. But like one of the shoes fits and the other one is too small because it&#8217;s not wide enough for the other foot so I can still wear them. But they&#8217;re just like, they&#8217;re okay. And I mean, after the discount, they were like 25 bucks. So I&#8217;m like, yeah, this is, this is just something I can just throw on and like check the mail or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
So we&#8217;re going to get you into some Johns. You&#8217;re going be to, you know, say nothing but good things. We gonna see you on the gram And then you had to give all praise if you like it. And if you don&#8217;t, you never heard of it. So its all good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Ill Put a link to this in the show notes so people can see it. Like I&#8217;m looking at it now, the Jackson YC, John, they come in like this lemon ice, yellow, like ch like classroom, chalk yellow, which is an interesting color way. I like it.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
They also come in gray suede, I think there&#8217;s a gray suede</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, I see I&#8217;m scrolling down. I see now</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Scroll down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The yellow was interesting though!</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And that was based on, so my brother, his kidneys started failing his feet, started swelling and he needed wider shoes. And so I put them in some Birkenstocks, which he was good with, but he needed like some actual real shoes to get around in. Cause he&#8217;s in Ohio and it was winter. And so I was working with his brand in China and they made the shoe for seniors. The name of the brand is Zulee&#8217;s and so, and the shoe was like, I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s kind of the way they created. It was very much like old people shoes.` It&#8217;s like, it just had this diet to this sort of function first and it just didn&#8217;t look cool. And I was like, yo, can we make these in first suede? And then can we make them in like some monotone colors that I don&#8217;t know, you think you like, look good?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And they were like, well, that&#8217;s not what old people want. I was like, well, how do you know? Like, and they were like, all right. So they blessed us with some pairs just to try out. [crosstalk 01:18:04] And people were like, yo, I can look good. Like, and we kept getting hit with, I don&#8217;t want to wear them out. And it was like,</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
oh, interesting.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Because they were all suede. And they were like, I don&#8217;t want to get them dirty. Cause they look so nice. It was like, like stop wearing the shoes that you hate because you can get them dirty and wear these. And it was interesting because we made our conservative desks that, you know, we&#8217;ll make them in gray and we&#8217;ll make them in yellow thinking that, you know what? People will want the gray because that&#8217;s normal. But you know, we&#8217;ll get some daring people to wear the yellow and it kept going back. Like I think we sold out of the yellows in most sizes. So you have your side, it&#8217;ll be lucky. But for the most part we have grays left cause people wanted like they wanted to stand out in the way that wasn&#8217;t like clown, but also they didn&#8217;t want to look like I am the old person I am. And I think that, again, it goes to, wasn&#8217;t so much about the design, the design should work, but sometimes it&#8217;s color and materials [crosstalk 01:19:00] that kind of plays into how people feel.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It is an appropriate amount of swag. Like I&#8217;m looking at the photos, like there&#8217;s this one where this dude is getting into like a rag top convertible and like his, the color of the car and his shoes are pretty much the same. I&#8217;m like, that&#8217;s kind of dope. And he&#8217;s cause he&#8217;s wearing a black jacket. It has on yellow shoes. And then you see like the black rag top in the yellow paint, like okay. Bet. All right, cool. Well, we will definitely talk about that after we stop recording. Cause I would definitely be in the market for these look, these look great. And it&#8217;s interesting that there&#8217;s this personal story behind the design too. What I get, you know, from just talking with you and learning about your history and everything is that eventually you always bring it back to the work, which I think is something that is indicative of people that really have a passion behind what it is that they do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like even with the name of your studio being &#8220;And Them&#8221; like you&#8217;re taking the onus and the focus like off of you, it&#8217;s really about how the work is being received in the world and how people are using it. Which I think is super, not just, I think super important, but also super inspirational for people to see, because I think especially for younger designers there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
can be this, want to kind of do the biggest flashiest stuff all the time. Or like, like that&#8217;s the stuff that they want to do that they feel like may point out the thing in their career or like put them on the map or something like that. And really if the work that you&#8217;re able to do is like really changing people&#8217;s lives and affected them. That&#8217;s hopefully just as, as good as a takeaway from the work that you do.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
No, I think that&#8217;s well said. I think even the work that you&#8217;re doing, like you talked about, like it took you a number of podcasts and a number of like folks in the outside, like co-sign for credibility to be there with other people. But the reality is you are going to do it because you thought it needed to be there. And I think that&#8217;s very important. So people don&#8217;t understand that sometimes people won&#8217;t come out to you first show people won&#8217;t come out and see like the first game you play in cars may not be great. But if you know why you&#8217;re there and you keep working on your craft, you get better.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And that&#8217;d be great, but if you know why you&#8217;re there and you keep working on your craft and you get better, I think it then pays off, and it doesn&#8217;t always have to be, &#8220;Did I have the biggest show on the planet?&#8221; Sometimes it&#8217;s just about, &#8220;Did I do really good work and were people happy?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
So, no, it&#8217;s definitely whenever we can use our skills to make friends and family happier, and when they bring us new friends and family that we can work with, we&#8217;re happy to use our skillset to make other lives better.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know that we technically announced it. I guess they announced it. We&#8217;re working with this Reinvention Lab out of Texas, this group out of Teach for America to kind of&#8230; We ran a shoe contest, and they got to actually find organizations within their group to design shoes and they got to work on it.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And what&#8217;s interesting is there&#8217;s going to be a winner, and we&#8217;re actually going to sell some of the shoes that they made. And they were like, &#8220;Oh yeah, we don&#8217;t care if we won any more.&#8221; Just going through the presentation process, how designers look at things, how they have conversations about things&#8230; Just the design process was new to them. And that helped them understand what they bring to education and what they bring to laying out curriculum, which I sort of, I don&#8217;t know, I hang out with Chris Emdin, whose HipHopEd, and the way he talks about pedagogy. Those are things that I take internally as normal, but they had to go through this class. They had to do this competition to take in and be like, &#8220;Oh, design thinking is not just for designers. It helps us.&#8221; And so that was really gratifying to see. Or even just our approach and our process could bring, I don&#8217;t know, something to other people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And speaking of school, I mean, you&#8217;re on the advisory board for a school in New York, the Business of Sports School. And most recently you became a board member at Knoll. For you, what&#8217;s the importance of sitting on boards like this?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s&#8230; Another thing that I sort of got dragged into, and some of it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m old, I hang around old people and they are on boards and they say, &#8220;You&#8217;d be good at this.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t really know what a board did or what it meant. Now that I&#8217;m on two, I can sort of surmise that it&#8217;s definitely one of the, for most businesses, the biggest form of sponsorship you can get. Because as much as mentorship and execution are good, if the people who are sort of guiding the people who are in charge understand the entire, I think, operation and process, the better it is for the people who are doing work and the more diverse of an angle you get. And so at BOSS, this a sports school, it was&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And one of my best friends on the board, we were having this discussion around college visits. And so BOSS is a school in Hell&#8217;s Kitchen, most of the kids come from the Bronx and Harlem. In terms of who could attend, they&#8217;re changing up a little bit how who gets into the school, but it&#8217;s definitely an open enrollment. It&#8217;s not based on higher test scores and they don&#8217;t pick who they get into the school. It&#8217;s just kind of an open free-for-all in terms of kids that get to the school.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s not built on kids who are automatically going to Harvard who have family history and education and college background. And so one of the things that they&#8217;ve promoted, I think for good reason, is they want to make sure that kids have an understanding of what college is, and so they go on college tours. And so the college tours were happening around junior year, and I said, &#8220;No, it&#8217;s too late.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And my friend Marie, who works for SMY, her son at the same time&#8230; I think both of our sons were in college, were in high school and around junior year at the same time. And she chimed in and was like, &#8220;No, you have to understand. My son, this is the biggest time of his life. He&#8217;s visiting all these colleges. And it&#8217;s really important. It&#8217;s shaping who they are.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Yeah, but your son has heard about college since he was five years old. Some of these kids, none of their family is going or has gone to college. And so this is a new concept. They&#8217;re expecting them to go work. Some of these kids, their family is wondering why they&#8217;re finishing high school, literally wondering why they&#8217;re finishing high school, when they could go work and put food on the table. It&#8217;s a different conversation. So can we please take them freshman year, even just to one college campus? Normalize the idea of college in their brains before they&#8217;re taking an ACT, before they&#8217;re taking a prep test. Can we do that?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And what&#8217;s funny is she saw that, and she was like, &#8220;Oh.&#8221; And because this was happening at the board level, this is well before the teachers had to choose where they were spending money or where they were scheduling time, and so offering a more diversity of voice, at a school like that, I think was powerful. But there&#8217;s quite a bit of diversity on that board. When I got to Knoll, there wasn&#8217;t that much of diversity of thought on the board. And it was interesting, because when it first came up, I was like, &#8220;Are you inviting me on the board because I&#8217;m Black?&#8221; And they were like, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s helpful.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Oh [crosstalk 01:26:00].</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And I was like, &#8220;Well, are you inviting me on the board because I&#8217;m creative?&#8221; And they were like, &#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s a design company, and we don&#8217;t have creative people on the board. There&#8217;s a misstep there.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Oh.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And then later on, someone was like, &#8220;Yeah, scary enough. You&#8217;re also young.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Oh, I haven&#8217;t been young in a while.&#8221; But I was the youngest person on the board. And I think, again, being able to have diverse levels of thought at a board level where it&#8217;s really only about sponsorship, it&#8217;s really about giving direction to the real leaders and responsible folks who run something, being able to give them a sounding board and holding them to task on, &#8220;Are you getting the most out of your people? And by the most, are you just even listening and can you hear their voices?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And I think when boards start to diversify, I think&#8230; And I mean, the same is true in C-suite. I have a whole thing about, &#8220;I love all my friends who are D and I experts at every company, but you wouldn&#8217;t need them so much if the C-suite was diverse. You&#8217;d have other problems to fix because then those folks would make sure that there was a diverse hiring thing.&#8221; Maybe not all the time, but there&#8217;d be more folks to sort of like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get after diversity in bigger ways.&#8221; And I think to me, the board level helps usher and push along those movements. So I&#8217;m very, very happy that folks sort of tapped me on the shoulder. One, I didn&#8217;t look like the average board person. I also went in saying I wasn&#8217;t going to act like the normal board person. And I think they were actually quite excited that I wouldn&#8217;t be. So I was blessed to end up in conversations that they wanted me there, as opposed to they felt like their hands were tied about having me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I mentioned before we started recording that I had done my research. I read through a lot of articles that you had written up on the GwoodThin.gs blog, and they&#8217;re also syndicated on Medium.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
I apologize for [crosstalk 01:27:58].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no. I actually want to talk about that. What does writing do for you as a designer?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Writing is probably, and this plays into, I don&#8217;t know, the background of introversion of I stumble across my words. If I&#8217;m having a conversation, I&#8217;m one of those people who goes, &#8220;Oh, I wish I would have thought about that when we&#8217;re talking&#8221; because I can&#8217;t think on my feet like that. And so being able to write, a skill that my sister made sure I&#8230; She saw that I had a little bit of a talent. My sister&#8217;s 13 years older than me. So she saw I had a little talent and made sure my teachers knew and forced me to write more and more when I was in high school. And that just became a way for me to, almost in a journal way, sort of write down what my thoughts were when I knew I couldn&#8217;t finish them in other ways, or I really didn&#8217;t feel comfortable talking to other people.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And also allowed me to&#8230; And when you get old and have kids, you sort of see that, well, your kids aren&#8217;t always listening to you. And I, for sure, didn&#8217;t always listen to my parents or my elders, but if you write it down and leave it so that when they&#8217;re ready to take any of the information, it&#8217;s there for them. And so for me to write it down like this&#8230; And people bring up some of those Medium posts all the time like, &#8220;Oh, I read such and such.&#8221; I don&#8217;t even remember writing it. It&#8217;s from 2016. And I might&#8217;ve just copied and pasted it from a Tumblr post from 2012. But it&#8217;s more of my journal, this was kind of going on or a thought that popped up in my head that I may have wanted&#8230; or someone asked a question that I wanted to answer for that person, but also wanted to answer for multiple people.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
So being able to write, to me&#8230; And it&#8217;s funny because people often talk like, &#8220;Oh, you write the same way you talk.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, that should be the same way with everybody, I would think.&#8221; And so I don&#8217;t use complete sentences, and I&#8217;ll stop in the middle of a sentence and just go into the next thing because it&#8217;s really just my thought&#8230; And my kids hate it. They&#8217;ll read and be like, &#8220;You have no focus.&#8221; Because they took real writing classes and I&#8217;m like, [crosstalk 01:29:57]. &#8220;You&#8217;re smarter than me because I can send you to a school that you can be smarter than me, so leave me alone.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
But for me, it&#8217;s sort of this unfiltered way of throwing down whatever is in my head. And I might evolve six months past whatever I wrote, but my journal is sort of me documenting my thoughts so that if it&#8217;s helpful to somebody at a time, it&#8217;s good. And also there might be hope that there&#8217;s some things that I&#8217;m sort of fighting against or don&#8217;t want that one day it&#8217;ll be sort of useless because they&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, we don&#8217;t have those problems anymore. We&#8217;ve moved onto new problems.&#8221; But hopefully that becomes the case.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I have to say I could not stop reading. I think you&#8217;re a fantastic writer. I think you should keep it up.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Thank you. No one knows that I&#8217;m paying you in shoes to say that, right? Okay. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look, I was going to say that before the shoes. No, I&#8217;m kidding. I&#8217;m kidding. No seriously, though, I mean, as I read through it, I think it&#8217;s important not just as you&#8217;re talking about to push your thoughts down, but as you also said, for other people to see, and not just your kids, but for other designers to stumble upon, &#8220;This is what it&#8217;s like for an agency owner when they&#8217;re working on projects,&#8221; or, &#8220;How do you think about the work that you do in your creative process?&#8221; That kind of stuff tends to not really get shared, certainly not from other black designers in that way.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
I was listening to, I think one of the interviews you had before, and I think you brought up that you could throw something in a Tweet and how deep does it go, but how long does it actually stick? It kind of gets lost in the universe.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And I think when you actually write a book, there&#8217;s a little bit more staying power. And I think those long reads that challenge you to follow a story that imparts information, I think, are very powerful. And I think there&#8217;s also just&#8230; Some people would rather have the 300-page book about a topic and some people want a TikTok version of the same thing. And I think everything&#8217;s not for everyone. So how I communicate may not be for everybody. I apologize that you had to read through all those, but for some people they enjoy reading them and some people are like, &#8220;Yeah, I read the first three lines, and I was good. Way to go.&#8221; And that&#8217;s okay. [crosstalk 01:32:05].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, I read through all of them because some of them you&#8217;re talking about different projects that you&#8217;ve worked on. There was one even about the recent board appointment that you had mentioned. So it was just good to sort of see it, see how you perceive the world through your eyes and your words and how that all&#8230; Because for someone like me, I wouldn&#8217;t know what that&#8217;s like, but to read your words on it, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, so that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s like.&#8221; Just to kind of see that perspective is important.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s really powerful when you don&#8217;t have enough voices in jobs from people who look like you who might be able to say things and sound like you, not only for you to hear and go, &#8220;Oh, okay. This is what it&#8217;s like when I get there.&#8221; But also I think I wrote one article about of the nicest guys I know on the planet. He posted on his Instagram a photo of the Nike design offsite. It was a picture of all the Nike designers and pretty much all white folk with&#8230; You can pick out the three or four people who aren&#8217;t white.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And when I saw that, I had anxiety just looking at the picture. Because I remember going to those offsites going like, &#8220;This is weird,&#8221; and not knowing who to tell or who to say it to except for people who were there.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And we were all kind of looking at each other like, &#8220;Yeah. But it is what it is.&#8221; Someone just posted the phrase, &#8220;It is what it is&#8221; on Twitter. And I was sort of like, &#8220;That&#8217;s a very dark expression for Black folk because it&#8217;s almost like you&#8217;re giving up, like a loss of hope.&#8221; But &#8220;it is what it is.&#8221; It&#8217;s not what I think other people might think it means. It&#8217;s definitely like, &#8220;We&#8217;re done here. There&#8217;s nothing we can do. It is what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And I think changing that at Nike became something so many of us focused on that, I don&#8217;t know&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if we were able to put a dent in it as much as we wanted to, but it definitely some days felt it is what it is.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And that picture brought out all that anxiety. And I told him. I was like, &#8220;Yo, are you okay? I&#8217;m going to actually use the article. I&#8217;m going to write your name and say what a good dude you are but also explain this is the truth.&#8221; And it&#8217;s funny how many people who reached out to me after, on both sides who were like, &#8220;Yo, I thought this and I didn&#8217;t know how to feel, and I didn&#8217;t know what to say.&#8221; Depending on, like, on each side, which is kind of interesting. And there were some people were like, &#8220;Yo, you never acted this way when you were there.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Maybe I did and you didn&#8217;t notice.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Or, &#8220;Maybe when you knew me, I was going with &#8216;it is what it is.&#8217; So what&#8217;s the point in telling you about it?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
So writing is a way to sort of, I don&#8217;t know, let people see what it really was, even if you couldn&#8217;t do it in real time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think it can also sort of serve as a mirror back to you, particularly in terms of colloquial language. You have one post on here called Who All Gone Be There, which is so common, I think, for any person of color they&#8217;re going somewhere that&#8217;s mixed company.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
[crosstalk 01:35:12] talking about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;Who all gone be there? I need to know what I&#8217;m stepping into,&#8221; or something like that. Or even there&#8217;ll be posts that are named after song titles. There&#8217;s one called Shook Ones or something like that. Or even one where you&#8217;re breaking down the cost of a shoe, you know, or the materials and everything that go into it because people will, I think, certainly with the inflated sneaker economy now, people will look at a shoe and wonder why it costs that much, but not thinking of everything that has to go into it with research and materials and all that sort of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Right. And what&#8217;s funny is, I think&#8230; And I watch what&#8217;s happened in the last 20 years with journalism is that, I don&#8217;t know, maybe 20 years ago there would be, especially sports journalists, I think that&#8217;s kind of where it started with like, &#8220;Oh, this is the hip hop journalist, and he speaks in a vernacular that connects to the people and uses hip hop slang,&#8221; and yada, yada, yada. It&#8217;s one of those. Or &#8220;Y&#8217;all just letting him write and just write what he would write to his friends.&#8221; And so for me, I think that connection point of calling it Shook Ones is not&#8230; I&#8217;m not trying to connect with you. I&#8217;m not apologizing. It&#8217;s just like, &#8220;You know where it&#8217;s from. I know where it&#8217;s from. So that&#8217;s how we communicate. That&#8217;s how communication works. I don&#8217;t know any Billy Joel songs to impart to you how I&#8217;m feeling about it, so I can&#8217;t do that. And if I could, then I would connect with&#8230; Are there Billy Joel people listening?&#8221; No shade to Billy Joel, but that&#8217;s sort of&#8230; I&#8217;m just talking the way I talk in the group chats with folk.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah,</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s sort of&#8230; And I think that was&#8230; And writing helped me&#8230; I talk about this a lot. I grew up swearing like nobody&#8217;s business, and I don&#8217;t know if we cool. We know what you like. I could swear left or right. Writing helps me like, &#8220;All right, let&#8217;s change some of those words. Sometimes it bes what it bes.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And to your point, it also, you know, even, I think, as it reflected through the makeup of your team, it shows them that being able to express themselves authentically doesn&#8217;t make them any less of a professional.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
You know what&#8217;s wild is&#8230; And I talk about this a lot with folks who are of my age group, who are in this weird late forties, early fifties, where we sort of went through a history of trying to code switch. And like I said, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m necessarily good at it. I think I tried it enough, but I don&#8217;t know that anybody bought it. But the idea that young folks don&#8217;t care to code switch.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
They just show up how they show up and talking to folks who are my age. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yo, don&#8217;t get caught out there code switching because the young folks would call you out on it and they ain&#8217;t listening. They don&#8217;t have time for you to be worrying about what you got a bonnet on at the airport. It&#8217;s just not [crosstalk 01:38:08].</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
It should just be you every day. And it&#8217;s difficult because we came from an age group where we were taught when you show up, you&#8217;re in their space. You need to respect [crosstalk 01:38:18].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, respectability politics.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Exactly. And it&#8217;s sort of&#8230; I was lucky enough to&#8230; And I say this all the time. I have amazing credit only because when I got my Discover Card in college, it was like, &#8220;Yo, you can either pay this much or you can pay this little bit and all these other numbers about what you pay for the next six months.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m too lazy to do that. I&#8217;m just going to pay the big number.&#8221; So I never had debt because I just paid the big number. So it&#8217;s not because I was smart and knew, &#8220;Ooh, I want to get good credit.&#8221; It was I just don&#8217;t want to deal with the headache.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Same is true about&#8230; I was just like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to wear a tie to work ever. I don&#8217;t want one of those jobs. I&#8217;m not going to go work there. I just want to wear sneakers to work.&#8221; I just chose that, not knowing it was going to be&#8230; I didn&#8217;t choose this because it would make me money. I didn&#8217;t choose it because it would provide me money to buy a house and not have to assimilate so much. I did it because I just liked sneakers and I liked the culture. And I think young folks are more and more for the technology to exist, they get to do the same. They&#8217;re just trying to figure out what it all means because they&#8217;re being told by older people, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s adulthood time. So now you have to follow in line and you&#8217;ve got to wear your hair a certain way.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;No, thank you. But [crosstalk 01:39:33].&#8221; So I think it&#8217;s cool that people can be who they&#8217;re going to be and old people like me get to help them do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Yo, this drives me and everyone else crazy that I want to be able to just walk down the street and not have to go anywhere and everything comes to Harlem because we made it possible. I went from, I don&#8217;t know, doing product design a few years back to ad and content creation. And now I&#8217;m missing a call right now about NFTs, which I had no idea about, but, &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s go learn about NFTs and the process and the drops and all this other stuff.&#8221; And it&#8217;s one of those&#8230; I think the strategy mindset, the creative mindset, and a little bit of, I think, luck along the way of having some wins, folks invite us to parties, whether it&#8217;s just me or my entire team. I think people trusting my team as they get better. And the team&#8217;s starting to have their own sort of mentees below them to kind of grow the business for all of us.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And even if they go run and create their own agency, it&#8217;s all good. I kind of want this fun growth to keep, I think&#8230; I used to say making stuff was cool, and now I&#8217;m to the point where making stuff has taken a different personality, given my thoughts on sustainability. And sometimes it&#8217;s not making stuff is the answer, but figuring out how&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
My biggest thing in terms of conversations in the last probably three months has been on housing justice here in New York City. And I think that&#8217;s not the standard conversation for maybe a creative, but I think the thought process and the connections and the ideation that myself and my team, the folks I hang out with and bring to the table just, I don&#8217;t know, open up the vision on some of those things. And I think that&#8217;s what I mean when I say putting things&#8230; And I&#8217;ve always said this. If you can create, I don&#8217;t know, some systemic change in Harlem and Atlanta and Oakland, in places like Detroit, I think if that starts to stick and ownership becomes a big piece of it, I think there&#8217;s some conversations that are really going to be had.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
And then their less talking about, &#8220;Oh, well, I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;ll give them a chance, but we&#8217;re good. We did this. We&#8217;re good.&#8221; And I think that&#8217;s where I&#8217;d want to be. Even if it&#8217;s not me, I&#8217;m just hanging around people who are doing those things. That&#8217;s my five years from now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
So definitely come hang out&#8230; For the most part, if you want to find out about all the fun we&#8217;re having, find us at GoodThin.gs, G-O-O-D-T-H-I-N.gs. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be in the bio and byline. That&#8217;s where we have our fun. That&#8217;s where we give back to the community. That&#8217;s where we show how we hang out. You want to book us for business? Definitely come to andthem.com. We keep it professional. You can write us checks and we&#8217;re all good. Ready to do stuff. And then definitely, I don&#8217;t know, we&#8217;re making some shoes. We&#8217;re doing apparel next. You can see NinetyNineProducts and Jackson YC. my guy [Royce 01:42:42] is doing Silk City. We got a few hustles going on, some fun. So please, you don&#8217;t have to read all the reading [inaudible 01:42:49] is doing. Greatly appreciate it, but you can come check out and see some of the creative stuff we&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s good reading, y&#8217;all. Don&#8217;t listen to him. It&#8217;s good reading. Jeffrey Henderson, thank you so much for coming on the show. I think, you know, from hearing your story, from looking at your work and, again, even from the research that I&#8217;ve done, to me, there is a certain deep sense of thoughtfulness that you bring to your work that perhaps I don&#8217;t know if you even recognize how thoughtful it is in terms of doing work for the community and making sure that you&#8217;re creating this nurturing space for young creatives and everything. I think it&#8217;s something that more of us need to see in the industry. We need to see, of course, I think just more Black agency owners, but also more Black agency owners that are kind of bucking the trend or changing the paradigm or showing that it&#8217;s okay to be thoughtful and do great work like this and not have to stick to, you know, any sort of archaic or a draconian style of running a business, that you can do great work and have fun and it can be a nurturing space.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I definitely see that care and thoughtfulness that you bring to your work, and I&#8217;m appreciative of it. I&#8217;m sure that folks listening think that way as well. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Jeffrey Henderson:</b><br>
Thank you so much. I&#8217;m glad to be on that list of hundreds of people who you bring in, I think. Visibility too. I love what you&#8217;re doing. So however I can be a part of this, I&#8217;m happy to help. Thank you.</p>
