Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>We&#8217;re exploring the intersections of design, music, and social impact with this week&#8217;s guest, Sam Viotty. Not only is Sam an extremely knowledgeable program and experience designer, but she&#8217;s also the co-owner of a record label and <a href="https://www.luc.edu/baumhartcenter/bios/samviotty/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">she&#8217;s an adjunct professor at Loyola&#8217;s Quinlan School of Business</a>. And that&#8217;s just scratching the surface!</p>
<p>We started off by defining program design and experience design, and from there Sam talked about her label, <a href="https://www.rosedalecollective.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Rosedale Collective</a>, and her dedication to showcasing BIPOC voices in country music. She also dove into her previous work at The Obama Foundation, and how that opened her world to the importance of design in project management and social innovation (and for starting her own company, Viotty Design Studio). Sam even talked a bit about her current role at Adobe, and shared her plans on what she hopes to accomplish in the near future.</p>
<p>Sam&#8217;s career is a lesson in how we can all reshape our perspective on the conventional borders of design &#8212; something important to learn in this ever-changing world!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m Sam Viotty. I&#8217;m a program and experience designer, a creative at heart, and someone who really just loves design all things design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Just before we really kind of get into the conversation, I&#8217;d love for you to explain just off the top, like, what does experience design and program design mean to you? And the reason I&#8217;m asking this is because oftentimes and we&#8217;ll, I think, get to this later in our conversation oftentimes when people think of design, they&#8217;ll only think UI/UX, visual type of thing. What does experience design and program design mean to you?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I think a lot of the time when I say program design, people are like, you design computer programs? I&#8217;m like, no, not that kind of design. Or they&#8217;re like interior design. And so program and experience design really to me is thinking about service and experiences for people. It really is people design in how I see it. So when we&#8217;re designing the ways that people interact with one another, build relationships, operate in the world professionally, develop themselves, that&#8217;s how I see program design. So really designing programs and experiences that people go through and then experience design, I think is a little bit more broad than program design. So it includes program design, but also thinking about events and experiences and things that people kind of experiencing go through. So events, conferences, those types of things, all thinking about not just what people are going experiencing, but seeing, smelling what they&#8217;re taking away.</p>
<p>A lot of it is like learning. So overall experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So it&#8217;s kind of like an encompassing it&#8217;s funny you mentioned event because that&#8217;s really sort of something that indulges or can indulge all of your senses. What you see, the swag you pick up, any sort of beverages or drinks or food or anything like all of that kind of can fall into the realm of experience, design, it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Correct? Yeah, absolutely right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>How have things been going for you this year?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a busy year. I was traveling a lot. I took on just, like, really trying to spend a lot of time thinking about what is my life outside of my professional work. I live in Los Angeles, so I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time outdoors. Started hiking this year. Yeah, I just really trying to absorb a lot of the outdoors now that I live in a warm climate. I grew up on the East Coast, and so it&#8217;s really nice to spend more time outdoors more times during the year. And I feel like it&#8217;s definitely ignited my creativity in a way that it hasn&#8217;t before.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m really excited about that. So, yeah, spending lots of time outdoors reading, trying to figure out this has been an exploratory year, and I think next year will be more of the taking action on those exploratory ideas. But I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about I&#8217;ve always thought of myself as a designer and a creative and an artist, but recently have more thought about myself as being a curator. So really trying to dive into what that means.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And also, I should say congratulations are in order. I was doing my research, and I saw you were recently selected to participate in something called the 2023 Keychange US Talent Development Program. So congratulations on that.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Thank you so much. Really excited about it. It kicked off at the beginning of October with a cohort of 25 really incredible human beings. It made my heart really warm to spend, like, three days with all of them started in October and it ends in March. So I&#8217;m really at the beginning of the program right now, and so far we&#8217;ve only had a few interactions, so one in person and two virtual events together. And I already feel like I&#8217;m a part of a community, which is why I applied. I was really excited about being a part of a larger music and artist creative community in Los Angeles. But it&#8217;s a Los Angeles, New York and Nashville based program, so we&#8217;re also the first US cohort.</p>
<p>So I love being a part of a pilot program. We&#8217;ll probably get into this later, but yeah, I&#8217;ve been a part of a lot of pilot first time programs, which really is exciting to me to kind of lay the groundwork for what&#8217;s to come. It&#8217;s been really fun. We&#8217;ve spent time working together. We went to Joshua Tree Music Festival together. I&#8217;ve never gone to a music festival for work before as fun, so that was amazing. Yeah. Being a professional at a music festival is interesting.</p>
<p>It was really so four of the participants in the program also performed, and it was the first time I got to see them perform. So just seeing the people who are your peers do their thing on stage was just like a proud mom sitting in the audience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>So, yeah, it&#8217;s a really beautiful community that they&#8217;ve built.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And now you said it&#8217;s the first US based cohort. Is it normally international?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>It sounds like yeah, it&#8217;s an EU funded program, so they mostly do projects in Europe, and so this is the first time they&#8217;re doing a cohort in the United States, which is exciting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And now what will you be doing as part of the program? Is this affiliated with some of your other work?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>It is. So I applied as an innovator. So it&#8217;s twelve innovators and 13 musicians or artists who come together to work just professionally develop. So really thinking about what is your career? I&#8217;m the co-founder of a small indie music accelerator and label focused on uplifting the voices of people of color in country, folk and Americana music. We&#8217;re expanding to other genres of music. So think like genres that you don&#8217;t normally see people of color on the charts. We&#8217;re helping amplify those. I applied thinking, how incredible would it be to be a part of a cohort of people who are working towards similar things, trying to achieve equity in the music space, trying to change the music industry.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working in the music industry for a few years now, and it&#8217;s very interesting. It is unlike any industry that I&#8217;ve ever worked in. I used to work in nonprofit, I moved to the private sector. But music feels very different. And living in Los Angeles, on any Wednesday, you&#8217;ll go grab lunch and you&#8217;re like, Why is it crowded? Because everyone&#8217;s having a lunch work meeting within a different culture than I&#8217;ve ever experienced. Yeah, it&#8217;s very different. I applied thinking, how do I build my music community and work alongside other musicians and innovators to change how the music industry operates. A lot of the label is called Rosedale Collective.</p>
<p>We really often think about how do we change the way that artists are treated and supported and how do they have ownership, in particular, Black and brown people having ownership over the work that they create. So how do we revision no pun intended, actually, how do we revision a way forward for how artists create work and work with labels? And so we&#8217;ve designed a residency program that is a year long. We&#8217;ve done a few that are shorter. We have not launched our long term, one year long program yet, but we&#8217;re working on that. But the long term vision is you support a cohort of artists throughout a year. You pay them a salary and they get to focus on making the art. And then instead of owning the It or the masters to the work that the artists create, we revenue share throughout across all of the different categories that an artist to make money. So through merch and royalties on streaming and touring.</p>
<p>So we split those and instead of just outright owning the work, an artist gets to keep ownership. So we&#8217;re really trying to rethink how the industry makes money with artists, and right now they&#8217;re making money off of artists. So we&#8217;re like, how do we make money with you instead of off of you?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>First off, that is a fascinating model. I mean, I think there&#8217;s no shortage of horror stories about musicians getting shafted in some way by the music industry or taken advantage of or something. So I love that you sort of have this revenue share thing and then also the fact that the focus is on a genre of music. I know you said you want to expand it, but you&#8217;re focusing right now on country music, which, again, is probably not seen as very super diverse. Like, I can probably count the number of Black country artists. There&#8217;s more now than when I was a kid. I&#8217;ll say that in terms of visibility, but yeah, that&#8217;s such an awesome I mean, I feel like there&#8217;s a great story behind even the fact that you co own a record label. That is amazing.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fun, actually. I met my co-founders at a conference in DC while I was working at the Obama Foundation. We got tickets to A Day of Healing and Restorative Justice. And so I was like, I&#8217;d love to not go into the office today. I&#8217;d rather be at a conference. And so met these people who are working at the intersection of social impact and entertainment. And I was like, this is such a cool job. You just get to use celebrity money to change the world.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s awesome. I was 25 then, so I was still doe-eyed and excited&#8230;a little jaded now. So I was very excited about that. And so I kept in contact with the people who were working there, and they reached out to me in 2020 about starting a record label and thinking about designing programs for people of color in the country music space. And so I was like, I don&#8217;t know a ton about country music. I know a little Shania Twain, but I do know that it feels pretty racist and so that I can get behind challenging that. And so how do we really think about what music would look like and how it would be different if Black people or people of color kind of were at the forefront? So country music was made by people of color. And so Charley Pride is one of our people that we look up to.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, how do we just reclaim a genre that really was made by Black people? And now the face of country music is not a Black person, not in the United States and not on the top charts. So how do we reclaim that? So we spent a lot of time thinking about narrative change and really redesigning the system of the music industry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, I feel like there&#8217;s a lot that has to go behind designing a label. I mean, of course you think of general things like album art and logos and things of that nature, but the design and business of putting something like that together, that seems like such a huge undertaking.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to be honest, I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing. I still don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing. And I think it actually has been really beneficial that I stepped into the music industry not knowing how the music industry works, because I&#8217;ve just been doing what I think makes sense, and that doesn&#8217;t necessarily align with what actually happens. And so I&#8217;m like, yeah, I think artists should own their work. And people are like, well, it doesn&#8217;t really work that way because we don&#8217;t make a profit. I&#8217;m like, well, that doesn&#8217;t make sense. We could figure out a way to make money while also letting people own things that they make. So let&#8217;s just design that.</p>
<p>I very lucky. My co-founder is an incredible&#8230;I don&#8217;t think he would consider himself a designer, but he designed our logo, and I think it&#8217;s genius. It&#8217;s a circle that has lines going through it and it&#8217;s the middle of a guitar. It&#8217;s a really amazing logo. I&#8217;m very proud of the logo. So we put it on everything. I wear a sweatshirt. I have a hat. Stickers.</p>
<p>And so thinking about how do we take symbols of country music and redefine them? Because I think right now people think country music. I think or before this, I used to think cowboy hat, cowboy shoots, cowboy boots. So what are the symbols of country music? And what are the symbols of country music for people of color. The guitar is one of them. We work with some other organizations who really like to uplift Black and brown artists. One of them is Black Opry, and so their logo is also a guitar. So just thinking about the symbols and iconography for black country music has been really exciting because I think it&#8217;s a different language. Like, we&#8217;re speaking a different language to a different audience.</p>
<p>And so I spent a lot of my time in undergrad thinking about symbols and iconography. And so it was exciting to bring that piece to the label. And thinking about a label, it&#8217;s like developing a brand. We developed a brand before we did anything. We came up with colors and a logo and a design and a deck. And so so much of it was like, how do we communicate who we are and what we do before we&#8217;ve even done anything? Which lots of conversations, lots of talking to people before we did a single thing, we did a listening and learning tour where we talked to tens of musicians, like 100 music execs and people in the music industry and in the nonprofit space trying to change things, social impact people. So just spend a lot of time talking to people to be like, what are people looking at? What do people feel and how do we communicate what we&#8217;re trying to communicate? And who is our audience, actually? So goes into a lot of the design work. When I went to grad school, I went to grad school at Emerson in a pilot program.</p>
<p>It was called Civic Media Art and Practice. And so that&#8217;s where I learned about design thinking. And so I&#8217;ve brought design thinking into ever since I&#8217;ve learned about it, I&#8217;ve brought it into every single job. And so I think when I don&#8217;t know what to do, I just rely on that process. I&#8217;m like, it&#8217;ll be good, we&#8217;ll just figure out how. It&#8217;s like the scientific method. I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t know how to get an answer, but if we just use this process, I can get us to figuring out how we get an answer. We did a lot of that.</p>
<p>And so that first stage of talking and listening to people is very similar to the empathy stage and the design thinking process.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I say that all the time to people about how design thinking is very much like the scientific method. So I&#8217;m glad that we see eye to eye on that.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I explained it like that. I&#8217;m like, it&#8217;s the same thing. People just yeah, anthropologists looked at it and I guess the design school looked at it and then rebrand it&#8217;s all branding. They rebranded it, but it&#8217;s the same thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I think what you&#8217;re doing with one, shining a light on country music and also promoting and uplifting artists, BIPOC artists, et cetera, in country is great because I grew up as a musician. I grew up as a jazz musician mostly, but there was one thing about like and this might be a bit of a stretch, so if it is, please let me know. But I feel like a lot of could do really well as contemporary country songs. I feel like there&#8217;s a thin line between Toni Braxton and that being a country song. I&#8217;m thinking love should have like &#8220;Love Shoulda Brought You Home&#8221; could totally be a country song.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>I absolutely could be a country song. We used to jokingly make a criteria checklist for what is a country song. One was like, is it about love or heartbreak? Check. Does it have a Twang check? I think you&#8217;re right. The only thing missing from the twang, like, if they all had a twang, they would absolutely be country.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yes. A lot of, like, Anita Baker songs could definitely also sound like country songs. She has like, a slight Twang. But I get what you mean though. There is sort of a checklist of like, is it heartbreak? Is it lament in some capacity then it could totally be a country song. Now, we talked about Rosedale, but also you have another job where you work for Adobe. Can you talk a little bit about what you do there?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, that is really exciting. I spend most of my time working at Adobe now. It&#8217;s one of those companies that when you&#8217;re young and in college and you think about design and education and what&#8217;s the coolest job you could have. It is the job I have now. And I think that&#8217;s incredible. College me would be very proud. So right now, I lead all of Adobe&#8217;s higher education professional development. So training programs for faculty and students in higher education in the United States.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re expanding to the United Kingdom and Australia. Starting to think globally about what does it mean and what are the skills that a 21st century college graduate needs in order to operate in the world. Adobe is notorious for being extremely challenging, having a high learning, a very difficult learning curve and being quite know one financially. And also, just like, the tools are complicated and there are a lot of them. Adobe has launched something called Adobe Express, which is the kind of premier product that I work on and work with schools to use. So think of the rival Canva as&#8230;Canva was a response to Adobe being really difficult. Adobe Express is a response to that. And so it&#8217;s an incredible tool.</p>
<p>I think the thing that&#8217;s exciting about Adobe Express is it has the generative AI in it, which is really helpful now and interesting, brings a conversation about ethics and IP and copyright, which Adobe is big on, especially because we&#8217;ve been working with artists and illustrators and graphic designers for ages. I spend a lot of my time helping faculty and schools and instructional designers think about what does it need to be a digitally fluent individual? And so how do you redesign your curriculum so that students are getting the skills that they need to be successful beyond college. So instead of maybe writing that ten page paper, what does it look like to help a student create an assignment that is actually a video storytelling project or create a podcast instead of the paper? So what is the alternative to the typical research paper? Because in my personal job, I am not writing research paper long things anymore. I am doing research and then applying it to a project. And so how do we do a little bit more project based learning at the higher ed level? I think a lot of K Twelve and high schools have taken this on, which is incredible. But I think the project based learning often happens either in really vocational or technical student projects. So if you&#8217;re in a graphic design class or create this poster or create a project for a client, those things happen. But in the kind of social sciences and English classes that&#8217;s not really happening.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still pretty static and it&#8217;s like write a paper to respond to this. And I&#8217;m like, the world that we live in now doesn&#8217;t really do that. So how do we change how we&#8217;re thinking about it? And how do we cultivate the skills that people need? Creating presentations, marketing on social media, creating posters, creating graphics like everyone video and short form storytelling. Short form video is the primary way that people communicate now. They cannot scroll on any social media without seeing video. How do we cultivate those skills to make sure that students are signed up for success? So I spent a lot of my time doing that, which is really cool because I was really interested. I started my career in education and then I also just have always had this passion for being creative and working with creatives and just thinking about arts and culture. And so I feel like I get to bring those worlds together in my role at Adobe.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now that is fascinating. You&#8217;re designing education or you&#8217;re designing the way that people are learning about these new tools and these new methods. And I&#8217;m curious, does that work and the work you do with Rosedale collectors, does that bleed into each other in any way? It feels like that could be a lot to possibly try to balance it.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Is it&#8217;s like, you know, corporate world and also working at a small indie, but I sit in between the education team and the marketing team. And so I&#8217;ve learned so much about corporate marketing through working at Adobe, which as an Indie label and accelerator, we have the finances to play small. But I&#8217;m like how do we play big? Because that&#8217;s how the music industry works. There&#8217;s so much like everyone&#8217;s a musician, everyone can be right. And so how do you get the people that you want to bubble to the top? And it&#8217;s marketing. I was talking about those interviews earlier and we talked to so many artists, and I&#8217;d say, what do you need help with? What&#8217;s your biggest struggle right now? It is not songwriting. It is not making the music. It is not finding a producer.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t even touring. It is marketing. They&#8217;re like, how do I get someone to hear my music? It&#8217;s marketing and distribution. And so I&#8217;ve learned a lot about marketing and distribution in this corporate role and seeing how that plays out and being able to say, okay, if that&#8217;s true here, how do we apply it to how do we use some of these strategies for our artists and teach them how to do it for themselves? And so I see my role in both of them as I&#8217;m professionally developing people. They&#8217;re just different. But coincidentally, the artists that I work with are about the same age as the students who faculty are working with. I have a similar audience. Like, how do I prepare these 18 to 25 year olds with 21st century skills to be successful in the world to either market themselves, market the things that they&#8217;re working on, and really tell stories?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, I think what you&#8217;re doing is just such extremely important work because I think what we&#8217;ve definitely seen over the past few years is that our systems are changing. I mean, definitely with the advent of AI and things, we&#8217;re seeing how that&#8217;s been affecting certain industries. But even like you said, with marketing and getting content out there, it&#8217;s even weird to call it old school. But the old school ways, which we knew about how to market things and how to learn things are changing. And a lot of that is due to technology. So I think you being at the forefront of that, particularly with sitting kind of between marketing and education teams, that sounds like a dream. I mean, I&#8217;m speaking for myself, but that sounds like a dream job to have.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Again, I think college undergrad me would be like, if someone asked me what job I wanted, it would be this one. And so I&#8217;m excited about that. The other thing that I just so excited about is generative AI. I know that it&#8217;s a hot topic, but working at Adobe and seeing just, like, how these tools have allowed people to make things that they wouldn&#8217;t have created before, same. Like, I also am an illustrator. Not a great one, but it&#8217;s my hobby. It has enabled me to create things that I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to create before.</p>
<p>And not in a plagiarism way, but I&#8217;m like removing the background from something. Used to take ages in Photoshop. Now in Adobe Express, it&#8217;s a like, it has saved me time. Technology is catching up with how quickly and how fast the world is. Like, things happen and then it is online in seconds, and the tools are starting to catch up to that. So I&#8217;ve been really excited about how do we leverage those tools to ignite creativity because I&#8217;m someone who procrastinates, and I also get really stuck. I think generative AI has helped me get unstuck as a brainstorming. Like, you know, let me just pop it in and see what I can start with.</p>
<p>Whereas before, I kind of just sit and wait and then never do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Just recently we had Andre Foster on the show and he has a motion graphics company in Detroit called First Fight and he talks about how he uses generative AI, kind of in the same way that you mentioned it. He uses it like a I think he likened it to a Pinterest board or a mood board where it&#8217;s a good place to sort of just take the idea from your head and start to instantly visualize it, to see where you could possibly go next with it.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Love that. I totally agree with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, you talked about growing up on the East Coast, so I would like to kind of shift the conversation towards that and learn more about just sort of how you got to where you are now. So you grew up on the East Coast. Were you kind of always exposed to a lot of art and creativity and such growing up?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. I grew up in New York City, so every field trip was to a museum. When I was in school. I also had parents who were really excited about the arts. My mother was a dancer, just really excited about performance arts. And with my grandmother and then my dad and my dad&#8217;s mother. My dad&#8217;s mother was a teacher. I was excited about reading as a kid.</p>
<p>He spent so much time at the library. I used to pick out books, and very often I would pick books based on their covers in contrary to what you&#8217;re told. I was like, if it looks cool on the outside, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s cool on the inside. And so I was just really excited about that. I used to draw a lot. Like, the Christmas gifts that I used to get as a kid was like, I don&#8217;t know if you remember those. Really big. I hope they still make them.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t seen them in a while, but it&#8217;s like pastel crayons paint.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, yeah, those 130 piece art kits or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yes. And they&#8217;d have a bunch of pencils, and I never used to use they had, like, four types of pencils, and I was like, I don&#8217;t know what anyone&#8217;s doing with this. I like the color, so I used to get those every year. I&#8217;d ask for a new one. I didn&#8217;t always need a new one, but, yeah, I used to run the cray pods down to the bone, and so I used to play with those all the time. And so I&#8217;d, like, draw pictures of our family, draw pictures of the sky, draw pictures of the books that I&#8217;d read. Spent a lot of time drawing and. Creating.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like, do cutouts. I used to play with paper dolls all the time, just always thinking about what I can now see in retrospect is design. And my dad, who just was so proud of me, used to, in our basement, created kind of like a little curatorial gallery of my work on a string through the basement. So anytime I came down or people came down, it felt like a gallery show. And so I always loved museums and art. Yeah, my art was all over the house. Like, it was on the fridge, it was on the walls, it was upstairs. And so I was really encouraged to express my creativity.</p>
<p>My dad was a computer nerd, and so he tried to teach me computer programming when I was younger. I think it was called Logo?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Logo, with the turtle!</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yes, with the turtle! So my dad was&#8230;yes, he tried to teach me that. I hated it. I was like, this is so boring. I can&#8217;t stand this. He&#8217;s like, but you can create art with it.</p>
<p>I was just, I&#8217;m not interested. I really regret it. I wish I became a computer scientist, but I just constantly encouraged. I used to use the Paint app on Microsoft and on, you know, all kids, but I was really into just, like, creating, and I was really encouraged to create, which I&#8217;m so grateful for now. I think my parents really let me explore, at least when I was a child. This changes a bit when I get older, but while I was a child, in my adolescence, I was very much encouraged to paint, create, make things get messy, do whatever, and explore my creativity, whether it was, like making my own clothes, designing clothes, designing paper, making notebooks, writing stories, like, anything. And I think that I brought a lot of that into how I kind of exist now and explore my creativity now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Did that shift happen in high school?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yang it did. And I think it&#8217;s funny that, you know, that I was not encouraged to explore art when I was in high school. I remember I liked our art class, and I did quite well. My dad was excited, so my mom passed away when I was six. So a little hard. My dad had to take on being a single parent and then remarried. My parents were divorced at the time, so it wasn&#8217;t like that stark of they&#8217;re dating someone else difference. But I was close to the woman who is now my stepmother, who I&#8217;m very close with and who helped raise me.</p>
<p>She was a nurse, and so registered nurse. And so just like a very practical human in a way that maybe my dad and I were not. And so she&#8217;s like, you need a practical job. Need you to get a practical skills, like, what are we doing? Which I think she&#8217;s brought the logic to my creativity, which is wonderful. But once I got to high school, I was not discouraged from taking art classes, but it was like, well, then what are you going to do? I used to use my room as a curatorial space. I&#8217;d buy as many magazines as I could, and then my walls were completely covered with images, and I just would always do that. I&#8217;d look at font type and ads. I was like, how do I create this? And I wanted to go into advertising and market and communications, but my parents were just like, maybe I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>My dad was like, Please go into science. I was like, I&#8217;m really not good at physics. And my mom was like, Please do something practical. And so I was kind of, like, torn. And all I really wanted to do was change the world. Then I just became privy. I went to a predominantly Asian school in New York City. So 50% of the population was Asian, maybe 20% was white, and then the rest was, like, Black and Latino.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, maybe Southeast Asian. It was a very interesting mix, but just was starting to become more privy to racism, I think. Growing up in New York City, I&#8217;d always thought in high school, thought, I&#8217;d go to such a diverse school, I&#8217;ve gone to diverse schools, everything&#8217;s fine, and then realizing the world just doesn&#8217;t operate in the ways that it should. Extreme poverty exists. I want to work in that. How do I do that? And my parents were not excited that they were proud of me, but they were not excited about that career path. My mom&#8217;s like, you want to go into nonprofit, you&#8217;re not going to make any money. And so I ignored them and went to college.</p>
<p>So I went to college at Wheaton College in Massachusetts. Small liberal arts college, about 1600 students. So very small campus was like, you could run around it. I couldn&#8217;t even really get my laps off when I go for a run because it was only a mile and barely. So it&#8217;s a very small campus. And so I was like, I&#8217;m just going to major in English. I wanted to go into marketing, communications, but small liberal arts college only had English as a major. I was like, Seems close enough.</p>
<p>I major in English. My parents are like, sounds fine. It seems like a scale. Great. And I start applying to internships, and I&#8217;m not getting anything. Like, absolutely nothing. I&#8217;m like, I can write things. This seems practical.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on? But I was applying to things that were a little bit more creative, a little bit more ad comms marketing, and I think they were, like, looking for someone who was in that. My junior year, there&#8217;s a new major called Film and New Media Studies, and so it sat within the English department, and so I could take film classes as an English major, and so I did. And the first class I took was race and racism in U.S. cinema. Blew my mind, was excited. I was like, this is all I want to do forever. I need to change my major right now. I know I&#8217;m getting ready to graduate, but I have to.</p>
<p>And I also need to study abroad. So how do I make it happen? My professor and advisor at the time. Incredible. Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to do. You&#8217;re going to switch your major. You&#8217;re just going to change it, and you&#8217;re going to go to Australia because that&#8217;s where they have a mutual program. And you&#8217;ll study film and graphic design there. You&#8217;ll make up your freshman credit for the major, and then you&#8217;ll come back and you&#8217;ll finish the credits and you&#8217;ll graduate on time.</p>
<p>I was like, great. Sounds lovely. I changed my major to New Media Film and New Media Studies on my resume before even changing it formally on paper. And all of a sudden I&#8217;m getting responses back on internships. People are so happy to talk to you. This is ridiculous. And that to me, is the epitome of that&#8217;s. The power of branding and marketing.</p>
<p>Yeah, pursued that. I was excited about Film and New Media Studies. I didn&#8217;t love actually being behind the camera. I was like a senior in freshman classes in Film Production 101, learning about Aperture. I was like, I don&#8217;t want to do this. This is not fun for me. I was like, Can I just tell someone what to do? Isn&#8217;t that a thing? And someone&#8217;s like, oh, you want to be a director? Yes, exactly. So, yeah, I moved a little bit away from technical film and really loved the theory and things like that.</p>
<p>And so I was able to explore ideas of concepts of social justice and equity and race and representation through that studies and then took that into my hope. I was hoping to take it into my professional career, which I did, which quite different as my first job, which was I was helping first generation college students get into college when I first graduated, which there&#8217;s more similarities than I thought. I was really excited about that role, and I wrote a lot. I helped every single student tell their story, writing college essays. I reviewed lots of college essays, lots of supplemental essays. They ended up being more connected than I thought they would be. But yeah, I did not go into a Film and New Media Studies advertising role right after college like I wanted to. But I think supporting students to get into college was really an impactful, one that led me to the career that I have now in education.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, I feel like, and I&#8217;ve said this on the show also before college is really that time for you to experiment and explore exactly what it is that you want to do. And I think it&#8217;s specifically for the reasons that it sounds like your parents didn&#8217;t want you to go into some specific field. I mean, K through twelve, we&#8217;re kind of booked or we&#8217;re sort of subconsciously shaped and molded into a particular trajectory that we may not even want, we may not even want to do. I know for me, when I was growing up, I really wanted to write and I wanted to major in English, and my mom was like, no, you stay on that computer. You&#8217;re going to do something with that computer. Like, you&#8217;re going to major in something with that. And I liked web design, but I also went to a small liberal arts college, and this was in the oh, my God, I&#8217;m dating myself. This is in the they didn&#8217;t have web design, so I was like, oh, I&#8217;m going to be a computer science major.</p>
<p>And that was not web design back then. I mean, we&#8217;re talking 1999, 2000. That was not web design. That curriculum did not exist. You learned it on your own, and you just kind of hoped to make a way for it. It wasn&#8217;t something you went to school for. But I say all of that to say college is really that time where you&#8217;re able to branch out and see where your interests take you. I mean, there&#8217;s very few places outside of that particular type of institution where you&#8217;re allowed to explore and play and do different things, and it won&#8217;t have a detriment on your status as a human in this capitalist world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Totally. And I wish I knew it. I guess I felt it then that that&#8217;s what it was for. My parents were like, the tuition money four years, so explore all you want within that amount of time. So I felt like there was a ticking time bomb. And I was one of those kids who was like, I literally cannot go back home after college. I can&#8217;t live my parents. I am an only child who is just constantly being helicoptered.</p>
<p>I need to live elsewhere for all of us, for everybody. And so I really need a job. I need a job that pays me enough to leave. And so, yeah, I moved to Boston. So my school&#8217;s in Massachusetts. I ended up moving to Boston right after college and lived there for quite a bit. But yeah, college was an interesting time, and I loved school. I was one of those kids who loved school.</p>
<p>When I was younger, I looked forward to going to school. I think part of it was being an only child, because I make all these designs and stuff, and the only person looking at them was my dad or friends who came over occasionally. So I was so excited to go to school and get affirmation from teachers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I 100% know what that&#8217;s like. I mean, I wasn&#8217;t the only child. I had an older brother. But yeah, to get that sort of validation that the work that you&#8217;re doing means something, it&#8217;s actually making an impression on other people. I was very much. Oh, yeah. Especially in college. I was very much like a school kid.</p>
<p>Like, I did not want to go back to Alabama. I&#8217;m like, we have to make it out. I don&#8217;t know what that looks like, but we got to get out. We can&#8217;t go backwards. Now. In 2017, you started working at the Obama Foundation, and you sort of touched on some of your early career things that you did right after Wheaton. How was your time at the Obama Foundation? Like, how did you sort of start there?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>That was like I remember getting my offer verbally, and I just was stunned. I was like, I cannot believe I&#8217;m about to work for the person who was the first Black president of the United States. It meant so much to me. I think it was after he was in the presidency, so he made a foundation really focused on organizing community work for young people. I worked on the education team at the Obama Foundation, which, again, mixing education with what I was excited to end, like, changing the world. I was like, my goodness, dream job. And it&#8217;s so, like, at every stage that I&#8217;ve had a job, it&#8217;s been like a dream job only. And now I&#8217;m in a job that I also think is my dream job.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m like, what will I think years later when I have another job? Anyway, it was incredible. I have made the closest friends I&#8217;ve ever made. It was an interesting time. I think a lot of I never worked on a campaign before, but I imagine some of the campaign culture had seeped into our workplace. And so all of us were very close, spent a lot of time together trying to work towards the goal of empowering 18 to 25 year olds to change their worlds and their communities. I loved it. It was incredible. I was hired as an experienced designer, so thinking about our program, so the education team had one program at the time.</p>
<p>I was there for a few years, and so we developed more programs, but the original program was like a one day experience for 150 18 to 25 year olds in Boston, Chicago, and Phoenix, Arizona. And so we went to each city, and we work with community organizations. We&#8217;d work with designers and organizers to really fire up these 18 to 25 year olds, get them passionate about the thing that they were excited about. So we&#8217;re like, what aren&#8217;t you passionate about? What do you care about? And how can we drive you to a plan of action to organize towards that? And so I saw my role as one just understanding our audience. So I spent so much time talking to the 18 to 25 year olds that we worked with. I set up design workshops. I would work with them. So I used a lot of my design thinking stuff from grad school that I learned and would go through that with them.</p>
<p>I taught a lot of our design thinking sessions, so I go from city to city just going through project based learning and talking about, how do we like, well, if this is what you care about, how do we develop a plan for that? How do you understand them? Who is your audience? A lot of 18 to 25 year olds are like, I want to end poverty. And I&#8217;m like, yes, where do we start? Like, poverty, poverty where? And so that was really exciting for me, and it was really impactful. I can still remember the day that we brought President Obama to meet all of the students who had been in the program. Not students, community members who had been in the program. And it was just, like, the most joyful I&#8217;ve ever seen. People are crying. They&#8217;re, like, falling down. He decides to shake every single one of their hands.</p>
<p>He was supposed to be going to a meeting with donors, and we were scheduling him to just take a photo. He was supposed to come and take a photo with the group. We&#8217;re very excited about that, that he was going to be able to do that. But he is supposed to be rushing to a donor meeting. He was already late. He was late to come get us for the photo. He finds out that he&#8217;s late to the donor meeting and is like, oh, well, and just stands there and shakes 350 hands. And so I&#8217;m so happy I got to witness that.</p>
<p>And so that was the power of his brand. I was so lucky to be able to I felt like I could walk into any room and just be listened to because of who we were representing and the power that that had for people in many communities across the united States. It just symbolized change. It symbolized hope. And I&#8217;d never been a part of a brand like that. I&#8217;d worked at many nonprofits, but obviously nothing like that. And so that experience is yeah, I loved working there. I met so many incredible people, so many smart people who have worked and lived all over, had different experiences, but everyone came together for this one central mission, which was to empower people.</p>
<p>To change the world is absolutely incredible. I think about that experience very often.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, if there&#8217;s any brand that could get you probably in the foot of any company, it would be Obama. I mean, God, that has been such an amazing experience to be able to do that kind of work. I think you kind of alluded to this a little bit earlier when you said, like, making I wrote it down. You said something about using celebrity money to change the world. That is awesome.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it was so great. And the other thing that I was able to do was, because I was our experience designer and helping to design our program, I got to choose who we put on so or who we got to put on a platform. And I was so excited about that. I was like, this is it. I get to choose the people of color that I want to be on stage or the people who I think are making a difference. I can get to curate that experience. So lucky. I&#8217;ve worked with Antionette Carroll and Chris Rudd, who have also been on this show, who were a part of that amazing program that we ran over the course of a few years.</p>
<p>So just really excited to be able to give opportunities to people who really deserve one recognition, the amplification, and just, like, the connection with the community that we really thought they were already doing but wanted to uplift them. So absolutely incredible. Got to work with a ton of designers and creators because I was working in that space, and you send an email with Obama.org attached to it, and people responded, which was, you know, there&#8217;s.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>A saying that you can&#8217;t be what you don&#8217;t see. And I can only imagine, because you had that level of access that it probably opened up for you a lot of possibilities of what you could do personally out in the world. I know while you were at the Obama Foundation, you started your own design studio, via studio. Did that sort of come from that time of seeing what was possible because of the Obama Foundation?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>It did. I didn&#8217;t know how much money existed in the world until I worked. Mean, like, talking to donors and who you have access to and who responds and what people are willing to do, and how many people of color I&#8217;d seen and worked with who started their own companies. So many of the designers that we worked with ran their own design firms. And I was like, oh, I can see how it&#8217;s possible. I had never thought of it before. I knew I wanted to start something when I was younger, but I didn&#8217;t know what. And so I started doing design consulting, so designing programs and giving design thinking advice and doing design sprints and workshops for other companies and nonprofits at the time.</p>
<p>But, yeah, I was so inspired by all the work that I was doing with other people. I was like, well, if you&#8217;re doing it, I think I might be able to do this, which is really exciting. And I had help. I mean, the connections that I made at the Obama Foundation and the people and the designers that I spoke, like, I don&#8217;t think people were trying to gatekeep at all, which I thought was really beautiful. People were like, I mean, I work with them. You should totally work with them. Let me just make an intro, which I had not experienced before. I think a lot of nonprofits that I worked with before that were gatekeeping, and I understand why.</p>
<p>It was like, well, if I tell this company or this grant about you. Will we get the money next year, right? So it was a lot of, like, I want to keep things to myself, but it was not like that at all. I was like, this is amazing. So everyone wanted to help each other, and so I was able to make connections and get clients pretty quickly. And a lot of them came from I think all of my first clients are Obama Foundation related.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow, that&#8217;s amazing. That&#8217;s amazing. Now, you were there for a number of years, and then afterwards you left and you went to work for a biotech startup, Curative. When you look back at that time, what do you remember? Because I could imagine it&#8217;s probably a lot different from nonprofit work, especially the Obama Foundation.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>So it was 2020. So the pandemic had hit, and I used to do programs in person at the Obama Foundation. 2020 happened. We&#8217;re doing programs virtually. I just was like, I don&#8217;t know that our programs virtually are doing the same thing that they were when they were in person. And so the world is in a really scary space. I want to be on the ground. And so I got recruited by Curative to lead all of their kind of expansion with communities.</p>
<p>So the job actually when I had that interview with Curative, the woman who hired me actually was in political organizing before that. And she was like, it&#8217;s actually she&#8217;s like, you&#8217;re telling me about your job at the Long Foundation, but she&#8217;s like, I think it&#8217;s really similar. I know it&#8217;s biotech, hear me out. But I think what you&#8217;re doing is, like, partnering and working with communities. We&#8217;re changing health care, and it&#8217;s the same thing, only it&#8217;s healthcare and not community organizing. And I was like, I think you&#8217;re right. So I partnered with community organizations to pop up COVID testing at the time and then vaccinations for communities of color in particular, where they didn&#8217;t have testing and vaccinations. And so I thought that I was like, this feels like a need, right? Like, people are dying.</p>
<p>I want to be of service. And so it was a crazy time. I don&#8217;t understand how I did not get COVID then. This is like, before, people were wearing masks. I was out helping set up test sites without a mask. And then I was wearing a mask, and I was traveling everyone&#8217;s at home, and I am on a plane to New Orleans to set up a test site alone on the plane because obviously no one&#8217;s flying. And I was, like, flying all across the country trying to make sure that people were getting tested. I thankfully, in the year and a half I worked there, never got COVID.</p>
<p>I got COVID last year at a conference. Yeah, literally, just like I was completely fine. But it was a really impactful experience. I got to use my design thinking skills. I did lots of marketing and trying to understand our audience. I worked with a bunch of different types of clients and customers. I worked with city governments. I worked with fire stations.</p>
<p>I worked with federal government. I worked with everyone private sector. I worked with schools. So many schools wanted to go back to in person, but they didn&#8217;t have a testing plan. So I was like, working with each individual school to workshop what will work best for you. And so I used a lot of what I felt like was my design thinking hat to design programs and processes that made the most sense so that people could return, not return to life, but be able to live lives that felt safe enough to live and still benefit. Yeah, it was a really crazy time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, it feels like it&#8217;s a lot of that sort of practical application or continuation. Like the person that hired you said you&#8217;re taking that same energy and that same sort of skill of putting programs together, but you&#8217;re doing it on really kind of a more tactical level in that way, especially during a time when the pandemic affected. I feel like all of us in different ways, but the one thing we all had to do was sort of figure out how to kind of move through it, navigate through it, move forward, especially with information changing a lot. Like you said, pre masks is a time that now is a bit hard to think of because they were so ubiquitous. And I mean, people are kind of still wearing masks now because we&#8217;re kind of still in the pandemic. But in a lot of ways, because of work that people like you have done, we found ways to kind of manage our lives through it, which who knows how long that would have taken if that didn&#8217;t exist or if there weren&#8217;t people like you that were able to make that happen.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Thanks. Yeah, I was able to hire an incredible team. Just could not have done it with a bunch of other people. And it was a wild time, and I learned a lot about healthcare. I used to hate the healthcare system. I still do. But I now understand why there are so many entities designing for healthcare. Now that I&#8217;ve worked in it, I&#8217;m like, it makes sense.</p>
<p>It needs redesigning. It was my first for private sector job, which I was trying to pivot. Like, the Obama Foundation was great, but I was kind of tired of being a nonprofit. I was tired of not having enough money and working really hard all the time and working to the mission, but not getting paid enough. I was like, I think there&#8217;s a way for me to get paid enough and work towards a real goal. Being in the for profit during COVID was very interesting. Healthcare. We&#8217;re trying to save the world, but we&#8217;re also making money.</p>
<p>So a conversation for another day about the healthcare system. But yeah, it helped me understand a little bit more about the way the world works.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And now you&#8217;re doing Rosedale, you&#8217;re doing Adobe. You still have your studio, and you also teach. You are an adjunct lecturer at Loyola&#8217;s Quinlan School of Business. How did that come about?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an incredible am again. So I met two people. One was someone who was one of the first community members in the Obama Foundation program that we ran. Just stayed really close to her. She was one of those people that I called her our super user. She just would do exactly what I would imagine someone would do in our program. She&#8217;s ideal. I could predict her behavior.</p>
<p>It was amazing. And so we stayed in contact. She started working at the Baumhart Scholars Program at the Cleveland School of Business and asked me if I wanted to guest lecture her class, like, come and just talk. So I did. And then there&#8217;s another person who was in the program I did Starting Block, the Starting Block Fellowship a few years ago, probably 2018. More than a few now, but someone else who was a designer also taught another course and was like, hey, could you come to my class too? And so I did. He was getting ready to leave the following year because he got a very cool job at Capital One doing design. And so he left, and they were like, well, we don&#8217;t have anyone to teach class.</p>
<p>Do you want to teach it? I said, I&#8217;d love to teach this class. So it&#8217;s a project management and social innovation class, and it&#8217;s taken a bunch of different iterations. This will be the third year that I&#8217;m teaching it. It actually starts next week. Time for me to start designing the deck. But the incredible thing about the program in particular so the Bomb Harvest Scholars Program is within the School of Business, but it is for a select group of students who really care about social impact. And so a lot of their courses are focused on it. Obviously, you get an MBA, but a lot of courses that you have to take in addition to the MBA requirements are social impact focused.</p>
<p>So the project management course, I&#8217;ve done lots of project management, so I hadn&#8217;t thought about it as like, how do I teach it? I was like, It&#8217;s just something that I do. I&#8217;d gone to trainings for it throughout my career, but had not thought about, how do I teach this and then how do I teach the social impact piece? And so I actually really excited about how this class was taught. I have kind of mapped the class into different sections, and each section is a different aspect of the design thinking process. So it starts with empathy and goes to reflection. I also take the design equity framework. If people aren&#8217;t familiar, it&#8217;s the kind of typical design thinking process. Empathy empathize. Define ideate, prototype iterate, and do it all.</p>
<p>Over again. But I&#8217;ve added kind of equity pauses, which is a term that I learned from another designer, and reflection at every stage. So I talk about doing all of those things within project management because I think that&#8217;s really what project management is. It is like working with people. It&#8217;s understanding people. It&#8217;s trying things and then doing them again, and then trying it and doing it again. And so I&#8217;m really excited about it&#8217;s. A project based class.</p>
<p>Every single person in the course, it&#8217;s usually a small class, but every single person, I encourage them to choose a project that they are working on at work, or they&#8217;re all adult professionals who have jobs and do this MBA mostly on the side. And so they choose a project from work. And then I want you to change something at work or a project that you&#8217;ve always thought about doing, which you have never actually had the time to do. Like, let&#8217;s use this class time because you have to take this class. Let&#8217;s do it now. So people have come up with incredible things. Someone came up with a youth program last year, which I was really excited about. Someone revamped their entire board of directors processes, which I was impressed with.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s on the board of a nonprofit and was like, we just don&#8217;t fundraise right? How do we rethink the fundraising strategy and how do I lead my team through a process? A lot of the work is quite meta, where they&#8217;re redesigning experiences that will be redesigned. So they&#8217;re coming up with a project plan. So I bring a lot of the design thinking aspect to the course in addition to trying to give people practical skills on how do you manage a project, like what tools are we using, are you using Trello? Are you using Monday? Are you using Asana? How are you assigning roles to people? Are you thinking about equity when you&#8217;re deciding roles for people, how do power dynamics come into play? So really intertwining all of those things. And so I&#8217;ve learned so much from all of the students because they all work at different places. Some people are working in consulting, some are working in education, some are working at healthcare nonprofits, and so they all are working together. A lot of it is group work, but the end project is individual. So I hope that they&#8217;re learning from each other about what each other is working on and challenged with. So I love teaching that class.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also not that long. It takes a few months. And so it&#8217;s what I look forward to every end of year. It&#8217;s a nice close out to the year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, it really feels like a perfect way for you to take all of these skills and things that you&#8217;ve learned throughout your career and pass that on to the next generation of, I want to say of innovators. You mentioned at the top of the episode that you had applied for this development program as an innovator, and the more that you talk about your career and the experiences you&#8217;ve went through, I&#8217;m like, I can see it plain as day. Like, you&#8217;re really out here changing minds and hearts. It&#8217;s so awesome.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to hear. I hadn&#8217;t thought about yeah. I guess when you talk to someone and hear it back, it definitely feels different. So thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, I think what&#8217;s probably most interesting about you and your career and what you do is that you take design. And design is such a broad category. I think even when you tell someone you&#8217;re a designer, if you tell five different people, you may get five different definitions of what that even is. I mean, for you, what does design mean? Like, what&#8217;s your personal philosophy? When it comes to that?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>I believe everyone&#8217;s a designer. I also believe it&#8217;s people who want to take on that role. Like, if you want to be a designer, you can be. I think the most important thing about being a designer is understanding who you&#8217;re designing for. Graphic designer, and I someone who is a programmer, experience designer will have. What we have in common is, who are we designing for? The graphic designer is like, I&#8217;m making a poster, or maybe they&#8217;re making a poster, and they&#8217;re like, okay, well, who&#8217;s the poster for? I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m designing a program. Well, who&#8217;s the program for? So really getting to the meat of how do I understand people? And for program design, I think it&#8217;s beautiful because it&#8217;s everything or experience design is everything. What I said earlier was, it&#8217;s what things smell like, what you&#8217;re touching, what you&#8217;re seeing, who you interact with, when you interact with them.</p>
<p>When we show you something, all of those things make an impression. So I think about design as design is everything. Yeah, I look at and now that I&#8217;ve been in so many different sectors, and I know that design means so many different things, I see design in everything. I can&#8217;t open a door without being like, someone made this and thought about how humans will open this door wild. So, yeah, designs and everything. I think it&#8217;s a branding. As I always say. It&#8217;s a branding, marketing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>It sounds like you&#8217;re really interweaving with design, at least with the way that you&#8217;re approaching design. Everything works together. All these processes work together. Nothing is in a vacuum. And I think that&#8217;s really a holistic way to look at design, because for years, people always say designers are problem solvers, but the problems they end up solving tend to be UX problems or browser problems or things like that when there are so many other things out there in the world. You mentioned healthcare. Government is another one. Government services.</p>
<p>There are so many huge systems that we encounter every day that could use that design eye and that design thinking. And so I hope that people listen to this conversation and start to think of design in a bigger way. Like, think outside of just what you see on a monitor or on a phone. Like, think of design in a broader sense.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. Yeah. I think you&#8217;re spot on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What&#8217;s inspiring you these days?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Thank you for asking that. Color. Color has been inspiring me. I started reading. I went to the library and I started reading Color &#8212; I have the book right here: &#8220;Colors for Designers: 95 Things You Need to Know when Choosing and Using Colors for Layouts and Illustrations&#8221;. And I&#8217;ve been having, like, a lull in inspiration, and I never really learned about color theory formally.</p>
<p>And so I&#8217;ve just been so excited about color. I&#8217;ve been going on hikes recently, and so I&#8217;ve been obsessed with the sky. I go on runs, and there&#8217;s a beautiful sunset on Monday, and I counted eleven colors in the sky. I was just like, wow, what eleven different colors? And so I&#8217;m, like, training my eye to see different colors and hues. So I&#8217;ve been really inspired by that. I started reading. I just finished the book &#8220;Stay Inspired&#8221; by Brandon Stosuy&#8230;or Stossai? Finding motivation to your creative work.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s a book of just, like, a bunch of activities to get you motivated and inspired to do creative work. And so much of the book has you tap into childhood experiences. So I haven&#8217;t been writing all the activities. I&#8217;ve been at least thinking and meditating on them. And so that&#8217;s been really fun. So thinking about my childhood as inspiration for things that I create and do now has been really cool. And then, yeah, just thinking about color. Lots of color.</p>
<p>Lots of just trying to find inspiration and creativity. My end of year project right now is trying to create an art book. And so very similar to the fade on kind of like big coffee table books, I want to curate some type of yeah, I&#8217;ve never tried. So I&#8217;m going to just try and map that out over the holiday and see what I can come up with. Have a little theme. I love material culture, so I think that&#8217;s going to be the theme for the art book, is thinking about material culture and how artists use different materials to create meaning. So I&#8217;ve been doing lots of research. So that&#8217;s been my end of year inspiration.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>At this stage of your career, even just looking back to where you&#8217;ve come from and where you&#8217;ve worked and the impact that you&#8217;ve had, how do you measure success now? What does it look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>So do I feel happy? Do I feel good? Do I feel motivated? Has been whether or not I feel successful or those are my metrics for success. Are things feeling right? Feels a little woo. Woo. I think it&#8217;s because I live in La now. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d ever talk like this before, but yeah, a lot of it is. Like, how do things feel? I think I&#8217;ve had a lot of moments in life. I have ADHD. I also have quite a bit of anxiety.</p>
<p>And so a lot of my life has been me trying to get around those things. And so my metrics of success now have been, do I not feel anxious? How often have I been feeling anxious? Is it less? That seems great. That feels successful. So, yeah, just kind of just like, monitoring my mental health and feeling good about where I am in life right now and being content, spending a lot of time just being happy with what I have right now. It&#8217;s hard because I think, how do you balance that with wanting more and being ambitious? I&#8217;m wrestling with that now, but just be happy with what I got.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Is there anything that you want to do that you haven&#8217;t done yet?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I really want to curate a show. Like an art show. I say it every year. So now that I&#8217;m saying it out loud to you and shared with the public, I think I have to do it. So maybe it&#8217;s on the 2024 docket. Yeah, I really want to curate a show. I&#8217;ve always said I plan for it, I figure it out. But maybe 2024 is the year that I start actually doing it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>You&#8217;re right there in La. That&#8217;s a great place to do it. I know that United talent artists has an artist space, but, I mean, there&#8217;s just so much art and design in Los Angeles. I feel like you could definitely make that happen.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Thanks for saying that. I live close to the UTA artist space, and I&#8217;ve contacted them before just for other stuff, so yeah, thank you. You know what? Yeah, it&#8217;s going to go into the like when I envision boarding for 2024. This is it. Thanks for this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. What kind of work do you see yourself doing in the next five years? I mean, I feel like you&#8217;re someone that, because of the skills and experience you&#8217;ve had, you could really almost go anywhere. Because what you do is you help build systems and you help build processes to work through things. So say it&#8217;s five years from now, what kind of work would you like to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>The thing that I have not dove into that I would like to do more is or just curation in general. So I think I want to move to a space where I think I&#8217;ve spent a lot of this part of my career being like, I want to be the artist, I want to create, I want to work with people and uplift them. I think I can do that in a different way. Whether I&#8217;m curating music shows, which I&#8217;ve started to do with Rosedale curating an art show, just like doing more curation and leaning into, I don&#8217;t have to be the person that&#8217;s doing the thing. I can support the people doing the thing. And so I think that&#8217;s where I want to go, and I want to do it across I imagine it being across a bunch of different sectors, and maybe it&#8217;s not just visual art. Maybe it&#8217;s also fashion, and maybe it&#8217;s also interior design and objects and vintage and stuff like that. So I want to dive more into my creative self of putting things.</p>
<p>I feel like a lot of the work that I do ends up being behind the scenes or I don&#8217;t get to share it very often, or it doesn&#8217;t feel like I share it very often on a public platform. So I would like to move into that space a little bit more.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, just to wrap things up here. Sam, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work, your projects? Like, where can they find that information online?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>I occasionally post on my personal instagram, which is @samviotty, S-A-M-V-I-O-T-T-Y. But my art stuff is at @theviottystudio on Instagram, so both of those are on Instagram. I occasionally tweet. I&#8217;m @samviotty on most things. I think I&#8217;m also the only Sam Viotty. So if you google Samantha Viotty or Sam Viotty, I&#8217;m pretty sure you&#8217;ll find me anywhere that&#8217;s mostly I respond to DMs. People can also email me at hi at sviotty dot com. So happy to chat.</p>
<p>I love just talking to other people about what they&#8217;re working on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, sounds good. Sam Viotty. I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I mean, when I was doing my research, and I think what really kind of blew me away was, like, this is a program designer that&#8217;s like, trying to change country music. It felt like this weird sort of combination. But now that I&#8217;ve talked with you and I&#8217;ve gotten the sense to kind of see how you work and how you think, you&#8217;re the kind of person that I feel like the design industry needs to have more of. Like someone that can really synthesize all of the things that design can do and use them in ways that can help forward, move people forward, move systems forward, move companies forward. I mean, there&#8217;s been so much talk about generalist versus specialist, right? And I think what you embody is, like, the true kind of generalist type of designer that I wish more designers were like.</p>
<p>I wish more people were able to take their knowledge and think of it and use it and apply it in ways that can really sort of benefit the world. I mean, we live in a very crazy time right now, and a lot of the systems and practices and things we have are designed and can be and should be redesigned. And it&#8217;s just so empowering for me to see someone like you that&#8217;s doing this work out in the world, and I&#8217;m glad to share that with the audience here. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Thank you. I&#8217;m so happy that you have this platform. It&#8217;s incredible. Everyone I&#8217;ve listened to a few episodes and people are really inspiring. So I&#8217;m honored to be on the show. So thank you so much.</p>

<p>A dear friend of mine asked me to include a creative on Revision Path that could speak to building a personal brand online, and my mind went immediately to UI/UX designer Brandon Groce. I first encountered Brandon a year ago hosting an AIGA DC design event, and was impressed by his work creating content for design brands including Disney, Hilton, and LG. Did I mention he&#8217;s also an Adobe Partner?</p>
<p>Our conversation started off with an update on what Brandon&#8217;s been doing over the past year, and he talked about his current and upcoming projects, including the DesignOff Tournament. We also talked about building confidence, showcasing your work, and&#8230;the metaverse? (You&#8217;ll have to listen to the end to find out!) Kudos to Brandon for being a great designer and for helping elevate the next generation of designers through his events!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Alright, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Howdy-doody, Maurice. My name is Brandon Groce, yes, gross as in nasty, not spelt that way, but I am a designer and Adobe partner, and kind of can be summed up in terms of what I do, not necessarily what I am, but I create content for design brands and I throw on some highly edu-taining design events.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. How&#8217;s the year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not going to lie, I love being able to be in my house and not have any outdoor obligations, my friend. My partner asked me, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you like to go outside?&#8221; And I looked back to my childhood and I was like, &#8220;I think I was always in a corner with the computer, in two sheets to cover my whereabouts.&#8221; [inaudible 00:03:49] focus either playing games or learning things on the internet. Honestly, my year has been good. I absolutely love learning. It&#8217;s not the same for everybody else. Everybody has a different situation, but I&#8217;ve been very lucky to have healthy family members and be in this situation that I&#8217;m in. So it&#8217;s been good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Good. What lessons did you learn over the past year? How do you think you&#8217;ve grown and improved?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I&#8217;m a very anxious person. My parents are like Brandon, you need to wear that pro, I don&#8217;t even know Prozac is the thing, but I don&#8217;t think stress or anxiety is a negative thing. I really think it is a beautiful thing, or at least in my case, because it tells me it is literally a biological indicator of like that is just going to fuck up your day. So please fix that.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
So this year, I have learned how to effectively &#8230; or it&#8217;s going to get better as I get older, how to learn what I need to quickly to put out a fire or build a raft, or learn whatever I need to, to either avoid or somehow redirect whatever catastrophe is coming my way, specifically when it comes to my business. I&#8217;ve only been in business for two &#8230; I can&#8217;t even say two. Yes, I&#8217;m still saying one. I&#8217;ve had an audience for a while, but it&#8217;s only been, I think, a year, last month, where I&#8217;ve ventured on my own and trying to figure out with the relationships and things that I&#8217;ve had, how to kind of go from what we&#8217;re, not even taught, but how we&#8217;re built to think like employees. And I&#8217;m not saying that in the derogatory sense, but there&#8217;s certain brain patterns that I had that didn&#8217;t help me scale what I was trying to build. And I feel like I&#8217;ve finally broke some of those thought patterns, which have really helped me figure out, in addition, tiring business coach, which was part of the growth, but learning how to not be in the business, but work on the business.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I mean, there&#8217;s a whole bunch of learning lessons, but essentially, me being able to, in a year where everybody was inside and where everything was becoming digital, or a lot of money was being allocated to digital events, digital this, digital that, AR/VR, being able to see a whole change in the market, in addition to finally, with the market change, seeing where I fit into it, as well as how to scale my business in that market change. Those are like the three things that have been highly, I guess, learning lessons when I&#8217;m continuing to learn and just been beautiful things in the past year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes. And I have to say, it&#8217;s good that you&#8217;re learning that in your first year of business. There&#8217;s a lot of businesses that don&#8217;t get that until maybe year two or three after they&#8217;ve gone it alone and figured out that&#8217;s not the best way to do it. I like that part you said about being in the business, but not really working on the business. So it&#8217;s good that-</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Which is still hard because I have to be on camera [inaudible 00:07:06]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I mean, but hey, that&#8217;s your business, though, right? That&#8217;s Groce media. What&#8217;s a typical day like for you?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I can tell you what I would like to have my typical day be. It&#8217;s only in bouts of stress like this last week where I just throw it all away. Typically, I wake up at 6:00. I&#8217;m very structured, man. I get thrown off if you ask me to do anything outside of my routine in the morning. I don&#8217;t care if I wake up at &#8230; like today, I woke up at 9:00. I must get on my little cycle, must be either 15 minutes or three miles. I listen to audio books, while I&#8217;m on the cycle. I must take a shower after that, make my coffee, and then I make a list for what needs to get done that day, and then I sit in my chair for &#8230; I honestly don&#8217;t like to. If I can get all my work done before like 1:00PM because I know as soon as I eat, I&#8217;m tired. So I try to get &#8230; And this is why I went on a break last week and I&#8217;m trying to get my schedule back together, because I had a really challenging three-week, almost a month sprint where I work through the weekends, I typically don&#8217;t do that.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Yes, from 6:00-7:00, 7:00 to about 1:00, I&#8217;ll probably &#8230; that&#8217;s my work. That&#8217;s where all my everything that must be done is done within that time. And then the rest of the day is just, what other things need to be planned, for example, one of the things I need to focus on is creating SLPs for whoever I decide needs to fill these positions that we were kind of talking about earlier. But yes, I mean, morning and till 1:00PM is kind of pretty structured after that. It just depends on what I want to do or what extra, like what would I have to be doing tomorrow that I can do today, but I am pretty regimented and I try to keep in mind that I know my brain is only probably optimal for like four or five hours of really good like no distraction related work. After that, I&#8217;m like &#8230; The bunnies and the Chipmunks they&#8217;re running around my brain at that point. No way. I&#8217;m not sure that answers your question. But that&#8217;s literally my typical day and Saturdays and Sundays in working is different, is typically strategizing in reading on Saturdays and Sundays. It&#8217;s not sitting at a computer. I don&#8217;t necessarily consider it work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, but you&#8217;ve got that structure down, which I think probably helps out from day-to-day to make sure that you stay on task.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
That&#8217;s one thing that I know I&#8217;m really good at, is habits usually. And my dad is this way too. I got it from him. And people always yell at us, they&#8217;re like, there&#8217;s like an hour in the beginning of our days that you just can&#8217;t disrupt or we even have &#8230; There&#8217;s literally a calendar. Actually, I&#8217;m going to bring my dad into this. But he has a phrase like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t eat cake on Tuesdays.&#8221; And we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Why specifically Tuesdays?&#8221; But there&#8217;s a reason and he sticks to it. I&#8217;m the same way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look, we all got to have our rules. We got to have our structure that gets us through things, I think especially since this past year, people have just had to discover and develop their own kinds of habits to get through. So it&#8217;s not a bad thing, I don&#8217;t think. What are some projects that you&#8217;re working on now?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
So with everything going digital man, do you know what virtual production is?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Virtual production?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where it is?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
What it is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, I know what it is. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
All right. Have you seen these people on the internet with mocap suits? You&#8217;ve seen these &#8230; and they&#8217;ve been around for a while, but they&#8217;re starting to pop up a little bit more. For example, you have AiAngel, CodeMiko, you have these virtual influencers, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes, yes. I&#8217;ve seen those.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
All right. So I have been studying how to do &#8230; I have a beta version of this stuff made. So I have a car, I have a city. You&#8217;ve probably seen it in my live streams, but I&#8217;m just getting my character made. I hired somebody to make my character and we&#8217;re going to start building in the metaverse. With the tournament that we were talking about a little bit earlier, designoff.live. It&#8217;s basically, think esports, but for design, and I really want that event to be almost like a virtual music concert/tournament. Do you play games Maurice?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I do.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
What games do you play?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I&#8217;ve got a switch. So I&#8217;m not going to lie. I&#8217;m mostly playing Animal Crossing these days because-</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Oh, my God.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; it&#8217;s just a destresser. Wait a minute, you didn&#8217;t let me finish. You didn&#8217;t let me finish. I mean, I&#8217;m mostly playing that. I do have a PS4 and I&#8217;m between playing Fuser and Persona 5 Royal. So it varies.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Persona 5 brought me back. You reeled me back in. Do you watch Twitch at all? Do you watch any gamers?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve seen some gamers on Twitch. I&#8217;ve watched a few on YouTube also. I know I&#8217;ve watched some people do live streams on YouTube. I&#8217;ve seen some gaming live streams on Twitches as well.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Got you. I think what&#8217;s really missing right now, and it&#8217;s also very challenging at the moment with, everybody&#8217;s on zoom calls, everybody&#8217;s watching live streams of some sort. The thing is, is that, and this has always been the problem even with webinars, it&#8217;s people on stage talking to audience and audience are just chatting. And yes, you can hit the clap button or the heart button or whatever, but I&#8217;ve been watching this one individual, her name is CodeMiko and she does the best. Her avatar and maybe the world that she has isn&#8217;t necessarily to my aesthetic liking, but the fact that she&#8217;s able to allow the audience &#8230; she&#8217;s a developer by trade, and so the audience can input commands or purchase certain things to mess up, or make things happen to her. Either mess up the environment or make things blow up, make her dance, mute her while she&#8217;s streaming. She&#8217;s basically gamified her live stream experience.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
And so you&#8217;re a gamer &#8230; imagine if you&#8217;re watching a live stream of one of your favorite brands, or maybe even one of your friends and you just want to mess with them. And you just drop $1 or $5 and maybe even just type this code and something funny happens on stream. It&#8217;s no longer a one-way street, it&#8217;s a two-way street. And there&#8217;s so many levels of complexity that you can make this, I mean, I really don&#8217;t even think the larger brands are even doing this right. We&#8217;re still at the point where we&#8217;re looking at these large organizations with millions, billions of dollars, and they&#8217;re still doing the side by side conferences, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
With almost like zoom calls. So really what I&#8217;m looking at is how do we bring that sort of CodeMiko entertainment into design, through Design Off as a tournament, almost like, think about it as WWE is like the entertainment version of wrestling, this stuff is not saying what we&#8217;re doing on stage is fake, but it&#8217;s so dramatized, people get hype about it, and it&#8217;s entertaining, bringing that side of things over to the design world. And it also be somewhat of a learning experience as well. So the number one thing that I&#8217;m working on, is designoff.live and other design education related events. And now I&#8217;m so far down the line. I don&#8217;t remember your questions.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, that was it? I mean, I was going to talk about DesignOff and you sort of mentioned what it is and everything, but I was asking, what projects are you working on? I&#8217;m really intrigued by this virtual production, so you&#8217;re going to have like a virtual avatar that represents you. It&#8217;s you, but it&#8217;s not you. Sort of like a VTuber, I guess, right?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
A VTuber essentially except it&#8217;s going to be &#8230; I wish there was like a video podcast, can you bring it up? Think VTuber, but not. VTuber is kind of like it&#8217;s the concept of what I&#8217;m talking about, but it&#8217;s niched into almost like the anime sort of sect, whereas kind of what I&#8217;m talking about. Think about, you&#8217;ve played Assassin&#8217;s Creed, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Or any type of dope 3D video game. Essentially, things have gotten so cheap, Maurice, I have a mocap suit. We&#8217;re about to dive in. My mocap suit was only 2500. I can put on this suit and I can download any character I want from a video game, from whatever, and I can become that. It cost 2500 for that suit, the character is probably between $25 and $100. And as I put on the suit, I become that. And even the scenes are like $25. So the ability to create almost triple A level quality game. And the thing is, is like games, right? You can create your own game, except what I want to do with it, is make it more so an entertainment platform, and also a tournament. So rather than making a game, we&#8217;re doing something a little bit different. We&#8217;re pulling a couple things together. But yes, essentially VTuber, however, it&#8217;s more so taking the thought of making a real triple A game, whether that be the latest Assassin&#8217;s Creed or some other high graphic game, basically utilizing Unreal Engine in its capabilities.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m very intrigued by that. I really want to see how that will come forth in the future, especially with people have virtual reality headsets and stuff like that, like how all of this will kind of work together because I do see things going certainly more into this, I hate to say the virtual world because I&#8217;m sounding like I&#8217;m a kid in the &#8217;90s. Remember when the virtual world was like a thing in cartoons and television series? We&#8217;re going to the virtual world. That&#8217;s sort of what this feels like, but it&#8217;s actualized. You can do it. It&#8217;s in the realm now that any consumer can probably get into, it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Yes, man. The costs are really low. Things are going to be crazy man. At the end of this podcast, people are going to be like Brandon has his screws loose, someone get him a Home Depot set, used to call it, but yes. The way that I see things going, you were saying the virtual world, I&#8217;m making numbers up, but I really do think that there will be people that live in the virtual world. Have you seen on Netflix the Altered Carbon?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve heard of it. I haven&#8217;t seen it.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not going to go too much into it because I&#8217;m horrible at explaining. Everybody&#8217;s going to be like, that sounds horrible. But it is a really good series guys. You should check it out. But there&#8217;s people they call the real world the real. And those are the people that live like in virtual reality by choice and these people that live in the real world. I really do think that that will be a choice. You&#8217;re not even a half life of your 100 years. So I really do think in the next 20, maybe 30, you have crypto coming up the ability for people to maybe not even have regular jobs, just play games for the &#8230; not even like streaming, just be able to play Pokemon Go for their income. We&#8217;re going into a lot of things, but I&#8217;m just very excited about the virtual world because like I said, in this, I guess, industry what people will call the world builder, it&#8217;s kind of the metaverse is what it&#8217;s called. And people who create within the metaverse are people that create games, but I think video games is going to be one of the ways that we enjoy life in the future, which is interesting and weird to talk about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, the metaverse. That sounds like another &#8217;90s cartoon. I&#8217;m not saying that to be derisive or anything, but it sounds really cool. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. That stokes the inner child in me to be like, &#8220;Oh, what is this about?&#8221; Even as you mentioned Altered Carbon and kind of, I guess, notion of being able to sort of have yourself inside of the metaverse. I don&#8217;t know, it reminds me of this anime, and you&#8217;ve probably seen it called Serial Experiments Lain.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Serial &#8230; No, but I&#8217;m writing it down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s streaming on anything, and I know if Cat Small is listening, this will make I think the second time I&#8217;ve mentioned it on the show. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s available to stream, but it&#8217;s a 13-episode series about this girl named Lame and how she gets sucked into this online internet world. I think if you like Altered Carbon, you would like that show.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes. So to bring it back to the real world for a minute, I can&#8217;t help but notice, of course, in your photo that people can see you for the cover art that you&#8217;re holding this neon, Adobe XD logo cue, which Adobe XD appears to be your kind of main tool of choice. Talk to me about that. How did you land on Adobe XD?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s not just the Adobe XD that&#8217;s part of it, but it&#8217;s more so about the Adobe brand in particular. I&#8217;ll explain that. So Adobe XD just because &#8230; and I can&#8217;t just say just because, because my main skill or my main trade is UI/UX design and being able to &#8230; there&#8217;s a couple of reasons, right? Have a company that offers not just the &#8230; it offers the suite of not just what I have done that produced my income, as a UI/UX designer, XD, but they also have Photoshop, Illustrator, they also have After Effects, Premiere, they have everything at really one cost. And so the larger picture I see is, I have to be careful what I say here, because it&#8217;s not necessarily true. We&#8217;re moving in a space where AR and VR is going to be what UI/UX designers are as of right now.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
When COVID came through and everything started to become remote, I saw a huge uptick in the need for UI/UX designers. Why? Because everybody&#8217;s at home. And the companies who have these streaming platforms and who have digital experiences, their revenue is skyrocketing because everybody&#8217;s on their some sort of screen. And the next version of that is yes, we have screens now, but you have companies like Snapchat, even though their glasses technology looks a little bit funky at the moment. Did you see that release this week?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Of the new like specs?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Specs. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Yes. So it looks a little funky, but that is version 0.01, that&#8217;s essentially a beta version of what I think the iPhone was when it first came out. It doesn&#8217;t look sexy, but the idea is there. Being able to wear a set of spectacles where your friend could decide, hey, I want to wear this pirate hat and I&#8217;m going to press this, anytime anybody has a certain type of technical optic and looks at me, they&#8217;re going to see my digital outfit. So that&#8217;s also the metaverse. So you could decide on your app or whatever, or you. You can be like, I want to wear X, Y, and Z. You put that in your phone and if I&#8217;m looking at you with these spectacles, I can see everything that you decided to wear in the digital space, while also in the real world. I just find that being a lot more attractive to me, just because the sky&#8217;s the limit on what you can do, you&#8217;re no longer limited to 1920 by 1080, you&#8217;re not limited to what are the 320 by whatever 568, someone&#8217;s going to be like, hey was the pixel off, right in the comments, guys.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
But yes, I think that&#8217;s the next step because the sky&#8217;s the limit, the only thing that you&#8217;re really limited by is the hardware, but for screen experience, when we can just create experiences on the things that we look at, man, that&#8217;s crazy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes. And so tools like Adobe XD, or even like the Creative Suite really kind of play into that more.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Yes, because you are able to use like &#8230; This is the thing. When you have things like, whether it be Figma, Sketch, whatever else is out there, you have specific tools for specific things. But when the market starts to become more complex, and you need to be able to adapt, what is their lifespan looking like? And I&#8217;m just like, that&#8217;s great. They&#8217;re a specialty tool. That has some market share. In the larger scheme of things where I think things are going, and also what I&#8217;m interested in, which is also a large factor, this is probably where my biases, because there&#8217;s still going to be screen experiences needed. There&#8217;s still people trying to get their mobile out here and their million dollar companies out here, trying to get their mobile app out.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
So yes. I just like to be on the cutting edge of things and being a part of technologies that allow flexibility and also the integration of where things are moving. So you have Adobe dimension is a 3D tool that allows designers, is also by Adobe, without really any 3D knowledge knowing how to make stuff you just need to know how to download models, change the color them and then use your brain to rearrange them in the way that you think looks best, export that, drop that in, whether that be Photoshop XD, it just makes &#8230; Adobe&#8217;s tagline really does hold up or it&#8217;s just like creative for all. They reduce the barrier to entry and reduce the complexity of what it takes to create something.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know for a while in the design industry, there was this big, I don&#8217;t know, I felt like there was this big push away from Adobe tools. I feel like it was right around the time Adobe Creative Cloud became a thing with their subscription. And lot of designers I know really pushed away from it trying to find some alternative, and they doubled down on Sketch, which is still Mac-only, or they used Figma, or they&#8217;re using other tools like that. But I mean, the way that Adobe has been innovating over the past few years since they&#8217;ve started Creative Cloud, probably because a lot of subscription money, I&#8217;m not going to lie, but the way that they have innovated over the past three years has been nothing short of remarkable. And, I mean, I hate to say there&#8217;s not really any other tools out there that can touch what Adobe is doing. This is not an Adobe sponsorship, by the way, although if you all are interested, let me know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m just saying this because personally, I cut my teeth on Adobe. I learned Photoshop and Illustrator on my own. I just did an interview earlier today where I was talking about how I didn&#8217;t start out in design, I started out doing customer service stuff after I graduated from college. And I would go to Barnes and Noble and pick up .Net magazines, and those like UK computer magazines that would always come with a CD or something, or those Photoshop tips and tricks books. I go to Barnes and Noble, get those, look through them, take pictures, take them back home, I used my pirated copy of Photoshop to try to get my design chops up and stuff. Of course, now that I&#8217;m in a position where I can pay for it, I do pay for it. But I say that to say in terms of the amount of innovation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, Photoshop is a verb for a reason. I mean, nobody&#8217;s out here saying they&#8217;re going to Figma their photos.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
No, I don&#8217;t even think you can Figma a photo, sadly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look, where I work at now, I asked them for an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription because I wanted to work on some design stuff. And they were like, &#8220;But, we have Figma&#8221;, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No, that&#8217;s okay. That&#8217;s all right. That&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I think there&#8217;s no right or wrong. I think there&#8217;s just certain &#8230; like I said, there&#8217;s a market for a reason, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
There&#8217;s particular individuals that there needs really line up with Figma. They were free. They had all this stuff for free. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
What they had was, for a lot of people, they&#8217;re like, why not? But like you said, when you find yourself in a position, and you&#8217;re like, I have the resources now to allocate to a tool that allows me to do more of my best work. That&#8217;s kind of the mindset that, when you have that mindset, you have the resources to actually put it towards something that makes you do your best work. For me, that just happens to be Adobe, because the type of work that I do requires a lot of cross threading.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s fair. Yes. And I mean, also with these Adobe tools, I mean, they&#8217;ve been industry standard for a reason. Every design job I&#8217;ve had, I&#8217;ve still had to use Dreamweaver or Photoshop or something. But I can see why these other types of tools have become more popular, because they have been brought up as the industry changes. There&#8217;s been a huge influx of UX/UI designers and product designers in the past, like seven years or so. And so there has to be tools then that can kind of work with that. I know, for a while, people are trying to use maybe Photoshop or Illustrator to do that, but needed something that was maybe a bit more, I don&#8217;t know, exact, I guess, because Illustrators are for vectors, Photoshop is for photo manipulation, and if you&#8217;re trying to do something that&#8217;s more product-based, you&#8217;d need a tool that, I guess, would allow you to simulate some of those things, which of course, is why Adobe XD comes along, but then also why you have a Sketch and a Figma, or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The tools match what the industry is doing at the moment, so I can see that. Yes. Kind of switch gears here a little bit, I know you are located in Maryland, is that where you&#8217;re originally from?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I think so. Guys, for those of you guys who are listening, Maurice asked me before the podcast, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Brandon, where are you currently residing?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;First off reside is a too big word to even use in a sentence with me.&#8221; And then I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t even know my street address barely.&#8221; But yes, Maryland is I think where I&#8217;ve always been. I have been to Texas though. I&#8217;d lived there for a little bit. And I love the heat over there, man. Love that it doesn&#8217;t get cold. But yes, I&#8217;ve been in Maryland for the majority of my life span of 27 years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. What was it like?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
And this is also what is interesting because people ask me about life and I talk about the internet. I really didn&#8217;t go outside much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So growing up you were the kid that was like always in the house on the computer.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Oh, yes. Yes. Even if you look at my Facebook profile pictures and you look at the &#8230; There was one day where I was looking at some of my high school friends and their pictures versus mine. I was like, oh, hang out with people. And so the majority of my childhood was wrestling in Brazilian jujitsu, because I was a very active, like I said, I can&#8217;t really sit in the chair, I had a lot of energy. So the majority of my childhood starting at eight, up until whenever college started after high school was Brazilian jujitsu, and just teaching and training both kids and adults. I have a brown belt Brazilian jujitsu. I stopped after I moved to Texas and trained a little bit here and there on and off. Business is a lot like jujitsu, except you don&#8217;t get physical ailments from it. Unless, right now I have a pinched nerve for sitting in my chair, so I&#8217;m really lying.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you&#8217;re like street fighter, basically.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I mean, you can say that, but I&#8217;m definitely the first one to run. If you were with me, I have &#8230; Maurice, let me tell you this real quick. Back to my anxiety and paranoia. I&#8217;m not sure if it runs in my family, but I am the first one. We&#8217;re about to go to the storm, it&#8217;s an actual phrase. Let me grab my pepper spray. I don&#8217;t know what it is. I was talking to somebody about this the other day. I like to be overly prepared, because I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to go down. And I&#8217;m not saying I live in a bad area, and I think that&#8217;s also from jujitsu to where is a mindset kind of came where it&#8217;s the paranoid survive. And that&#8217;s kind of how I operate. Some people think that&#8217;s very, a chaotic way to live, but for me, it&#8217;s like hey, that&#8217;s the way that I operate. I try to be always overly prepared. You never know what&#8217;s going to happen and you try your best to optimize what based on the situations that you&#8217;re in, which is also probably why I don&#8217;t leave the house a lot. There&#8217;s a lot of stimuli out. I can control everything that&#8217;s artificial, which is in the computer. [crosstalk 00:32:40].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. But, I mean, even like, still to that point, I guess you were still, I&#8217;m assuming, exposed to a lot of design and tech growing up perhaps.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
A lot of art, or a lot of books. A lot of books, a lot of puzzles. Yes, that&#8217;s all I did, man. Man, I was a hustler. I would resell things that I found at school back to kids, I would sell like art lessons in elementary school and make money so that I really use this money to, or the quarters my parents left in the couch, to purchase puzzles that I would put together, or my grandmother would always buy me these things called Zoids. Do you remember those?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Zoids?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
They&#8217;re essentially like Gundams, but they&#8217;re like cats, or different animals.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hadn&#8217;t heard of those.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t remember what year they were, but they were like my thing. I would put them together without the instructions. And these things were like hundreds of pieces. And I would just figure it out. And honestly, my main superpower that I think is like, I&#8217;m just like, oh, that was the wrong hole, we got to figure the other hole out. I&#8217;m very good at putting things together. And that&#8217;s why I always loved art and expressing things, but I also loved creating something that worked, which is why I really struggled at the end of high school and even moving into college where it was just, what is technology plus art? And I didn&#8217;t have an internet, around the time I was 18, I was like, oh, we&#8217;re just going to be a tattoo artists somehow without getting any tattoos. That wasn&#8217;t going to fly because who&#8217;s going to hire a tattoo artist without any tattoos? I know I wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You got to start somewhere.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Well, this is true. But I just was not &#8230; I was like, I know I mess up paper. So if somebody comes to me and was like, can I have an owl, and I just mess up one feather and somebody is not going to be happy. So like I said, I really like control and something that you can constantly tinker with. I dabbled in internships at NIH with medical illustration. I thought that was really weird. This is when I learned I really didn&#8217;t like work because, and it was probably around 18, 19 at the time. And I would go there and I would want to learn so much, because these people would show me interesting things and I would spend time trying to learn how to do it. And then they would go out on three hour lunch breaks and I would always go in and ask the question, they&#8217;re kicked back in their chair, and I&#8217;m like, what&#8217;s going on? Nobody does any work here. And I&#8217;m not saying this is what the general workforce does, but I was just very turned off by the lack of &#8230; and it wasn&#8217;t even that the other interns were like that as well, I was very turned off in that environment, that the fact that there are so many interesting things around us and nobody&#8217;s asking any questions.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Yes, so I&#8217;m a tinkerer man. Even though I call myself a designer, I&#8217;m probably more so an inventor mindset than anything else. I really like to learn how things work, we will be in Giant man. And I&#8217;ll be like, I wonder how they package those raisins. I ask questions all the time and I really like to find how certain things are made, especially when things are in alignment with what I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m going to jump ahead a little bit here, because I feel like just based on what you&#8217;re telling me, I really get the sense that you&#8217;ve had to work a lot to build up your confidence in order to really, one, I think showcase work that you can do and of course, to partner with Adobe and other companies and such like that. How do you build that confidence? What advice would you give out there to somebody that&#8217;s listening that wants to build up that confidence to be like you?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Well, I wouldn&#8217;t say try to be like me. Let&#8217;s pause right there. But I think I have a pretty good &#8230; I didn&#8217;t have this story when we first talked about this in the beginning of the podcast, but it&#8217;s one thing that I hold indefinitely in my head that changed things for me. So in school, school was very hard for me. The way that I was, and that I talked about NIH, was not who I was in early school at all. To be honest with everybody, I don&#8217;t even know how I passed elementary school, middle school, or any. I never did any work. I have no idea. They wanted me out of the classrooms. But I never paid attention in class and mainly because I struggled with the way &#8230; now thinking back, it&#8217;s a little bit clear, I didn&#8217;t understand the instructions that whomever was giving me and how to do certain things. And I was like, why is it this way and not this way? And because I didn&#8217;t understand the way that they were telling me, a lot of the times, I was basically the laughingstock. There was so many times where if I even just dare raise my hand in class, the class will just blow up in laughter, and that really hurt a lot.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
And so a lot of elementary school and in middle school, I just thought &#8230; we were talking a little bit earlier where the kids in the special help class programs. That was me. I think I started reading out loud, even in high school, man. Honestly, that mess sucked. But what really changed was, I would probably always get &#8230; I&#8217;m not even sure you can get D&#8217;s in elementary school.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You can.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I probably got them. Yes. And I just remember my mom telling me, as supportive as she could, she was like, you&#8217;re different. You have ADHD. Just please try to pass. And I remember like, yes, it&#8217;s not just one time, but just looking at myself in the mirror, not understanding why didn&#8217;t get things. Thinking back about it, don&#8217;t make me feel good. But there was just one day where I was just like, for whatever reason, I just decided on the dumbest thing ever to Maurice. It was a spelling test. So I was like, I&#8217;m going to just try and spell probably like because and I spell it because. I don&#8217;t remember what it was, but I decided to stay up really late and just study 10 words probably what it was. And I got an A. I remember running home from the bus with the paper in hand to tell my mom. Damn, I can&#8217;t even tell this story. Shit hurts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, I didn&#8217;t mean to-</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
No, you&#8217;re good because it&#8217;s a really good story, man. And then I opened the door and I said, &#8220;Mom, I got an A.&#8221; And she hugged me and I remember I went upstairs after that and I was so pissed, Maurice, that I listened, for I don&#8217;t know how many years, to people telling me that I was slow. Regardless of the tears dropping, it was like in that moment that I realized that I had let people tell me things about me that I accepted. I got so pissed in that moment. I was like, I will never, ever, ever allow somebody to tell me what I can and cannot do. And I probably threw a castle around in my building or in my room, something like that.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
But yes, it was a spelling test. Yes, it was something minimal. But it was like that big lesson that how, me, other people, what stories that we hold in our heads and that we apply to ourselves, and that weigh us down in terms of what we actually think is possible. And I&#8217;m not religious or anything. I found recently in the Bible, Exodus 3:14. And don&#8217;t forget who asks, but they essentially ask God, what his name is, what he&#8217;s called, and he says, I am.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I was thinking about this school period or this anger, or whatever this experience that I had that made me feel less than, and I was like, why? Why would he say I am? And I was like, he&#8217;s probably so woke, that he understands and doesn&#8217;t even give the ability to somebody else to even label whatever he is. He just is, or whatever it is. And I was like, wow. Regardless of who said that shit, that&#8217;s some powerful stuff. I am. That&#8217;s something that really sticks with me because I live &#8230; this is a little bit going into talking about the imposter thing. I just understand that I&#8217;m an entity that becomes whatever I decide I would like to become. I come with a biological technology that allows me to pick up and put down whatever it is that I desire within my capabilities of operation.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
So long story, how can somebody become more so of themselves rather than like me? It takes time. I happened to find it studying 10 fucking words for a spelling bee and realizing that I was holding people&#8217;s stories of me and I never crafted my own. So every day, I hold myself accountable to what story, what I like to tell the world about me. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s highly important. And I changed from day-to-day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, that&#8217;s really powerful.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I hope so. I hope it was worth the tears. It dropped in my tea.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I can&#8217;t drink that any longer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to keep on that same vein, not trying to make you continue to cry, but-</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Two tears, we&#8217;re done. [inaudible 00:42:45]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
As you have said, you&#8217;ve managed to kind of instill this confidence now within yourself where you don&#8217;t take in other people&#8217;s thoughts or stories about who you are. And to that end, you have this very unique personal brand, which you&#8217;ve taken time to craft, like I said, I&#8217;ve watched your videos, I&#8217;ve seen your photos, looked at your Instagram, etc. How can someone out there listening start to create their own personal brand? Is it more of the same process that you talked about?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Yes, it&#8217;s really getting in tune with what it is that you produce and that you want to produce. I think it&#8217;s really important we produce things on autopilot. Like you by yourself, or me by myself, I&#8217;m more likely than not, I&#8217;m probably talking to myself, regardless of where I am, which probably makes what I do very natural. And that&#8217;s why the acting thing probably seems natural, because I do &#8230; Man, I talk to myself in the shower. My partner&#8217;s like, &#8220;Who the hell are you talking to?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like talking to Sarah, Jamil, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;They&#8217;re in my head. They&#8217;re talking.&#8221; We have yet to be tested for schizophrenia, but there&#8217;s probably a little dose of that in there.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
But I think it&#8217;s really important to know what you enjoy and what you do naturally, that is, the way you don&#8217;t have to try too hard, but understand where your natural abilities and occurrences lie. It&#8217;s not just that because you have to also understand what people enjoy about that. But you have to find what people like and value. For example, you could be funny to yourself, but are you funny to other people? So for example, when I was young as in high school, I was picked on a lot. And it wasn&#8217;t until I started saying the dumb shit that was in my head right back at the person where other people started dying, laughing about what I said. I was like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s funny.&#8221; And so this is when I started &#8230; when I realized I was like, &#8220;Oh, I do this naturally. Are there other people that are funny that I can study that could help me enhance what I do naturally?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
So I&#8217;ve watched so much Katt Williams, man. I watch a lot of comedy to help me enhance what I&#8217;m naturally capable of and find people other &#8230; but I sound crazy, but I was about to say other avatars, other people who are built with almost somewhat of the same things that I see in me and just take what they&#8217;re doing and try to evolve my skill set from what they&#8217;re doing. I try to find who I would be in the future based on what I know about myself, and what I see in them and try to take what they have already done and apply it to what I&#8217;m doing today. I study &#8230; yes, I said Katt Williams, but I try to read as much as possible bibliographies because there&#8217;s frameworks, these people who have lived like hundreds, thousands, I don&#8217;t know how long the earth has been here. But there has been a repetition of your DNA and capabilities somewhere in the universe. Imagine if you were able to find throughout a couple of books, who you want to be or who you think you&#8217;ll be sprinkled throughout books, and just in a couple paragraphs, you can take those learnings and apply them to the frameworks that you walk about life with. The reason I read is to build the character that I&#8217;d like to see.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I think of myself as a computer, essentially. I download software through books, or through watching people, or through whatever type of input, but it&#8217;s really important that I understand who I would like to become and find frameworks through multiple ways to craft said character. And I know that with the words that I&#8217;m using, some people will be like, that doesn&#8217;t sound good. This goes back to that first story, I told, would you rather be told who you are, or create who you want to become, or who you are, rather? And that&#8217;s just how I go about building my character?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you appreciate the most about your life right now?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Honestly, probably my time with my partner and the freedom, that&#8217;s first. And then the freedom to just think about what I want to put out into the world and have time to do that and have a community and people around me who also are trying to strive for the same things and working together and building that idea. So my relationships, my free time, and my ability to, with that free time, think about what I want to put into the world and produce and what impact that has.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of that, what kind of legacy do you want to leave behind? When you look at yourself, say in the next five years or so, what&#8217;s the sort of work that you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
The impact is just possibility, man. Through this design, I&#8217;ll be able to have people understand that you can learn all day. You can be on YouTube and just learn, but just through doing and having fun, and just be tinker, just tinker and build what you want. That&#8217;s what makes you learn. And to facilitate that, just how Dean Kaymer has, that&#8217;s something I&#8217;d like to do in addition to some, not entirely sure even what to call it, but because we are going to be getting into the metaverse and being able to produce quality 3D movies almost, but just because of our virtual setup. I would also like to do some storytelling as well. We&#8217;ll see. The combination of both.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can see storytelling. You got the voice for it.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So just to wrap things up here, Brandon, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
For sure, you guys can find me &#8230; If you just type my name into Google, you&#8217;ll find me. Brandon Groce, G-R-O-C-E. If you guys want to participate in DesignOff, you guys can go to designoff.live. The majority of my stuff, you guys can find me on Instagram, that&#8217;s probably where I&#8217;m most active, or you guys can join our amazing discord community with over 1,000 other creatives from all over the world and not just UI/UX designers and we have illustrators, 3D artists, we literally have, I think there&#8217;s more people from other countries than where I&#8217;m at. So it&#8217;s really nice to have people who are not just in one vertical, but can help each other build on top of something. So short answer, Instagram at Brandon Groce, YouTube, same thing, but if you find me on Instagram, you&#8217;ll find me everywhere else.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Brandon Groce, I definitely want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I honestly want to sharing your story and being as open and candid as you were to share it. I think it&#8217;s important for people to see the path that people take to get to where they are. It&#8217;s not always this straightforward, you went to this school, then this school, and then worked at this place. People come into this industry in so many different ways and I think it&#8217;s really important to be able to see how you&#8217;ve been able to make your own place in this industry, how it&#8217;s helped you build your confidence, how you&#8217;ve not only helped to build a community, but also help to empower so many others out there to see the possibilities for themselves that they didn&#8217;t see. So, thank you so much for coming on the show, man. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Likewise, Maurice, thank you so much for having me. I appreciate it.</p>

<p>Adobe is a company that is synonymous with the creative industry, so I was really excited to finally talk with someone from the company for Revision Path! Meet Caitlin Crews: a creative outreach and design specialist on the Adobe Stock team. </p>
<p>We started off talking about Caitlin&#8217;s day-to-day work, which includes a lot of writing, interviewing, and discovering new designers from all over the world. Caitlin also talked about her photography background, her work with Lord and Taylor, and she shared how she&#8217;s helping use her current work to create a more equitable future.

<b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Hi, my name is Caitlin Crews and I am a creative outreach and design specialist at Adobe.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Now what does a creative outreach and design specialist do? I&#8217;m curious. Tell me a little bit about that.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      I actually worked on the Adobe Stock team. So a lot of people think of Stock photography, but we have what we call kind of complex or extended assets, meaning we have motion graphic templates, design templates, 3D models and such. So a lot of people just think of, this the tick vocal stock photography, but I actually work on the templates team. So my day to day with that is I&#8217;m working with graphic designers globally to bring their work into a marketplace.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Now I&#8217;ve seen it inside of Photoshop where you can link to Adobe Stock and different libraries. I&#8217;ll be honest, I&#8217;ve never really used it. I feel like it was one of those things at Adobe because Adobe tends to just roll out updates come so fast and furious and there&#8217;s so many things in it. I&#8217;d never get a chance to really experience everything that the Adobe products can do.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yeah. So within the applications for illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign, we offer free templates. So we&#8217;re working with designers to do very specialized content. When Photoshop is rolling out something new or InDesigns rolling out a new feature, those templates that you find in the application are actually designed and best practice with the application to feature something new depending on what that new tool is. Also, it&#8217;s a way for us to kind of work individually with artists or small design studios to kind of bring their work a little bit more into the forefront. Also we have a subscription paid situation through our website and there are of course 10 more, a lot more templates there. But what you find in command in and the new dialog box for those apps are we&#8217;re refreshing them a couple times a year. So it&#8217;s a great way for people who really aren&#8217;t sure how to use InDesign, or people who are maybe familiar with illustrator but not Photoshop to kind of explore and see how files are set up properly. So it&#8217;s a lot of like design thinking and a lot of best practices being put into those templates.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     I see. I didn&#8217;t even think about it that way that you could really see how someone else&#8217;s file structure and things are. I&#8217;ve seen those sort of templates and designs before and I&#8217;m like I can&#8217;t do that. Well the candidate thing, it&#8217;s like a tutorial or something. I&#8217;m not going to do that. I just need to like resize this photo or something. That&#8217;s interesting to know that people are kind of using it in that way.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yeah, let people we have strong download numbers I think week to week in that and those are free. Like if you&#8217;re a trial user and you want to kind of test and see what that&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s great. If you&#8217;re someone who needs a new resume and you want to do it InDesign those are just kind of like great places. I always tell people to start there. And then also people who are creating new work for the marketplace of Adobe Stock just as nice way to see like this is how it should be done and this is probably like maybe the best way for another user or your end user to be able to use this template. So yeah, it was a whole new world for me coming in this role. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     It&#8217;s like instructive as well as sort of a showcase in a way.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yeah. And I learned a lot. Like I&#8217;m adverse to Illustrator completely. I&#8217;m like, oh, I don&#8217;t want to touch it, no thank you. But being able to kind of see how it works and working with these designers on it, like day to day basis, I learned a lot very quickly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     So in a normal day, you say you&#8217;re helping designers get on the market place. Can you talk about like what that process is like for designers that are listening now? How would they work with you say to get their work on the marketplace?</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yeah, so what we do is our process right now is kind of like an invite only. So a lot of my job is researching and finding people online or through conversation that would be interested in doing this type of work. So it&#8217;s usually a pretty interesting conversation of like this is what you do, this is how it gets done. And we actually have like our specs, our requirements for everyone per application to kind of follow. There&#8217;s a contract that needs to be signed and then we kind of work. It&#8217;s mostly like, okay, I see somebody&#8217;s work online. I like it. I think it may be interesting to see it as a template and then we kind of go from there. Through that process I&#8217;m also kind of guiding them a little bit through creative direction I&#8217;m looking at what&#8217;s selling, what&#8217;s not doing so well.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Actually asking people to switch apps. So if someone&#8217;s making a lot of work in Illustrator and I&#8217;m like, ah, this is actually better InDesign, can I give you the tools to revamp your work and InDesign because it may sell a little bit better or it may perform a little bit better. So it&#8217;s this multifaceted like mind switch. And working with people globally is been a really interesting thing as well. Like I sadly don&#8217;t speak a second language, but being able to decipher and be able to communicate with people that are in Spain or Italy or I think I have someone in like there&#8217;s people in like Ireland. You know what I mean? So it&#8217;s just kind of like this being able to communicate broadly. It can be a little difficult, a little bit hard, but it&#8217;s just really interesting to see like what you get back through those conversations.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     And so because it&#8217;s a market place, some things are free, some things are paid. So these designers are also earning revenue from being in the market too.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yeah, earning revenue and kind of explaining how that works. A lot of the free content, like that&#8217;s a completely different contract. So it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re getting paid for your work, we&#8217;re not taking your work and just trying to sell it for free. But it&#8217;s a whole process when it comes to making sure that artists get paid and make a living. A lot of it for a lot of people is passive income and you can make a group of templates and we can get them online and you can just kind of like, okay, let&#8217;s see how it goes and test the waters and see. But a lot of it it&#8217;s kind of like a passive income. We&#8217;ve had a few people, a few Adobe Stock artists that were doing this in their spare time and we&#8217;re able to like open small studios and do it as their full time job is making design templates for marketplaces.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Oh nice.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yes. It&#8217;s fun to see that happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     So when you&#8217;re doing this outreach, like I&#8217;m curious like what&#8217;s a normal day like for you or are you just like scouring the web and just reaching out to people?</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yeah, scouring the web, reaching out to people. Also finding really good resources. I loved meeting people in person. I never really go in being like, hey can I sell you on this thing. It&#8217;s more like I really want to get to know the people, the artists that we&#8217;re working with. I really want to get to know like things that they want to try but they&#8217;re not really sure how to.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      So even meeting people in person has been, if you go to a talk or you go to a panel or what have you, just kind of meeting designers out in the real world I think is the most important and constantly keeping your eyes like on Instagram. I think predominantly everyone I follow now is like some sort of designer or illustrator. Just kind of like being able to see what&#8217;s happening right now InDesign and thinking about what it&#8217;s going to do in the future. Like, especially from an aesthetic standpoint, just what does it look like and how does it function? So it&#8217;s a lot of research and it&#8217;s a lot of just like kicking around ideas most of the day. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Now Adobe, I don&#8217;t know, it kind of has a contentious relationship I feel like with designers because it&#8217;s the tool that many of us started with. Like it&#8217;s the tool that many of us just sort of cut our teeth with whether we paid for it or pirated it as I or whatever. But like it&#8217;s the tool that we use to kind of not only sort of get our feet wet with what we could do digitally, but also to learn about like different terms and things like before design I had never heard of like cropping or rasterize. Because I didn&#8217;t go to design school so I didn&#8217;t know any of that stuff. But I knew I really liked graphics. I had a copy of Photoshop and I learned really kind of like a second vocabulary through the tools and learning about like different blend modes and what does that mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     And that got me more interested in learning about design. So for a lot of designers, Adobe&#8217;s like an education to them, like learning the tool, learning things from that. However, Adobe also gets a lot of flack because, well I think it&#8217;s probably most people know about the pricing. Adobe went from, well I think at one point in time they just had, you could buy the downloaded actual software and that was pretty expensive. So now going to this sort of monthly model, monthly subscription model of subscribing to all of the apps or any number of apps you wanted to, which a lot of designers in necessarily feel like was something they could do, like they can afford. And I feel like there was like an inflection point when that happened because then you started seeing a lot of these difference, almost anti Adobe design tools come out because they&#8217;re like, oh, I can&#8217;t pay for Photoshop, so I need to make something else that can do the same things or similar things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     And a lot of that is borrowed from Photoshop, like the terminology, the things it can do, et cetera. A lot of that, I mean Photoshop like the OG in that respect. So that in like is it challenging talking to designers when you let them know like I&#8217;m from Adobe because of that kind of stigma?</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      I think so. A lot of people, when I do approach them, I do talk to them. It&#8217;s like, no, you&#8217;re not. Like I&#8217;m not a real person. Like I was actually trying to assign a contributor artist onto stock and she was like, can you send me your LinkedIn page? I don&#8217;t believe you are who you are. And I was like, well, there are real people. There are a lot of us at this company and I think that when you have a product, like the products that Adobe has put out and I think has been around for a very long&#8230; It&#8217;s like some application had been around for 35 years and in the world of technology, that&#8217;s a long time. I think that what&#8217;s interesting is like, yeah, I mean as someone who also don&#8217;t tell anyone, but we&#8217;re going to tell everybody I also would pirate, you know what I mean Photoshop because I had to do something.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yeah, I think that it&#8217;s just you know what I mean? It&#8217;s kind of like this barrier of entry and I think what Adobe is trying to do is to price things at a way that&#8217;s still competitive but also like it&#8217;s a company you have to realize they need to make their money too. But I think that with every step of the way and the new applications that are coming out and the new software that&#8217;s coming out, I think that just makes it healthy. I think that Adobe has always been kind of in the forefront of that technology, but it wouldn&#8217;t be a true world if there wasn&#8217;t someone out there to kind of push at that a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      And I think that&#8217;s the role of creatives always to question and also reinvent. So is that a good or bad thing for Adobe? I&#8217;m not exactly sure. I think as long as the wheel keeps spinning and we keep innovating, I think that no matter how you get the work done, you&#8217;re going to get it done. So that&#8217;s kind of my take on it. I don&#8217;t have any official word from my company, but-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Oh no, no, no. Yeah, I completely understand that. I mean, and Adobe continues to innovate. I mean, with the subscription price, like so for example, I have mine through my company I work for, for Glitch and so we&#8217;re able to all of the Adobe apps, of course Photoshop, Illustrator InDesign, I use Premiere, I use Audition. There&#8217;s a number of different ones and then that also extends to the mobile apps as well. And I&#8217;m always finding something new aside from just new features that Adobe rolls out, I&#8217;m always finding something new I can do with Photoshop that I didn&#8217;t know that I could do before. I think probably one of the biggest game changes for me was two of them. The first one was how you could straighten images using the ruler tool. I had no clue about that. Like, I think I lucked up on that one day and was like galaxy brain, like I can&#8217;t believe I can&#8217;t do this now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     I can straighten crooked images with the ruler tool. And then the second thing was the content aware fill how Adobe&#8217;s using like machine learning and AI to fill in parts of an image magically that don&#8217;t exist. I mean just it&#8217;s like magic. It&#8217;s like, oh this makes my job so much easier. I don&#8217;t have to like clone stamp and blur, clone stamp and blur to try to get the texture right or whatever. I mean, I don&#8217;t know. I see what you&#8217;re saying about, I kind of be in that healthy competition. I mean I do have Adobe apps, but I&#8217;ve also got the full affinity suite of apps. I&#8217;ve got designer and following publisher and I&#8217;ve used those as well on times where I couldn&#8217;t use Photoshop because it didn&#8217;t work for a certain thing that I needed to do, but affinity did. So I can see where that could be healthy competition.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yeah. I think it&#8217;s also just always important to know what tools are out there, no matter if it&#8217;s with an Adobe product or not. Just kind of like what can I do to get this done? And I think that&#8217;s just super important as well. There are tools in Photoshop I took a, we&#8217;ll probably get into it, but I took a break for a little while in the creative space to kind of stopped and coming back into using Photoshop I was like, where did this come from? Why didn&#8217;t I know about this? This would have saved me so many tears about three years ago. What happened?</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      But it&#8217;s interesting to watch these products continue to develop because there&#8217;s a reason to why there is content aware fill now. You know what I mean? They&#8217;re realizing, oh okay, if we can do this through machine learning and AI, why not make it slightly easier for somebody? So I do find that to be really interesting and also like a big thank you when you&#8217;re doing design work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     And speaking of content, I mean Adobe has been really like not so suddenly flexing in the content creation department. For the past few years, like there&#8217;s been live streams, of course there&#8217;s conferences like Adobe MAX. Of course there&#8217;s all the articles and things on the Adobe blog. How does that factor into your work, if any? Like that&#8217;s stuff that you have to work with as well?</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      For sure. Outside of doing the day to day finding new contributors and finding new artists to work with. There&#8217;s also like we&#8217;re a pretty small team and Adobe Stock is rather new compared to other departments within Adobe. And so a lot of that the blog writing, doing contributor interviews and spotlights, writing about new features that we&#8217;re finding within templates or marketing that also comes from my team. So also on top of the day to day, and there&#8217;s also I&#8217;m writing blog post, I&#8217;m working with marketing teams, I&#8217;m also building collections. That&#8217;s another big part of my job right now is to build highlighting the best of the templates collection and making sure that that gets out to the marketing team. So on Twitter or on through internal communication, just so people know, kind of like what we&#8217;re doing and what we&#8217;re producing.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      And that&#8217;s something else that I work on. So it&#8217;s actually in ground very deeply into my role. So it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s not just one thing. You&#8217;re always wearing different hats and it&#8217;s always like, I call it the brain switch constantly. One moment you&#8217;re focused on, okay, getting someone&#8217;s contract done and processed and ready and the next thing you&#8217;re like, oh, okay, cool. I get to switch gears and write about an interview another designer. Have those like really awesome conversations about their process and how they thought of this concept or why did they choose this route.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      So yeah, it&#8217;s a multiple fold kind of job and it&#8217;s something that I think I like and I excel in, even with Adobe MAX getting prepared for that this year. There&#8217;s always something. It&#8217;s either you&#8217;re trying to find content to feature during MAX or this year the template scene, we don&#8217;t have too many features coming, but like a couple of years ago we announced Adobe Stock.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      So that was like really interesting. And I was there a couple of years ago working in the booth, meaning people. You get the craziest questions sometimes I don&#8217;t tell people I worked for Adobe because it&#8217;s like I was at a conference, I was actually at the Black is Tech Conference on a panel this was early spring and Adobe has their like booth up because it was also like a recruiting event for us. And I&#8217;m there and this kid comes up to me and call me kid, but he&#8217;s a grown man comes up to me and was like, can you help me with my Photoshop? And I was like, actually I can, so sure. But like every single time you mentioned you worked for Adobe, it&#8217;s like my account won&#8217;t think or like it&#8217;s just you get the craziest stuff and I&#8217;m just like, whoa, that&#8217;s so out of my lane. I don&#8217;t know, but let me try to find someone that can help you. That&#8217;s like the biggest thing is just like I may not be able to do it but like give me your information and I&#8217;ll try to help you out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     You are like tech support basically.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      All of the time. All of the time. I was somewhere, someone was like, &#8220;Oh, where do you work?&#8221; And I go, &#8220;I work at Adobe.&#8221; And he was like immediately wait, let me open my laptop. Can I show you something? And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Ah.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Oh boy.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yeah, it&#8217;s a lot. It&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     So we met in a slack room. We met in the Black is design slack room. And I know that your job has to do with, of course finding designers. I would imagine diversity plays a big part in that. And when you booked, you said the first thing that you said was, I really would love to chat about where to find diverse black designers. You are in the perfect place to have the conversation, so let&#8217;s chop it up.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     What questions do you have? I&#8217;m curious.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yeah. I think for me it was like I&#8217;ve spent my time in different fields, right? So getting kind of back into design was like a shift for me. And then realizing, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve felt this, but I&#8217;m sure you have. It&#8217;s like, okay, you&#8217;re the only one in the room. And for me it didn&#8217;t matter what industry is and if it was in the museums or art or if it was in fashion and photography. I was usually only the only one. So I was like, hold on, I&#8217;m in this position now to actually help and elevate designers at a company that is for designers.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      So my thing is just like, where do I find everybody? And then I found that Slack group and I was like, Oh, okay. I found it. This is great. It was just one of those things where it&#8217;s just like, well, where do I begin? And being in New York too, it&#8217;s I feel like things are so specialized and so niche sometimes where I&#8217;m just like, who am I to walk into this space? And the thing about also being in that Slack group, it&#8217;s like I didn&#8217;t come into that Slack group being like, hey guys, who wants to sign up to be an Adobe stock contributor? I haven&#8217;t done that at all. It&#8217;s more so I just want to get to know people where they&#8217;re&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      &#8230; to know people, where their struggles are in this space and what kind of person can I be in that moment as either an aid or someone who helps or mentors in this space. I think finding those pockets and those areas is super, super important. I also think that having those connections means a lot to a lot of people. Looking at the Slack groups and looking at different boards, I think there&#8217;s another group called African-American Graphic Designers and being in that space has been eye opening as well. I think I&#8217;ve found a few spaces since I put that question out there, but yeah, I&#8217;m always curious to be like, &#8220;Where is everybody?&#8221; All of the time. It&#8217;s interesting, like even my brother, he&#8217;s a sales dude in telecommunications, he&#8217;s a VP of sales for a company and we have this conversation all the time of like, &#8220;Where is everybody?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      How is it this the age and this year and I&#8217;m still sometimes the only one in the room, it doesn&#8217;t make sense. So when you go to find that and you&#8217;re like, okay, and it has to be done in a meaningful way, where do you begin, where do you start? Actually finding that Slack group was, just for me, myself, my own personal career journey, a huge thank you. Because always and often in the world I can walk into art shows and be like, &#8220;Okay cool, how am I in New York and I&#8217;m the only black person in this room?&#8221; That&#8217;s insane to me. That&#8217;s the thing that I want to break down, but also preserve space, I think that&#8217;s super important as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Okay. I&#8217;ve mostly just found people online. People always ask me like, &#8220;How are you able to find so many designers for Revision Path?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;On LinkedIn.&#8221; That&#8217;s usually how I do find people. I&#8217;ll search LinkedIn, I&#8217;ll go through their connections, I see who their connections know. Sometimes I&#8217;ll just pull up a company and just look through who their employees are and try to find the one or two black people that might be in there that might be in design. But then even just from people who I&#8217;ve had on the show, there&#8217;s been a lot of referrals.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     I&#8217;ll interview someone and I&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Oh well if you know some people who you think might be good to have on the show, let me know.&#8221; From there I&#8217;ve been able to build up not just the network for the show, but we&#8217;ve got a running list of about, I don&#8217;t know, maybe about 2,000 or so people that could be on the show. They&#8217;re not just in the US they&#8217;re worldwide. Which, even if you think about it is a small number just when you think about the size of the design industry, but they&#8217;re out there. It&#8217;s harder to find I think for one because of networking and two, because the overall design community has not placed any level of prioritization around spotlighting voices unless it happens to be that diverse voice&#8217;s affinity month. You&#8217;ll hear about us during February, that ain&#8217;t no problem. They&#8217;ll find black designers in February, they&#8217;ll find Hispanic designers between September and October for Hispanic Heritage Month. They&#8217;ll find Asian designers in, I think May is when Asian/Pacific Islander Heritage Month is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     But it&#8217;s like you&#8217;ll find them during that time, but then other times of the year it&#8217;s non-existent because they haven&#8217;t made an attempt to really diversify really who they showcase. A lot of this is perpetuated unfortunately by design media, this is a big reason that I started Revision Path is that I didn&#8217;t see other designers I knew who were doing really great work ever being recognized or ever being showcased and I&#8217;m like, well, there needs to be a platform to showcase this work they&#8217;re doing, so I guess I have to be the one to make the platform.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yeah, I think it&#8217;s a great platform. I&#8217;ve listened to this podcast, so it&#8217;s exciting for me to actually be here, but also part of my other role at Adobe is I am one of the co-leads for the Black Employee Network in New York for Adobe. So that has been an awesome experience as well, is to be connected with other black employees in New York. And the gamut, right? You have people in marketing and people in sales, you have people in design and people who are engineers and getting together with people and being able to talk about what those struggles are in our day to day. Then also having connections with other black employee networks in other offices for Adobe has been this amazing place and being able to elevate certain voices. So my job, my day to day is finding these designers, but I have literally baked it into my KPIs with my manager to make sure that I am elevating certain voices.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      I also set personal goals for myself every year to sign&#8230; I was like, I definitely want to sign on at least three black designers by the end of the year. I also want to be able to make sure that I am working with a lot of women designers as well because I was like, okay, we have this platform, we have this space, let&#8217;s make sure we&#8217;re using it to the best of our ability for those people who usually are looked over or are not recognized. I mean that might not be everybody&#8217;s goal, but it&#8217;s definitely one of mine in my day to day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     For designers that are listening, how can they become an Adobe Stock Contributor? Is there a process or a form they have to fill out or anything?</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      There&#8217;s a process and a form. I&#8217;m trying to think of the best way to go about it. But usually if you navigate through the helpx section of Adobe, you will find the templates page there and there is a form that you can fill out and that will come to my team and we&#8217;ll review portfolios and contact you. Our bandwidth isn&#8217;t the biggest compared to think what people may think it may be, but it&#8217;s a very small, small team going through the process. But yeah, through the helpx page and you can look for templates, there&#8217;s a form there and you&#8217;ll be able to find us.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     And that&#8217;s just helpx.adobe.com?</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, I&#8217;ll try to find it and put a link to it in the show notes because I&#8217;m sure people that are listening will want to be able to get in contact with the team and submit their work so we can help you meet those KPIs, we&#8217;ve got to look out for you. I want to go more into your career, but let&#8217;s learn more about you. I started doing my research, I saw you&#8217;re from a small town called Uniontown, in Pennsylvania?</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Talk to me about growing up there.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Oh wow. Okay. I just talked to my parents today, so I&#8217;m feeling very nostalgic and excited to actually go back for Thanksgiving. If you would have asked me that a couple of years ago, I&#8217;d be like, I&#8217;m never going back. But it&#8217;s a really small town, about an hour and 15 minutes south of Pittsburgh, basically on the West Virginia border. If you can take a sense of what that&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s exactly what you think it is. It&#8217;s a small town of like 14,000 people. I think when I was growing up, it was maybe 16,000 so the population has definitely dropped off. When I was younger I wanted to get out as quickly as possible, but it&#8217;s a beautiful place to grow up. You&#8217;re near the mountains and there&#8217;s lakes and it&#8217;s very beautiful for nature. But growing up there was a little rough.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      My parents worked extremely hard to get us through Catholic school, my brother and I both. My mom was this public school teacher, so she was like, &#8220;I will figure out how to pay for this, but you&#8217;re going to Catholic school,&#8221; and I kind of hated every moment of it. I was also raised Catholic, so I was in Catholic school from kindergarten all the way all the way through high school and graduated with 76 people in my high school class. I dealt with a lot of racism, that&#8217;s just how it is there and it&#8217;s interesting because it is a mixture of people in that town. It&#8217;s just, when you&#8217;re dealing with people who aren&#8217;t from your life, it can be a really difficult kind of place to be, but I don&#8217;t think I would be the person I am if I wasn&#8217;t from there.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      You had to fight a lot. Not physically, but just making sure that you&#8217;re always on point with whatever it is you&#8217;re doing because the goal was to leave. That was also my parents&#8217; goal, was to get us out. &#8220;You have to go, you cannot go to school around here. You have to go.&#8221; So, I&#8217;ve got that push from them mostly to get out and don&#8217;t look back. I mean I joke around all the time because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wow, it&#8217;s really cheap to live there, maybe I should just move back.&#8221; And my mom was like, &#8220;Absolutely not. Heck no, you&#8217;re not doing it. You can come back and visit but you&#8217;re not staying.&#8221; So yeah, I enjoy going back now and of course to see my family and some of my friends who still live there, cousins, but it was an interesting place to grow up for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Wow. I really grew up in a small town. I grew up in Selma, Alabama. A little bit bigger than Uniontown, I think we maybe had about like 25,000 people, but everything that you&#8217;re saying about small high school class, growing up with racism, all of that, we are here. I understand that 100%. Were you exposed to any art and design or anything when you were growing up?</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yeah. My mom grew up in the city of Pittsburgh and my dad is from Uniontown. They met in college and got married and my mom moved away from the big city to this small town and she made it a point, we were in Pittsburgh almost every weekend. We were either going to like Phipps Conservatory to see the flower show, I was encouraged to take photos at a young age, going to the Carnegie Museum, going to the Andy Warhol Museum, taking a trip to DC, going to the Sicilian there. I was always exposed to stuff like that, and even in art class, even though we were just probably with crayons on like Manila paper coloring, we still had art. Then in high school, that&#8217;s when I started taking photo classes, photography. Black and white photography in dark room, my little 35 millimeter Vivitar camera, I still have it.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yeah, I was always encouraged to do stuff, I was always painting at home or my mom always made sure that we were going to go see the symphony, we were going to the ballet at least once or twice a year. Those were things that my parents made sure that my brother and I both experienced. I think even for herself growing up in the city of Pittsburgh and a pretty large family, her mother made sure that she did that. It was just a natural thing, it wasn&#8217;t weird. Because then when I got to high school, I had friends that have never set foot in Pittsburgh before. It&#8217;s an hour drive. You have your license, what do you mean? &#8220;Oh no, I&#8217;ve never.&#8221; There are people who literally at 17, 18-years-old have never made the hour drive into Pittsburgh and that blew my mind. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     I joined marching band when I was in high school and that was really my first foray out of Selma. Selma, I guess similar to Uniontown was like an hour away from the nearest big city. The nearest big city was Montgomery. Montgomery was to us, that was our New York City. They had a movie theater, they had a mall, they had a McDonald&#8217;s. All the things that I didn&#8217;t have growing up, I didn&#8217;t see any of that stuff until I was like 18 but anyway. I get that that sort of&#8230; it&#8217;s almost provincial in a way. I definitely grew with people who had never stepped foot outside of Selma or even never really stepped foot outside of the part of Selma they were in to another part of the city. Because Selma was very much a sundown town, there&#8217;s certain parts you just don&#8217;t do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     But yeah, I feel like if I wouldn&#8217;t have joined marching band and gotten to at least go to other cities in the state and I think eventually we ended up doing some out-of-state stuff, I don&#8217;t think I would&#8217;ve left until I left for college. I would&#8217;ve been one of those people that wouldn&#8217;t have left the city because it wasn&#8217;t even so much that I didn&#8217;t have the want to leave. I wanted to leave, I really wanted to leave, but I couldn&#8217;t see a vehicle and not like a physical vehicle, I couldn&#8217;t see a vehicle to get me out of it until I got to high school really until like junior, senior year. Once college and things came, I was like, &#8220;Oh I could do that.&#8221; I could go to college somewhere and my mom was like, &#8220;You are not going to college out of state. If you go somewhere, you&#8217;re going somewhere close.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     If I told my mom I was moving back home right now, she would roll out the red carpet. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Come back.&#8221; I don&#8217;t understand why, that&#8217;s a whole other podcast. There&#8217;s a, and you can probably attest to this, being in a small town like that, there&#8217;s this weirdly safe and insular feeling from the rest of the world and it&#8217;s like ignorance is bliss kind of thing. If you don&#8217;t know that it exists outside of the city limits, then it doesn&#8217;t matter to you.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yeah, it&#8217;s been interesting going back now, when I go back for the holidays or something like that. The town itself is changing again and it&#8217;s really interesting. There&#8217;s yoga studios popping up, there&#8217;s art galleries popping up and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, this is really cool.&#8221; So people are either coming from other places or people are leaving, seeing something and coming back. So that&#8217;s been really interesting to see. I played sports a lot growing up and so in high school when I got into this photo thing, we took a trip to New York and I came back home and I told my parents that I&#8217;m moving to New York when I&#8217;m done with college. My mom was like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; I was a very shy kid, like you wouldn&#8217;t know I was in the house. I am the person who was somewhere in a corner reading.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      I was very, very, very shy until about high school. Then making this declarative statement that I am moving to New York and then I did, but it was like this, even when I come home now and I seem them they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, are you back now or are you moving back?&#8221; I go, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m literally here for the week.&#8221; It&#8217;s an interesting time and place, but it&#8217;s also really cool to see cities change, that urban sprawl almost again happening where people are finding these smaller towns to raise families in and to live in and to grow a business, I think it&#8217;s really interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     That&#8217;s true because now, I mean at least you know for us in the tech and design industry, a lot of the work we do can be done remotely. I&#8217;m very fortunate that the company that I work for, they&#8217;re based in New York, but I live here in Atlanta and I can still do my job and excel in my job, not being at a physical location, which is great, which is probably a big reason why my mom wants me to move home because she&#8217;s like, &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to live in Atlanta to do this job.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I know, I know that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      &#8220;But I want to.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Right. I totally understand that. Yeah. Before you moved to New York though, you went to Kent State and you studied photography. What was your time like there?</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      It was a weird time, again from a really small town and then I go to Kent State, which is probably triple the size of the town that I grew up in. It was a culture shock for me to be around so many diverse people and to be on my own. It&#8217;s about three hours from Uniontown and it was out of state. It was almost a safe distance from my parents. There were times where they would come hang out and come visit for the day or a couple of days and so I did have a connection. One of my roommates actually in my freshman year, we went to high school together. It was a really close comfort in a way, but also this time to just explore everything. It&#8217;s a big school, people don&#8217;t realize it&#8217;s like the second largest school in the state of Ohio.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yeah. A lot of people don&#8217;t know that. The reasoning for going there was, I actually started out as a pre law major. I was going to be a lawyer. That&#8217;s what someone said I should do and I was like, &#8220;Sure, great, let&#8217;s do this.&#8221; I got into some of the coursework, especially around criminal justice and realized that I can&#8217;t do this. Actually, we were sitting in the Rodney King case, in that frame by frame and I went to Kent in 2003? Studying the Rodney King case frame by frame and then getting to the point that like you would have to maybe defend someone that you don&#8217;t believe is guilty or innocent and I just was like, I can&#8217;t do this. I couldn&#8217;t sleep. I was having trouble sleeping after reading case law and diving even more into politics.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      I was like, this is too crazy for me. I don&#8217;t know how I can do this for the rest of my life. In a split decision moment in a call home, my parents were like both of them on the phone with me in probably two separate rooms in the house telling me that I need to do what I want to do and that you&#8217;re good at photography, why don&#8217;t you do it? You love art, you love history. I was like, &#8220;Oh yeah, art history is a thing too.&#8221; That&#8217;s what I did. That moment walked over to, I think I was housed actually in the journalism school and walked over and changed my major that day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Wow.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     How did that help prepare you for your early career? You mentioned moving to NYC, that was after college? How did it help prep you?</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yeah. I took an internship with a celebrity portrait photographer. His name is Chris Buck. I actually saw his work in GQ because I was a big magazine&#8230; like I love layout, I loved the way things looked on paper. I love physically holding magazines and I knew that I wanted to be a photo editor, but I took this internship with Chris Buck and my first week was like four shoots. The first one was the New York Times. The next one was like Business Insider Magazine. Spin and I think Psychology Today. It was all within the first week of me starting in New York and just being like, &#8220;Wow, this is nuts.&#8221; It&#8217;s another level.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      I don&#8217;t think I would have had that experience anywhere else to work, to meet that photo editor of GQ or to walk into W Magazine or whatever, and just be like, &#8220;Oh, hey I&#8217;m here to drop off some proofs.&#8221; It was this really interesting couple of months for me. I was thrown in the deep end in New York in the middle of the summer. So yeah, kind of how I got here. Then from there, the economy took a nice dive in 2007-2008, so the recession hit and it was really hard to find a job. And when the recession hit-</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      And so the recession hit and it was really hard to find a job. When the recession hit for sure you remember all those magazines were closing left and right and a lot of people got a job. So it was very hard to find a job. Actually didn&#8217;t move back home for 4 months. Then my parents came home one day from work and they&#8217;re like, you got to get out of here. Here&#8217;s pack your bag here&#8217;s a plane ticket go find a job in New York you&#8217;re depressing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Wow.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      And so I did and that&#8217;s kind of how I ended up at trunk archive actually. There was a few other jobs before that within retouching and color correction and production and printing. Then I landed at trunk archive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     The work you&#8217;re doing at trunk archive was retouching like you were mentioning.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      It was more so like image research and keywording. It was more like, cause you&#8217;re getting images in and you&#8217;d have to keyword them and by site and then also researching like is this person the famous artist you know this is all before like AI being able to tech faces and you had to know like okay I think this is a model. Okay let me search through all the model agency websites and let me find this person so you could properly tag everything so everything could be searchable. Which is interesting cause it now comes into my job now like keywording and having metadata and all of that is so important. It&#8217;s just interesting that that now has kind of come part of my job as well. I kind of like was in this very fancy office in Soho at like 21,22 years old and kind of like just kind of thrown in it like you&#8217;re in the office with like famous photographers and you&#8217;re in the office with like models walking through.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      So it just was like this really interesting like those early, like early mid 2000 like years of just exposure to every creative field possible. So it was really cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     It sounds really glamorous.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      It was and I&#8217;m not a glamorous person so it kind of felt like a fish out of water. Like I&#8217;m the girl with jeans and like glasses and the flannel shirt on. You know what I mean? And so it has been like, it was really interesting to like kind of be in that world and have it not really affect what you&#8217;re doing. Cause I was like I&#8217;m just done I&#8217;m making enough money so let&#8217;s figure this out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Yeah. And now after that you held down positions at Lord and Taylor. You were at VF corporation for a while. We were doing the same kind of work there too.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yeah it was doing a lot of like at Lord and Taylor I was doing a lot of like image coordinating and like pre production work. It was like retouching working with retouchers also that&#8217;s kind of where I started getting more into like design work. I was basically like QC the quality control person for a lot of stuff went to print. So like looking to make sure that files were in black and not registration in Design. Making sure that like what I&#8217;m looking at as a final proof is what I&#8217;m seeing on screen. So when all those I was responsible for packaging up all of those materials and sending them off to a printer that&#8217;s kind of cut little bit into like design work and production work there. Then after that I went to VF Corp and worked mostly on Nautica and Kipling and that&#8217;s where I was like a full on retoucher.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Okay.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      So I&#8217;ve like jumped a lot. But yeah, retouching in E-Commerce in the photo studio. So again, surrounded with like hair and makeup people who are still to this day friends with some of them. Some of the models are also really lovely too and just having like a really small young all female staff in the photo studio was also super exciting for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     What made you decide to go to grad school?</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Oh boy. I didn&#8217;t really see a future in what I was doing. I thought my choices were to somehow creep into creative direction but I didn&#8217;t see a movement there at all. I didn&#8217;t see an opening our clearing for me to move that way or it was to leave Nautica and go to another company just like it and do retouching there and do the same thing.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      And I was like i don&#8217;t get to be part of the decision making or the thought process behind a lot of things in that role. I was like okay, I&#8217;ve always wanted to work with nonprofits. I have always wanted to work a little bit more closely with artists. I decided to go to Pratt and get my master&#8217;s in arts and cultural management and with that thought process it was more so along the lines of i want to run or become like an assistant director or director of a nonprofit. That&#8217;s where my head was at the moment but the great thing about the program i will say it was really diverse in terms of curriculum. It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re learning how to budget, you&#8217;re learning IP law, you&#8217;re learning just how to communicate with different people in terms of leadership.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      It was at this really interesting kind of combination of things that really had me kind of entranced then completely into this idea of working for a nonprofit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Well you ended up in Adobe right after that. You worked for a museum actually for a while.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      I worked in the museum for a year. In the future a [inaudible 00:05:05] , okay, let me see if this kind of structure of nonprofits and kind of like an academic art world situation would be right for me and quickly decided that it wasn&#8217;t. I knew that I always wanted to be in touch with the artist community and just community building in general so in between all those jobs I also was always like working with friends and we started a collective. Where we were doing kind of like nonprofit artwork meaning we were throwing parties in Brooklyn art shows so I would find artists all over Brooklyn or friends of friends and kind of we would curate these shows and have bands play and all the money that we would collect would go to a local nonprofit in the neighborhood we were having a show.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      So that&#8217;s kind of what set me on the path of being really excited about art and how art in the community works because at the time it&#8217;s like bushwick was new in a thing and starting and you had these local nonprofits who had no connection with the community or you had community and artists who were living there but didn&#8217;t know anything about the neighborhood. So it was kind of like our duty almost to kind of go in and make those connections. Yeah so I was always doing that in between different jobs and different roles and then just found that kind of all come together within my master&#8217;s program.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     So with a lot of the work that you&#8217;re doing, I mean design and is clearly part of the conversation. I mean it&#8217;s interesting cause you&#8217;re working for essentially a software company that also sort of intersects a lot with the creative world and it feels like especially when we&#8217;re talking about tech that design tends to be really designed and art in general tend to be left out of the conversation. There&#8217;s been places where I&#8217;ve worked that it&#8217;s been like pulling teeth to try to get a design hire or something because they figured out what we can and demonetize it so they figured out we can just get a freelancer and doing it and it&#8217;s not super important to our brands as long as we just get like the thing that we need done. What do you think art and design tends to be left out of the conversation when it comes to tech?</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      I think a lot of people will put this very high mark on like engineering and the skill set that&#8217;s needed for that and yes I understand computer science is not maybe the easiest thing in the world to study. If it was I think everyone would be a computer scientist and I know some people who have left the creative world to do that. I think that the thing that kind of needs to shift in thinking is the creative people that have to also implement their part of the deal. Like I don&#8217;t know a lot of designers that are paid like engineers and I&#8217;m really kind of curious to kind of explore a little bit further like to why that is. Why is a creative person almost less valuable than someone who knows code? And I think that also I work a lot with some students that are in high school at the high school level and every time you talk to a new group of students like I&#8217;m going to be an engineer, I want to be computer scientist, I want to do this.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Like that&#8217;s cool but I think there are other things that you can do and learn and just as and be just as happy. Like if you are a creative person and you are an artist at heart, why do we have to make such a delineation? And a mark between the two. So I think that the conversation you were trying to push, especially young black kids into STEM and we&#8217;re completely leaving out. I think that for some people, and I definitely was one of those kids that I needed that creative outlet throughout my life and still do to be able to like I have a place somewhere. I think it&#8217;s something that people have left out because it&#8217;s easy to put I think like you said, a price tag on this certain skill. It&#8217;s still very hard to measure someone&#8217;s creativity and if they&#8217;re good or bad at it. You totally measure someone that if they&#8217;re not hitting something exactly it&#8217;s just I think that mindset completely has to change what is important in work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Yeah cause I mean the thing is that creativity is not an untapped resource like that. Like say for example, if you&#8217;re hiring someone to do like a custom image for you or do branding or something like that and instead of you coming to them with a discreet concept that you&#8217;re kind of coming with just the general thoughts. They have to do the research to try to find what you&#8217;re looking for. They have to do sketches there&#8217;s a lot of back and forth to kind of determine whether or not this is the right thing and it&#8217;s oftentimes when I&#8217;ve worked with big companies they always will just try to boil it down to a number of hours like Oh well how many hours will that take as if you can just click the stopwatch and then just automatically get to it. You know it&#8217;s not that simple of a process.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     I wonder if the commodification of it comes from the fact that it&#8217;s maybe just not seen as valuable especially in the tech industry. I mean I&#8217;ve had several designers here on the show and several developers also and it just seems to be this running thing of design not getting a seat at the table. It&#8217;s not I guess understood in a way that people realize that design influences people. Design is something that we&#8217;ve all had interactions with since birth.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     We all come into the world especially now as adults with a very rich design language. We may not be able to tap into it as readily as a designer could but that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re designers. They&#8217;re specialists in that way. Like we all know if something like if we get a shirt and it doesn&#8217;t like fit right or if we sit in a chair and it&#8217;s not comfortable or we use a pen and like the ink is leaking out over here, I&#8217;m like, those are poorly designed experiences and we all have these touch points or I&#8217;ve had these touch points throughout our lives with design so we know what we like and what we don&#8217;t like.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     I think designers have the keen sense to be able to tap into that more easily and then turn that into something that can serve a business&#8217;s goals and that&#8217;s a skill that translation, transmutation if you want to really get fancy with it. That&#8217;s a skill that a lot of people do not have to be able to make something out of nothing and I think with tech, what happens is like a lot of the executives that you see sort of propped up they&#8217;re not as funny. Not only are they engineers but they also didn&#8217;t go to college or they dropped out of college or something like that. So it&#8217;s not even so much the whole I want to be an engineer but also like not to say that college is the way because you certainly don&#8217;t have to go to college to be a designer but there&#8217;s a lot of interesting overlapping narratives that go into it and you know, of course capitalism is a big part of it because you hear about starving artists you don&#8217;t hear about a starving engineer.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Exactly and I that&#8217;s kind of like my whole, like when I speak about designer and my path into it. It has to be I want people to know that It&#8217;s not like you said the starving artist. I know starving artists I know well but a lot of them have taken on other skills and I think that&#8217;s another thing too. I talk to a really good friend of mine recently about this idea of like do you specialize in something or do you become a generalist? And I feel like I&#8217;m a generalist I think I have like there&#8217;s something that has to be said for people who can pick up things learn them and execute them well and then also you mentioned something about like being able to design and that&#8217;s the one thing like with my current role is like looking at designers.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      You can design whatever but when you design a template you have the thing about your end user. How many people are thinking about that process like from conception to the end and it sometimes that design and that art doesn&#8217;t end with you. It&#8217;s picked up by someone who&#8217;s purchasing it or enjoying it so I think sometimes in the realm of like understanding I think all of them just don&#8217;t even understand what designers do. I&#8217;ve come across that a lot they&#8217;re being very specific words for what people are doing and what people are doing on their daily life of the job. I don&#8217;t think a lot of people deep down I don&#8217;t think completely understand what a designer&#8217;s role is and what the expansiveness of it can be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Yeah and to that end I have a question and this is sort of a thing that I&#8217;m trying to run with this throughout the year. Which is how are you using your skills as a designer or as someone who works with designers and creativity?. How are you using your skills to help create a more equitable future?</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Yeah, I mean I think for myself I am lucky enough to work for a company that is allowing for that space to happen within the walls of Adobe and being able to just connect with people in general and being almost like an ear or a support to them I think is has been not only great for me as someone who&#8217;s always looking to connect with people but also just for anyone else involved. Like I have younger coworkers that are like &#8220;I&#8217;m going through this&#8221; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to do&#8221; and I&#8217;m like &#8220;Well I&#8217;m glad that you came to me to talk about it, let&#8217;s talk about it&#8221;. I think that being really open to the idea of helping other people and being maybe a little bit of a support system or building a support system I think is super important in your space.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Either if you&#8217;re a lot of people work remote and I think that sounds has to be I think semi hard for people too is like where do you find people to connect with? I always tell people like extra time like for networking and networking doesn&#8217;t have to be like okay, I&#8217;m dropping you my business card and networking can be like, Hey I have this question or I&#8217;m going through this experience. What has your life been like during this? And if I can tell anyone listen I&#8217;ve been in some situations and jobs with people that as being a woman of color and as being a black woman has not been favorable. It has not been an easy road by any means but I&#8217;ve always been able to ask questions and kind of seek out that you know information that I&#8217;m needing and for me it&#8217;s like if I can reduce the worry and the pain and the tears that I have had in my life.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Being a black woman in art, design, creativity or tech it&#8217;s also something that I have to put on myself is to make sure that other people aren&#8217;t going through the same thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Now it&#8217;s the year 2025 where do you see yourself? Like what kind of work do you see yourself doing in the future?</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      It&#8217;s so interesting. I never as you can see, I jump a lot. In the future I kind of want to have my own thing going. I don&#8217;t know exactly what it looks like. I feel like every year I&#8217;m building on this idea of like what kind of creative agency I can have or what creative output I can have in the world. I&#8217;ve always kind of worked in bigger corporations. I would like to kind of see what it&#8217;s like to work for something smaller or to work for myself. I don&#8217;t know what capacity that would be yet but I still hope to be in New York or if I win the lottery have an Island somewhere who knows?. I always see myself, I feel like this in the past year I&#8217;ve kind of come into my own a little bit in terms of my career and what I excel at and what I don&#8217;t excel at.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Like I know what I don&#8217;t want to do. I can see that but when it comes to wanting knowing exactly what I want to do I can&#8217;t pinpoint that. I&#8217;m always an open book to like it&#8217;s just like Oh that looks cool. How does that person do that? How do I incorporate that into my world?. I just think it&#8217;s like, I want to say open to the idea and the prospect but 2025 I would like to be working for myself only cause I want to have my own hours and do my own thing but I also love being connected to other people. I like coming into the office working with my team which is also a very diverse team as well so I kind of battle like I can do anything. That&#8217;s what I have to say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Okay, well just to kind of wrap things up here where can our audience find out more about you or your work or even the work you&#8217;re doing with Adobe where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Sure. You can first start off by going to the Adobe stock website and checking out all our templates online. I&#8217;m also on LinkedIn. Find me on LinkedIn, it&#8217;s Caitlin Cruz and I will definitely connect with you and I love chatting. I&#8217;m kind of off social media. I don&#8217;t really do Twitter and I don&#8217;t have a Facebook anymore. I&#8217;m on Instagram It&#8217;s just Caitlin Cruz first and last name you can find me there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     All right, sounds good. Well, Caitlin Cruz I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I think first I want to thank you for really just giving us a little peek behind the curtain of Adobe. I mean just for someone who has used Adobe products for so long and it&#8217;s been such, I think an integral part of my development, early development really as a designer. It&#8217;s interesting to see how things work there and I think it&#8217;s really dope that the work that you&#8217;re doing really helps to showcase others. Like you were mentioning at some point when we were talking about how to use your skills for more equitable future and you&#8217;re saying that you kind of want to make those opportunities for other people and I feel like this work that you&#8217;re doing is that&#8217;s a prime example of making that happen. You&#8217;re giving people not just a space to be celebrated but also an opportunity to advance themselves through this and it&#8217;s really just as simple as a connection to make that happen. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Caitlin Crews</b>:      Thank you for having this. Awesome to speak with you.<br>
