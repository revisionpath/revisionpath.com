Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>It takes a lot of drive and determination to chart your own course, and no one embodies those qualities better than this week&#8217;s guest. As the creative director (and founder) of <a href="https://curvetheory.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Curve Theory</a>, Reggie Tidwell has provided beautiful and effective design, branding, photography, and videography work to clients for over 20 years. </p>
<p>We talked about the secret to Reggie&#8217;s longevity as a creative entrepreneur, and he shared his story about growing up in St. Louis, studying graphic design, and his early post-grad career as a Flash designer in the beginning days of the World Wide Web. Reggie also spoke about what brought him to North Carolina, and about his work in bringing an AIGA chapter to Asheville.

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Hey, I&#8217;m Reggie Tidwell and I am a graphic designer and a professional photographer as well as a videographer, which I do on occasion as well. I tell stories.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s the year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Wow, it has been a great year. Bought a house.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Thank you. I also have had my best financial career last year. Everything has culminated to that, and this year seems to be on track to even beat that, so that&#8217;s super exciting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, that&#8217;s real good. That&#8217;s real good. I mean, even with all of that, is there anything in particular that you want to try to accomplish before the year ends?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, once you own a house, there&#8217;s always house stuff that you want to accomplish, but professionally, man, things have just been falling into place and sort of a beautiful way that I feel just very excited. I&#8217;m going to be doing all of the photography for&#8230; So I&#8217;m a huge fan of the outdoors and nature landscape photography. I do a lot of that for Explore Asheville, which is our big tourism division here in Asheville, and the Gray Smoking Mountain Association has reached out and they&#8217;re going to have me do all the photography for their new book on Cade&#8217;s Cove, which is a really beautiful spot in the Smokies. So if you&#8217;ve ever been to Great Smokey Mountain National Park, it&#8217;s our biggest and most visited national park in the country and it&#8217;s absolutely gorgeous. But I&#8217;m super excited. I&#8217;m going to be doing all the photos for the book, so I&#8217;ll get a book cred.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. Congratulations on that.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about your company Curve Theory. Now, Curve Theory has been around for over 20 years, which I definitely have to tip my hat to you. I ran a studio for nine years and I know how much goes into that. So 20, over 20 years, I think. What, 21 now, right?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
21 years. 21. I&#8217;m in my 21st year. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What&#8217;s been the key to your longevity?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Quite honestly, it&#8217;s building relationships. I&#8217;ve never advertised. It really is a combination of building relationships and being passionate about the work that I do. I love designing photography, I love being a creative, I love people. And so it just makes sense that I would be able to maintain this business because it&#8217;s all the things that I love and things that I would be doing anyway. I&#8217;m always building relationships. I always tell people, and I always think it&#8217;s a funny little bit of a factoid about me. I don&#8217;t typically just add people on Facebook that I don&#8217;t know, and I&#8217;ve got 3000 plus connections on Facebook and every single one of them is someone that I know. I had either a meaningful conversation with and align somewhere, or they&#8217;re friends in real life or I served on the board with them, or whatever the case may be. They&#8217;re all real connections and when you think about that, that&#8217;s a lot of&#8230; Exponentially the more people, the sort of more you can grow your network. This business for me is really about being present and available.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s really good for Facebook. I think Facebook and probably a lot of social media networks now have really enabled this way to just collect friends, almost like you&#8217;re, I don&#8217;t know, collecting trading cards or something like that without really having any intentionality behind it. The way that you&#8217;re about connections on Facebook. That&#8217;s how I am on LinkedIn. I&#8217;m really, unless I&#8217;ve worked with you or I know you personally or something like that, we met at a conference or something, we&#8217;ve had a conversation. That&#8217;s usually the only way that I&#8217;ll add people. Although now, lately I have gotten a little lax and well, partly because I let them stack up. So I&#8217;ll go months without adding anyone on LinkedIn and all of a sudden I&#8217;ve got a hundred connections. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, I should probably go through these and see who I know.&#8221; And I tell people, write a note to let me know how we know each other. And I mean some of them are just sales calls and what have you, but&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So many of those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But in terms of the power of the network, I got laid off recently and I posted I think two posts on LinkedIn about it and I was flabbergasted by how my network showed up and spread the word and put me in connection with other people. And I&#8217;ve had some great conversations and such, so&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
That&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s this author Porter Gale who says your network is your net worth. I totally believe that. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Totally. Yeah. I get so much business from those connections on Facebook. I mean, quite honestly, it&#8217;s just doing stuff, especially from the photography side of my business. I&#8217;ll post a photo and I&#8217;m constantly posting photos and I do also on LinkedIn. Ultimately what ends up happening is because you&#8217;re constantly putting content out when someone thinks a photography and someone says, &#8220;Hey, do you know a great photographer?&#8221; You should be in someone&#8217;s very short list of their mental Rolodex. And that&#8217;s what happened. I get calls all the time. Hey, so and so&#8230; I mentioned on Facebook that I was looking for a drone photographer or a lifestyle photographer, a commercial photographer, whatever, and they mention you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What&#8217;s a typical day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So for me, it&#8217;s nice being a designer and a photographer because on any given day, I never know it could bring me being out in a field on a photo shoot, it could bring me in a brand strategy session with a client, or a discovery session with a new branding client, whatever it is. It&#8217;s nice because my days aren&#8217;t always the same. I get to travel, I get to, for instance tomorrow I&#8217;m going to be in another area of North Carolina for a commercial shoot for pretty much much of the day, starting at Golden Color. And it&#8217;s nice. And then Friday I&#8217;m in the studio all day, probably editing photos from that shoot and rounding out a logo for another client.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you include your photography as part of your design service, so I guess company services, I should say?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Kind of. Occasionally the two will intertwine, usually the two intertwine when I&#8217;m doing web designing. So if I&#8217;m designing a website for a client, a lot of times because I know exactly what kind of images the client needs, I can add it as part of my service to do a lifestyle shoot of their company or their clientele, and then that can get baked into their website. And I&#8217;m working with my own images. I can control a lot more effort that way. But yeah, it happens. It doesn&#8217;t happen as much because I don&#8217;t do as much web design as I used to. I&#8217;m probably doing about two or three sites a year where I used to do quite a bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Back when I had my studio, I wound things down from the design end, I&#8217;d say roughly around in the mid 2010s because there was certainly a market for bespoke web design. They want, people wanted a particular website theme or something like that. But now with all these website builders out here, people are taking the design element, or at least the modular parts or the design process into their own hands. And it&#8217;s like, yeah, I don&#8217;t really need bespoke anymore. And so I ended up doing more consulting because you were able to shift like that. So it&#8217;s interesting now because I&#8217;m looking for work at the moment and people are like, &#8220;Oh, okay, you redesign a website?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, Ah. I mean I haven&#8217;t done it in a long time maybe.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I&#8217;m probably not your first choice for that, but I get what you mean. People, they hear design and of course if you have an online presence and a website, that&#8217;s the first thing they think about is, &#8220;Oh, can you design a website or can you redesign a website?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
I think depending on the client, I do still see value in bespoke. I feel like ultimately I&#8217;ll end up doing a completely custom website where I&#8217;ll get to work with a developer and I&#8217;ll design the front end and we can work beautifully and make something really amazing. But that doesn&#8217;t happen as often as I would like. But I do find the builders have actually worked for me because especially if you know them, there&#8217;s Divi and Elementor, there&#8217;s a handful of other ones I&#8217;ve been using Divi for a while, and though it can be a little bit verbose in it&#8217;s code, I find that the flexibility of me being able to do something completely custom using mostly you doing custom CSS to some of their built in modules.<br>
So I can build the content and lay out the content really quickly, then go in with CSS and really start to fine tune and make it exactly what I want it to be. That&#8217;s a nice, because I do work with very large clients and also small clients, that&#8217;s a really nice option for clients that don&#8217;t have six to 10 grand in their pocket to do a website. It&#8217;s just nice to have that as an option and for them to still get something that&#8217;s custom.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of which, what are the best types of clients for you to work with?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Quite honestly, I&#8217;ve got a soft spot for the mom and pop shops, either they&#8217;re startups or they&#8217;ve been around for a while and it&#8217;s time to change things up. I love that transition of being able to help them renew their own passion in their business through that process. I&#8217;m working on the branding right now for an auction house that&#8217;s been around for decades. They&#8217;ve been on Antique Roadshow, so they&#8217;ve got a presence, but their brand look is a bit dated and they&#8217;ve started resting on their laurels a little bit because everything is just so tried and true. It is what it is. It&#8217;s been what it&#8217;s been. And they realize this time to shake things up a little bit. They want to expand their market a little bit, they want to&#8230; And so going through that process with them, it&#8217;s so rewarding because they&#8217;ve been living with the same logo for 20 years, or longer.<br>
And to be able to see them embrace something that&#8217;s different, and it&#8217;s a fun process too with this particular client because they were like, &#8220;Yeah, we want some completely modern and avant garde.&#8221; And I went there, they were like, &#8220;Oh no. We love it, but we&#8217;re not ready yet.&#8221; And so, okay, that&#8217;s good. At least I know what your comfort level is. And so now I can dial it back and land exactly where we need to be. And then feeling them working through the resistance but then initially, not only acceptance, but oh my God, this is amazing. This is going to be really great for our company. We&#8217;re excited. That&#8217;s a great feeling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So when a project, let&#8217;s say, comes in your inbox or something like that, what does your process look like when it comes to starting on new work?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So I usually have a quick little meeting with the client just qualify whether or not we&#8217;re going to work well together and whether I&#8217;m the guy for the job. But then once that decision is made, I set up a discovery session where we really actually start to dig deep into the typical discovery questionnaire where you learn a little bit more about their business, their aspirations, what&#8217;s working, what&#8217;s not working, so I can better provide exactly what they&#8217;re looking for. I feel like, for me anyway, I feel like the key to being a good designer that makes happy clients and solves the right problems or solves problems in the right way is asking the right questions at the very beginning. So I&#8217;m all about being inquisitive. I want to know everything. And if you feel like it&#8217;s too much, it&#8217;s not.<br>
Because at the end of the day when I&#8217;m digging into sketching out logo concepts or I&#8217;m coming up with a tagline or whatever that information that I&#8217;m going to be so thankful that I have it because I can go through and dig in for inspiration to recheck the direction that I&#8217;m going to make sure I&#8217;m headed in the right way. But yeah, it&#8217;s all about the Q and A, at the beginning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I see here on your website that you do a lot of volunteer work. You worked also with Leaf Community Arts. Can you talk to me a little bit about that?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. So, Leaf Community Arts for me was a big part of, I did service work before that, but it probably to date was probably one of the biggest chapters in my life in terms of giving back. Leaf Community Arts is a nonprofit here in the Asheville area that they have teaching artists that go into the public school system and the neighborhood centers and basically recreation centers and they work with youth, teaching them poetry, dance, how to play the Djembe, how to do different types of art, visual art. It&#8217;s pretty amazing. And it gives kids this sense of ownership of something which I think is quite necessary, especially for the age range of students that they work with. But then they also have this other part that I was actually more aligned with was they do cultural preservation in First Nations, third world countries like [inaudible 00:16:38], and Uganda, and Rwanda, and Cuba, all these different places where there are cultures that have been around for ages and First Nations tribes that as the youth are becoming more westernized and the elders are dying off, these cultures are just vanishing.<br>
There&#8217;s no evidence of their songs, or instrument making, or costumes, or any of it. And so what Leaf Community Arts did what they were partnering with an agency on the ground that was trying to do that cultural preservation and help raise money to do things like build recording studios, or hire artisans that know the native language to native songs, the instrument making, the dances. And they actually make it really cool for the youth where they&#8217;re putting their phones down, and totally engaging, and dancing, and singing. And I found that particularly interesting. I love the beauty of cultures, and how different cultures are, and how you can learn something completely and different from a culture that you never had experienced before.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now are you still doing work with them? I know that now you&#8217;re also the new president of AIGA Asheville, the founding president, but have you waned your work with Leaf Community Arts?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
I have still a supporter of it. I worked all the way up to my presidency in 2017 and then my term ended. So I&#8217;m now board president emeritus. I&#8217;m still, the Leaf Community Arts people are family, they actually put on a huge music festival three times a year. I&#8217;ve met Arrested Development, Speech. Now we know each other by name. I&#8217;ve met, gosh, we&#8217;ve had Angelique Kidjo, and Mavis Staples, and Indigo Girls, and all these amazing bands that have come played. The Family Stone. But they put on this music festival in the spring and in the fall and this really beautiful place out in Black Mountain called, Black Mountain, North Carolina, called Lake Eden. And then they do one in downtown Asheville in the summer. And that basically raises money for all of the work that I mentioned before that they do with cultures and with the youth.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. Nice. And we&#8217;ll talk more about your AIGA Asheville work a little bit later on in the interview. With everything that you do through Curve Theory, what gets you truly excited about your work?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Man, I love to solve problems. Quite honestly. I love working with clients and trying to find out exactly what&#8217;s not working with them and helping come up with solutions that one, inspire and excite them. But then also they continue to propel me forward in my love of the work that I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now let&#8217;s dive a little bit into your personal story. You talk about this I think a bit on your website, but you grew up in St. Louis. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Born and raised?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So I grew up in St. Louis, Missouri. I was raised mostly by my grandmother, an amazing dad too, that was also in the picture. But most of my time was spent with my grandmother, who was an educator. She taught for 36 years and she was a huge supporter of education. And so in the summers where all my friends were out playing and running around, I had to do homework before I could go out and join them.<br>
And of course I hated it then, but on some level I understood the importance of it and it would come into play in many periods throughout my life, just being someone that is studious. I ended up testing the highest in the seventh grade in language and math in the entire school that I was in seventh.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
In seventh grade. Which that said a lot about my grandmother&#8217;s dedication and how she worked it with me, but it wasn&#8217;t with a heavy hand. She just understood that she wanted me&#8230; I grew up in a very, I would say mean, just put it bluntly. It was a poor neighborhood, lot of gang violence, a lot of break-ins and theft. And I saw some pretty horrific things in my own neighborhood, just in my own alley. It wasn&#8217;t a place that I wanted to definitely grow up and grow old.<br>
And so education for me was the key of being able to get to a more ideal situation. So I wouldn&#8217;t say I was a first generation college student. My mother had a degree music, actually two. She had wanted music and art, possibly three maybe in education. But my grandmother, of course was educated. And so it set me on my path to discover who I really wanted to be in the world. I think you had mentioned very briefly what was it that made me choose this path of design? But all that didn&#8217;t come quite easily.<br>
I ended up pretty much blowing away my first couple years in St. Louis at a junior college called Florissant Valley. I think I had a 1.9 GPA because I wasn&#8217;t inspired. I picked business administration because I knew I wanted to be an entrepreneur. But you&#8217;re asking a 18 year old, 17 year old, 18 year old kid to decide what they want to do for the rest of their life. And yeah, of course I want to run a business. Oh yeah, business administration, that&#8217;s what you should do. But that&#8217;s such a broad topic. I wasn&#8217;t inspired.<br>
I actually went from that student, at one point I was the student in the back of the class nodding off, not very inspired. The teacher would call on me and not only did I not know the answer to the question, I wouldn&#8217;t even know what the question was because I was probably asleep. So I ended up taking a break after four semesters of that, I said I got to do better. This isn&#8217;t going the way I wanted to go. So I ended up taking a semester off and really doing some deep diving and soul searching. I talked to my counselor at the school. I really thought long and heavy about what I liked and the things that I knew I liked were being creative. I was always drawing from the time I could hold a pencil, I was sketching and doodling. And so I always loved art. My mom was an artist, is an artist. And so that was an inspiration.<br>
And so I went back to school. I decided at the time that I wanted to be an interior designer or a architect. And the path to both of those were mechanical drawing and a lot of drafting. And so that was all I needed to be inspired. I went from that student that I mentioned before to the student making the top score on every test in every class until I graduated. I went from a 1.9 GPA to a 3.2 GPA, graduated with honors and got my general transfer studies to go on to a four year college.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know there&#8217;s that saying that goes, sometimes you have to do things that you don&#8217;t necessarily want to do to try to get to do the things that you do want to do. But I think also to that end, just from what you&#8217;re mentioning, that whole period of high school going into college, there&#8217;s so much pressure to try to decide exactly what it is you&#8217;re going to do. And I mean we also, I think have to put this in the context of just where the world was at this time. Because I&#8217;m guessing this is around early nineties. Early nineties.<br>
And there was just this push, and I was mean I was in elementary school then, but I mean still there was this push to know exactly what it is that you&#8217;re going to do with your life at fairly early age. Look at the state of the world with what&#8217;s going on, what is it that you want to do? And for a lot of people it&#8217;s tough. I mean, even when I started out in college, I ended up switching majors because I thought I wanted to do one thing just based on societal norms and such. And then I was like, eh, I don&#8217;t really like it.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
I know. That&#8217;s a big part of it. I mean, thinking about it nowadays students take what they call a gap year. I am a firm supporter of that because I do feel like somebody that young needs to go out into the world a little bit and understand who they are. I mean, up to that point, they&#8217;ve just been a student studying all the basic electives. There&#8217;s nothing in that that would potentially produce career inspirations. Maybe you like math and maybe you like biology, but that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you want to be a mathematician, or a scientist, or a biologist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So yeah, I feel like that would&#8217;ve served me well. But thankfully I was able to make that comeback and find that inspiration.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You ended up going to Maryville, University of St. Louis and there you studied graphic design. Talk to me about that time.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So yeah, actually Maurice, I started, remember I said I was interested in just interior design or architecture. That&#8217;s what got me to Maryville because they actually had a nice interior design program. And I got there in those first two years I thrived. I was still inspired and I was still being a great student and loving the experience. But at one point I got, so the way Maryville&#8217;s program was set up at the time was you did all your art electives and got all those out of the way, and your art electives as well. You got those out of the way the first two years and then you dove into your concentration.<br>
Right as I was about to make that transition, I talked to my counselor, Nancy Rice, at the time and I was like, I don&#8217;t know if I want to do interior design. I like the sketching part, I like the conceptualizing, but then it&#8217;s all floor plans and elevations and it gets super technical and that&#8217;s the part that&#8217;s where I get lost. And this particular teacher who, it is funny because I&#8217;ll tell you this in a second. She basically told me, Reggie, you&#8217;re great at computers. You love computers. I&#8217;ve been working on computers since I was 15. My grandmother bought me a Commodore 64 and I was programming in basic, I was playing games. I became very comfortable in that computer world. The nerd, the invention of the nerd. I took that as a compliment. She&#8217;s like, yeah, you&#8217;re big in the computers. And then she said, and you also love art, so you should consider graphic design.<br>
And for me that was a new term. I hadn&#8217;t thought about it. And once I did the exploration and thought about it and understood what graphic design was and understood that I&#8217;d already seen it all around me all the time already and thought about how I could be someone contributing to that. Yeah, I was like, you&#8217;re exactly right. This is exactly what I want to do. And that&#8217;s where it started. I feel, I feel really fortunate that I&#8217;m someone who got a degree in something that I&#8217;m actually still doing.<br>
I guess it was a few years ago, I reached out to her because we&#8217;re friends on Facebook. I thanked her. I didn&#8217;t remember if I&#8217;d ever thanked her, but my whole career came from that decisive moment where she told me about something I didn&#8217;t know about. And then I ran with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m trying to think, I&#8217;m trying to place this in time because we talked earlier about early nineties. So this is mid nineties or so.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So this is mid nineties. Yep. Mid nineties. Actually&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. When you said&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
&#8230;ended up graduating with my BFA in graphic design and December of &#8217;97.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Tell me what it was studying design back then, because you also have the big advent of the personal computer. You&#8217;ve got the coming of the internet as we know it. What was it studying design during that time?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Man, it was wild. I mean, first and foremost, we&#8217;re working on Apple Performs 4500s I think was the model number.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
And I mean these things were tanks and dinosaurs. You could have Photoshop open, only, or Illustrator, but not both. And if, we&#8217;re talking 32 megabytes of RAM and I mean lots of crashes, so you had to frequently save your work. We definitely did some cut and paste stuff because that was just not too far out of the rear view mirror that people were still making the migration to computer. So there was still a lot of manual cut and copy and paste, cut and paste design, lot of assemblage, a lot of that stuff was still going on. So of course it was part of our curriculum.<br>
And I&#8217;ll tap into my photography side as well. I always find it a little bit of a, for me, I paid my dues. It was a rite of passage that I actually got to do photography. I got to take photos using film and understand the value of the frame and not just take in 450 shots and hoping there&#8217;s a good one in there. And then actually developing my film in the dark room, all that stuff was happening around the same time, which all feels of course very archaic now. But that was the start. That was what it was like back then.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean it sounds like it was just really hands on because the computer couldn&#8217;t do everything. I mean, it could do some things, but you still, like you said, have to do copy and paste, or cut and paste, or you still have to take photos and develop them yourself. It&#8217;s so wild now when I think about digital cameras, because I remember in high school having Fun Saver cameras. You go to the party, you have your Fun Saver camera, you take all kind of shots, you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re going to get back until you get it back from Eckerd or wherever that you got them developed at. But yeah, and I took a photography course back then too, so I know about developing in the dark room and stuff, which now seems&#8230; It&#8217;s funny. I&#8217;ll watch a movie or something and they always paint it as this, I don&#8217;t know, old school way of doing things. Developing. And it&#8217;s not that far away from now.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
No. No. And honestly it&#8217;s become of a niche for some people. I know a lot of people that actually I say a lot, but a handful of people that are still shooting film and still developing in that handful of dark rooms that are left. And it&#8217;s something, I think maybe they embrace it, not because they&#8217;re too stubborn to switch to digital, but it&#8217;s a craft for them. Some of them are people that have embraced digital, but they also still really love film. I admire that. I think it&#8217;s great. I don&#8217;t miss it. I don&#8217;t miss the smelling the smell of fixer and then and not knowing what you&#8217;re going to get until you are dropping it into the developer and hoping that you nailed it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I could imagine even doing design back then because computers were changing and software was changing and everything. Were there trends back then? I&#8217;m just curious because I feel like a lot of stuff still carried over from print, but were there specific graphic design trends that you remember from back then?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean I think there was a time where decorative fonts were really starting to become prevalent. And you started, I mean this was quite honestly, I think this was when fonts like Hobo were actually still being used.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Oh yeah, yeah. Papyrus. Yeah, I feel like there was a exploration&#8230; Fonts just exploded. And with the advent of the computer, fonts started off trickling in and then they exploded. And I think designers had to be really disciplined to not, I feel like most designers were going really far out and using all these crazy decorative fonts and still having their design disciplines about them. So they may only use one decorative font and a nice San Serif that balanced it. But those fonts were not elegant, at all. And it of course, depending on what you were trying to do with it. And I think what has happened, we&#8217;ve seen from a time where people were trying to get away from using the tried and true fonts, the Adobe Garamond, the Futura. People were feeling like those were overused or they were too basic and so they had to expand their typeface horizons. And then I find these days, man, some of the best brands go back to basics and are going back to some of those tried and true fonts and looking for things that are a little more elegant.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I didn&#8217;t even think about the proliferation of typefaces as something that was part of design back then, but it was. I mean really because you had, of course, greater displays that were coming out and you could just do more than what you could do with print in terms of the types of typefaces. You just had different things.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
I think that was it. I think it was so many people were used to doing manual print design and then all of a sudden you&#8217;ve got access to 3000 fonts. Hold me back.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
That&#8217;s exactly what it was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you graduate from Maryville. You&#8217;re out there in the real world as a designer. What was that early postgrad career like? Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So the first thing I did, so going back to that whole wanting to be an entrepreneur thing, that still was in me. I still definitely wanted to have my own business and I started actually working with clients before I graduated. I worked at Office Depot, so I met a lot of people and there were people coming in that needed business cards, but they were really awful designs that they had or they didn&#8217;t have one at all. And I said, &#8220;Well this is what I do.&#8221; So I started developing a clientele before I even graduated and then spent the first year postgrad being an entrepreneur, working in the basement of the apartment that I lived at in at the time, it was actually a townhome, doing branding work. And it was mostly just branding and identity systems that I was doing early on. But about a year into that, being someone that&#8217;s super social, I started to get that cabin fever and wasn&#8217;t around people as much as I&#8217;d like to be.<br>
And so I had a side job working at Circuit City. On one particular day I was venting about, man, I really think I want to work in an agency or a company. And there was a guy by the name of Mike whose dad headed up a division of Lid Industries, which Lid is a Fortune 500 company and they had a division in St. Louis called PRC. The acronym got dissolved, so I don&#8217;t know what it ever originally meant, but it was in PRC. Anyway, they were hiring a resident graphic designer and at the time, you&#8217;ll appreciate this, in terms of historical relevance in the design and web design world. They had a Macromedia authorized training facility and I got the interview, got the job. They wanted me to teach Flash and Fireworks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So I ended up being the only guy in St. Louis teaching Flash through a Macromedia authorized program. And so that really just kicked off all kinds of just awesome awesomeness in my career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, I know you were in high demand back then. Cause Flash was everywhere. Everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Everywhere and everything. And that was right at the onset of its popularity. So I stayed with that company for about a year, ended up, gosh, being in a big metropolitan area, teaching Flash was awesome. So I ended up getting hired away by a information graphics company called Xplain. And I ended up being their interactive team leader. That was pretty exciting. Did that, ended up teaching at Washington University while I was there because the Art and Design faculty at Washington University wanted to learn Flash. I did a summer workshop for the Art and Design faculty. They loved it so much they invited me to create a multimedia class as part of their visual communications curriculum based on Flash and other video and other multimedia applications. And that was amazing. And I ended up partnering with a lot of design agencies in the St. Louis area, fairly large agencies because they didn&#8217;t have a web team or division.<br>
So that was cool. I ultimately got laid off from Xplain. They went through four rounds of layoffs. I went in the last round and because they still needed the work that I did, they became my first client. So that&#8217;s how I started Curve Theory in 2000, and or in 2001. It was just one of those things. I was still popular, the work was still necessary, the company was needing to make some pivots. And that was a blessing on my end because I always wanted to have my own business business. And that&#8217;s how it happened. I started, I launched Curve Theory with them as my first client 21 years ago.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I mean, I can&#8217;t think of a better way to roll into entrepreneurship like that. You were already super highly sought out for your design work in another medium. The company you&#8217;re working with goes out of business. You start your own business. That&#8217;s perfect. That&#8217;s a perfect handoff.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, it was. And they didn&#8217;t go out of business, thankfully. They did go back to their original, I think they grew to like 45 employees at one point, but they went back to the original 13 and they&#8217;re still around a day and they&#8217;re still thriving. But yeah, it&#8217;s getting kicked out of the nest but then given a nice little mattress to land on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
It was great. And I really love St. Louis, but I definitely knew that at some point I was going to want to leave St. Louis.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So what brought you to North Carolina?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So at the time, the woman that I was dating was also in that same head space that she was ready to leave St. Louis. I was still teaching in Washington University and then actually had just been encouraged by the design chair, the Art and Design faculty chair to apply for this tenure track position that was opening up in the Art and Design department. And so I was at this crossroads where in my heart I knew I really didn&#8217;t want to stay in St. Louis that much longer. Things&#8230; I had envisioned leaving St. Louis almost as soon as I graduated but things kept falling into place career wise, which was great because those things were setting me up. But at one point my partner and I, ex-partner and I, were having these frequent conversations about where we would ever relocate to and at one point I mentioned that a good buddy of mine had in passing talked about moving to North Carolina.<br>
And so I asked her, &#8220;What do you know about North Carolina?&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Oh my god, Asheville. Asheville is absolutely amazing. You would love it. Check it out.&#8221; And of course, since we had the web then, I looked it up and I mean, I think within 20 minutes I knew it&#8217;s where I wanted to be. It wasn&#8217;t landlocked. There&#8217;s a four hour drive to the ocean. Mountains, waterfalls, streams everywhere. Hiking trails, mountain bike trails, you name it. That&#8217;s the kind of guy that I was. I mean, thankfully had a father who raised me. In the time I spent with him, we would go camping and hiking. And so early on I garnered a love or appreciation of the outdoors.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so you had the job that allowed you to do this work from anywhere. So why not go to a place you really want to go?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Absolutely. I actually, I had to finish that first semester at Washington University and then I had the whole spring semester. So this was in 2023. Loved that semester, loved my students. Finished that semester, turned in my grades in May and the following weekend was Memorial Day weekend. I&#8217;d literally moved a week after I turned in my grades and never looked back.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. And you&#8217;ve been there ever since.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
And been here ever since.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. You&#8217;ve been a part of the Asheville design community now for such a long time. You mentioned your community work earlier and you&#8217;re the founding president of AIGA Asheville, a new chapter. What was behind bringing an AIGA chapter to Asheville?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a great question, Maurice. So for me, one of the things I did mention that I was on the board for the St. Louis chapter in the mix there. I think I joined the chapter while I was, might have been while I was still at Lid in PRC, but I know I did two or three years on the board as their web chair for the St. Louis chapter. And I really love that community of design, the comradery, the people that you surround yourself with understand your day to day trials and tribulations, they get it. So that was, I really appreciated that as it pertained to the design community in St. Louis. And I got to Asheville and we didn&#8217;t have that. As a matter of fact, I was trying to find designers just to connect with, just to network with and they just weren&#8217;t around.<br>
I think I had maybe three or four design friends at the time, but we knew there were more designers in and around the area, there just wasn&#8217;t anything in place to help bring them out. Out of the woodwork. And so we had a lot of early conversations about, I would reach out to these other designers that I knew in the area and tell them how much I wanted to have a chapter in Asheville, because the closest chapters were in Knoxville and Charlotte. It&#8217;s a couple hour drive each way in either direction. And so for me, just selfishly, I&#8217;m like, God, I want that here. I don&#8217;t want to drive two hours to have community. It took a while. Originally you had to have 40 sustaining members just to even be considered to have a chapter. And I think given the fact that we were having a hard time finding 20 designers in Asheville at the time, that was a tall order.<br>
So we ended up creating this thing called Design Salon, which ended up being a hang for designers in the area. And the more people gathered, the more the work got spread out, and the more designers you realized were here. The more you understood that there were some really talented people that were in Asheville. And because Asheville is such a draw for people all over the world, somebody that&#8217;s here now probably wasn&#8217;t here two weeks ago. That&#8217;s how&#8217;s how it works. There was a woman named Jamie Farris who&#8217;s also a really good friend of mine that took Design Salon and started adding programming to it, and that made it even better. And so the more program she added, the better. The more it had an actual format instead of just being a creative hangout, the more I saw that we were there, it was time.<br>
And so 2019 was when I had a feasibility meeting. I just called a bunch of people that I knew and they invited other people and I said, &#8220;Hey, I think it&#8217;s time to finally start a chapter.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t actually know the requirements had changed in my mind. I was still thinking 40 sustaining members. So half the way through, we learned that it was only 20 sustaining members, but we actually turned in our petition to become a chapter with 43 sustaining members, I think.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh nice.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Just because we are a little bit of a smaller city and I wanted to show how bad we really wanted to be a chapter.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
And from that first meeting I was able to build our first board of really awesome and engaged founding board members. So yeah, we started literally the year before the pandemic and have thrived through the pandemic and we&#8217;re still kicking it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That is amazing. That&#8217;s amazing to hear that. And now when you say sustaining members, is that members at a particular membership tier? Because I feel like they had that at one&#8230; I feel like sustaining was one of the, if not the top, but one of the top tiers you have to have.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, I think Design Leader was the one after that. I think the sustaining member was at the $250 giving level and then it went to Design Leader, which doubled to 500.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
And so that is, especially for a professional association, that was a lot to ask, but I was just elated that many people wanted it to and believed in us having a chapter that much that they signed up. We still have a tremendous amount of sustaining members. We probably have more sustaining members than we have in any other giving level. And they have changed the price structure and the names of the giving levels a bit. And so it&#8217;s, I think easier now than ever to join the AIGA and I feel like that was part of the reason behind just sort making it a little simpler, especially after the pandemic. But yeah, it&#8217;s quite wonderful to be in a city that now has a chapter. We have great programming. We&#8217;re putting on our first design weekend, which is a mini design week that&#8217;s coming up at the end of the month.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh. Very nice.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, first weekend of October, so it&#8217;s September 30th through October 2nd. Super excited about that. We got David Carson coming to speak at our annual meeting in November. That&#8217;s going to be pretty cool, Mr. Masterclass himself. So yeah, we&#8217;re happy to have a chapter and we&#8217;re happy to be able to have such a positive impact on our design community and that means everything for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at your career and all your experiences, is this how you imagine yourself when you were a kid in St. Louis?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
No, not at all. And it&#8217;s funny because I think being a kid in St. Louis and growing up where I grew up, I feel like my grandmother knew and saw my potential, but I didn&#8217;t see it because it&#8217;s hard. I&#8217;m surrounded by the things that I was surrounded by. And I think it&#8217;s hard to see the forest through the trees when you&#8217;re in that scenario. And for me, I don&#8217;t think, honestly, I still get surprised. I think at some point in your life, Maurice, when you&#8217;ve accomplished a lot, when you&#8217;ve done a lot, when you&#8217;ve had this longevity of experiences and learning, at some point you start to realize that people see that in you and they see all the experience and all the leadership and the guidance and they start to seek it out.<br>
I get called to be on boards, I turned down probably seven board positions last year. I&#8217;m publicly a leader. And so I think it still surprises me sometimes where, and I think it also surprises me that sometimes somebody asks me a question and I think I&#8217;m still that 25 year old in school and still on his path figuring things out, and learning, and discovering. But then I start to answer, I hear the question and then my head just gets filled with all of this relevant information that you don&#8217;t even really think about. You&#8217;re not just sitting around thinking about all the stuff, but when someone calls and asks for mentoring or it&#8217;s a colleague you&#8217;re just shooting a breeze with. You start to realize how much of that stuff is in there and it&#8217;s quite amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What gives you purpose to keep doing the work that you do now?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
I think for me it&#8217;s those relationships and experiences. I&#8217;ve always said that if I won the lottery and had all the money that I would ever need, I would still be a designer. I would still do design, I would just do mostly nonprofit work, and do it pro bono, and just take a select number of projects a year. I love the work, I&#8217;m passionate about the work, and I&#8217;m passionate about the people that I get to work with. I&#8217;m very particular about the clients. If a client doesn&#8217;t seem like they&#8217;re the right fit or I&#8217;m not going to have a mutually enjoyable experience, then I&#8217;ll pass on a project. And I&#8217;m pretty thankful to be in a place in my career where I can do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give for someone who, they&#8217;re listening to this interview, they&#8217;re hearing how you&#8217;ve come up throughout your career. What advice would you give somebody that wants to follow in your footsteps?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
I would say, and I talk to young people all the time, I actually mentor. And the thing that I feel like is the most important is to really keep exploring who you are and what you like, and don&#8217;t follow the money. I feel like it&#8217;s very easy to, I&#8217;ll talk back to a time in my life when I worked at Office Depot when I was Florissant Valley in Junior College, I was asked to get into the managerial track at Office Depot where at the time I might have made, once becoming a manager, I may have made $35,000 or $30,000, which at the time seemed like a lot of money. And that&#8217;s a very easy distraction. That&#8217;s a very easy temptation. And I had a friend at the time who also was a really, really talented artist. He also was wanting to go to design school.<br>
He ended up getting in that track and hated it. It just completely dominated his life. He wasn&#8217;t fulfilled. The money at some point wasn&#8217;t even relevant because he never had time to spend any of it because he worked so much. I turned it down because I knew, I think at this point I was already at Maryville University, so I was already in the graphic design program. I knew that that&#8217;s what I wanted to do. So in order to get to that point, you have to do some self exploration. You have to understand who you are, what it is that you really value and set your sites on being able to do that for a living. And don&#8217;t waiver.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What sort of work would you like to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Man, I would love to retire in five years. I&#8217;m 51. So that&#8217;s definitely a tall order, but in a perfect world, I might completely crush it for the next five, six years or so and retire early, or at least partially retire. But I do see myself in leadership. I do see myself still trying to bring positive change to communities in whatever way I can. Through social justice, through design leadership, through, I&#8217;ve hinted at the thought of being, it&#8217;s been mentioned and it&#8217;s been a internal conversation and conversation I&#8217;ve had with colleagues about the AIGA trajectory, and perhaps maybe serving on a national board at some point. I have friends on the national board. I love the organization and I love what the organization provides to the design community. And I always see its potential is limitless and to be able to serve in that world at a higher level, definitely. But yeah, that&#8217;s probably something that I would look to within my five year trajectory. And more than anything, I always want to make sure that the work that I&#8217;m doing continues to be meaningful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think you should definitely consider it. I mean, I&#8217;ve done work at the volunteer level, at the national level, and it&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s been great. I highly think you should do it. And I&#8217;m sure other people have probably mentioned this to you as well, but there&#8217;s a book in your story. There&#8217;s a hundred percent a book in your story.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, I don&#8217;t know if anyone&#8217;s outright said that, but I definitely know there&#8217;s stuff in there that I always find it intriguing to look back in my past and see where I&#8217;ve been, and where I am, and how I&#8217;ve been inspired, and how I&#8217;m now able to inspire. That all is important to me. But yeah, thanks for saying that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, no, there&#8217;s a hundred percent a book in your story. I mean, one, I think just because of how you have managed yourself through how design and technology have changed, but then also I think your personal story added in as a layer on top of that. And with the work that you&#8217;re doing now through volunteering and giving back, that&#8217;s the best seller. You might want to think about it. You might want to think about it. I&#8217;m just saying I&#8217;m putting it out there.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Thanks. You&#8217;ll get their first copy for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Absolutely. So curvetheory.com. C-U-R-V-E-T-H-E-O-R-Y dot com is my commercial website. There is a link to my print work on there, which yeah, prints are great, but if you want to see the bulk of my commercial photography, landscape stuff, nature, and cityscapes, that&#8217;s a good place to go. I also am on Instagram Curve Theory on Instagram. And there I don&#8217;t really put a whole lot of design work on. I do have a separate account that I&#8217;m hoping to start building up my, putting all my design work on, but really photography&#8230; Years ago I had a mix of photography and design and it always just felt all over the place for me. And one of the things I always noticed when I go to other Instagram accounts and I see these really nicely curated feeds that everything just, there&#8217;s something nice about the continuity and you&#8217;re like beautiful landscapes, and then there&#8217;s a logo. It just feels odd placed. And so I took all my design stuff off of there and it&#8217;s just my photography on my Instagram account. But those are the best places to find me. And I&#8217;m also on LinkedIn. Reggie Tidwell on LinkedIn.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, Sounds good. Well, Reggie Tidwell, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I mean, of course, like I just mentioned about there&#8217;s a book in you, your story and the passion and the service that you&#8217;ve given back to the design community is something that I think is really inspiring for a lot of people. Certainly your local community. But I hope that people that listen to this interview also pick up on that as well, because you mentioned being raised by your grandmother and her being a teacher, those values that she instilled in you, you&#8217;re continuing to give those back out to the community, which are really the basis of your success. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Hundred percent agree about my grandmother, and thank you so much for having me on, Maurice. It&#8217;s been a pleasure talking with you.</p>

<p>After years of asking questions to designers and developers all over the world, now I&#8217;m in the hot seat! For this special mailbag episode, I answer your questions about Revision Path that you sent in from our website and via social media. (And I have to say, you all definitely asked me some hard questions!)</p>
<p>How long does it take to put together a podcast episode, and have I ever had to take an episode down? What happened to our design anthology RECOGNIZE? Why did we have Facebook as a sponsor? What are my thoughts on AIGA? And why do we charge for job listings? Listen to this episode for the answers to these questions, and several others. Keep sending us your questions, and I may do another one of these episodes in the future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So this first question is from Jarvis J., and he asks, &#8220;how far are you from where you thought Revision Path would be right now?&#8221; That&#8217;s a great question. I promise not to say that before every question, although these are some great questions that I got in. I would say very far, but also not far at all.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When I started Revision Path back in 2013, I really wanted it to be kind of an online magazine. And then, I&#8217;d say probably within the first year or so of doing Revision Path and trying to keep it on a fairly regular schedule of it being an online magazine, I discovered it was just easier to make it a podcast. I could turn it around much quicker and stay on a schedule. I would say just that first transition was more than what I thought it would be when I started doing this whole project.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But as far as like where we are right now, and if we&#8217;re far from where I think I wanted to be, I would say yes. I mean, we&#8217;ve been doing this podcast now for almost nine years. I think it&#8217;s been a good, steady resource in the industry. Like people are always coming to Revision Path for one reason or another, whether it&#8217;s finding out about black designers or placing a job or something like that, and I think that&#8217;s been good. However, there are bigger things I would love to do with the show. And we&#8217;ve sort of over the years had opportunities to do some of those things, but just not on a consistent basis. For example, live shows.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We did our first live show in 2017. That was here in Atlanta. We did it with Facebook Design, and that was a great show. We did our 300th episode in New York City at The Greene Space back in 2019. That was good. And in 2020, actually we were planning to do a live tour across the U.S., in conjunction with different chapters of AIGA. So we were going to start in Los Angeles, and then do, and not necessarily in this order, but I&#8217;m going from west to east, but doing Seattle, Houston, Little Rock, Chicago, Atlanta, D.C., New York. That was the plan, because I had talked to people from each of these chapters. We had talked about doing some kind of programming. I was going to just basically pay out pocket to go to each of these places, and schedule and do live shows.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so we did the first live show in 2020 in Los Angeles. That was with Roland A. Wiley. We recorded that at Leimert Park in Los Angeles, and then the coronavirus happened. And then once that happened, the flights got canceled, plans got changed. There was talk of me trying to take these same instances, this tour, I should say, take it online and do digital things. But if you remember spring of 2020, we didn&#8217;t know what was happening. The pandemic was just beginning and people were still trying to figure out what all this was and what we were going to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So the thought of sitting at home and doing a live event on Zoom didn&#8217;t really vibe well with me. Like I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I don&#8217;t know if I want to do that.&#8221; And then also I lost my job because of the pandemic in May of 2020. So I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I really don&#8217;t want to do it now.&#8221; There are bigger goals I have. For a while in the past, Revision Path had a blog. We had a blog with fairly regular entries from guest writers. I would love to continue to do that. I would love to do live shows again, once it&#8217;s safe for us to congregate in that way. And I&#8217;ve even thought of ways that Revision Path could maybe branch out more and do more video things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can tell you this, last year there was&#8230;or there are plans, I should say, because they&#8217;re still on the table, to do some sort of a live video show with Revision Path, like on Twitch or something like that. I think at one point we were talking about doing it with Facebook, and doing it on their Facebook Watch platform. But now Facebook book is Meta, and they&#8217;re doing stuff with the metaverse. And so that kind of fell through a little bit. So I would say right now my goal is just to keep hitting these milestones with the podcast.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;ll hit episode 450 this year. We&#8217;ll hit episode 475 this year. We&#8217;ll hit episode 500 next year. And then of course next year will also be Revision Path&#8217;s 10th anniversary. Do I have plans for those things yet? No. I should probably start thinking about that since it&#8217;s going to be coming up sooner rather than later. I&#8217;d say just in terms of the initial idea of Revision Path with it being this online magazine, and now to it being this sort of steady staple in the design industry for us to have the respect of design organizations, tech startups, tech companies, et cetera, for it to be in the Smithsonian, I would say, is very far from where I thought Revision Path would be. I hope that answers your question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Our next question here is from K.B. who asks, &#8220;how long does it take to put together an episode of the podcast?&#8221; How long does it take? It varies, because putting together the episode, if we&#8217;re just talking about postproduction from when I finished the interview up to when I get it back from RJ, who is our editor, I would say it roughly takes a week. But the thing is, I record so far in advance that RJ just kind of gets to them week by week by week. And so we have a regular production schedule. I record the intro and outro every week. So we record that in the beginning of the week, I pass it on to him. He already has the raw interview file. He does his edits, gets it back to me. I get a transcript done, upload everything, and it&#8217;s good to go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So usually in the postproduction stage, takes about a week. If we&#8217;re talking about everything before that, also kind of adding into it, I would say that also will vary, because when the guest books on the show, that&#8217;s usually everything that I need to go ahead and get started with the actual interview for the episode. So I&#8217;ll do my research. I&#8217;ll put together a few bullet points. Then I have the guest on the show. We do the interview.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I&#8217;ll put it like this, the time that we book for the interview is roughly 90 minutes. 90 minutes doesn&#8217;t mean that we use everything in that 90 minute. We may use probably only about an hour or so of that audio, but I do 90 minutes, one, to handle any sort of technical difficulties that might arise on my end or on their end. Sometimes maybe they&#8217;re not in a super quiet space, or there&#8217;s like mic issues or headphone issues. We work those out before we start recording.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then when the guest is ready, I let them know I&#8217;m about to start recording. We do the recording, we do it all the way through, hopefully, fingers crossed. I&#8217;d say now it&#8217;s much better. Sometimes we would have issues with the recorder that I use or with Skype or with the guest internet connection or with my internet connection. There can always be things that go wrong. But within that 90 minute timeframe, I&#8217;ve got everything I need to go ahead and send off to RJ to start to get the episode together.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
While I&#8217;m doing the interview, I also will take notes, like edit notes to say like, here&#8217;s a timestamp where I coughed, or here&#8217;s a timestamp where the guest dropped something or something like that. And he edits through all of those and it&#8217;s good to go. Roughly the interview portion, including everything else, I would say it takes about like a week or so to put an episode together. I try to do them in advance because I&#8217;m also scheduling them around different events that might be happening, or trying to see which episode can I place in this spot for maximum reach or that sort of thing. So it kind of varies, but roughly about a week, I would say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d say the quickest turnaround I&#8217;ve done on an interview has been maybe a couple of days. Like we record, I get it to RJ, he gets it back to me, and then we have everything together. But if I&#8217;ve got everything that I need to get started, and we request with the guests, we get that going, we record it, I send it off to RJ, get the transcripts, all that stuff, roughly about a week to put an episode together. And then it&#8217;s out for the world to hear.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Ryan B. asks, &#8220;have you ever had to take down an episode for any reason?&#8221; So luckily within the 430+ archive of Revision Path episodes, I have never had to take down an episode; knock on wood about that. I&#8217;d say 99% of what I record with the guests ends up in the final episode. We&#8217;ll edit out a cough or a sneeze or something like that, but there&#8217;s very few episodes that I&#8217;ve had to really aggressively edit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And to that end, because everything that we talk about goes in the show, and the guest has reviewed it and everything, we have not had to take any of those down. Now, what has happened, I&#8217;d say in recent years is that we will get people who will write to the show leaving, I would say the equivalent of a negative Yelp review about the guests, but not about what the guests said on the show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s never about what they said on the show or what I said on the show or our conversation or our topics, but they will leave a negative review about their personal interaction with the guest, and using that as justification for why I should remove the interview, which I never do. If you had a negative run-in with this guest for one reason or another, that&#8217;s on you. That has nothing to do with the episode that I&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And usually these are for like old episodes too. Like ones I&#8217;ve done maybe 3, 4, 5 years ago. There&#8217;s someone that sort of comes out the woodwork and is like, &#8220;Hey, this person said this thing to me or did this thing to me. I don&#8217;t know why you have them featured on your website. You should take it down.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m not going to take it down. That&#8217;s a problem you had with them. That has nothing to do with what I talked about with them, or anything like that.&#8221; So I don&#8217;t take those down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, it&#8217;s a different story with 28 Days of the Web. 28 Days of the Web is our sister site, 28daysoftheweb.com. We do these profiles for every day in Black history month in February, where we profile a different Black designer or developer or something. I have had to take quite a few of those down for different reasons. The biggest reason being that the person just doesn&#8217;t want to be recognized.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
None of the information that I have when I put those profiles together is coming from like some secret private place. Like it comes from their public LinkedIn, their public website. I&#8217;m getting that information from there, so I&#8217;m not creating anything myself. Like it&#8217;s all from them. And so they&#8217;ll see it and they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Oh, well thank you for the honor, but I want you to take this down.&#8221; And so I&#8217;ll take it down in that instance, because it is something that I&#8217;m doing to recognize people that I may, for one reason or another, not have on the show, because I haven&#8217;t reached out to them, or&#8230;I have a long list of people, like potential folks that I could have on the show. I think it&#8217;s maybe about 2,500 people at this point.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So everyone that I have on the show that I could talk to, I can&#8217;t have because we just do it every week. And so some of those people will end up becoming 28 Days of the Web profiles. I mean, even if you go back all the way to 2014 when we started that, you&#8217;ll see some of those people have been guests on the show eventually. Have not had to take down a podcast episode, but I have had to take down a 28 Days of the Web profile here and there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
This next message is from Jordana T. who asks, &#8220;what&#8217;s the biggest blessing in disguise you&#8217;ve gotten from Revision Path?&#8221; I&#8217;d say the biggest blessing in disguise is probably the rooms that Revision Path is mentioned in that I&#8217;m not a part of. I think that&#8217;s probably the biggest thing. I&#8217;ve done this now for a long time. I&#8217;ve interviewed a lot of people, and those people will talk to other people who talk to other people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s oftentimes I&#8217;ll be researching something for work or anything like that, and I run across someone who&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh yeah, I know you. You&#8217;re from such and such.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s probably been the biggest blessing in disguise is knowing that the work that I&#8217;ve done is being mentioned in other rooms and other places without me necessarily having to be in them. That&#8217;s probably the biggest thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think the other biggest blessing in disguise for me is the network that I&#8217;ve been able to build, just personally and professionally. Interviewing all these people has gotten me an in with different companies in different ways, whether that&#8217;s for sponsorship purposes, whether that&#8217;s for consulting or any number of other things. I&#8217;ve been able to get my foot in the door so I can say, oh yeah, I know someone at Microsoft. I know someone at Dropbox. I know someone at Meta, or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s not to say it in a braggy sort of name-droppy sort of way, but it is a blessing in disguise to be able to have that one-on-one access to someone who could possibly get me access to someone else. I think that&#8217;s been the biggest kind of a blessing from the show. Doing this interview-based show is always good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Another big blessing in disguise is honestly just the fact that so many people are appreciative of hearing these conversations. Like I will get messages from people who are just glad that they found this as a resource, whether it&#8217;s through their own research, or a friend or a colleague of theirs is on it. Like hearing back from people, what they thought about the show or what they thought about the interviews, and how much of a help it&#8217;s been to them has been a real blessing. Knowing that I&#8217;m putting something out there in the world that, yes, is educational, and that you&#8217;re learning about these people, but is also inspirational.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m glad that people are finding that inspiration from listening to these stories and listening to people and learning about what they do and being able to expand their own kind of personal knowledge of black designers and the work that black designers can do. Yeah. That&#8217;s kind of been the biggest blessing in disguise from doing this whole thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Next up is this question from Rosie. Rosie asks, &#8220;how come some of the podcasts have transcripts and others don&#8217;t? When will that be fixed?&#8221; The simple question is that some podcasts don&#8217;t have transcripts because I don&#8217;t have the money to pay to get them transcribed. That&#8217;s the easiest way to answer that question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We do have an accessibility sponsor that we&#8217;ve had now probably for the past year, which is this great studio in D.C. called Brevity &#038; Wit. When we were part of the Glitch Media Network back in 2019, we had podcasts for a couple of episodes, well, not a couple, for a lot of episodes. And those are the ones I think in the like 250 to maybe 340 range of episodes, those have transcripts. But no, all of the podcasts do not have transcripts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We use a service called Rev, R-E-V, to do our transcripts. And they&#8217;re roughly, I think it&#8217;s like a $1.25 a word or something like that. So you can imagine with 400 plus episodes, that&#8217;s a lot of money to transcribe all of those episodes. Now, if you are a company out there who would love to sponsor us so we can get all of our episodes transcribed, I would love that. Like please hit me up. I would love to make that happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But no, because of that, that&#8217;s why some of the podcasts do have transcripts, some of them don&#8217;t. One of the goals I would love to have is to have the entire archive transcribed, but that is probably going to happen way off in the future. That&#8217;s something that we have to have the funds to be able to do. I do know that now there are these sorts of automated services where you can send them a MP3 or an audio file of some sort and they&#8217;ll spit out a transcript. They sort of do this speech to text kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But what I find with those is that the transcripts that you get back, unless you&#8217;re speaking in absolute like perfect English, they are always going to be messed up. Like with Rev, I know that there are real people that are transcribing them. So there are certain words and things that they&#8217;ll pick up on and spell correctly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If I use one of these automated services, by the time I get all those transcripts back, I&#8217;d have to then probably go through all of them individually to make sure the words that were said were right, especially if we&#8217;re talking about interviews that have slang terms in them, or the names of companies or things like that, that will be hard to spell out. I guess that would be hard for an AI to kind of figure out, but a human could figure it out. That&#8217;s why not all the episodes have transcripts, but that is something in the future I would love to do. And if you&#8217;re a company that&#8217;s listening and wants to sponsor us to make that happen, I am all ears. Hit me up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, this is a really good question. This one is from Cole M. Cole asks, &#8220;what are your thoughts now about AIGA? In early episodes, it seems like you didn&#8217;t like the organization, but you&#8217;ve also worked with them in the past. And now you have the new president of AIGA as a guest on the show, which is it?&#8221; Okay. Fair enough. I would say I probably still continue to have a complicated relationship with AIGA. Part of that complication, I&#8217;d say it comes in waves.</p>

Back when I was starting out as a designer in the like mid-2000s, and trying to really become a part of the design community in Atlanta, I did reach out to AIGA Atlanta several times, and never really heard anything back. They never responded to my emails. I would go to events. I would feel out of place at events and things like that. And so it wasn&#8217;t until, one, I started this podcast. And two, they saw that I was doing work with AIGA National, that the local chapter here started to pay attention to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d say probably the most egregious example of that is when I spoke at HOW Design Live here in 2016, and the president of AIGA Atlanta at the time had reached out to me, and was like, &#8220;Oh my God, I feel like I should know who you are. I don&#8217;t know who you are. You&#8217;re one of two Atlanta people that are speaking in this conference. We should get to know each other.&#8221; Which I was like, &#8220;Whatever.&#8221; Super transparent. We didn&#8217;t know who you were before, but now that you&#8217;re hot, we kind of want to know more about you, that sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like Cole said, I have volunteered with AIGA. I was on their national diversity and inclusion task force for three years. Did a lot of work there. Ended up making my exit from the organization. And then a few years after that decided to cancel my membership with AIGA. I do have a complicated relationship in that respect. I&#8217;d say within the past, what&#8230;almost 10 years now? I&#8217;ve seen AIGA go through now three executive directors. Like I knew Ric Gref√© back when I started the show. I knew Julie Anixter, who was the executive director, and I still keep in contact with. And I know Bennie, Bennie F. Johnson, who was our 375th episode guest, who was the new executive director of AIGA, not the president.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve had relationships with each of them. Bennie and I actually talk fairly regularly outside of podcast stuff. I would say Bennie, and this is to the organization as a whole, I mean, it&#8217;s over a hundred years old, and they have not done a great job with keeping up with the times. I think anyone that is a modern designer, particularly if you&#8217;re a product designer or a UX designer that came about in the past 10 years, like AIGA doesn&#8217;t really have any relevance for you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s partially the organization&#8217;s fault with not really keeping up, in that respect, with the trends of where the design community has gone. I think they are starting to make those changes now, and starting to become more of a professional organization that offers services and access and information of things that are of importance to current working designers. I can say they did not offer that before.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So like there&#8217;s different conferences and webinars. There&#8217;s like continuing education courses and things you can get now through AIGA. They&#8217;re really trying to turn things around. I&#8217;ll say from the time that I have worked with AIGA, I&#8217;ve even been to the headquarters in New York. Recorded, not an episode there, but I did record an interview there. Got to sit in the AIGA boardroom, and talk to people. They&#8217;re a small organization. I&#8217;ll say that they&#8217;re may be about 25 to 30 people. So they&#8217;re not this like massive group. They&#8217;re a small organization that happens to have these different chapters across the country. And each chapter kind of operates independently, for the most part, of AIGA headquarters.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so a lot of people&#8217;s, I think experience with AIGA, particularly through their chapter, is what colors their perception about the organization as a whole. Certainly that was the case with me. Now that I&#8217;ve worked both with local and with national, yeah, I have kind of a conflicted relationship. Am I an AIGA member now? No, I&#8217;m not. But I do think that they are starting to become an organization that is doing what needs to be done for the modern designer now, which is really be not just an educational resource, but I think also becoming a resource that is important to the design business community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ll give you an example. In Canada, there is a organization called RGD, which is kind of, I don&#8217;t want to say Canada&#8217;s answer to AIGA, but it is a professional organization for graphic designers in Canada. And a lot of employers in Canada really look at your RGD membership as a good thing to have on your resume, or something like that. So if you take the skills tests and things that RGD has, and you are able to put those on your resume, then it means you&#8217;re a designer of a certain caliber.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Whereas I think if you&#8217;re an AIGA member and you put that on your resume, it probably doesn&#8217;t mean anything to most companies. They probably have never even heard of AIGA, or know why it&#8217;s important, or why hiring an AIGA member is a benefit over hiring someone who is not an AIGA member. Those are things that I think the organization still is trying to work out for itself. Those are kind of my thoughts on AIGA.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s still an organization that is doing great things. Like many other companies and organizations, they&#8217;re trying to find a way through this pandemic, because AIGA does and continues to do a good number of in-person events and things like that. It&#8217;s just different when you can&#8217;t congregate like you used to. Like how do you have the big AIGA design conference, for example, that&#8217;s like a four or five day event, how do you have that when everyone&#8217;s at home? You bring it online. And so they&#8217;ve managed to bring it online and make it more accessible to more people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now that they&#8217;re using online as kind of that event space, they&#8217;re able to have other types of events that they can spin up for different sort of niche parts of the design community. They&#8217;re doing what they can. I am still not a member, like I said before, but I think they are taking steps in the right direction to make the organization more of what it needs to be for the modern designer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sarah Z. asks, &#8220;why are you charging for job postings? The job board on Where Are The Black Designers is free, so I don&#8217;t understand why I should post a job here instead of there.&#8221; Okay. So I debated on whether or not I was going to include this question in the episode, because it&#8217;s a question, but it&#8217;s also actually a very common gripe that I get from companies that write to the show. So I figured this would be a good public way to say what I&#8217;m already saying privately to many companies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I understand that companies are trying to diversify where they post their listings. It&#8217;s something certainly I think that has been a thing that&#8217;s been present in the industry, but especially after the kind of &#8220;summer of racial reckoning&#8221; in 2020, a lot of companies were like, oh, we need to seek out the black voices and where the black people are and blah, blah, blah, and all this all kind of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, I get that. And people will look at Revision Path, they&#8217;ll look at other black/POC focused job boards, like Where Are The Black Designers, or People of Color in Tech&#8230;there&#8217;s a number of them. There&#8217;s actually a lot of them now more than there used to be. Some of them do allow you to post for free. Some do have a charge that&#8217;s associated with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When I started the job board, which I think was back in maybe 2015, 2016, I think, the price was $99. So it has not changed the entire time that I&#8217;ve had the job board. Actually, what we did, I want to say around 2016, 2017, was we started to offer lower priced job to your listings based on the type of job that you were posting. So, full-time and part-time jobs were $99, but if it was say an internship or a contract gig or a freelance gig, it would be $49. So we would make it half price.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And what I found was that people didn&#8217;t even want to pay the $49. They expected it to be free. A lot of people expect some kind of discounts. Like I will have multi-billion dollar organizations that will contact me and want a discount on a $99 job posting. Usually they want it for free. But when I say it&#8217;s $99, they want to know if there&#8217;s any discounts. I don&#8217;t offer discounts. Like I keep the price low to make it accessible. I know that if I were to have it for free, everyone would post jobs here, which is not to say that&#8217;s a bad thing. But then on the back end, I would have to spend so much extra time trying to filter out what&#8217;s quality from what&#8217;s not. And what I find to be the differentiator for that is putting a cost on the listing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The cost is $99. We mention it on the podcast, like three or four times when you post it, depending on when it falls within our production cycle. So it&#8217;s getting out to thousands of people worldwide, which I think is a pretty big reach, aside from it just being on our job board. We also used to do a newsletter. We found the newsletter was not very active in terms of people finding out about stuff. So we would just put them right there on the podcast. And actually, if you go to the job board, I think it&#8217;s still there. But if you subscribe to RSS feeds, I don&#8217;t know if people are still doing RSS feeds in 2022, but you can get a RSS feed to the job board. And then you can get the jobs as they&#8217;re posted, like with no delay. So, it&#8217;s a big reach.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And the reason that I have that cost is to make it so I can differentiate between that. There&#8217;s this comparison thing in this question that I also wanted to address, which is, why is this black job board free, but this black job board isn&#8217;t? Don&#8217;t do that. Don&#8217;t do that. If you&#8217;re a company that&#8217;s doing that, don&#8217;t do that. Like, one, black people are not a monolith. But two, we&#8217;re catering to different, I want to say we are catering to fairly different communities with Where Are The Black Designers does, with Mitzi Okou and what I&#8217;m doing with Revision Path.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m sure in the Venn diagram of our two communities, there is some overlap, but it&#8217;s not a perfect circle. So to try to compare and say, well, their job board is free, and your job board is $99. What&#8217;s the deal with that? I mean, it&#8217;s $99 because it&#8217;s $99. Also all the proceeds from the job board go right back of the show. Like the money from that pays RJ. It pays our transcripts. It pays for advertising. So it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m just pocketing the money. I don&#8217;t see any of that money. It&#8217;s a direct loop right back into the show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So every job listing that we get, yes, it makes sure that it goes out there, but then also it keeps the show alive. I mean, for several years we had a Patreon, and we still have a PayPal where you can donate either on a one time basis or on a monthly basis. But I found those weren&#8217;t ways to really keep the show going. The job board really keeps the podcast alive. And so those listings go directly back into the show. So that&#8217;s why I charge that much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One is quality control. And two, because it&#8217;s a source of revenue to keep Revision Path open. Well, I mean, not like it&#8217;s closed like a business, but you know what I mean. It keeps the show going. But I will say, the jobs that we get are from all over. There&#8217;s educational jobs, there&#8217;s private sector, jobs, there&#8217;s small businesses, et cetera. We just did this thing last year, where we created kind of like an enterprise type job board sponsorship. So if you wanted to sponsor for like the entire year for one flat price, which is, to be completely transparent, is $2,000. You can post as many jobs as you want to the job board, no problem. You get a code. You can post them all the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One of the current job board sponsors we have is Work &#038; Co, and they post all the time. I&#8217;m sure if you&#8217;ve listened to this show within the past, what? Maybe like five or six months, there&#8217;s been several Work &#038; Co positions that we&#8217;ve put up. And they&#8217;re a pretty well known reputable agency. As to why we charge for job postings, like I said, one, it&#8217;s quality control. Two, it actually keeps the show going. Like it goes directly back into the production of Revision Path. That&#8217;s why I do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Next. Y&#8217;all are giving me some really spicy questions here. I&#8217;ll answer them. Anyway. This question is from R.G. who says, or who asks, I should say, &#8220;why is Facebook a sponsor of Revision Path? It feels hypocritical given all the harm Facebook has done to this country and this democracy that you would cape for them so hard on this show. Why is that?&#8221; Y&#8217;all are a trip. Okay. I&#8217;ll answer it. I&#8217;ll answer it completely honestly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Revision Path first came on Facebook&#8217;s radar in 2015 back at South by Southwest, when I did the Where are the Black Designers presentation. I did it there. Some people from Facebook were there. They invited me to their Facebook house. For those that don&#8217;t know for South by Southwest, it&#8217;s this big interactive, film, and music festival that takes place in Austin every year. And so companies, particularly for the interactive part, will rent out spaces like restaurants and things like that, and basically turn it into their base of operations, also known as their house. So you&#8217;ll to have like a Facebook house, a Microsoft house, an eBay house, whatever.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So Facebook had a house there, and I got to meet folks. That is how, from doing that, I ended up not only speaking at Facebook to close out their design lecture series in 2016, but also got to visit the campus, be on the headquarters, record a number of interviews while I was out there. And yes, Facebook has, in the past, financially sponsored Revision Path. Facebook has not been a sponsor of Revision Path since 2018, I think, 2018.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When we joined the Glitch Media Network, again, I&#8217;m trying to be as truthful here. I&#8217;m just trying to think of the best way to put it. When we joined that network, the CEO of Glitch, who is Anil Dash, has said a number of very kind of inflammatory things about Mark Zuckerberg, who is of course the CEO of Facebook. And so let&#8217;s just say that that didn&#8217;t really mesh well, the fact that we were joining this network, and Facebook is like, yeah, you know what? They kind of just gave me the silent treatment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So for the year that we were on the Glitch Media Network, Facebook was no longer sponsoring. I think there was conversations and opportunities around re-upping that sponsorship in 2020, but then with the pandemic and everything, it all just kind of fell through. We were even at one point, and this is kind of leading up to our 300th episode, we were going to do that episode at Facebook&#8217;s headquarters in New York, and had been talking about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The team that I had at the time &#8212; shout out to TK and Deanna and Britt &#8212; yhe team I had at the time had even went to Facebook&#8217;s campus in New York to scout it out for the event, but it ended up falling through. We ended up getting The Greene Space. The rest is history. I&#8217;ve had conversations with folks from Facebook since then. Facebook is now Meta, but Meta is a huge organization. Even the people who I talk to back in 2015 have moved on from the company, or they&#8217;re in other parts of the company. So I have to speak to like a whole new person about what Revision Path is and why it&#8217;s important. So I often have to like plead my case to them several times.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And after a while it&#8217;s just like, well, why even bother? Especially once we joined the Glitch Media Network in 2019, and that wasn&#8217;t a fit in terms of being on the network of a company that has openly disparaged the sponsor. Kind of not the best thing to do. I&#8217;ve had conversations with folks from Facebook. I mean, of course we&#8217;ve had still people from Facebook on the show, but they have not been a sponsor for a minute, Facebook/Meta. I mean, even at the top of the year, we had Charlene Atlas, who was a researcher at Meta Labs, their Reality Labs. Yeah, that went fine, but that was not a sponsored thing. We haven&#8217;t spent Facebook&#8217;s money on this show in years, but I appreciate that people are, I guess, calling me out in a way, or calling the show out for that sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I do appreciate that because it keeps me honest. It makes sure that the audience knows like this is where we stand in terms of like certain issues and things of that nature. But no, Facebook/Meta has not been a sponsor for a long time. I could see how, that sort of hypocritical remark, I could see where that would come from, particularly because we were taking their money during the time of like Cambridge Analytica and all that sort of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I get that, but a lot of that information came out after we had already took and spent the money. So like, I can&#8217;t unspent the money and give it back to them. But I also never told them like, we are no longer sponsoring. They just sort of moved on, especially once Facebook themselves got into podcasting. I think, and I&#8217;m speculating here, so if you work for Facebook and this is the case, don&#8217;t come after me, but I&#8217;m speculating that once they got into podcasting themselves, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, why are we sponsoring shows?&#8221; That kind of fell through. And to be honest, I haven&#8217;t pursued it since then.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Rob asks, &#8220;I have a question, but it&#8217;s about something related to Revision Path, RECOGNIZE. What happened to it? And is it coming back this year?&#8221; I&#8217;ll answer that second question first, which it is not coming back this year. I&#8217;m not sure when RECOGNIZE is coming back. I do want it to come back, but it&#8217;s not coming back this year. As far as what happened to it, tail as old as time, we don&#8217;t have the money to put RECOGNIZE on. That&#8217;s kind of the biggest reason behind it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The first year that we did RECOGNIZE, we received a grant from InVision from their Design Forward Fund, and that allowed us, one, the opportunity to pay the illustrator and to pay the writers for their finished edited submissions. But then it also meant that it would have the audience of InVision on their blog, which I think is called Design Together, I believe is what it&#8217;s called. So we had that big kind of megaphone and platform for the first year of doing RECOGNIZE.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The second year, we started it in 2019. The theme in 2019 was Space. And then we started in 2020, and the year, the theme for 2020 was Fresh, I believe. The pandemic kind of put just a big rain cloud over the entire kind of, I don&#8217;t even want to call it a competition, because it&#8217;s not a competition, but it put big rain cloud over the entire process, because people aren&#8217;t thinking about trying to submit to a design anthology when they&#8217;re just learning about this virus and how it&#8217;s spreading and what they can do to try to protect themselves from it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We did receive a fair number of submissions, but what happened was we got, I think we got down to six, that were kind of good ones that I wanted to move forward with. And then four of them completely just dropped out of the process. They were like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time for this. I&#8217;m too stressed. I&#8217;m too this.&#8221; Which I completely understand. And we ended up just proceeding that year with two authors, Regine Gilbert and Kahlil Crawford, I believe is his last name. And we published those. Those two ended up also getting republished in A List Apart. Shout out to Aaron Gustafson, who&#8217;s the editor-in-chief over at A List Apart for helping to make that happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But the interest, because of the pandemic kind of died out. Plus I had just lost my job. I was paying for all of this out of pocket, like out of savings and everything. So it just got to the point where it&#8217;s like, oh, this is a lot. And even as I thought about the third year, I wanted the theme for 2021 to be Reboot. And we had made graphics for it and did a campaign. I think the open time was like three months, which is the largest submission period that RECOGNIZE has ever had, to give people enough time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And we got a number of submissions. And then after reading through all the submissions we got, I didn&#8217;t feel any of them were good enough to kind of move forward on. There were like three or four that I&#8217;m like, well, maybe if we shifted this and changed this. But then just kind of stepping back and looking at the entire process with how much it was going to cost and how much time it was going to take to work with these authors. And the fact that these submissions were just not really up to the quality that we used to get. The quality really decreased from year to year of the submissions.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I made the executive decision in 2021 to just put the hiatus on RECOGNIZE. One, because, like I said, the quality just wasn&#8217;t that great. I mean, it&#8217;s hard to put out a design anthology of essays when the essay prompts that you&#8217;re getting, or the essay submissions you&#8217;re getting have nothing to do with the theme that we put forward. Like the theme was reboot, and we were getting just basically things that people wrote about whatever they wanted to. They wrote about nothing that had to do with design. They just wrote stuff. Some people sent in designs, which&#8230; it&#8217;s a literary anthology, so you don&#8217;t need to send me something visual. So the quality just was really not that great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then looking at how much it was going to cost in terms of editing, paying the illustrator, paying the writers, I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I just don&#8217;t have the money for this.&#8221; So we didn&#8217;t have a sponsor or anything lined up for it. And so that&#8217;s why I ended up putting it kind of on hold. One of the things I would love to do in the future is bring it back, but bring it back in like an actual printed form. I&#8217;m working on a project right now, at the job where I&#8217;m at, where we&#8217;re making an actual magazine, like a print magazine. And so I&#8217;m able to work with printers and see how much it costs and all the kind of behind the scenes stuff that goes into making a print magazine.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m like, I think RECOGNIZE would be great as like an annual digest of some sort, but that would require, I think, many more submissions, many more quality submissions, in order to make that happen. Not to mention the price to print and ship, which was much less than I thought it would be once I really started doing research. That&#8217;s what happened with RECOGNIZE.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The quality of the submissions greatly decreased. The pandemic I think just took a lot of wind out of people&#8217;s sales for wanting to contribute to something like this. And I didn&#8217;t have the funds to really keep it going on my own. If we get a sponsor that&#8217;s able to make it happen, then maybe we&#8217;ll bring it back. To answer that second part of your question, again, it is the not coming back this year, and I don&#8217;t know when it will come back in the future, but it will come back. I do want to bring it back, I just don&#8217;t know when.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Medina D. asks, &#8220;I recommended a friend of mine to be a guest on the podcast. When are you going to interview them?&#8221; So this particular guest that Medina is talking about, I&#8217;m not going to say who the guest is, but I have already reached out to them, just waiting for them to hopefully respond, and we can make that happen. But I do want to sort of pull the curtain a little bit back on how we have guests on the show and how this process works. Because I would say within the past maybe year, maybe the past two years, I&#8217;ve gotten a lot of people who want to come on the show who it&#8217;s very clear they&#8217;ve never heard the show before at all. And the only reason that they want to be on the show is because it&#8217;s a black podcast.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I will get any number of people in a number of different fields. Many of them not even designers. I&#8217;ll get nonprofit CEOs. I&#8217;ll get marketing people. I&#8217;ll get authors of business books, all want to come on the show and talk about my book. Oh, I want to come on the show and talk about this project that I&#8217;m doing, and it doesn&#8217;t fit with the tenor of the show. They&#8217;ll say they&#8217;re a big fan. And I&#8217;m like, well, clearly you&#8217;re not a big fan because you would know that we don&#8217;t cover this sort of stuff on the show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d also say probably the interesting thing is that many of these people who do this are also not black. Is it a black show? Yes. Because I&#8217;m a black host and I talk to black guests, and that&#8217;s the thing about the show. Like I talk to black designers and black tech people too, but I try to be very deliberate in that, because what will happen sometimes is that I think, one, because Revision Path has been around a long time. And because we do kind of straddle between design and tech, Revision Path is often miscategorized as a show for people that it&#8217;s not even about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So like for example, people will say, oh, well, Revision Path is a show about black designers in Silicon Valley. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s not geographically specific in that way. Or people will say, well, Revision Path is a show that talks to BIPOC creatives. We don&#8217;t talk to BIPOC creatives. We talk to Black designers, creatives, artists, that sort of thing. So I have to be very deliberate in that, because oftentimes Revision Path just gets lumped into the overall &#8220;diversity in tech,&#8221; or, I guess diversity in design conversations too, but in a way that makes people think that they can just come on the show for whatever reason, even if they don&#8217;t fit sort of what the guest roster is, or what the theme of the show is about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When I do have guests on, I try to let them know that even if there is a particular project that they want to plug, the interview is not just about the thing you want to plug. Like we&#8217;re not that kind of show. First of all, because I record in advance, like up to a month in advance. Like by the time you hear the interview, it&#8217;s been at least a month or so since we&#8217;ve had that conversation. It&#8217;s hard for me to do really timely things. And I do that on purpose to keep our production schedule pretty lean in that respect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But secondly, if you just come on the show and it&#8217;s all about, here&#8217;s the one thing that I&#8217;ve done, that doesn&#8217;t make sense in the entire archive of the whole show, because it&#8217;s about people&#8217;s individual journeys as designers, as developers, et cetera, et cetera, not about this one thing they did this one time with this one company that they worked with. It doesn&#8217;t become this sort of evergreen sort of thing, if you just want to come on and talk about one particular thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I don&#8217;t know. I think Revision Path has ended up in some PR database, because I get all kinds of folks that are like, &#8220;Oh, I want this person to be on my show. And they&#8217;ve done this, this and this.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, this is a white man. Why would I have them on the show? You looked at the guests, do you see that I have white men on the show? What&#8217;s not clicking? I don&#8217;t know. They&#8217;re clearly not paying attention in that respect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But to put a finer point on Medina&#8217;s question about the friend that she had said wants to be on the show, oftentimes people will recommend like friends of theirs, colleagues of theirs, et cetera, to be on the show. And I like that. I love to get that sort of warm referral. What I will ask is that if you do that, please supply enough information to me, so I don&#8217;t have to hunt down who this person is. Like for example, someone will say, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve got a really good friend who should be a guest on the show. Respond back and I&#8217;ll tell you who it is.&#8221; I&#8217;m not going to do that. Why don&#8217;t you just tell me who it is instead of having to play this kind of back and forth game.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Or they&#8217;ll give very little information like, oh my friend Alan would be a great designer. Okay. Alan who? Does Alan have a last name? Do you have a link to Alan&#8217;s website or LinkedIn, so I can find out more information about this person whom you&#8217;re recommending? Make my job a little easier by giving me the information, especially if this is like a friend or a colleague of yours that you want on the show. Like, help them out. Like help me out, but help them out too, to make sure that that information is correct.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, when I do outreach, and I guess this is sort of branching out from your question a little bit, Medina, but when I do outreach, I try to make sure that I connect via email. One, because I just have my one inbox, and it&#8217;s just easier for me to manage it that way. If you&#8217;re a designer that&#8217;s got a contact form or something like that, just make sure that it works. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I go to a person that I would love to interview, and I go to their website, and there&#8217;s absolutely no way to contact them. There&#8217;s no social media links. The contact form doesn&#8217;t work. There&#8217;s no email address listed. It&#8217;s like, how am I supposed to reach out to you?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And maybe they don&#8217;t want to be reached out to, which is fine. That is totally something that you can do, that people can do. I don&#8217;t feel any sort of negative way about that, because for a while in my career I was very much the same way. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk to me, just let me do my work.&#8221; But it becomes harder when there&#8217;s not really an easy way to contact the person, or I don&#8217;t have enough information for me to do even preliminary research to see if this person would be a good fit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Also because I do record very far in advance. Just because you send me this person&#8217;s name, I may not get to them for months, because I already have other people whom I&#8217;ve reached out to, or there&#8217;s just other folks in the queue. So it may take me a while to finally get around to that person, but I&#8217;ll get onto them eventually. I have a long list of about, I think I mentioned this earlier, maybe about 2000 to 2,500 people, that I could reach out to. Like I go through that list pretty regularly when it comes to reaching out to folks because I&#8217;ve been keeping the list now for nine years, and I&#8217;m continually adding to it and such. And so I make sure that when people recommend folks, I do move them to the top of the list.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d also say, let that person know that you are recommending them. So that way if I reach out to them, it&#8217;s not this, well, who are you? And what is this show? And blah, blah, blah, that kind of thing, because then it&#8217;s weird. It&#8217;s like, okay, well your friend recommended me, or your colleague recommended you to come on the show, and they often don&#8217;t even know. So like, let your friend know, copy them on the email or something. Help them out as well. But yes, to Medina, I did reach out to your friend. If they happen to get back to me, I would love to have them on the show. Let them know that I reached out to them, and then they can respond, and we can make that happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. We&#8217;ve got time for one last question, and this comes from Maya W. who asks, &#8220;you always ask a guest where they see themselves in the next five years, where do you want Revision Path to be in the next five years?&#8221; My overall aspiration for Revision Path is to grow this into becoming a multimedia network. The biggest reason I think is to grow beyond being typecast. I mentioned before about how Revision Path is often kind of misnamed or mislabeled as all these other things that it&#8217;s not. Being able to grow Revision Path into a network allows or would allow me more places to really say, this is what this is about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What I&#8217;m envisioning with this kind of multimedia network is we still continue the podcast, because that&#8217;s the main keystone of all of this. I&#8217;d want to keep that. Maybe expand out to do other types of shows. There are other shows I would love to do. I would love to bring on other hosts on this platform. Maybe acquire some shows, have like a Revision Path network. That would be great. I would love to do something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I would want to have an editorial arm at Revision Path, where we bring back the blog and have a regular staff of writers. We bring back RECOGNIZE, and make that a printed annual design anthology. And I would even lump 28 Days of the Web into that as well. Like bring that under the whole editorial arm. And then branch out and do video as well. I sort of teased that a little bit, about the possibility of doing some sort of a weekly live show, maybe on Twitch or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I also want to do short documentaries or licensed short documentaries, licensed web series, things like that. Basically really build this out so Revision Path becomes kind of a staple in the Black community that deals with design. When I started Revision Path, I&#8217;d say probably one of the thing that I really wanted to do was make sure to inform people about who Black designers are. Like why are we doing this? What&#8217;s the reasoning behind all of this?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Part of this also even stems from research that Cheryl Miller, who, AIGA medalist. We&#8217;ve had her on the show before. Has talked about her 1985 thesis around basically why is it that there aren&#8217;t more Black designers in the industry? And part of that being that a lot of Black parents don&#8217;t really understand like what design is, or they think of it as a hobby and not an actual profession.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so one of my hopes with expanding Revision Path into being this multimedia network is to provide enough information so people know like what design is. Like the black community knows like this is what design is. These are all the different sorts of things that you can do. And it&#8217;s as viable of an option to go into as if you were to go into medicine or to go into sports or to go into engineering or whatever. You just have more information.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, granted there&#8217;s been a lot of talk and initiatives and things around STEM. Arts kind of gets lost in that. Sometimes it&#8217;s lumped in as STEAM as opposed to STEM, so the A gets thrown in there. But I want Revision Path to be this multimedia network that really lets people know that creativity in the Black design industry of course is something that we&#8217;re known for. These are the types of people that are doing it. These are the positions that are available. These are career paths that you can take. Basically just provide more information.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like I&#8217;ve been very fortunate that I know that the show is even taught in some schools. Current designers are learning about this show and learning about the people on this show to help inform them as designers when they get out there in the world and create new things. Imagine the kind of reach that Revision Path can have if we&#8217;re able to do that through more ways than just this podcast.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Podcasting is great, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but I also realize that the platform is the barrier to getting out to more people, because everyone&#8217;s not going to listen to a podcast. They may watch a YouTube video. They may read an article or something like that, and so to allow Revision Path the space to grow into those particular types of media would be great. Next five years I&#8217;d want to do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And of course be able to do Revision Path full time. Like right now Revision Path is very much still my nights and weekends project, because I work a nine-to-five job. I would love to do Revision Path full time, and have the sustainable revenue from patrons and from companies and from sponsorships to be able to really do this full time and really crank out a bunch of great stuff. It&#8217;s not still just me, because I do have a small team, but to even be able to expand that team out to do more would be great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Next five years, I hope to be there. I am putting things in place to make that happen. I just brought on a sponsorship director to help with getting more funds in for the show. And turn that revenue into these things that I want Revision Path to eventually become. I&#8217;ve got a plan for it, I just have to try to work the plan, and hopefully within the next five years we will be there, and you will be there too.</p>

<p>One of the things I love most about Revision Path is talking shop with design educators like Kaleena Sales. Kaleena is an illustrator, a design educator at Tennessee State University, and the author of <em><a href="https://papress.com/pages/extra-bold" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Extra Bold: A Feminist, Inclusive, Anti-Racist, Non-Binary Field Guild for Graphic Designers</a></em>. Kaleena is one of many Black design educators that are helping make the design canon more elastic for students by allowing Black culture and aesthetics to be a part of the conversation.</p>
<p>We talked about teaching design virtually at an HBCU, and Kaleena talked about growing up in Nashville and how she thought about pursuing a career as a fine artist before putting in time working in the advertising industry. She also spoke about what drew her back to her alma mater, as well as the many ways that she has seen design education change since she started teaching. Kaleena is also active with AIGA Nashville, and even shared some info about her upcoming book! With educators like Kaleena, I think the future is in good hands.</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Hi. I&#8217;m Kaleena Sales. I&#8217;m a design educator, illustrator, researcher from Nashville, Tennessee. I teach design at Tennessee State University where I&#8217;m also serving this year as the interim chair of the department. I also serve on the steering committee for AIGA&#8217;s design educators community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. How&#8217;s 2021 been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
You know what, it&#8217;s been good so far. It&#8217;s been really, really busy. 2020 was busy and then I feel like 2021 is just sort of a continuation of that. Lots of really cool opportunities have come up. There have been a couple of book projects and conferences and some speaking engagements and things that have kept me really busy. That&#8217;s been really nice and it sort of like serves as a good balance for me between my teaching role at TSU.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is it hard kind of trying to balance the teaching along with these other opportunities?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
It can be, yeah. I mean, this year&#8217;s been weird anyway just because of all of the virtual instruction and then having to figure out how to deliver content to students in addition to taking on this interim chairs position for the first time and learning how to serve in an administrative capacity. That&#8217;s been a lot of really like a new space for me. So doing a lot of the the book projects and sort of my, I guess field work has really started as a really nice balance. So it keeps me really busy, but I really like being able to do all of the extra projects. I feel like it really gives me the context that I need to be a better educator.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s dive into more of the work that you&#8217;re doing at Tennessee State. So your interim chair of the, which department is it again?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
It&#8217;s the Department of Art and Design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Art and design. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah, studio and design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. I would imagine with sort of this, I guess, hybrid&#8230; I don&#8217;t know is it sort of a hybrid thing now that students are getting vaccinated and such or is it still all virtual?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, we have a few hybrid courses, but this past year a lot of the delivery has been virtual. So we&#8217;ve been trying to stay away from each other as much as possible. But there have been some classes, the more studio-based courses. So like ceramics or sculpture and those types of things that are difficult to teach just online. Those have been meeting a little bit in person. For my design classes, I&#8217;ve been all virtual though.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has it been trying to teach design virtually?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
It&#8217;s not terrible. I mean, obviously with design, we have the benefit of using the computer as our main tool. So it&#8217;s been fine in that way. One of the challenges though is I&#8217;m used to like a lot of other design educators and just educators in general like I&#8217;m used to walking around the classroom and assessing student&#8217;s work and sort of being there with them as they&#8217;re navigating through some of their challenges and helping them to see things as they&#8217;re working.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So you lose some of that within the virtual space because students are either working offline or they&#8217;re not sharing their screens with you while they&#8217;re kind of going through those processes. So that assessment and kind of critique process really has changed quite a bit in the virtual space.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s the part that&#8217;s tough and I think that the students are having a hard time with that and that feedback loop is a little bit difficult for some of them. But again, I&#8217;m thankful though that we do get to just use our laptops for the most part to do our work. There have been some issues though with just access to laptops and software for some of my students. So a lot of the students that I teach typically rely on using the computer lab to do a lot of their work.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So we have seen a drop-off in enrollment because some of the students who just don&#8217;t have the materials to do it just didn&#8217;t enroll in classes this semester or this past year. So that&#8217;s been really unfortunate and I&#8217;m hoping that in the fall we&#8217;ll see that turn back around.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was listening to this podcast series from the New York Times called Odessa and they have been following this&#8230; Really, it was this high school girl and her class. Her band actually, marching band. And it struck me just like it has to be so hard for students right now everywhere. Regardless of the grade because school is such a vital social function as well as a societal function. And when something like the pandemic kind of strips that away and turns into a virtual experience, it&#8217;s not just so much about, &#8220;Oh, you can&#8217;t commune in public,&#8221; but it takes away something from like the whole society.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I can only imagine trying to focus and learn, and you can only do it on the computer and you can&#8217;t really collaborate in person or knock ideas off of other people in real time in that way. It&#8217;s really tough.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah, it is tough and a lot of the students&#8230; Everyone&#8217;s wired differently. So you have introverts like myself who are completely fine like being at home and away from people. But we have a lot of students who really, really do need that social component and they&#8217;re missing it. Then all the other activities that you have with just college life in general, outside of just your classes. And on an HBCU campus, one of the big draws to an HBCU for a lot of students is the community and it&#8217;s that sense of being around your peers. So when you&#8217;re back isolated at home, you&#8217;re missing out on a big part of why you even attended college in the first place.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s very, very true. Overall though, I&#8217;d like to know because I mentioned before we started recording that I&#8217;ve had a lot of design educators on the show just really this year, but what&#8217;s the experience like teaching design at an HBCU. What makes that special?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a really I think a kind of specific experience that happens when you&#8217;re learning design at an HBCU. And I&#8217;m sure it varies depending on which HBC you&#8217;re attending and all that. But a lot of the students that I teach, they come from cities like Memphis, and Atlanta, and Chicago. They are really from like black parts of town and then they come to a college that&#8217;s predominantly black.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So your cultural kind of experience is very kind of specific and that comes out in your design work at least in my experience it has for the students. So when we&#8217;re teaching about international typographic style and Bauhaus, and all of that, the students are engaged to a certain extent, but they&#8217;re very much interested in expressing their culture through design.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So I would say that&#8217;s a really big distinction between learning or experiencing design and learning designing in HBCU versus at a predominantly white institution is because you&#8217;re surrounded by black people, black culture all the time and you&#8217;re not really in the minority yet. So the students that I teach often don&#8217;t really see a need to create work that fits the mainstream necessarily.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
They&#8217;re not really pulled to do that or compelled to do that the way that I see black students who are in predominantly white institutions doing. So that&#8217;s really interesting to observe and it actually kind of is what created my personal research interest in general. So that&#8217;s one of the biggest observations I&#8217;ve made.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I would also imagine because you being a black design educator and it&#8217;s at an HBCU, you don&#8217;t dissuade students when they try to do that, right?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
You know what though, it&#8217;s been a journey for me because I&#8217;ll be honest and say that when I first started teaching, I was teaching very much the way that I was taught. So I was teaching very much like, again, international topographic style, and sans serif, and flush left, and these are the rules. I started teaching really like when I was 27, so it&#8217;s been quite a few years ago now.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So I wanted my students originally to fit into the mainstream. I felt like that was going to be their path into the industry. And it very much still is to be honest, but I&#8217;ve changed the way that I feel about that and the way that I teach about that now. So instead of wanting them to squeeze into the mainstream. There&#8217;s a really good quote by an AfriCOBRA artist that says something about making the canon&#8230; Instead of fitting into the canon, making the canon more elastic. So that&#8217;s sort of like how I approach it now versus the way that I taught in my really early years.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So now, I&#8217;m encouraging them to consider the ways that their identity might show up and the way that their social economic kind of status or upbringing might even influence their design work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting. I&#8217;m thinking on how that would look like. I don&#8217;t know. Can you give an example of what a student&#8230; And you don&#8217;t have to like call-out a student by name or anything, but what&#8217;s an example of something that a student would do in that instance?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
I actually write about this in the book Extra Bold, but one really kind of specific example would be just even the way that we all view wealth or money for example, right? If you think about if you grow up wealthy or in a family that&#8217;s pretty well off, your view of money is normalized. So if you were to ask to design a logo for a bank for example, you might represent that in a really sort of corporate way. It&#8217;s like simplified typography and that sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
If you grew up like I grew up, which was like inner city and not very well off, your ideas of what wealth looks like is very different. It might be a little bit flashier and it might have gold as a representation or some other kind of symbolism that matches that type of thinking. So I see my students choosing fonts, and colors, and textures that really speak to the visual landscape and the culture in which they come from.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So there&#8217;s a lot of, I think, influences from hip-hop and just very like urban design. They don&#8217;t shy away from that and I don&#8217;t want them to. So those are kind of some things that come to mind when I think about that specific aesthetic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The first thing when you said that what came to mind was&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if you remember seeing this, but there&#8217;s this black bank called One United Bank and they have this visa card with Harriet Tubman on it doing the Wakanda salute.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I saw it on Twitter and people clowned it, but leave it to a black bank to do that. You know what I&#8217;m saying? You wouldn&#8217;t see that at Wells Fargo. That ain&#8217;t happening.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
That&#8217;s funny. That sort of pushes it into sort of a space where those symbols&#8230; And I don&#8217;t want to criticize that design, but those symbols sort of take on a little bit of a stereotype or they don&#8217;t mean as much. I think that it&#8217;s hard to talk about black aesthetics and black design sometimes because I think sometimes we feel that we&#8217;re being or we&#8217;re describing like a monolithic viewpoint or like a monolithic experience when we do that.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s certainly not ever like what I want to suggest. I think it&#8217;s true for everyone&#8217;s experience. I think we just are all influenced by just the things around us and the media that we consume, and the way that we grow up. Even our fashion choices respond to our culture as well. So those are really the things that I see.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And your research focus, I mean it plays into this about black culture and aesthetics. How did you end up deciding on that as a focus?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Well, exactly sort of what I was just describing, which was I started to notice that my students were making some choices. So for example a lot of my students were liking like the Old English typeface. I was getting so frustrated and I thought, &#8220;Oh my gosh. Why do you guys keep choosing this?&#8221; I stepped back and I tried to be less critical and I was like, &#8220;Well, why do they like this particular typeface and why do I see certain color palettes repeating like red, and black, and white and really bold color combinations?&#8221; I started to study a little bit about the mere exposure effect and subliminal exposure. I don&#8217;t know if you are familiar with that or not.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No. I haven&#8217;t heard of that.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So it just simply says like the more you see something, the more you like it. The subliminal exposure effect essentially just says that even when things are repeated subliminally and you don&#8217;t notice that you&#8217;re seeing something over and over again, you still end up having a sort of a preference for that. So it&#8217;s sort of similar to, if you grew up in a household where people smoke cigarettes and then maybe as an adult, the smell of cigarette smoke is actually sort of calming to you because it reminds you of home.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Or if you grew up in New York City, and it&#8217;s busy and loud, maybe a very quiet kind of experience is discomforting to you. It&#8217;s sort of that kind of thing. So when we see things, textures of the city, the sounds of the city, even like fashion choices depending if you&#8217;re into sneakers or if you&#8217;re into certain kinds of shoes those color palettes and things, they stick with this.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So I see that in the research that I&#8217;m doing. What I started to do in my research was pull examples of my students work and compare it to the visual landscape of urban environments and I saw a lot of similarities between the two. So for graffiti lettering and then an interest in that kind of typography style or even textures from a city like walls or landscape and then the textures that students are choosing in their design work.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So I just think it&#8217;s kind of interesting and fascinating. Although, I specifically am interested in like the black experience and particularly the urban black experience, I think that this can certainly be true for people who grew up in rural areas and that sort of thing. So that&#8217;s sort of where that research interest comes from. It&#8217;s directly from my students experience and in my experience observing them while teaching.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Now, I want to switch gears here a little bit. I know we&#8217;ve been talking about the work that you&#8217;re doing at Tennessee State. Of course a lot of the work you&#8217;re doing with your students. Did you grow up also in Tennessee?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
I did. I grew up in Nashville and I went to Tennessee state university for undergrad. So that&#8217;s home and Nashville is home.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I would imagine creativity and art were probably a big part of your childhood and your environment growing up.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
You know what, not really. I would say I wasn&#8217;t exposed to a lot of art. My parents were military parents and my dad was in the army. My mom was in the army for a while. It wasn&#8217;t really a very artistic kind of household. I was sort of the oddball in my family in terms of having an interest in that, but it was always supported though. When I did decide to pursue art as a career path, I was lucky that my parents were supportive of that. I know I teach a lot of students who say that their parents are sort of unsure or not supportive of that when they first decide to choose that as a major.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So growing up in Nashville, I&#8217;d imagine Tennessee state was probably just always in your backyard?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah, it was. It was the only college honestly that I even considered going to. When you grew up in Nashville, especially I went to like a black high school and was in the band. So you get used to that, that culture. So we would march in TSU&#8217;s homecoming parades. So it was just always there. I think about this sort of in hindsight sometimes because I didn&#8217;t even know of any art schools back then. When I was thinking about going to college, I just had never heard of like MICA or RISD. They were completely foreign to me. So I think about that too in terms of exposure. I wonder if I would have known what choices I would have made.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny you say that about going to a black high school and sort of being close to another historically black college. So for folks that know that have listened to the show, I grew up in Selma, Alabama and the nearest&#8230; Well, we have a HBCU there. We have Selma University, but it&#8217;s a small college. We don&#8217;t even have a band. Nobody really pays attention to it. But Alabama State University in Montgomery was always like the school that we kind of, I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily say, emulated, but we also would march in their homecoming parade and stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So that whole culture of all of that is just so rich. Oh. See, now you got me thinking about marching band and memories of all of that is so rich. But it&#8217;s interesting though about not really knowing about the possibility. I mean, when did you sort of know that you wanted to study design to go to Tennessee State and to study it?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So I had an art teacher in high school and the class that we were in was called commercial art. I didn&#8217;t know what that meant, but for some reason I really liked the way it sounded. So I used to draw a lot. I didn&#8217;t know anything about computer graphics or what commercial art even meant, but for some reason I really grabbed a hold to that title. So when I was choosing a major, I chose art.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
After the first year or two of studying as a studio art major, I realized that I liked painting and all of that, but I really did not&#8230; I was sort of afraid of pursuing a career as a fine artist. I didn&#8217;t want to have to&#8230; I&#8217;d had this weird vision in my head that I would be standing on the corner trying to sell paintings for a living. I was afraid of that lifestyle and I was just like, &#8220;I need to find something that has like in my mind more stability.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
I was reading a magazine, I think it was like essence magazine or something like that and I came across the titles in the beginning of the magazine and it listed like art director and all these other&#8230; And I thought I don&#8217;t know what an art director is, but that sounds like something that I want to do. So I really clung to that and I started researching like early internet days. I started researching art direction and found the VCU&#8217;s Brandcenter. It was called the Adcenter at the time, but found that program online. And that&#8217;s what took me off in that direction.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. And VCU&#8217;s Brandcenter, I mean is well known, I think internationally well known. We&#8217;ve had another guest on the show, Brandon Viney who also went. I think he grew up in and around Virginia, but he knew about VCU. So certainly their program definitely cranks out people that can perform at a top-notch design level. How was it when you were there?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
It was amazing to be honest. When I discovered the program and I set my sights on going there for grad school, I&#8217;ve sort of like obsessively stalked their website and tried to emulate the work that I saw coming out of that program. When I got accepted and I went, it was all that I was hoping it would be like it was intense and rigorous. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s really meant for&#8230; I mean, I have thoughts now about how it sort of does exclude people who could not go through a program like that because maybe they had to work or had other kind of obligations. But for those of us that were privileged enough to not have other obligations and could do that, I really learned a lot about how to just think and how to solve problems and how to process ideas.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So I feel like although I&#8217;m not working in the ad industry anymore, it definitely has affected every part of my career since then in terms of just me being able to think about things in more of a problem-solving and strategic viewpoint.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I know you interned for JWT for a while and then you worked for several years at Doe-Anderson which is an advertising firm. With that whole experience, how did it sort of bring you back to Tennessee eventually?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
When I worked at Doe-Anderson, I worked there for a couple of years right out of grad school. It was a good experience, but 2008 right when the country was going through a recession, we lost a big client and I got laid off. I was like, &#8220;What? What is happening?&#8221; I had just won some awards and I thought everything was going great and it was one of the early shocks in my career that things could be turbulent and things could not go the way that you think they&#8217;re going to go.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know why I was one of the ones that was let go and honestly, it&#8217;s sort of a side note. I do think that it&#8217;s possible that there was some cultural fit issues. But that&#8217;s what made me move back to Nashville. I thought, &#8220;Okay. Well, I&#8217;m out of work. What do I do?&#8221; And I started freelancing as a graphic designer.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
That was really the first time that I really started to think about my skills as a designer a little bit more seriously than when I was doing the art direction thing. So I got pretty serious about learning craft and investigating typography a bit more and that&#8217;s sort of kind of is what paved the way into me teaching design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, the ad industry though is notorious for being like&#8230; It kind of chews people up and spits people out so that could have been for the best.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah. At the time, it felt really crappy. I was like things happen for a reason and I&#8217;m so happy with&#8230; In hindsight, I&#8217;m happy with the direction that my career has taken since then. But it&#8217;s a tough industry to be in. I mean, so many ups and downs. So many people that I know that still work in the industry that have just been uplifted so many times and moved. I think it&#8217;s great if you have a passion for it, if that&#8217;s your thing and that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re really interested in and that&#8217;s rewarding. But I think my forceful exit was what I needed to refocus on the things that I really care more about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve mentioned you&#8217;ve been teaching for a number of years. We won&#8217;t do the math on that, but how have you seen design education change since you started teaching?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Oh, man. I think that one of the biggest ways is that the conversation surrounding diversity and the canon and decolonizing design. I don&#8217;t know if I was just disengaged or if those conversations just weren&#8217;t really happening when I first started teaching. So that&#8217;s been one of the biggest ways that I&#8217;ve seen a significant shift in terms of pedagogy and just the ways in which we are considering what we&#8217;re teaching to the point where if I do teach things that are traditionally in the canon.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
I make sure that I&#8217;m providing context whereas early in my teaching days, I wasn&#8217;t doing that. So that context might be the reason why we&#8217;re learning about this person is because there are other people that were excluded that could not be a part of this conversation. And the reason why we&#8217;re learning about this particular design style is because other design styles aren&#8217;t in this book at all that we&#8217;re using.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So I see that across the board. It&#8217;s not just something that I&#8217;m doing. There&#8217;s tons of design educators that are revamping curriculum and really trying to respond to some of the changes that we&#8217;ve seen socially over the past few years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. it has really been interesting how&#8230; I didn&#8217;t go to school for design so I can&#8217;t really speak on it from a historical standpoint, but certainly I know since I started doing this podcast back in 2013, it&#8217;s amazing to see how educators have really started to come together not just in, as you say kind of elasticizing the canon or like teaching outside of the canon, but also even coming up with other curriculum or even opening up their class to talk about these sorts of things because students, like you said, you teach at HBCU.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So students are coming with these questions or they&#8217;re coming with these viewpoints and to not shy away from them and to be able to speak to them and place it in a modern context and place in a cultural context. I mean, it&#8217;s amazing just how much that has changed. Really, it feels like within the past maybe 10 years or so, it feels like it&#8217;s really started to grow around that. I&#8217;m seeing it even from mostly white art institutions. I&#8217;m seeing the same thing start to happen. I&#8217;m glad that it&#8217;s starting to take shape in that way.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah. I think that a lot of people recognize the opportunity to make these changes and are feeling some of the responsibility. I think as educators we are certainly sort of on the front lines of reshaping the next generation of designers and the way that they approach design. So I&#8217;m really happy with a lot of the conversations that I&#8217;ve listened to or been a part of even over the past couple of years that are really starting to push things forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I guess the pandemic maybe might have accelerated this a bit, but now you&#8217;ve been seeing more events around this. I remember 2015, Harvard&#8217;s graduate school, they have an African-American student union there and they put together this conference called Black in Design. And the first year that they had it was in 2015. I remember trying to get people that I knew like peers and friends to go like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go. It&#8217;s at Harvard.&#8221; The tickets were less than $100. It was super cheap.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But they were looking at the program and the thing was it was called Black in Design but it wasn&#8217;t digital design. At least for the first year, they have the conference every other year. And for the first year, the theme was around the concept of space like the city, the neighborhood, the region, et cetera. So people are looking at that and I&#8217;m trying to get people to go and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;But they&#8217;re not talking about Photoshop. They&#8217;re not talking about illustrator. Why would I go to a Black in Design Conference when they&#8217;re not talking about digital design?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m like, &#8220;How many black design conferences have you been to in your career? None. Let&#8217;s just go. It&#8217;s cheap. Let&#8217;s just go.&#8221; I&#8217;ve been fortunate to go every year that they&#8217;ve had it. I&#8217;m interested to see how they pull it off this year because I went last in 2019 for their third installment and I want to see how they do it this year. I mean, last year for example and this year as well, there was State of Black Design that went on. There&#8217;s Where are the Black Designers? I&#8217;m seeing even other colleges doing small little designs speaking events and things like that. So it&#8217;s really starting to blossom. It&#8217;s wonderful to see.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah. There&#8217;s been a lot of really great programming. The State of Black Design, the one that you just mentioned with Omari Souza. I mean, incredible. So I love it. I think the more that these types of things pop-up, it&#8217;s just going to further the conversation, get more people involved and engaged and really just recognize that this movement is happening and it&#8217;s not just like a fluke.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
I think when there&#8217;s just like one conference here, maybe some people will catch it, but when it&#8217;s happening over and over and all around us, at some point you can&#8217;t avoid it. So you have to kind of decide whether or not you&#8217;re going to engage in this change, in this movement.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you seen any sort of pushback against it, I&#8217;m curious like from a student standpoint?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Not directly. My students have not pushed back against it. They&#8217;re all about it. They&#8217;re excited to learn about, again, black culture, black history and whatever discipline that comes from whether it&#8217;s in their art history course or whether it&#8217;s in one of my design classes. So not directly with my students. I have seen questions maybe from design educators surrounding how do we engage students who aren&#8217;t interested in this?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So I would imagine at predominantly white institutions where this might seem like it&#8217;s sort of like breaking from the norm of what&#8217;s being taught. There may be more pushback, but I think overall even at predominantly white institutions there&#8217;s a lot of excitement or a lot of recognition that these are important areas. So yeah, I mean overall it&#8217;s going in the right direction.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, that&#8217;s good to hear. That&#8217;s good to hear.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
At least in my experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What would you say your students teach you?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Oh, man. Well, I think just they taught me to be a better professor and to understand context more. They also taught me how to give feedback. I think when I first started teaching one area where I struggled was how do I communicate the things that I would like for them to focus on in a way that they&#8217;ll understand it and in a way that doesn&#8217;t feel subjective and just a personal opinion.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So I had to learn that and I had to sort of read them and read their responses and figure out what was landing and what was not landing. So I certainly have learned that from them just based on the ways in which they respond back to me when we&#8217;re in class. They also have really great ideas. I just sat in on a bunch of meetings today and yesterday where our seniors were presenting their senior thesis projects and they&#8217;re choosing such interesting topics that are sort of blowing my mind.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
One student is interested in fashion and she was addressing ways that the pandemic has changed our outlook on clothing and fashion. Another student was thinking about the ways in which bias and stereotypes can be addressed through animation and cartoon. There&#8217;s all these like topics that they come up with that I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s really interesting.&#8221; I love to see like the way that they&#8217;re processing how to use art and design in those ideas. So I&#8217;m constantly learning from them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s really interesting. I don&#8217;t know. I mean, of course kids now have just so many different experiences that they&#8217;re pulling from especially during this current time. That part about the fashion though, I mean I can just personally attest. I&#8217;m looking at my closet and I want to get rid of everything. I want to adopt like a minimalist capsule wardrobe at this point. I look at my slacks and my suits and stuff, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I want to get rid of all of this.&#8221; Because I haven&#8217;t had to wear them. I haven&#8217;t had to go anywhere with it.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
That&#8217;s exactly what the student was sort of suggesting. We&#8217;re liking this comfort thing. Let&#8217;s get more of that, more yoga pants and sweatshirts. Then even just sort of like this particular project for example. The student was even questioning, &#8220;Are we learning more about sustainability? Are we not comfortable being as flashy anymore?&#8221; So she was just really posing some really interesting thoughtful questions and those are the things that are really refreshing to hear especially from really young designers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That is a great question. Now, that you&#8217;ve mentioned that I&#8217;m just thinking like when I scroll through Instagram, that is exactly what I see. I see so many tie-dyed sweatshirts. I mean, of course there&#8217;s like muted color palettes. There&#8217;s talk about sustainability and organic and all this stuff, but everything is very beige.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
That makes us feel like we&#8217;re being socially conscious because beige is the color of being socially conscious.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ve been talking about design educators kind of touching on that earlier, but there&#8217;s also been this kind of pretty regular conversation in the design community around maybe the lack of black design educators. What do you think contributes to that?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
I just think that we&#8217;re underrepresented across the board in the industry. In design and in education, higher education, and the end of higher education, I mean most accredited&#8230; Well, I guess depending on if your state school or how your funding works, you have to have a terminal degree to work as a college educator. So that&#8217;s the MFA in most cases. So that already pushes a lot of people out of the possibility of pursuing this.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
I know a ton of amazing black designers that went to college for it and would be incredible, but like a lot of other designers, they&#8217;re working. They&#8217;re doing their practice and so they didn&#8217;t go and get that MFA teaching degree. So that&#8217;s one of the ways that I see that it&#8217;s limiting because it begins to be really expensive. Obviously, the more education you&#8217;re pursuing. So those advanced degrees you&#8217;re having to decide on do I want to get student loan debt? Is this worth it? Is the college teaching job going to sort of offset the cost of all of this?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s a really big consideration depending on who you are and where you&#8217;re from and what sort of like&#8230; Maybe even generational wealth you might or may not have. So I think that can contribute to the lack of diversity in education in general, higher education in general. But then even as designers, there&#8217;s just so few still, so few black designers working in the space that it just gets narrowed even further when you add in another criteria. So it&#8217;s black designer and educator. The numbers just get real slim. So, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I could see that. I mean, I think visibility is sort of one part of that as you mentioned. You just don&#8217;t really see that many. Although now, I think you&#8217;re seeing more and more with these events and speaking and things like that. But also I wonder if students as they&#8217;re learning, are they also being enlightened about going into design education as well?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah. Probably not as much as we should. Actually, just before joining this call with you, I was listening to Jacinda Walker do a presentation about the work that she&#8217;s doing and she pointed out that there are, I think 300 and something black design educators across the country. That&#8217;s a really tiny number and she actually just mentioned something about to your point, we sort of need to do a better job of advocating for our career and talking about it and communicating to younger students what it is that we do and some of the things that we enjoy about this.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
I think that there&#8217;s still, I guess, a little bit of a misconception in terms of what teachers do. A lot of people, I think there&#8217;s still a little bit of that idea of like if you&#8217;re&#8230; What is it saying? If you&#8217;re good, you do and if you&#8217;re not, you teach.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. Like those who can do and those who can&#8217;t teach.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah. So I think that can sometimes, the mindset of a lot of creatives. So if you&#8217;re in a creative field, you really do have that itch inside of you to do the work, right? You want to practice. So teaching feels like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not going to be able to do the work. I&#8217;m going to be in this box where I&#8217;m not really practicing.&#8221; But what I would love for people to know is like when you&#8217;re working in higher education as a professor, research component that a lot of us are asked to do allows for us to grow our practice and really do a lot of personal projects that we wouldn&#8217;t otherwise be able to do if you&#8217;re working in the industry. So I&#8217;ve seen my personal work grow since being an educator.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now is that sort of how you came across doing the book?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Extra Bold?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was trying to give you a good segue into it.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Well, yes. I actually met Ellen Lupton. She came to Nashville, I think it was 2019 and she was AIGA Nashville. I served on the board for AIGA Nashville and we hosted her. she was actually doing a presentation for one of the really early iterations of the book before it took the shape that it is now. We took her to dinner. The board of directors for AIGA Nashville took her to dinner and we sort of chatted and just touched base and kind of do what you do when you&#8217;re at dinner.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
She followed up and asked a few questions. Then eventually I was going to be a contributor for a small part of the book along with so many other amazing contributors. That was where it was for a while and then I got an email last year sometime from her where she invited me and to be a co-author and do some more writing in the book. So that&#8217;s how that took shape.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s been amazing to be a part of that collaborative project. And what I love really most about that book in particular is that it involves so many different voices and perspectives and narratives. You hear from people like me who I don&#8217;t think typically has this sort of platform. So I love it. I feel like I&#8217;m learning so much from the other co-authors and the other contributors in the book.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, when does the book come out?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So Extra Bold will be released on May 11th, and so really soon. It feels like it&#8217;s been in the works for quite a while now, but just a couple more weeks. At least from the time we&#8217;re recording the podcast. I don&#8217;t know when it&#8217;ll be released, but May 11 is when the books will be on the shelves.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah. So I&#8217;m excited about that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. By the time this airs it&#8217;ll be out.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Oh, good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah. So that&#8217;s exciting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So about your work with AIGA Nashville on the board, what is it like sort of serving a chapter that&#8217;s in a city like Nashville? I&#8217;ve had other people from Nashville on the show before and even other people from Tennessee, but I don&#8217;t know if people might think of Nashville as being a really sort of design hub or a design city of any sort.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yeah. Nashville, we&#8217;re known for our music, country music. But we do have a pretty good design community in Nashville. What&#8217;s really interesting about the board and what I love about AIGA&#8217;s national board is it&#8217;s extremely diverse, much more diverse than the industry is. We have maybe 50% black designers and lots of women designers. It&#8217;s just a very welcoming kind of place and community to be a part of. It was really the first organization that I took on any sort of a leadership role. I was the director of education for a while and then I transitioned over into being the director of diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
And just by being involved, I have met so many other like wonderful designers. I didn&#8217;t realize that I was missing out. I think that naturally a lot of artists, designer types are kind of in our own little like circles or worlds. When I joined the board, it sort of forced me to grow and be a part of the larger like Nashville design community. And I certainly feel like I&#8217;ve benefited from doing that. I love just being a part of the events and figuring out content that will service the community there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are some upcoming events and things that you all are planning to do this year?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Well, we always participate in Nashville Design Week. So we&#8217;re brainstorming some ideas for that. It&#8217;s not released yet, but we typically invite in some inspiring guest speakers. Last year, we did a panel with Mitzi Okou from the Where are the Black Designers conference and Forest Young, and Bobby C. Martin. We just had an amazing conversation about the experience that they&#8217;ve had working as black designers in the field.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
This year will hopefully be like a continuation of those types of conversations. We also do a lot of programming. I don&#8217;t serve in the educator role anymore on the board, but we do a lot of programming for students. So we do a lot of like portfolio reviews and meetups for students. So that&#8217;s always fun to help them get their foot in the door.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I kind of want to switch gears here again. We&#8217;ve been focusing again a lot on your work and the things that you&#8217;re doing, but I&#8217;m curious what is it that sort of keeps you motivated and inspired to really continue this work?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
The more that I work and the more that my work sort of shifts, I really want people to feel seen and I want to value the different experiences that black and minority designers have in this industry. So that might be again looking at the ways in which there might be some differences in the ways that the portfolios from an HBCU might look versus again a predominantly wide institution and advocating for us to remove bias in our review practices.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So it motivates me to talk about that and to share students work and students experience. And it motivates me to continue to have conversations about just diversity and design in general and sort of like the implications of the lack of diversity on our experience when we&#8217;re working as designers, how does that affect our confidence? How does that affect our mental health? How does it feel to be the only black designer in a creative department? Similar to when I was working at the ad agency and sort of it motivates me to talk about that so that other young designers who are black and are in those situations can feel seen, feel understood and sort of recognize that they&#8217;re not doing anything wrong. It might just be the industry needs to catch up to fully appreciate their point of view.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you want to accomplish this year?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Aside from launching the book, I should say.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a big one. But I want to actually write more, but I really would love to find a way to connect my illustration interest with design. I feel like right now they&#8217;re still living very separate lives. I do a lot of like illustration work and portrait drawings and things, but also obviously, I have a really big passion for design and writing. So one thing I&#8217;d love to do is find a way where they can sort of&#8230; Like these things can co-exist. So I do a lot of experimentation and I&#8217;m trying to figure that out. So I&#8217;ll feel really satisfied if I can get to some sort of a solution on that. And especially if it continues to elevate black voices and experiences.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
I was serving like I said as the interim chair. So the next year I&#8217;ll be the chair of the department. I think I&#8217;d like to be still in that position in five years. So that&#8217;s a lot of administrative work for the department. But what that looks like for me is like revamping curriculum and thinking about ways to get more of our students working in art and design spaces and facilitating that experience for them. So again, changing curriculum, getting them connected to mentors in the industry and just doing all of that sort of work on behalf of the students that I teach, but more from an administrative role and capacity.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s where I see a lot of my time being spent. I would also love to do illustration work for some&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I want to take it away from just sort of something I&#8217;m doing on the side and maybe do more commission work in that space.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have like a dream client or a dream project that you&#8217;d want to do?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Sort of. There&#8217;s not a specific client. I think that I would just&#8230; I sort of believe that if I continue to work on my craft and then refine it, that whatever&#8217;s meant to happen will happen and that right opportunity or that right client will find its way to me. So we&#8217;ll see. I would love to do some sort of partnership. But I don&#8217;t know what that exactly looks like. I&#8217;m really open to wherever that goes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
So I am on all the social media channels on Instagram @kaleenasales. On Twitter @kaleena_sales. I think that&#8217;s right. And I&#8217;m on LinkedIn. I would love to connect on LinkedIn to whoever would like to connect and stay in touch that way. I&#8217;m on social media. My website is kalinasales.design, if you just want to kind of check that out and read a little bit more about what I&#8217;m up to there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. And we&#8217;ll also put a link to the book in the show notes.</p>
<p><b>Kaleena Sales:</b><br>
Yay. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Kaleena Sales, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you for really helping to teach the next generation of designers. I mean, it floored me the first time when I heard a teacher tell me that they actually use this podcast in their class because for people to know, I do this at home in my bedroom. And the fact that it has this kind of reach where I know educators are teaching it around the world, I think also speaks to this greater elasticization of the canon that you&#8217;re speaking about. I&#8217;m just glad that you&#8217;re there to help really guide and shepherd the next generation, and also keep them true to their cultural identity as they do it. That is super important. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>

<p>Joseph Carter-Brown is a man of many titles. He&#8217;s a UX strategist. He&#8217;s a human-centered designer. And by day, he&#8217;s the global UX manager at Stanley Black &amp; Decker, a Fortune 500 company that&#8217;s over 175 years old! Joseph&#8217;s versatility as a design leader extends far beyond titles, as you&#8217;ll definitely discover in this week&#8217;s interview.</p>
<p>We start off with a look at his work and his team, and he shares an anecdote from last year that put him on his current path to success. Joseph also talked to me about how he worked his way into a position at Apple thanks to Steve Jobs, his shift to UX after studying at Full Sail University, and speaks on his time with AIGA Baltimore and about how he wants to bridge the digital divide in Baltimore. Joseph is a prime example of someone who is using his skills to help build a more equitable future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I&#8217;m Joseph Carter-Brown. I am a user experience, service design and design strategy specialist. I&#8217;ve been in design for over 20 years. Started as a kid. I am currently the global UX manager for Stanley Black &#038; Decker, and I&#8217;m leading a team of user experience designers, strategists, and researchers helping to bring user experience in the user-centered design focus toward our digital brand and overall design culture.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. We definitely will talk more about your work at Stanley Black &#038; Decker just a little bit later. But right now, how has 2021 been treating you so far?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
2021 has actually treated me really well. I just bought a house about a few, well, two weeks ago now. So that was coming from a kid who had to be rather scrappy throughout childhood and growing up and get into an opportunity to say I can make that happen for myself was such an honor for me really. So far it&#8217;s been treating me really well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Over this past year or so, have you picked up on any like new habits or behaviors about yourself?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I had this latent introversion that I&#8217;ve regained. It&#8217;s really funny because a lot of my work as we&#8217;ve talked about previously about with AIG Baltimore, and working in this often front facing space where I had to be in front of people, I got used to being an extrovert, and over the pandemic, it reminded me that I actually kind of just like small understated experiences, hiking, getting away from people, not being around a whole lot of people. It&#8217;s been a way of rekindling my love for maybe just myself in those small interactions.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I feel like everyone has gotten closer to their true self in some aspects because of this time, because we just had to spend so much time quarantined or isolated from other people.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. I think it&#8217;s one of those things where I know when the pandemic starting I had, or especially when it really hit, my daughter&#8217;s birthday, my daughter&#8217;s 10th birthday was March 13th, 2020 and I had-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. I had this whole amazing surprise trip for her. We were going to go somewhere we had never been. I designed a website for it. I did all of these things and then I had to cancel that over just the day before we were supposed to leave and it was supposed to happen. I had this new job opportunity lined up that got washed away. My girlfriend is a nurse and so I was nervous about her going into work. My ex-wife got sick with COVID actually. So I&#8217;m concerned about, is she going to be sick? I kind of had to take a step back and just sit and do a lot of reading and look at myself and say, &#8220;No matter what happens, who are you?&#8221; I had to ask myself that question and really go inside for a while and understand my values and myself as a person. So I think that was an important moment. Fortunately, everybody&#8217;s okay. Everybody&#8217;s so safe and healthy in all of that. But it was definitely a moment of reflection for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. I bet. That&#8217;s a lot. Wow.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, just more gray hairs on my head is it seems to [inaudible 00:08:55].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So let&#8217;s talk about your work at Stanley Black &#038; Decker, which, I mean, in case people don&#8217;t know, that is a huge, huge business. Of course, you can probably infer from the name of the company. There&#8217;s two brands, Stanley Black &#038; Decker. There&#8217;s like a dozen or so brands of consumer goods and manufacturing goods and stuff. The business has been around for over 150 years. You serve as their global UX manager. Tell me a bit about what you do.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, so it&#8217;s probably as daunting as it sounds. I am there to really help bring a structure to how they approach digital brand engagements. I have a team of about six or seven designers, strategists and researchers, and we&#8217;re currently working on really working to reshape the way user experience is done throughout the global brand. One of the things I find interesting is with this old, long in the tooth organization, a lot of their understanding of the digital space is also growing. So there&#8217;s a lot of teaching that we have to do, a lot of mindset shift that we have to do. So it&#8217;s a lot of work in helping teams internally understand how to collaborate because so much of it for so long has been about working to&#8230; People build their silos and people working in these very tight knit groups.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I&#8217;m kind of the kick in the door type of person like, &#8220;No, we bring everything together. We show our work. We show our dirt. We show our ugly and we just go and we work together and we build this together.&#8221; Sometimes that&#8217;s a little bit uncomfortable for people and especially for teams that are used to having this very tight-knit, close-fisted environment. So it&#8217;s a lot about really organizational transformation, as much as it&#8217;s about digital transformation within the organization. It feels like we&#8217;re kind of tackling both right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m glad that you mentioned that about kind of the work that you&#8217;re doing, focus on the global brand, because I was even thinking, as I was doing research for this interview, like where does UX come into a company like Stanley Black &#038; Decker? I would imagine maybe for the actual websites or something, I&#8217;m not sure. I mean, when you say the global brand, can you talk about just what some of those touch points are?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. So one of the really tricky things that we&#8217;re dealing with is we&#8217;re a global brand. So we have to think about not just how say Black &#038; Decker site is presented to someone in the US. We have to think about how it presents in Latin America, Germany, Asia, Australia, all of these places. So it really about understanding, dealing with cultural difference, cultural expectation, cultural norms. It has a lot to do with understanding just communication and setting proper expectations. It&#8217;s also about not just control, but flexibility and letting go, like where do you compromise and where do you let go of the reins and understand that you can&#8217;t do everything. So some of it&#8217;s about just creating guides and helping people move in the direction that you like them to be.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
But yeah, so a lot of our work is particularly around the website and the digital experience to start. But when I look at user experience, I like to call user experience the customer service of branding. It&#8217;s the thing that you have to do where you have to think about how every step of the way is managed, and especially now, I mean, the key touch points that we have are digital, right? All of us have probably been in our houses, at home and doing everything virtually. So the experience that you create in the digital space is so much more important now, but it&#8217;s been going that way for so long. So I think that it has a big role to play on the external end, and then on the internal end, I think that there&#8217;s the aspect of user experience or maybe an offshoot of it, which is called service design, which is an area where I tend to specialize, which is really about coordinating teams and internal components to make sure that what you&#8217;re creating is actually feasible for those externally.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So one of my favorite examples or illustrations of that is I used to always work with people, especially when I was in an agency, and everybody would come and say, there was a time where everybody would come and say, &#8220;We want a blog.&#8221; These companies are like, &#8220;We need to engage with people. We&#8217;re going to have a blog and then everybody&#8217;s going to come to our blog.&#8221; But then you start to dig in into it and you say, &#8220;Well, how are you going to support this blog?&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll do a couple of posts a week.&#8221; &#8220;Well, who&#8217;s writing those posts?&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221; &#8220;Okay. Do you have the time to do that?&#8221; &#8220;Not really. I&#8217;ll make my assistant do it.&#8221; &#8220;Okay. Does your assistant know how to write?&#8221; &#8220;No, not really.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Service design is really about making sure that ensuring really, I would say an equitable user experience by making sure that you&#8217;re serving the internal components in a way that&#8217;s feasible, because it&#8217;s like if you&#8217;re going to start a process that you can actually support, or you&#8217;re not willing to put the resources up to support, then what&#8217;s going to happen is you&#8217;re going to put something out there that won&#8217;t support the people that you intend it for and you&#8217;re just going to fall short. So either divert your plan or put your money where your mouth is. I think that&#8217;s another of, important part that user experience plays with the service design discipline and something that I think we play as a role within Stanley Black &#038; Decker is understanding feasibility and not just let&#8217;s create something and throw it out there and hope that users want to interact with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I would say also just because of the types of deliverables, goods, et cetera that you make, because it works in so many different types of fields, in different parts of the country, different parts of the world, et cetera, there&#8217;s almost a expectation of that reliability anyway.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Oh, for sure. I think that really important part of it is that experience extends from the product that you make that&#8217;s tangible to just, again, those intangible interactions that you have. That&#8217;s why, like I said, I think it&#8217;s the customer service of branding. If I need to reach out to customer service, if I need to register a product, if I need to do any of these things, if you hinder my process any way throughout it, I&#8217;m going to get annoyed. I&#8217;m someone who&#8217;s a stickler for poor customer service. I mean, I&#8217;ve grown up in a service environment. My family was service-oriented. I worked for Apple and that was all about customer service. So I&#8217;ve just grown up about service. So when I have bad customer service, when I see bad, just things that aren&#8217;t thoughtful, I tend to get a little bit frustrated. So I try to put that into the work that I do as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does an average day look like for you? I mean, you mentioned you have this team of researchers and strategists, but how many people are reporting to you? Do you have a lot of meetings? How does an average day work?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. We tend to have a whole lot of meetings and that can be a little bit daunting at times. You got to kind of block out your calendar to make sure that you make some time for yourself. On an average day, so I have six reports, four direct reports, and then two other members on my team who also kind of filter up to me. So in total, my entire team, including myself, is seven people with two of them being in the strategist research realm and the rest really being more on design, development, or even engineering side of things. On a given day, it might be batting a number of meetings and working on strategies for some particular projects that are working on being launched. Sometimes it&#8217;s just kind of creating communications because so much of what we do, and I have to often remind my team that there&#8217;s a part of what we do, which is selling. It&#8217;s not just about creating the deliverable and it&#8217;s not just about getting it done, but it&#8217;s about selling to other executives within the company why the work we&#8217;re doing is valuable.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So one of the main things here is that it&#8217;s been&#8230; My team, in fact, I started in September of 2020, and my team really started maybe a month or two before me and then I came in to lead the team. So it&#8217;s still relatively new, but a lot of my day to day is really just working on testing plans, research plans, deliverable plans for visual designs and website launch projects that we&#8217;re working on, kind of looking at what&#8217;s on the horizon and trying to see what a little bit past the horizon to set a plan, making sure&#8230; It&#8217;s kind of like being a coach in a lot of ways, making sure all of the pieces are in the right place so that right in front of your face it can be handled, but also having the other pieces in place looking down the line to see what might be coming and then making a plan for that. So sometimes I like to call it building the plane while you&#8217;re flying it, but that&#8217;s a lot of what my days are like.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. I mean, I can imagine that&#8217;s a lot to sort of juggle even with not that many reports. I mean, it sort of trickles down because of how large your organization is.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, and there&#8217;s so many different stakeholders that you have to take into account. So a lot of times, I&#8217;ll try to make sure I&#8217;m having temperature checks, even today we had our team meeting and I had just a temperatures are like, &#8220;How&#8217;s everybody feeling? Where are you frustrated? Where do you need help? Where can I be providing&#8230;&#8221; Sometimes it&#8217;s kind of like the player-coach idea even. Sometimes it&#8217;s like, all right, I need to stop looking so high level, jump down in the weeds with the rest of the team and just knock some things out. Sometimes it&#8217;s like, okay, let me take a step back, see what&#8217;s on the horizon, help set up a plan, put pieces together. Sometimes it&#8217;s working with other leaders throughout the organization, just kind of understand where their concerns are, where their focus is, and then help set a plan for, okay, this is how we&#8217;re going to kind of help support you. There&#8217;s definitely a lot to juggle.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;ve said you&#8217;ve only been there since September. So you started fairly recently. I bring that up because there was an incident last year that happened that sort of brought you into this new role. Can you talk about what happened?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, so it was a really interesting thing that happened. I was working for a publishing company, and when the pandemic hit, like I mentioned, there was another job opportunity that kind of got nuked because of the pandemic. At the time, I&#8217;d grown a little bit leery of some of the practices, just the way the organization was treating people. As I kind of set and watched again, really had to do that introspection of who am, I would do I believe in, I started noticing that&#8230; We were publishing a site, it was a financial publishing firm, and we had a new site that if you imagine who your common financial investor type might be who has a lot of money and is trying to figure out ways to make more money, you can probably imagine they&#8217;re a little more conservative, a little more right leaning. I&#8217;m someone who believes that, hey, people can have their voice as long as you&#8217;re not challenging anyone or my humanity, then you get to have your views.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
We had a site that I&#8217;d kind of build a strategy around that was geared a little bit more to write conservative views. I noticed that over the time it was getting a little bit more&#8230; The editors were getting a little bit more sensationalist, which was something that I told them ethically I didn&#8217;t agree with early on. As I kind of watched the pandemic unfold and I started watching the conversations around it, and there was this long thread in April into may about the adverse and disproportionate effects of the pandemic on black people, brown people and underrepresented groups in general, I started noticing that this news site never mentioned any of that. So I went, &#8220;Well, this is kind of strange.&#8221; There&#8217;s been a lot of conversation around this. Why wouldn&#8217;t you mention this?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I just kind of kept my eye on it and in some of our team meetings, I was planning to bring it up, but I didn&#8217;t get the opportunity because I had to miss one and some different things happened. But in missing one of those and having to skip a couple, around the time just before our next ones, the Arbery killing had happened.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I said, &#8220;Well, let me go check in and see how they&#8217;re talking about it,&#8221; and there was no mention of it. I go, &#8220;Well, this guy&#8217;s name doesn&#8217;t show up. Why wouldn&#8217;t this be&#8230; This is news. Why aren&#8217;t you talking about this?&#8221; Then around the same time, there was the first mention of the disproportionate effects of the pandemic was labeled as people are getting worse effected in blue states than red states. I go, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a really disgusting way to talk about people, talk about humans and kind of not talk about the&#8230; I&#8217;m going to talk about the race disparity and the systematic racism that provides the reason for some of this, but you can talk about blue versus red as a way to dehumanize.&#8221; So Ahmaud Arbery happened. Then there was the, what was it, Amy Cooper situation that happened with the woman calling-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, in Central Park, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Cooper situation that happened with those [crosstalk 00:23:02].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. In Central Park? Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Right. So that happened. We had Brianna Taylor started to get brought up and no words about any of these and I&#8217;m going, &#8220;There&#8217;s so many reasons to talk about this.&#8221; Then, of course, there was George Floyd and at this point, steam is coming out of my ears and I&#8217;m going, &#8220;There&#8217;s no way you missed this one, right? No way.&#8221; They never talked about it until that Friday after when there were some riots and protests got a little more violent. The first mention of it was, was the headline that said &#8220;Black man&#8217;s death while in police custody sparks riots arson and looting.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
That was when I just banged on the desk and said, &#8220;Come on, guys. This can&#8217;t be the way you&#8217;re doing it. You&#8217;re leaving me no option here.&#8221; So, in one of our next team meetings, the next week, I asked them and I just brought it up, straight up and explained it the way I just explained it to you and said, &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s wrong here?&#8221; First, got a lot of mealy-mouth responses of like, &#8220;Oh, well we just didn&#8217;t know how to explain it and so many of our readers are racist and we don&#8217;t want our advertisers to think that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. So at that point, my heels were dug in and I&#8217;m a pretty stubborn person when I want to be, so I was just like, &#8220;We&#8217;re having this conversation.&#8221; Our organization was rather small. I was one of only two Black people and the other Black person in the organization, she spoke up and said, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ve actually noticed this too and I&#8217;m uncomfortable with it.&#8221; There was a lot of dismissing of the ideas, going, &#8220;Oh, you just don&#8217;t get it. You don&#8217;t understand. Oh, well, who cares? This isn&#8217;t a big deal. You&#8217;re just angry. You&#8217;re just this, that and the other.&#8221; Never was there a moment where somebody said, &#8220;Hey, how about you help us here? How can we fill these blind spots?&#8221; I&#8217;m going, &#8220;You&#8217;re clearly just not valuing the voices.&#8221; So, like I said, that was of that moment where I really had to look at myself and I said, &#8220;Well, I make these websites. I&#8217;m the catalyst that makes this whole thing go.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I said, &#8220;One more minute of time to this organization is supporting this kind of White supremacist culture and racist, if you&#8217;re not overtly racist, you&#8217;re aiding and abetting racists within your readership and you&#8217;re making a comfortable space for them. So I said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do that.&#8221; So the next day I just said, &#8220;I&#8217;m out. I can&#8217;t do it anymore. Effective immediately, I&#8217;m gone,&#8221; and this was beginning of June. So, unfortunately, like I said, there were some things that happened from a just personal/moral standing that made me a little bit questionable about them. So, unfortunately, I was saving as much money as I could and I had enough in the nest to cushion myself for a little while, but yeah, it was definitely a crazy moment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, props to you for not only standing up in that situation, but also being able to walk away from it, especially, during such a unpredictable time. You definitely upgraded, so that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Thank you. Again, it was a scary moment, but the thing is it really also brought to mind for me was it made me really sad because this was an organization that even though I was part of one of the smaller divisions, it was a actually, rather big organization, about 1600 employees in the Baltimore area. They have multiple divisions and a lot of different things that are happening and it just made me sad for the people who didn&#8217;t have that choice, who didn&#8217;t have the cushion or the opportunity, the privilege, to say, &#8220;I can step back on my laurels,&#8221; and they kind of had the grinning bear it.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I thought about all of the Black and Brown, LGBTQ people and all of these different things, women who just have to deal with many of the sexist views that are getting put out there, because you got to survive and it&#8217;s like, I can&#8217;t blame you, but it just really made me kind of sad that people, we still have to deal with that type of thing. I hate to say, we still have to, because I feel like that&#8217;s such a cliche thing to say, but yeah, it just made me really sad that that was a thing that I had to fight over and then leave a job over. It couldn&#8217;t have been a situation where they say, &#8220;Huh, you know what? Let us at least reflect. Let us be honest about it. Let us be open about it.&#8221; It was more of like, &#8220;Eh, too bad, so sad.&#8221; I was even told, &#8220;We work for the mob, get over it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Well, I guess, in a way, that is sort of honest. They&#8217;re not covering it up with a black square on Instagram or anything. They&#8217;re just letting you know right out, flat out. Wow. Let&#8217;s turn the page from that. Now, I know you grew up here in Atlanta, so tell me, what it was like for you growing up here and being exposed to art and design and everything?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I moved from Baltimore when I was about nine or 10 and came to Atlanta. Atlanta was a culture shock for me. Baltimore has this reputation or this nickname of Smalltimore. You have a lot of small little communities and you can interact with a lot of different cultures and a lot of different environments and I really loved a lot of that with within Baltimore. Even though Baltimore has kind of a racist history with a number of things that happened and I think I had rather diverse group of friends I remember as a kid and classmates and different things like that. Coming into Atlanta, it was one of those things where you really saw the way things were separated. We moved just before the Olympics came, so it was &#8217;91, &#8217;92 and there was still the conversation of like the Techwood community in Atlanta getting, basically, a really heavy conversation around gentrification where they moved a whole group of people to make way for the Olympic village. They wanted to, basically, get rid of the undesirables and my family was in community activism.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
My dad was a musician, but also a very active in Black rights and just speaking up for people. If you are familiar with Hosea Williams, Hosea Williams was like my grandfather. I really look at him in that light. We always were doing Hosea&#8217;s Feed the Hungry, Feed the Homeless. We were always doing different things around that and spent a lot of time around him and with him my dad worked with Curtis Mayfield, so I spent some time [crosstalk 00:29:46] with him. So it was an interesting thing to come in and be in this environment where I didn&#8217;t talk like the other other Black kids. I didn&#8217;t have the same type of accent. I didn&#8217;t have all of those types of beings. So it was also interesting because I also had to deal a lot with identity in terms of how people perceived me. A lot of Black kids going, &#8220;Oh, why don&#8217;t you talk so White?&#8217; I was just like, &#8220;&#8221;No, this is how I talk. This is just me. I&#8217;m not trying to be anything. I have zero interest in being anything other than myself, but this is just how I talk.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Having to go to a school in Sandy Springs, in fact, and deal with overtly racist, attitudes and being called the N-word in class and the kid basically getting sent to the principal for a little bit and coming right back with no extra conversation about it. When my dad had asked the principal why there was no further conversation, he just says, &#8220;Ah, Black kids, you got to punish. White kids, you just give them a look and they&#8217;re good.&#8221; So there were so many little things and even just the idea of not getting that opportunity to be recognized for my abilities, having a teacher who I felt like I clashed a lot with, I didn&#8217;t respond to really. Yeah, I really didn&#8217;t have any response to the point where I was missing work and doing all those things, to having a new teacher come in, a substitute, for a little while who really said, &#8220;Oh, actually you&#8217;re pretty good at math. Why are you doing this math class? Why are you doing the remedial math when you should actually be doing advanced math?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Then going, &#8220;Oh, he actually does know something,&#8221; and just those feelings of being ostracized in so many spaces which really led me to being homeschooled. While that was a challenge, it was difficult adjusting to that. I was, what, 10, 11, going, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t have to go to school today? I guess I can just hang out and watch cartoons now, right?&#8221; To having to learn, &#8220;Oh, wait, I got to go and get it on my own. I got to figure this out,&#8221; and that was actually how I got into design. I was a tinkerer. I like to call myself a hacker, in that sense, in the sense of being a tinkerer. I like to take apart electronics and try and put them back together to see if I can get them working again. I like to just mess with things and see what I could figure out about it, see what the underpinnings of things were.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I get an old computer from a thrift store and take it apart and see if I can get it working again. But I was also really interested in journalism. Probably when I was about 14 or 15, I was super into sports in general, but I was really heavily into it then and especially basketball. I wrote these five or six, maybe more, articles of just original content for myself and I designed it in Microsoft Publisher at the time, just on my family&#8217;s a old computer and was really proud of it, printed it out as this newsletter. My dad wanted to share it with everybody and I wanted to print out a new copy of it after he had given all of them away. When I went to open it, the file corrupted and I lost all of my work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, and again, being very service-oriented, the first thing I said to myself was, &#8220;Never, again. I&#8217;m going to figure out how to not have this happen ever again.&#8221; So it really just sent me down this rabbit hole of everything I could learn about computers at that point. I started reading every little thing I could about the inner workings of computers and then it just kind of bubbled up. At that point it was the early stages of the web, really, and I was getting online and I think there was an opportunity. GeoCities was a thing and it was like, &#8220;Well, you can create your own website.&#8221; So I said, &#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll do that,&#8221; and started messing around with it, but the little Wizywig system and it wasn&#8217;t really anything to me and it was very limited. So I said, &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s this Advance tab?&#8221; And it just gave me a blank screen.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I went, &#8220;Well, this is cool. This is kind of what I&#8217;m looking at. This It&#8217;s an opportunity.&#8221; So I started learning HTML and code and just absorbing everything I could, picking up every book. My dad always taught me, &#8220;If you can read it, you can learn it.&#8221; So I was just like, &#8220;Well, let me go and learn everything I can about web design now and coding, HTML and CSS and Java and JavaScript, XML, and all of these different things and what does this do?&#8221; I ended up building some websites and I was like, &#8220;Well, this should probably look good. This is not enough, just HTML and at the time, CSS was barely a speck. So I was like, &#8220;Well, let me learn everything. Let me figure out how to make it look good.&#8221; My mom was really a catalyst for me. She worked at Kinko&#8217;s and this is Kinko&#8217;s still had a computer services department, so I would get in really good with the computer services guys. A lot of them were nerds. They loved computers, so they loved that I liked tinkering with stuff.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So they would show me little tricks and ways of working in the command line and then the more design-oriented guys were like, &#8220;Let me show you this program. We call it Photoshop.&#8221; I started learning how to make things in Photoshop. They had CDs on Illustrator and Photoshop training. So I would just sit and absorb everything I could from that and really just taught myself Photoshop and Illustrator. It went from there. I learned everything I could about everything computers and I thought learning Photoshop, maybe a designer, I&#8217;d learn it the hard way. That was not the case.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
When I realized I didn&#8217;t know what DPI or PPI was and I was trying to print something and it kept coming out really small and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;But on my screen, it&#8217;s so big. It was like, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s because the resolution is off.&#8221; But that really pushed me down this line. I was also a huge lover of Apple and that was really where I found my love of branding. It was seeing something that connected with me where it wasn&#8217;t just this rote memory. It was about a connection and it was about something that made me feel like I had value. I had somebody talking to me and when they were talking to the weird ones and I really got into learning everything I could about Apple, again, immersing myself in that. We talked a little bit about the Art Institute of Atlanta and there was a center right across from that in Northside where there&#8217;s this office building and it had an Apple logo on it.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
It had this Apple Market Center and they did free seminars and so I just started going to those. I&#8217;m 15, 16 years old. I&#8217;d go to the Art Institute with my sister. She&#8217;s seven years older than me and so I&#8217;d go to the school with her and I walk over to the Apple Market Center and hang out with these business owners and learn as much as I could about new software and new products and I started learning all of that. Then I&#8217;d go over to the school and I&#8217;d get in really good with the tech guys and help them rebuild the networks and they&#8217;d let me use the computers. I&#8217;d sit in classes and nobody knew I wasn&#8217;t a student, so that was my way of stealing my education for a little bit. So it was this really unorthodox path that I took and I can keep going on and on, but I&#8217;ve told you more than you need to know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But back in the day, that&#8217;s how you had to learn it. There weren&#8217;t really university programs or things like that. You kind of picked up a little bit from a book or you reverse engineered something by viewing source or you picked things up here and there and that cobbled together into how you learned how to use the web and build the web back then. I remember those times very vividly.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
It definitely was a lot about, again, that hacker mentality, like taking it apart and deconstructing it and trying to rebuild it, seeing if you took this one piece and put it over here, what would happen and what&#8217;s the response you&#8217;d get? I think that was what I really loved about a lot of the design and what I still love about design as part of that, some of the user experience stuff is, I like to call it &#8216;the science of art,&#8217; in a lot of ways. It&#8217;s like that you take a hypothesis and you iterate off of it, you test it, see what happens and you adjust your test and see what reaction you get from that and I just love those types of things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm, nice. Now you attended Full Sail University, but before that, you mentioned this Apple training center, but you actually got your first job at Apple. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. My first job was at Apple. I was 18. I opened the Apple store at Lenox Square Mall, in fact. I probably borderline, stalker energy in that time, but I was so infatuated with Steve Jobs. He was someone who, when you saw the way he talked with so much passion and I just saw the vision that he brought to things and, again, that experience. It was something that just resonated with me and then I just read so much about his story and his struggles. He was someone that I saw as maybe a person that I could emulate, in some ways, or even just someone that I could have. I felt like if he could do it, I could do it. Obviously, it wasn&#8217;t like he was like super poor, but he also went through a lot of hardship in life.</p>

He had to go through a lot to get to where he was. He got kicked out of Apple early on and had to go through this whole journey and he had this triumph that came back to Apple, because I was always just inspired by him as a person in his story. I read so much on, again, the growth and birth of Silicon Valley, which also included him in those stories. I remember where I mentioned the bordering stalker energy was like, &#8220;I want to reach out to him. I want to make contact with him. I got to send him an email.&#8221; So I searched everywhere to see if I could find his email. What was it? Think I was going to the Apple Market Center. I met a few Apple employees and someone had given me their card and I realized the naming convention for their email addresses. So I was like, &#8220;Well, if this is how your email is patterned, maybe his email is patterned the same way.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I sent an email to Sjobs@apple. I think the first time just emailed and said, &#8220;Hey, is this a person?&#8217; I got no response and then I sent another email and I said, &#8220;Hey, look, if this is actually Steve Jobs, I just want to thank you because I&#8217;m a homeschool kid and the work and creative in education has really inspired me. It&#8217;s helped me find what I want to do in life. I didn&#8217;t know where I was going and now I feel like I have had this path. So I&#8217;m really appreciative of what you&#8217;ve done with the company and the focus you brought, because it&#8217;s really helped give me a direction.&#8221; So, and I was, like I said, 15 or 16 at the time and he responded. He said, &#8220;Thanks,&#8221; and that was all he said.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, for me, it was like a ping. It was like [crosstalk 00:41:24] So I said, &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s someone there.&#8221; So then I just went off and then this was when they were working on the Mac OS X.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh my gosh.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I was following all of the development of Mac OS X and I emailed him and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hey Steve, this would be a great feature to include in Mac OS X.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
This was a wild story. I&#8217;m sorry, I just have to interject. Keep going, Keep going, though, keep going.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I would send him little emails and I&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Hey, what about this feature? What if you added spring loaded folders to this thing?&#8221; I just started giving them all these ideas. He would never respond, but every now and then I would see one of those ideas pop up in a build and I&#8217;d like to take credit for it, but it was when they had announced that they were opening Apple stores and I was super excited for it. I was about 17 and I said, &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s surely going to be a store announced for Atlanta. Why wouldn&#8217;t there be?&#8221; When they announced the first 10, 11 stores, they had all of these stores, LA, Washington, DC, so on and so forth, but none on the roadmap for Atlanta. So I sent him this really angry email and I said, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m really disappointed that Apple does not have a plan for a store in Atlanta. If you&#8217;re saying that your goal for Apple is to double your market share, because at the time Apple was what, two-and-a-half percent market share and you want to double it from two-and-a-half to 5%?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
The fact that you don&#8217;t have Atlanta on your list of stores means that you&#8217;re not that serious about this idea because Atlanta has a huge creative community. It&#8217;s got one of the busiest airports in the country, in the world, if anything, a huge tourist community, a huge creative community, all of the markets and verticals that are within Apple&#8217;s range of market. So for you not to have a store on the pipeline here means that you must not be that serious and especially as someone who really loves these computers, I just want to have some access to them. So I hope that you all change your course and you decide to open a store in Atlanta. So a few hours go by and I get an email from a recruiter and she says, Dear Joseph, Mr. Jobs forwarded your email over to me. Please send your resume and cover letter at your earliest convenience. Again, I&#8217;m a 17-year-old kid and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;A who? A resume and a what?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I went and had to develop that really quickly and sent an email. At this time they actually didn&#8217;t even have a store on the pipeline. Again, that stalker energy, one of the ways you would know where Apple&#8217;s roadmap was, is you would look at their jobs page and they would put out, &#8220;We&#8217;re looking for employees in this place,&#8221; and people would go, &#8220;Oh, that must be a store.&#8221; So there was no openings in Atlanta for anything like that. Then, probably about six months later there was a thing where they had openings for a store or they had employee calls in Atlanta I was reaching out to the recruiter and she reached out and she was like, &#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s going to be slow, but we got your information.&#8221; I think she was just kind of being like, &#8220;Cool out, kid,&#8221; but yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So next thing I know I was getting a call and interviewing with the recruiter at 17 and just about to turn 18. The next thing I know in April of 2002, I was going into the training as the one of only two full-time Mac specialists to open the Apple store at Lenox Square Mall in come I think May, or I think it was about May was when we opened the store and it was all thanks to sending an email to Steve jobs. I was actually kind of sad when he died, just for obvious reasons, but a week prior, I had thought about him. I looked at where I had gone from that point and I said, &#8220;I should email him and say, &#8216;Hey, you probably didn&#8217;t think anything of sending this email over. You probably thought you were just getting me out of your hair, but you really kind of changed a lot for me.'&#8221; So, but yeah, that&#8217;s the Apple story.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
And that was from your first job? Wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Actually, outside of working as a dishwasher in a [crosstalk 00:45:42] restaurant as under the table [crosstalk 00:45:46] my dad, I was 14, but yes, my first legitimate job.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
That is quite a story. Wow. The fact that he even responded back and was forwarding your emails and everything, it just goes to show you, you have to be persistent. Nowadays, I guess that would be a bit stalkery, but-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; days, I guess that kind of would be a bit stalkery, but back then I don&#8217;t know how many people were really using email in that way, like they are now. But wow. That&#8217;s something.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. Again, it goes back to the idea of what I like to call a stealing shots. And sometimes you just got to find that sliver of opportunity and shoot and you might make it, you might miss it, but you got to shoot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So while you were at Apple, is that when you started going to full sale or was it after?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
No, it was actually, well after that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I branded myself as an anti-traditionalist for a long time. I think it was the homeschool [inaudible 00:46:43] and at the time of being homeschooled&#8230; This was before homeschooling got, I guess you could say popular. At the time people didn&#8217;t think&#8230; I would tell them I was homeschooled and they just were like, &#8220;Oh, so you&#8217;re just dumb,&#8221; or whatever. And so there was a lot of stigma around it and I was always like, okay, I&#8217;m going to buck the trend. I tend to try and buck trends. And so I started working at Apple and I was like, well, I&#8217;ve learned all of this stuff. I used to read business books, I used to do this, that and the other. I was like, &#8220;Well, I could figure it out. I&#8217;ll do it on my own.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I just kind of kept trying to do it, I guess you could say the hard way, but it was also cool. You know what I mean? I had an opportunity just from the knowledge and the, I guess the value that I&#8217;d shown even at Apple and things like that. I taught at The Creative Circus in Atlanta, taught some design classes and so forth. I didn&#8217;t even have a degree really. So I just kind of did my own thing for a really long time. And it wasn&#8217;t until 2012 that I attended full sail. And it was really era in which after the great recession, I worked at a newspaper prior. And at the time I started up a small clothing company with some friends, and we ran that for about seven years, from 2007 to 2014.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
But in around 2008, 2009, I had gotten laid off from a job at a newspaper in the ad department because it was a newspaper. So I lost that job. And it was also again around the economic downturn. And so I was this guy who felt confident in my abilities. I felt like, hey, I can figure anything out. You can put anything in front of me and I will tackle it and I will figure it out. But I was now this guy without a degree in environment where there were people who had 10 years experience and a degree, and they had all of this stuff behind them and they were also in the market.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
And so I just kind of found it where I was really struggling to get a lot of opportunities or get a lot of second looks. And I&#8217;d also had a little bit of a chip on my shoulder or a complex even about again. Then you hear a lot of the way people, again, talk bad about being homeschooled. I didn&#8217;t have formal training. I didn&#8217;t have all this. So part of me was like, well, can I do it? Can I figure it out? If I&#8217;m tested, how will I respond? And do I have the foundation?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You kind of felt like you had something to prove in a way to yourself.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. I needed to prove it to myself more than anything that I could just follow through with something and finish it. And so, yeah, I entered into full sales, online graphic design program and had done that from 2012 and then graduated in 2015.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How was the program? I know that as a, I think as a for-profit school full sale kind of tends to get left out of conversations when people talk about design slash art schools to go to, to really sort of get into the industry. But I mean full sale places a lot of people in the creative fields.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. Full sale was interesting for me. And I think that you do see some of that for-profit mentality come in where there is a bit of a what some people might call a degree factory mindset that is there in the sense that, hey, if you are willing to give them your money, they will take it. But if you are willing to hold them accountable for taking your money, you will also get a lot of value out of that. And for me, it was one of those things where again, I was doing the online program and I think that I succeeded because I&#8217;d already had this scrappy mentality. I was already used to figuring things out and going and finding my way. And so when I went to school, it was also, I was always kind of like against the idea of student loans and all of that, especially where I had seen people who had been saddled with all this debt and didn&#8217;t know what they were doing in life, or didn&#8217;t know, had felt like they wasted their time.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I was like, I&#8217;m not wasting my time. If I&#8217;m paying for this, I&#8217;m getting my money&#8217;s worth. And so I kind of went in with this attitude that like, I&#8217;m paying you are going to give me the same treatment you give your students in person. And I think for people who have gone there in person, they got a great experience. I saw a lot of people who went there online and they didn&#8217;t have that mentality, or they didn&#8217;t know how to go out and just dig and be scrappy for what they want it. And they kind of just fell through. Some of them fell off. Some of them were ending their school in some ways graduating and I&#8217;m looking at it going, oh, that work is not that great.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
But like I said, that was the degree factory of it. But like I said, I went in and I had a goal. I knew what I wanted out of it and I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to kind of make you teach me and do what I need you to do because I&#8217;m paying you this money.&#8221; And actually I had some great interactions with teachers. I learned a lot, I got a lot out of it, but I think it&#8217;s really all about what you make it. And I think it was, but I think that&#8217;s with any school, right. It&#8217;s what you make it. And I think they were good for what I wanted to get out of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting how&#8230; I think school in general can be like that, but particularly those for-profit schools so for graduate school, I went to a for-profit university and then later also taught at the for-profit university. I went to Keller Graduate School of Management and taught at the [inaudible 00:52:23]. And it&#8217;s interesting I think one sort of the perception of course, that people have about for-profit universities and what that means about the value of the education, but then to be on the other side of it and being an instructor there, I definitely get what you mean about the online students and you needing to really have that scrappy mentality to get it done because the online instructors do not care. They are, most of them are literally following a script to go through the course.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They&#8217;re teaching in a very abstract way in that most of these classes will have some type of a discussion forum. And so you may have to have a participation requirement where you speak to students three times a week, five times a week, et cetera. It&#8217;s not really the same as giving a lecture because the lecture is often times have already been made for the course. You&#8217;re just the instructor. You&#8217;re not really teaching it. I guess I might be giving away some secrets here, but like, you&#8217;re not really teaching it. You don&#8217;t even get a chance to make the tests or change the tests. When I taught design at the [inaudible 00:53:29] I was teaching design to business students. It was like a BIS course. And this was maybe 2011, 2012, something like that, I think.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I was surprised that they were still teaching students how to make webpages using tables. And I had to take it all the way up to the dean to say, you are setting students up for failure. If they take this course and they think they&#8217;re going to make webpages out of tables and get a job out in the market. And the dean was sort of like, oh, they&#8217;re business students. It doesn&#8217;t matter. I&#8217;m like it does matter. It matters that they&#8217;re paying for this and we&#8217;re deliberately teaching them old information. I really had to lobby to make it happen. And then once they said, no, I just changed it myself and started teaching more CSS and things like that. And I don&#8217;t know necessarily if the students appreciated it. I ended up getting fired. So it wasn&#8217;t necessarily probably the best thing on my end, but like at least I wanted to make sure that students were getting what they paid for in terms of proper information.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. And I think you rather get caught trying.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. And so I think [inaudible 00:54:38] good on you on that. And again, I think that was how I approached it in terms of being a student, which was I had the teacher&#8217;s email address. I had some kind of messenger option. I might&#8217;ve had, sometimes I had a phone number. So if I didn&#8217;t have the information I needed, I would have&#8230; I was always about building community. So I even built out a online, a Facebook community for some of the&#8230; Especially the students that I saw who kind of gave a damn. I said, &#8220;Hey, you seem like you&#8217;re going to be someone that I want to be connected to. Let&#8217;s have this group where we help each other.&#8221; But I saw other people who were like, oh, I can&#8217;t get this. I don&#8217;t know what to do. And I&#8217;m like, well, go ask the teacher like, &#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t talk to the teacher. I can&#8217;t find them.&#8221; Well, okay, well try something.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:55:25] figure it out. I would call the teacher. I would email them. I would message them. I would call my student advisor and say, &#8220;Hey, I need to talk to this teacher.&#8221; I would be a pain in their butt until they reached out to me because I was like this is&#8230; If I were in campus, I would be able to walk up to you and talk to you. But since I can&#8217;t do it, this is what we have to do now. So either take me seriously or I will make you take me seriously.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
For me, I would have loved if you would have been that kind of student because I can tell you, we get all the instructor in you never hear from the students, ever, unless it&#8217;s them trying to weasel their way out of some excuse or if they got caught, I would catch so many students plagiarizing stuff, which you would think would not be that common in a course about web design, but like they would take tests and some of the tests would have essay questions. And it&#8217;s like, you can tell they just copied and pasted this from some companies about page because the response makes no sense in relation to the question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s like I don&#8217;t even have to run this through Turnitin to know that you didn&#8217;t write this. Where are you getting this from? So the fact that you were that proactive as a student, I hope that your professors and instructors appreciated that because I can tell you from the other side, I would have loved that. It would kill me to see students not do well. And I could tell them come see me during office hours. Let me know if you have any questions and I&#8217;m blue in the face and they do nothing and then fail the course. And then they want to get mad at me and leave me a two-star review. [crosstalk 00:56:58]. It&#8217;s wild. So yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I think that one of the things that I learned there probably more than anything was it was one of those things where I look back at it and so I was valedictorian of my class and things like that. And I kind of looked at that with a little bit of like, eh, who cares? It&#8217;s about the work, as a designer is about the work. And I remember when I first started maybe my first couple quarters, I was doing the work that I knew would get me a passing grade. I&#8217;m a competitive person. I want to do the best, I want to be the best, I don&#8217;t like losing, those types of things. And so there was this moment when I first started, again, I knew Photoshop illustrated all those tools, like the back of my hand.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So we would get projects. I understood the coursework. So I would do it well enough to get an A, but I didn&#8217;t necessarily come out of it learning anything. And I remember toward the end of maybe my second quarter or so, I had to kind of look at myself and I said, you&#8217;re about to pay a lot of money to basically learn the same things you already know, is that really worth it? So I said, okay, so now my new model went because again that competitive aspect of me was like I want to be valedictorian. And they also had this, forget what the award was, but it was like you had the best quality of work. And I was like, I wanted both of those. And so I was like really trying to aim for that. And I was like, but you know what really, I want to learn as much as I can out of this.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I adopted this mentality where [inaudible 00:58:34] I&#8217;m going to try and fail. I was like, I&#8217;m going to do things that are so far out of my comfort zone. I&#8217;m going to go way off of what I know and what I know how to do well. And if I get a good grade awesome. But if I fail, I at least learn. And I kind of went at it with that approach. I ended up getting even better grades and coming out with more fulfilling work and ended up getting both the awards that I was kind of put on&#8230; That I was trying to cheat my way to in a way but also kind of gave me that idea of&#8230; I think prior to that, I was doing a lot of things in a safe manner. And I was trying to just, in some ways in a survival mode. I had been in such a survival mode all my life, where I just wanted to do enough to make sure I could go to sleep somewhere and wake up somewhere and eat something.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
If that&#8217;s what I got, that was good. And when I went into and embraced this idea of you know what, I have another slogan, which I don&#8217;t&#8230; Profanity, I&#8217;m not going to use it, but F S U [inaudible 00:59:36] F up is the term I like to use where it&#8217;s like, if I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing, instead of freezing, I&#8217;m just going to go in and go out in a blaze of glory. And if I fail, okay, but you&#8217;re at least going to be like, man, he did it in a way that nobody can look away from. And I found that that&#8217;s kind of paid off more than it has hurt me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve brought up here on the show before about how black designers kind of really need to have that space to fail. Especially if you&#8217;re approaching the design industry through a more, I guess you could say traditional routes, like if you went to a design school and then from there you started working at a product design company or a tech company or advertising agency or a branding agency or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The constraints are so narrow that there&#8217;s not really any space for you to fail. I wouldn&#8217;t even necessarily say fail, we&#8217;re talking about that certainly in the guise of experimentation, but like everything you do has to work, everything has to succeed. And I think while it&#8217;s great to have that track record, sort of like you were saying, you were kind of just getting by. It wasn&#8217;t until you really were able to break out of that space that you were able to do your best work and it&#8217;s rough that the industry unfortunately doesn&#8217;t really allow for those sorts of spaces. I would say mostly for black designers, but I think of designers probably across the board.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. I definitely think it&#8217;s glaring for black designers, but I think that you see that in a lot of spaces in general. Again, I&#8217;m a sports fan. I&#8217;ve noticed where black quarterbacks tend to get criticized more harshly where it&#8217;s a guy who is an average quarterback, average black quarterback will get less chances than an average white quarterback.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
And I&#8217;ve seen that. And I&#8217;ve noticed that even in professional spaces where, yeah, both as a design leader and as a, I guess for lack of a better way of putting it, a design follower where I was looking for guidance and I was looking for how to be a professional, where I was looking for mentorship and I didn&#8217;t always get it. And I&#8217;ve noticed that even in some of my peers who&#8230; There&#8217;s two sides of it. I think as a young black boy, my dad, my mom, everybody really, you tell me if you had the same experience where you kind of told like, hey, you&#8217;re black, you got one shot. They are waiting for you to mess up, don&#8217;t screw up because they&#8217;re just waiting for it because you will be the stereotype who fits the profile. Don&#8217;t fit the profile.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I had that complex, but then if we think about studies that are around how teachers, for instance, police black bodies and they enforce punishment on black children more harshly than white children. Even to my I think, my story about growing up in school and kind of being told the same thing. You see it at all these walks of life and I experienced it as, again, as a professional who wanted to do a lot of things. And I was even in one of my old companies, I was being put out there. I was the person who was really able to speak to business owners because I understood business and I could translate what design was to a business person. And I could translate what design was to a developer. And I could speak all of these languages.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
And I was one of the only people in this organization, in fact, maybe the only person who could do that in a way that was effective, but I was still getting paid like a junior designer. I was still getting&#8230; But when they would take me into these meetings they would say, here&#8217;s our senior designer, Joseph Carter-Brown, but then I was getting paid as a, as a junior designer. And when I said, hey, look, I&#8217;m barely making ends meet. And I was helping to transform how the organization approached design. They didn&#8217;t understand user experience. They weren&#8217;t thinking about design and measuring design. They were just developing and hoping design fell in afterward. And I&#8217;m saying, hey, let&#8217;s build up design [inaudible 01:03:40] helping the company win awards and doing all these things. But I&#8217;m still getting paid as a junior designer.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
And it was one of the lower paid designers there. And when I spoke up and said, &#8220;Hey, I would like some, I would like you to give me a challenge to be who I believe I can be.&#8221; It was like, &#8220;Oh, well, remember this one moment where you slipped up. Yeah. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re not going to help you out here.&#8221; Yeah or be like, hey, we need you to jump this hurdle. And then I&#8217;m the type of person where you tell me something once and I&#8217;m going to do it and you don&#8217;t have to tell me again. So I was like, you gave me a hurdle. I&#8217;m going to jump in there. I&#8217;m going to clear it every time. But then when I say, hey, I cleared that hurdle. They go, oh, but you didn&#8217;t clear that hurdle. And I&#8217;m like, well, you never told me that was a hurdle.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
And it was like the moving of the goalpost and all of these little bangs. So I felt that. And then when I went into a design leadership space and I had a black woman who was reporting to me and I had people coming and going, oh, well, she&#8217;s not doing what she needs to do. And she&#8217;s screwing up here, she messed this up and she messed that up and I&#8217;m going&#8230; And I&#8217;m having conversations with her saying, hey, I&#8217;m hearing these things and she&#8217;s going, nobody told me about this. I didn&#8217;t know I messed that up. I thought everything was okay. And I&#8217;m going, oh, well, who&#8217;s providing you mentorship. And it&#8217;s no one. And I&#8217;m going to them like, well, you guys can&#8217;t expect her to be doing things perfectly if you&#8217;re not showing her how to be there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m trying to work with these people and I&#8217;ve seen it where I&#8217;ve seen other black reports under me coming in and having this fear of pushing themselves or pushing forward and they&#8217;re asking, well&#8230; Before they move, they&#8217;re going, am I getting it right? And then it&#8217;s just like, no, just go. You just need to go and run and if you slip, cool, just get back up and keep moving. But it&#8217;s so heightened and there&#8217;s such a magnification of like, do not screw up that it feels like you can&#8217;t even&#8230; It&#8217;s like that in every creative space. We&#8217;re all creatives, I think.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
But I definitely think for black people is you have this&#8230; You&#8217;re dealing with this history of if you screw up, everybody&#8217;s going to say, yeah, that&#8217;s what we expected. And if you screw up&#8230; It&#8217;s kind of like the saying, where&#8217;s what working twice as hard to get half as far. I like to say that we have twice the expectation in half the time. And I think that&#8217;s one of the key things that I see is like we expect like black designers, black creatives to be twice as good in half the time or else it&#8217;s a negative mark on your character in your professionalism.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You spoke a word there. Wow. Knowing all of this, this is probably an obvious question, but what do you do to make sure that that&#8217;s fostered that feeling of experimentation and such, or I would say even the space to make mistakes in that way is fostered on your teams.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I try to speak to it. I&#8217;m someone that&#8230; I like to say that I have a bit of black privilege and I used to joke to a buddy of mine. I&#8217;d be like you don&#8217;t realize how many spaces you&#8217;ll get access to when you&#8217;re a black person who who speaks proper. I&#8217;ve met so many racist white who think that they can speak to me in certain ways or they can say things they think that I agree with them because of the way I taught. But it also gives you this ability to kind of, to speak truth to power in a way that you don&#8217;t always see room for. So I just tend to speak to it. And I think one of the great things about Stanley Black and Decker actually is when I joined there&#8230; Because of my experience with my last company, I asked them about how they talk about equity and inclusion and to their credit for a hundred plus year old organization, they have a lot of conversations about this.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
They encourage these hard conversations. So one of the first things I did with my team was I got us all together. And my team is made up of black, white, queer, men, women, so forth. And I brought them all. And I had even the person that I report to in this meeting. And I said, let&#8217;s talk about what your identity means to you. What pain points, what do you bring? What baggage do you bring with you? How do you perceive yourself in this space? And I try to have those hard conversations. I talk to different people and I would say, hey, again, I speak straight to it. As a black man sometimes I freak out. If I have a mishap, I give myself a hard time and it scares me because this is the baggage I&#8217;m bringing with me.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
And so I say, hey, I need you to make some room and I need you to let me know where failure is on your scale and what room I have for failure. And I relay that over to my team and I say, hey, fail, fail fast, get up, make a plan and keep moving. And I try to encourage that and I even take one of the [inaudible 01:08:26] on my team, who&#8217;s a black man. And I&#8217;ve had this direct conversation with him. And I said, look man, I deal with this in a different way than you do. But we know what this experience is like. And in any way I can provide that psychological security, I want to at least provide that so that you can grow to be your best self and not trying to be who you think everybody else wants you to be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Wow. I noticed kind of from just what you&#8217;re talking about here, we skipped the little bits because I want to focus on this shift because we talked about your time at full sale. Of course, we&#8217;ve talked about the work&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; shift, because we talked about your time at Full Sail. Of course, we&#8217;ve talked about the work you&#8217;re doing at Stanley Black &#038; Decker. There was some time there in the middle that you were in Atlanta and then eventually, you moved back to the DMV area and you were doing a lot of graphic design work, web design work, et cetera, and you took this shift in 2016 to doing more UX. What prompted that shift?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
It was actually going to Full Sail. Like I said, I started Full Sail in 2012. At the time I was also doing a lot of freelance work. Again, I had been laid off from a company. I was also running a small clothing company by the name of Rogue Squirrel. Me and three partners were doing screen printing, and going to shows, and selling merchandise, and we were doing branding and things like that. I was the web designer, as well as the business person and all the things, like the Jamaicans in In Living Color. I was doing all [crosstalk 01:09:57].</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
When I went to school, I had to reduce a lot of things. I stopped doing freelance for a while to focus on school. I worked part-time at a few different places. I always approached everything like everything was design. In fact, the talk I did at the AIGA Design Conference was called, It&#8217;s Just Fricking Design. It was about how design in all of these areas are basically the same. But when I was at Full Sail, like I said, I stopped doing a lot of web work and freelance work to focus on school. Around the time I was getting close to graduating, I started to get back into the flow of things and doing web work and so forth. It was around that time that there was a whole lot of conversation, a lot of, you saw the word or the term UX being put around.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I said, &#8220;Well, I guess I need to go learn UX coding now. I guess I got to go learn how to code in UX.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t know what people were talking about. I started reading about it and it was like, oh, you think about the user and you do blah, blah, blah. And I went, &#8220;That&#8217;s what I already do. That&#8217;s how I already approach design. I don&#8217;t think about this for myself. I think about it for other people. I look at why they need this thing and I try to advocate for them.&#8221; I do X, Y, Z. And so I was like, &#8220;This is basically what I&#8217;ve already done. This is already what I&#8217;m doing.&#8221; So I just kept going in that direction. It made logical sense to me that that was just the route that you went in design, because it&#8217;s like, if you&#8217;re not thinking about who you&#8217;re making it for, then what are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
If you&#8217;re not talking to the business to understand what are their goals or even if it&#8217;s not a business, it&#8217;s a community organization, it&#8217;s a hospital, whatever it is, you&#8217;re not thinking about what it is, what problem they need to solve, it&#8217;s like, well, what are you doing? To me, it was just the natural thing. And as someone who was, again, a techie, a business person, a web developer, a graphic designer, I really loved the process and the logical and the puzzle of it, like detective work. Figuring out where that thread is that other people don&#8217;t see. And figuring out how to pull that out. So to me, it was like user experience, and especially some of the service design stuff, was a natural conclusion of the work I had been doing since I was a kid, really, because it blended all of the things that I was passionate about without having to&#8230; I never viewed myself as a traditional graphic designer.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not the greatest drawer. Sometimes it takes me a minute to find the idea. But if you immerse me in having empathy for the person and thinking about how I make the best thing for someone, I wouldn&#8217;t put too many people&#8217;s ideas ahead of mine. To me, that was just the natural thing. So when I had an opportunity, I was working as a developer/web designer, I said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m just going to make this what I want it to be.&#8221; Again, I just started advocating, saying, &#8220;Well, we got to think about how this measure. We got to think about the user. We got to do this.&#8221; And I just kept pushing in that direction.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. As I&#8217;m listening to your story and as you&#8217;re saying all this, of course, I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn&#8217;t mention that you&#8217;ve also done a lot of work with AIGA, specifically the Baltimore Chapter. Talk to me about how you got started with them.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I got involved in AIGA after I graduated, or around the time I graduated at Full Sail. I had always heard about AIGA as an organization. It was always like, hey, you network. You got to get out there. Again, as someone who was now about to graduate with student debt, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I need to make some money. I need to get a job.&#8221; Really, to start, it was like going into AIGA, it was like I wanted to find a job. I wanted to make some connections in the design community, because I was doing so much freelance stuff. I was living a little further out outside of Baltimore at the time. I didn&#8217;t have a lot of connections and so forth. It was just a way to get connected to the community. But when I got in there, I think, again, I&#8217;m a service person. I love helping people. I love figuring out ways to build things and create systems and so forth. It was just natural that I started getting close to the board.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
If I would show up to an event early, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;All right, well, I&#8217;ll help y&#8217;all up the tables.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to be hanging out later. I&#8217;m going to help you break down tables.&#8221; That was just how I started. It evolved into me really needing to find my identity as well as a designer. Because again, I didn&#8217;t know where I fit. Again, I wasn&#8217;t a graphic designer. I wasn&#8217;t fully a web developer. I wasn&#8217;t always the business person. I had all of these, but I had areas that I could fill in. I just wanted to find how I fit and who I was as a designer. That gave me a space to really hone my leadership skill. I&#8217;ve actually talked with people within AIGA about this a lot, that I think that sometimes they do a disservice to themselves by not embracing themselves, the organization, as a leadership incubator. Because it, more than anything, it seemed like that type of space for me, where it was like I got a chance to take all of these things and learn how to lead with the skills that I had gathered.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
It had given me a bit of, again, a bit of that experimentation space. It gave me a safe space to try things and to test things out. I got involved with the AIGA Baltimore Chapter. It was at the time, like I said, it was about an hour outside of Baltimore. It was an excuse to come back home, to be near water. I love being near water. So it was like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m going to go to the Harbor. I&#8217;m going to go visit my grandmother. I&#8217;m going to do this and I&#8217;ll go to an event.&#8221; I just kept going deeper and deeper. I started as the Programming Chair, developing events, workshops and different ways of reaching out to the community. I moved into Programming Director and then eventually Vice-President. And then President of the chapter. And really, my time there was just again, doing the thing that design did for me, which was gave me access.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I just used it as a space to provide access, because Baltimore has a huge digital divide. I was like, well, how can I provide the platform that we had to lift the voice of the people in the community and use the resources we have? Whether it was Adobe partnerships or IBM partnerships, to bring those into the community and inform people who wouldn&#8217;t normally have access to it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a really good way to think about AIGA, as a leadership incubator. That&#8217;s a good way to think about it. Different chapters in different cities are always different. Folks that have listened to this show for any length, know how I feel about the Atlanta Chapter. I always will tell people that AIGA is only as strong as its weakest chapter. Certainly there are some that do really great work in terms of outreach to the community and other types of programs and things of that nature. I think the organization, even now, it&#8217;s what? It&#8217;s over a hundred year old organization. Even now in this time where we&#8217;re so distanced in terms of being able to meet up and things like that, the organization is, I feel it&#8217;s still trying to find its way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s, of course, having missteps along the way, as I think any organization is. But I still root for AIGA. I&#8217;m not a member, as folks know. I still root for them. I want them to succeed. I want them to do well, because I do see the impact that it has in the community. And the impact that it can have on designers if they really fall into the right space.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I agree one hundred percent. I&#8217;m the same way. As much maligned as it has been over the past few years, and some people who are close to me who have had some public falling outs and so forth with it and it hurt me and saddened me to see those things happen. At the same time, I don&#8217;t know that I would be where I am without the opportunity in AIGA. I still have people within the organization and around the organization, close to the organization that I consider very good and close friends and great collaborators. It was a great space. I definitely don&#8217;t want to see it go anywhere. But I want to see it grow and really build its voice. I think that with AIGA Baltimore, the motto that I left the organization with, the chapter with was, we&#8217;re not AIGA Baltimore, we&#8217;re Baltimore&#8217;s AIGA.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
That was the way we really approached it, is like we went out into the community and we asked people what they wanted. We said, &#8220;Hey, how do we bring you what you need? How do we provide something for the city? How do we support other organizations?&#8221; And it was like we were the cheerleaders, is the way I really started to think of it. We&#8217;re this big organization. We will get the windfall of things. We don&#8217;t need to go out there trying to grub for money. People are going to come to us anyway. We will help other people, who are smaller, build their voice. We will be the platform that they build their voice on. We&#8217;ll do this. I think that idea of AIGA as this incubator space, I think it&#8217;s so stuck in like&#8230; I think there are a lot of people who want to say, &#8220;Hey, we need traditional graphic design and this to be the thing that we are.&#8221; But it&#8217;s like, we&#8217;re moving into such an era now, where it&#8217;s so much about the experience. It&#8217;s so much about the connections that you make.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
If you can be a connector, that is more of a benefit than being an artifact maker. I think AIGA, hopefully, will embrace that and figure that out and push itself as a place that has now the cachet to provide that access. Like I said, they have all of these tools and resources. Get involved in communities. Somebody once said to me at an event, and it really made me think critically about it and thus, about that access point, they were like, &#8220;It&#8217;s expensive to be a designer.&#8221; Yeah, it is! I was like, well, how can I make it a little cheaper for somebody? Because again, I had to steal every shot I had early on. I had to fricking steal zip disks sometimes and fonts and all of those things. It was all in an effort to just be something that I felt like I could be.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
There are so many kids who don&#8217;t get that opportunity. They&#8217;d never even know what the edges of the universe might be. They never explore that. And that&#8217;s going back to the idea of that experimentation space and then providing that access. If AIGA could provide that, I think how much change could they make for equity in the design community that we know we don&#8217;t have?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you want to accomplish this year? Of course, you&#8217;re at this new position that you&#8217;re working with. Now, you&#8217;re probably not as involved with AIGA Baltimore, because there&#8217;s a new president there now. But what do you want to do for this year? Is there anything on your to-do list?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. On my to-do list this year, I took a break from doing a lot of speaking engagements. I was actually really thankful that AIGA, speaking of them, reached out to me to speak at the Design Conference at the end of the year. For me, it&#8217;s about getting back out there as a bit of a thought leader, sharing my experiences and doing more workshops and helping to build more strategy, growing, just continuing to grow my skillset. But also just continue to expand the conversation around what design is and how we use it as a tool for good. The place I always go back to is, how can I use my opportunity to make opportunity for someone else? Whether it&#8217;s getting more involved in community organizations. I&#8217;m really interested in something that&#8217;s been again, stewing in my mind recently, as I get a little more time, hopefully, is to get involved in supporting opportunities to help bridge that digital divide that&#8217;s in the city.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s glaring so heavily, because of what&#8217;s out there with COVID and how it changed things. I&#8217;m thinking about a lot of those things. But ultimately, I&#8217;m just working on getting my feet fully implanted or cemented in this space, helping to really do a lot of organizational transformation within Stanley Black &#038; Decker and then continue to really broaden myself in and put myself a little more out there in that space so that I can use that to propel other voices.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, as we think even more into the future, where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
In the next five years I really want to get into helping communities build equitable spaces for themselves. I&#8217;d love to do more in the civic design space, helping to bridge communication gaps between communities and cities or states, local municipalities and businesses to help provide systems that are again, sustainable and feasible for the people and again, equitable for the people within those communities. Ultimately, that&#8217;s the thing I want to start doing. Another area for me is really diving into the mental health space, is something that I think that there&#8217;s been so much stigma around. I&#8217;m happy that I&#8217;ve pulled, I won&#8217;t say pulled back on it, but I&#8217;ve seen that there&#8217;s been a lot more conversations. So it&#8217;s made me a little more hardened that it&#8217;s not as big a thing to have to tackle completely. But I definitely have a real passion for the conversation around mental health, especially in Black and Brown communities.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I actually started a small event series within AIGA Baltimore called, Well Aware, where we started having these open and more vulnerable conversations. In fact, before COVID, that was part of my trajectory, is I was going to come back to the board and help foster that type of conversation again. I think I have a lot of different things, as you can probably tell. But I think that those two areas, helping communities build spaces that allow them to take advantage and take ownership of their own mental health and the systems that are there for them, so that they&#8217;re more equitable and in alignment with what is needed is an area that I think will be really important.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
You can find me, I&#8217;m mostly on social media more than anything lately, at abrowncreates on Instagram, as well as on Twitter. On LinkedIn, Joseph Carter-Brown. I&#8217;m always happy to connect with people. And then on my website, anthonybrowncreates.com. So those are the key places that you can find me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Joseph Carter-Brown, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. The stories that you&#8217;ve told about how you have really progressed in this industry and really put your own stamp on it, being in the game for over 20 years and all the things that you talked about, it&#8217;s so clear to me that you have a real passion for this community. Not just for design, but for the community around design. And to be able to help people to see that this can be a space that you can really grow and thrive in, I think is something that is super important and something that you definitely have been able to show through your actions, through your words and through your deeds. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Well, thank you. It&#8217;s been an honor and I really appreciate you having me on here.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start off Black History Month with some education, shall we? </p>
<p>Meet David Jon Walker, owner of the graphic design studio <a href="https://rhealistic.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Rhealistic</a>, and a design professor at Austin Peay State University in Nashville, TN. </p>
<p>Our conversation started off with a brief look back at 2020, and from there, David spoke on adapting to teaching design during this socially distant time. He also talked about growing up in Nashville, discovering design during college at Tennessee State University, and shared some of the goals he wants to accomplish this year. I&#8217;m really glad there are educators like David out there to help guide the next generation of designers!</p>
