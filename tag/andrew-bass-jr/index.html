Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>By now, you&#8217;ve gotten acquainted with design educator and design strategist Andrew Bass Jr. In the second part of our interview, we explore Andrew&#8217;s calling as a design mentor, as well as his early advocacy work for diversity in the design industry. (If you missed the first part, <a href="/andrew-bass-jr-part-1-of-2/" data-wpel-link="internal">check it out here</a>.)</p>
<p>We start off talking about Black design leadership back in the day, and Andrew tells the story of how he learned about the Organization of Black Designers and how that led to his work leading AIGA&#8217;s first Diversity and Inclusion Task Force. From there, we discuss the current state of DEI with AIGA and the design industry, and he shares what gets him excited about design now at this stage of his career. It&#8217;s really an honor and a privilege to talk with Andrew about his longevity in design and about leaving a legacy for generations to come!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You mentioned when you were at Prats that you saw you had Black design professors and stuff like that. Once you got out there as a working designer, did you see a lot of Black folks in design leadership back then?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
No. That was the unicorn. I was in the libraries. That was one of the things all through my years as a student to my beginning years as a practicing professional, I would hit all the design annuals, books to see who&#8217;s leading in the industry to kind of know names. And I kept coming across the same thing. It was always white men. It was always white men. Eventually it started opening up a little bit where you see the spattering of white women, but it was all predominantly white men. And I barely, barely ever saw anyone Black, Latino. Occasionally there may be a spot, a spot of an Asian. And again, usually it would be a guy, but it was very much pure white and that&#8217;s all I ever saw. And I was actively searching to find, okay, there&#8217;s got to be more folks out there.</p>
<p>And then eventually I did find some folks out there, not through any of the exposure through manuals. At that time there were not a lot of big design conferences. I had not heard of AIGA at that point yet. Definitely there was no HOW. There was no HOW design. And there was Communication Arts because there was a lot of design magazines out back then. Print, design, communication, arts. What was the other one?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Step.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Step was there. Yep. Step. This is a Canadian one, Applied Arts, I think it&#8217;s called. Some other stuff. And so it was not until somewhere in around &#8217;93 in print when I saw Cheryl Miller&#8217;s article on, no, about Cheryl Miller, I should say. It wasn&#8217;t her article. Or was it her article? But it was in print about where are the Black designers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
And I read that article I don&#8217;t know how many times. Right now, these names. I&#8217;m like, who&#8217;s this person? Who&#8217;s that person? Oh wow. Because I had not seen that in any the quote general mainstream stuff. And that&#8217;s when I started learning that there were folks out there, and I started digging a little bit more into history. And that&#8217;s when I learned that there were a lot more that actually existed. And back in the day, just never given any exposure due to societal, the US view on race. So growing up I never saw any of the studios that I admired ever have any person of color in their leadership. And generally ones that I did find in leadership, they usually owned their own businesses. They had their own practices. I really am hard pressed to think of any leaders at any of these Fortune 500 companies throughout the nineties to even I&#8217;d say early 2000s. Nothing pops off in the top of my head. There&#8217;s always people doing their own thing.</p>
<p>And so a few years later, I think that was around &#8217;95, &#8217;96, that&#8217;s when I discovered HOW, HOW Magazine, which I sorely still miss today. That was a fantastic design magazine. Of all the other design magazines I had saw, they actually seemed to have tried to make an effort of showcasing designers of color and somewhat kind of touching the subject of diversity in the industry, because diversity didn&#8217;t exist back then in the nineties, that wasn&#8217;t a word. Some market chair came up with diversity. &#8220;Hey, I think this is going to be a good trend.&#8221; I was basically looking at it as like, fair is fair. It&#8217;s just not white folks out here. So I didn&#8217;t really started to see leadership until around then, around &#8217;95, &#8217;96 when I started seeing that and I started seeking them out. And then I learned Cheryl Miller was here in New York City, did actually meet her face to face. I think I did a freelance project with her.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Woo. She was tough too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I believe it. I believe it. A hundred percent. A hundred percent I believe that. Without a doubt.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
She knew her stuff and I understand why she was very sort of stern, because the industry, it was a very different mentality. She had to fend for herself and stuff and she was doing some major work. I also met Cynthia Mackenzie, I believe. She has a studio in New York too. CM something, something. Oh man, I met her and I was like, oh wow, okay. And then I started meeting some others, especially like I said, my professor Dwight Johnson, he&#8217;s the one who really started giving me some opportunities where he was connected to NBC. He got me to meet some people at NBC. No, I didn&#8217;t meet any Black people at NBC, but he started putting me onto folks that are out there. And then I started learning about Archie Boston, started learning about Tony Gable, rest in peace, started learning about Richard Baker. I started learning about, oh, oh, Eli [inaudible 00:10:29].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Maurice Woods. And that was a little later in the nineties. Oh, how could I forget about the south? It was where I&#8217;ve met her, Cynthia Worley.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, here in Atlanta.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah. And then also Turner. Turner. Illustrators where I first saw them in HOW, oh, I think the name is Turner, last name is Turner. I cannot remember their first name. They&#8217;re based in Atlanta. I think they&#8217;re still around. And I started learning about more folksm and I was like, whoa, how come they don&#8217;t get shined in these magazines? I just went into overdrive to try and find as much history as I could. That&#8217;s how I started finding it about Georg Olden. I&#8217;m still stuck on his story and the total disrespect I feel that the design industry has given him completely. And still, I wonder if I hadn&#8217;t brought up Georg Olden to Ric Gref√© back then before there was Design Journeys and all that. Because I had mentioned an idea on that, and they named the Design Journeys that they honored Georg Olden, what, two years after when I was on the task force, it just dissolved and then, oh, now you decide to award Georg Olden the Medal?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m like, you&#8230; Okay. But at least he got it. I just feel like there needed to be more of an acknowledgement to it. Honestly, I&#8217;m sorry, an apology. Because I read that he also had won an art director&#8217;s medal, art director&#8217;s club medal. But I could not find any records of that. I did not see any of that leadership until I kind of found it on my own. And I like the fact that they were leaders on their own. They didn&#8217;t wait for other people because they couldn&#8217;t get certain opportunities they made their own. John Morning, that&#8217;s the other name, John Morning. And they did it for themselves. It wasn&#8217;t until honestly 21st century, early 2000s that I started seeing Black leadership. I still say it wasn&#8217;t like top tier Black leadership, I still think some of it was just, okay, not semantics, but perceptions, start putting some folks here. So I think they&#8217;re more middle leadership, not top leadership. So even today at 2022, I mean, yeah, you have a few that truly you can say top leadership, but it&#8217;s nearly not enough. So it was very, very barren in those early years that you had to find it and dig to see it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember, and I want to talk about AIGA because that&#8217;s an important part of your story, but I remember when I first started doing Revision Path, I did a lot of research leading up to wanting to start this. And I came across those older magazines you mentioned like Step and Communication Arts is still around, but HOW, and I wonder actually for HOW, because HOW was based out of Cleveland I believe, or somewhere in Ohio, the Midwest.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Somewhere over there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I wonder if that informed the perspective they had because so many of these other design publications were out of New York. And so maybe for them it was through a more New York lens. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the case, but I remember doing a lot of that research and I would see where people would write a letter to an editor at Step or something and be like, &#8220;Well where are more Black designers?&#8221; And the magazine would be like, &#8220;Oh well we don&#8217;t know where they are and we can&#8217;t find them,&#8221; and all this sort of stuff. And I&#8217;m like-</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I was one of those that wrote a letter.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was like, they&#8217;re out there. But then granted, this is also a time before the&#8230; Well, I don&#8217;t want to say necessarily before the internet, but really more before the worldwide web when where people could create these destinations for people to go to. I discovered the internet, or the worldwide web I should say in high school in the mid nineties. I was in a lot of places I probably shouldn&#8217;t have been just in terms of the fact that the Web was just such a big place. So there were things like AOL Black Voices and Africana.net and NetNoir and all those places. So there were obviously places where people were trying to create these destinations for Black people. But I don&#8217;t think those social connections really became prevalent until of course the 2000s with the advent of social media and stuff.</p>
<p>So I was doing my research to try to start Revision Path and I would see that a lot of people were asking these questions, and the editorial boards would just shrug their shoulders. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where they&#8217;re at. I don&#8217;t know where they are.&#8221; And I remember through that research also discovering, or finding out, I should say, about the organization of Black designers and how they kind of started out in the Midwest. I think it was either in Chicago or somewhere in Ohio, but starting out there and then building things out. Did you know about them back then?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Oh that&#8217;s a whole nother story.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, I did. I found out about them early nineties. Actually because I found out about them and that&#8217;s how I found out about Fo Wilson and Michele Washington. Yeah, see now these names are coming back. Michele, she&#8217;s a teacher at City Tech right now. Yeah, I know about OBD and I actually went to one of their conferences. I can talk about that after AIGA because that&#8217;s a whole nother thing. So I lose track of where we going with AIGA.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, let&#8217;s talk about that. So you mentioned Ric Gref√© who was I think a longtime executive director.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, he was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
For AIGA, and you kind of worked with them back in the mid 2000s to-</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
2016, 2017. [inaudible 00:16:38]. Yeah, actually, yeah, you&#8217;re right. Earlier.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve been a lot earlier. Yeah, because Ric, I think Ric retired or left or something.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Sorry, it was 2006, 2007, 2008.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, okay. Yeah, right around that time. Because I think Ric left I want to say in 2013, 2014, something like that. But you had worked with AIGA to not only create the diversity and inclusion task force but also serve as chair. Tell me what that was like, because if diversity was not even in the conversation with regards to the design community, how much of a uphill battle was that?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Shoot, I don&#8217;t even think we even got the first step. Honestly looking back, it was all for show. It was all for show. How that all came about was Step in Design had an article based on women in design, very good article, very interesting. I was kind of starstruck that, not starstruck, I was kind of awestruck that out of all these listing of women designers, how come there weren&#8217;t any people of color in them? I think there was one, and I think it was Lucille, and I never really know how to pronounce her name, but Tenazas, Lucille Tenazas, she&#8217;s a name in the industry, [inaudible 00:18:01]. So I believe she might be either Filipino or-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
She&#8217;s Filipino. I know who you&#8217;re talking about, Lucille Tenazas or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yes, yes. And I was like, you got one person on here. There&#8217;s a whole lot of other people out here. So I wrote a letter to Step in Design at that time just saying, &#8220;Hey, great article, cool and that, but hey, you&#8217;re kind of lacking X, Y, and Z.&#8221; And I rolled off some names that I knew of, such as Cheryl Miller, Of Wilson, Michele Washington. And just questioning, if you&#8217;re going to do a compilation like that, you really need to be a more thoughtful and full approach in doing these kind of compilations. And at the time the editor in chief there, Emily Potts, actually replied back to me via my email. I was like, ooh, I didn&#8217;t know I was going to get an actual response. And she actually struck up this conversation, I should say we struck up this conversation and she had told me she was having conversations with Bill Grant at the time who was AIGA president, right? Yeah, yeah. Board of director president.</p>
<p>And that was one of his issues. He wanted to expand AIGA&#8217;s reach, and so that it becomes more inclusive to people and stuff like that. And she told me, would I be interested in talking with him and that she&#8217;ll put me together with him. And I said, &#8220;Sure, I don&#8217;t mind talking. Talking&#8217;s free, not going to hurt nobody.&#8221; So within the span of I guess a day she got me in touch with him and he called me at home, because I think it was some sort of holiday because I know I was there with the kids because they were upstairs. I had to go in the basement because they were so loud. And we were just talking and he was telling me about his idea that he wanted to start up this task force about diversity for AIGA and would I be interested in helping out with it if I had any thoughts on it. And so I kind of told them some of my thoughts and what it is and stuff like that. That&#8217;s when the conversation started shifting to hard left that I did not anticipate, was that, &#8220;How about you serve as chair?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wait, this ain&#8217;t even a real task force yet. You want me to be chair?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, because you have your ideas and what you&#8217;re thinking with something like that. How about you lead the task force?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; Because I was kind of hesitant because I was not an official member of AIGA at this point. I&#8217;d always worked with AIGA, like some sort of ghost warrior on the end on the outside. But I never actually paid for a membership. But somehow I kept finding myself at AIGA events. And so I was like, all right, let&#8217;s talk. And he said there was a few people who are of like minds with this. And so we met, we talked, and I sincerely felt he actually wanted to do this. That he had a desire to see this happen and that to affect some sort of philosophical change within AIGA in the industry. And I was like, okay, that&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s when I first met Ric. I went to a couple of their leadership meetings out in San Francisco to talk about the task force. I mean, I should have kind of seen it then when I gave that speech, I forgot who, it was with somebody else that we were talking. I can&#8217;t remember who it was. It was a last minute addition to the leadership summit. I kind of took that some kind of way. This was like, okay, it was last minute, but you&#8217;re president. Because he was in his last year. Now, I don&#8217;t know how much pushback he might have gotten, and having the experience I&#8217;ve had now I kind of understand maybe why he was trying to push it through his last year. Because I think he really did meet a lot of resistance. And so I think he just found a way to pigeonhole it in there and stuff.</p>
<p>Our presentation was sort of last. I really can&#8217;t remember who the other person was. But the response from the leaders there, these were chapter leaders about, well, in terms of this diversity task force and chapters looking at it, what if we don&#8217;t have any people of color here? Basically let&#8217;s put it straight. What if we don&#8217;t have any Black people? And I was like, &#8220;Okay, diversity does not mean just Black people.&#8221; I explained to them diversity means a group collection of different voices. And I said, &#8220;Just because there may not be any Black folks there, Latino folks, Asian folks there, you as white folks can still talk about diversity. There is different white folks too. There&#8217;s also the gay community, this disabled community. You can talk about diversity and how you can address practitioners of design who have been left out.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can be a participant and not some sort of like, well if you need help I&#8217;ll be over here but I&#8217;m not going to do anything until you ask me. The kind of snide blow back getting from that at that time kind of told me what we were headed for. But I was like, all right, fine. This is about education. Let&#8217;s school folks. Yes, I knew some chapters, they don&#8217;t have any Black people around. They probably not even been in the same room with a Black person, let alone anybody else. So back in New York, formulating these plans with the&#8230; Well actually, no, we were doing that in San Francisco. We started burgeoning a task force. It was, oh man, I&#8217;m so bad with names. I think Jose Nito out from Boston, Tracy Woods from St. Louis. There&#8217;s a brother down south, can&#8217;t think of his name. I see his site in my head. A white lady from DC, I can&#8217;t remember her name, and somebody else.</p>
<p>We were sort of like the initial pool. And so we started trying to put up strategies, what we&#8217;re going to do, what&#8217;s going to be the tenant of the task force, what are some of the things we&#8217;re going to try and achieve? How do we talk to chapters about this? And I was assured that the New York chapter, not New York chapter, because it&#8217;s always tricky because New York chapter is the headquarters. So it&#8217;s like, we were assured that headquarters would be a hundred percent behind this. Ric said, &#8220;Yeah, we&#8217;re going to do this.&#8221; I think Emily Woods is a name. I don&#8217;t know if she was on the board or if she was from DC, but there was some board members there or staff members from headquarters that were going to help coordinate this, set up some workshops, help supplement our plans. In meetings that I had with Ric, I talked about some of my ideas and some of the research that I had, which I still have a copy of that letter, where essentially I outlined the plan of what needs to be done with diversity task force in the infancy stage.</p>
<p>Because I knew, okay, I&#8217;m not going to hit you up with everything, because we got to convince you guys just to do a little bit first, and let&#8217;s test the waters to see how serious you are about this before wasting all of our time doing this. And I basically was telling him first and foremost, you can acknowledge now the invisible designers out here, the invisible pioneers both past and present. And that&#8217;s when I mentioned the idea that became Design Journeys. My plan was for that to be a roving exhibition going from chapter to chapter to chapter like they do with other stuff. Gave them a whole list of current, at that time current because this was a 2006, current and past design professionals that they could focus on and recognize for not only just AIGA and [inaudible 00:26:05] but just to make up for the, what&#8217;s the word I&#8217;m looking for? The blind eye that they existed and then set paths for people.</p>
<p>And again I was assured, yeah, we&#8217;re going to do this, we&#8217;re going to help put this through. And so as I tried to set up, oh that was Cooper, from Cooper Design in Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, I forgot her name, her first name. As we were beginning to do and set up these programs with the assurances that Ric, the headquarters was going to be behind us, started having as we tried to put these planning meetings together more and more of this initial task force, the participation wasn&#8217;t existing. Folks, some of them checked out. There was only about three of us who were actively meeting, confirming, talking and trying to set stuff up. As they sort of slid off to the back burner, like oh we&#8217;re engaging in the conversations or attending the meetings, as we try to put plans to Ric and the headquarters team as, okay, can we set this up? They&#8217;re like, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to pass it to the board and talk about stuff and see if we can get allocations and resources.&#8221; Nothing ever happened. It was always a talk, &#8220;We&#8217;ll get back to it.&#8221; Let&#8217;s talk about this. What can we do?</p>
<p>And that went on for about a year of just, okay, we&#8217;ll get back and talk about it. And I was really getting very frustrated and pissed off about it because I&#8217;m like, okay, it&#8217;s like this has been set up to fail from get go. Headquarters is not doing anything. And then I got half this task force team that is MIA. The three of us can&#8217;t do all this stuff. And I&#8217;m not going to say the three people that were there. I&#8217;ll keep that out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh man. No, I&#8217;m kidding.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
But they were very active. And the funny thing is they were active because we all shared the same thing. We were all people of color. Those who were active members on this. With the exception of the lady from DC, the white lady from DC, I have to say she was actually very active too. So it was from a biased perspective so to speak. We had a vested interest in this happening. Did not get that same vested interest from headquarters and from some of the task force members. And so as those task force members started whittling away, tried to shift the focus on, all right, let&#8217;s just stick with the task force members that are here and try and get at least something jumped off from headquarters.</p>
<p>They tied the diversity task force into their mentoring program because it was high school art and design. Well, predominantly most of the students are Black, Latino and Asian. But I was like, but that&#8217;s already in place. I mean yeah we can kind of put that, but if you&#8217;re trying to set this as a standalone, we got to do something that puts us out first. How about we first move with, at the time I had The Invisible Designer, but it became Design Journeys. I said, &#8220;How about this exhibition? Now let&#8217;s start introducing folks to these names.&#8221; Then there was this whole thing about money, how would it be, would it be a roving thing? Who can we put together? And that&#8217;s what I learned about the bureaucracy. AIGA is ridiculous. Which I think is on purpose because they definitely can move stuff when they want to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m holding my tongue so much. But yeah, go.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I mean the biggest, I&#8217;d say two of the biggest programs that they definitely move fast was women in leadership, women in design, I forgot that. And then the voting. Oh, they&#8217;re moving heaven and earth to do that. And granted, yes, the women in leadership, great. You still didn&#8217;t focus on anybody of color in there. Still a whole lot of white people. But you can move heaven and earth for that. You can&#8217;t do it for there, where there could be potential sponsorship opportunities here, where you can get Adobe into this. You can get vendors that this is a necessary need because this broadens the industry. And quite honestly, if you just want to go business wise, increases your sponsor&#8217;s customer base. Because we all use the products that they do. We have to, this is our industry. So through all that, my time spent there was, like I said, we barely got a foot because it was all meetings and back and forth and conversations, like okay, we&#8217;re going to set this up.</p>
<p>All these emails that would have back and forth, I&#8217;m like, can we do something? And because of that inaction, basically most of the members left because they were like, &#8220;Okay, nothing&#8217;s going to happen.&#8221; And then eventually I was told, you know what, this chairpersonship should be every year, which I agree it should be every year. But I&#8217;m like, look, we haven&#8217;t even done anything yet. Because the next chairperson after that was Jose Nito, who was part of the original task force. And they still didn&#8217;t do anything. They still didn&#8217;t do anything. But then it was, what was it, in 20&#8230; When was the first design studios thing? When they got their promos and everything, they held it at AIGA headquarters. That was in 20 something? Twenty&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know when that might have been.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
2015, 2016. Maybe it was earlier than that. Maybe it was 20-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it might have been earlier than that.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Because the only thing I saw came out of it was that in 2008, a year after I just basically left and the new chairperson came on board for the D&#038;I task force, they awarded Georg Olden the medal. And I was like, all right, so you took something out of the list. And then the subsequent years I noticed they started pulling more of the names off that list, giving them AIGA medals. So I&#8217;m like, all right, cool. Now in the beginning a lot of it was the older ones, some passed, some were old. I don&#8217;t have the polite word to say, but I&#8217;m like all right. So at least you&#8217;re recognizing them, you&#8217;re still not giving a context to it. So it&#8217;s like a half assed kind of thing. It&#8217;s like, oh, let&#8217;s just do this. Because it definitely was done just to say, &#8220;Yeah, this is what we&#8217;re doing. We are recognizing diversity, we are recognizing our past invisible pioneers in the industry, and that&#8217;s all you need to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>They gave no context to it, anything like that. And then a few years later they started recognizing some living folks, which I&#8217;m like, all right, you can do a mix of living and past. It doesn&#8217;t have to be one year&#8217;s all dead, now you start going to living. But I noticed that they used quite a few of the names that was on the list that I provided. And I was like, all right, fine. At least something happened. I was like, I still think it&#8217;s for show. And then I got the bomb dropped in my mail when I got the promo card for the exhibition of Design Journeys. To say I almost felt like going down the AIGA headquarters and lightening it up. I was pissed because they created, I really thought it was just a empty shell of what it could have been. It definitely felt like a lip service. Definitely. I mean, I wasn&#8217;t doing it for any acknowledgement or anything like that, but the way they did it where it just was born out of them pissed me off to no end.</p>
<p>Still pisses me off to no end. Because every conversation I have with them is like, oh, we didn&#8217;t know you brought this to them. And I&#8217;m like, you mofos, it&#8217;s right there in black and white. Emails, letters. It&#8217;s like, yeah, yeah, okay, whatever. When I went to the thing, because they gave me it like, &#8220;Oh come down, Design Journeys, blah blah blah, this little promo.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, you didn&#8217;t even spend the money for the kind of promos you do for everything else. It&#8217;s this matte cardboard thing that looks like it came out my own printer. I was just ashamed to see that.</p>
<p>And I went down there, it was just basically a wall of some names, and I&#8217;m like, this is really not a true testament to folks&#8217; legacies and their work. I mean, you&#8217;re not even showing the full showcasing of their space, not their space, but of their actual work and what they went into. I was not a fan of it. I thought the exhibition design, I didn&#8217;t particularly like. And then they turned it into this exercise of, &#8220;What is diversity to you?&#8221; And it turned out was AIGAs membership at that time, it was still predominantly white folks coming in. I&#8217;m reading some of this stuff and I just got offended by some of the stuff that I was reading there. &#8220;Diversity is having some Black people, some white people. It&#8217;s about listening to a different perspective you don&#8217;t necessarily have.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, okay, you&#8217;re not really getting to the root of what it&#8217;s supposed to be.</p>
<p>Whiteboard exercise they had. I&#8217;m like, that means absolutely nothing. Because people are going to go in there, they&#8217;re drinking their little wine. &#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s do this because I&#8217;m down for the cause,&#8221; and then next day what cause, what are you talking about? So that incensed me. And I was just kind of done with AIGA at that point because all the conversations I had with Ric, in the beginning it started pleasant and nice but towards the end he definitely could tell my frustration. And I did start getting a bit raw, which I don&#8217;t think anyone&#8217;s ever talked to him raw before, he&#8217;s high in academia and stuff. But I was like, at that time &#8220;I&#8217;m done with this bullshit. This is crap.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;You&#8217;re not doing anything.&#8221; And then he retires, and they give him a big send off and I&#8217;m like, all right. Yeah, you did great for AIGA, but you left a huge part of your membership underwhelmed.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s how that came to be, this leadership. I never really felt like I got a chance to do anything with the task force because it was such a step. The thing is, while going through all this, I came to City Tech because I was now teaching there and I would talk to Dorothy Hayes and that&#8217;s when I bumped into her and I was like, &#8220;Hey, by the way, let me tell you about we&#8217;re doing this diversity task force for AIGA.&#8221; She was like, &#8220;Oh God.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;What do you mean oh God?&#8221; &#8220;You do know that&#8217;s not the first time they&#8217;d done that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Was like, &#8220;We tried to do that in the seventies. Me,&#8221; meaning her, Dorothy Hayes and a few others, &#8220;And we got nowhere.&#8221; She told me, &#8220;Don&#8217;t trust AIGA. They&#8217;re going to give you the runaround. They&#8217;re going to make you think they&#8217;re doing all this stuff. You&#8217;re going to do all this work and it&#8217;s going to leave you empty.&#8221; They will find an excuse why they can&#8217;t do stuff. Because she said they&#8217;re not interested, they&#8217;re really not interested. They don&#8217;t see the value in it.</p>
<p>And that I have to say came to fruition. To this day I still don&#8217;t think AIGA values what really D, E and I really means about, because at this point I&#8217;m even saying that diversity, get rid of that word. That&#8217;s becoming a trend word. It is very much about inclusion. It is more about being included in the conversation.</p>
<p>Diversity means, okay, I got a representative here, there, there, we&#8217;re good. Those representatives don&#8217;t mean nothing. It&#8217;s like you come here, you can&#8217;t say nothing, don&#8217;t be seen. Just look good. At this point it is about inclusion and equity. Giving me that same access to that power pie that you have and not the crumbs. I don&#8217;t want the crumbs, I want the pie. I don&#8217;t think they value that. I don&#8217;t think they understand the value of it or intentionally underplaying it. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>So those early years to the subsequent later time that I came back onto the task force with AIGA under a different leadership, Julie, Julie Anixter, who I actually liked, I thought she was on point because it all comes down to leadership. Because at the time it was Bill Grant who was pushing this, but his term ended. The next president came in. He had a completely different agenda and it was not about D&#038;I. No. I forgot what he was working on. And then subsequently every board president after that has not picked up the ball with diversity. Let me stop saying diversity. With inclusion and equity.</p>
<p>And then they brought in Julie. At that time, the task force leader then was Jacinda Walker.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Jacinda Walker, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
And Jacinda I had met years ago from an OBD conference, and she was pegging me all these questions about a AIGA and I was telling her, because at the time I didn&#8217;t really know why. I was like, &#8220;All right, cool. You want to know about AIGA? Let me tell you the good, bad, ugly so you making an informed decision.&#8221; And she becomes the chairperson, which Jacinda has got energy for days. Which is great. I&#8217;m not that kind of person.</p>
<p>I loved how she reinvigorated, and actually that version of the task force got more stuff done than I ever seen. And I think a lot of it had to do with Julie. They were in sync. That got more traction and things going on, which reinvigorated me, honestly. I got reinspired. I didn&#8217;t want to do anything with leadership or anything like that. I was like, look, I&#8217;ll just be in the back. I&#8217;ll be a worker. Just put me in the back. I&#8217;ll work with you. I will say that was probably the best time working with AIGA was that iteration of the task force. From, I think I rejoined 2017 till 2018, until after Julie left. That was great. There was things happening and I really felt people were committed. That actually members were committed and that Julie was committed to it.</p>
<p>Now the board is another thing. Which at this point I feel the board has more power than the actual executive director of AIGA. I did not feel the same energy from the board. So with that, as we kept going through stuff and doing things and even the offshoots emerge, which was very interesting, and actually enjoyed working with that too. It was all about emerging designers, and that definitely was a more inclusive kind of recognizing designers and stuff like that. But Julie left, AIGA has gone through a major, major transformation. Seemed like they no longer support any of these programs. I haven&#8217;t seen anything about emerge. I no longer am a member of AIGA and won&#8217;t go back as a member of AIGA because during that last part, once Julie was gone, they had the interim CEO or interim executive director.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Barry.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, Barry. Somehow they got wind, I forgot, it was the engagement director or membership director who reached out to me. Because I had posted a Medium story about my frustration with AIGA, and they reached out to me probably just to cover their ass and for prep. &#8220;Oh we didn&#8217;t know this was going on. Explain this to us.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ll talk to you. I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m talking to you. You a membership person. What are you going to do?&#8221; Come to find out after I explain all this stuff, she left three days later, she had a new job.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So that went nowhere.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
That went nowhere. And I was like, okay, you guys are really wasting my damn time and you&#8217;re going to see Brooklyn come out with that if you keep going. So at that point I was like, I&#8217;m officially done. I&#8217;m officially done. Julie&#8217;s gone. I didn&#8217;t like how that went down. Definitely could see the support being pulled from the task force, left folks questioning what&#8217;s going on. So folks started peeling back and I was like, look, I&#8217;m not going through this road again. I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m officially done. I ended my membership the end of 2018. I let it lapse, I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not doing this anymore. I&#8217;ll join somebody else. I&#8217;ll go to SPD.&#8221; From that point on, I&#8217;ve just seen AIGA sort of disintegrate when they appointed the new executive director Bennie Johnson. Yeah, Bennie Johnson.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, Bennie F. Johnson.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I was like, oh wow. They actually appointed a Black man. And I&#8217;m like, now is that for show or are they actually really serious? But I hadn&#8217;t seen anything with AIGA after that. I slowly started seeing all the initiatives being peeled away. And then to now, D, E and I task force is just a picture on the webpage. That&#8217;s it. They don&#8217;t do anything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now Benny&#8217;s no longer the executive director, which will be news by the time people listen to this. But yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I mean, what, three years, again, that&#8217;s crazy. So essentially that signals one or two things to me. That AIGA definitely may be in its death knell, or two it really is lost in what it&#8217;s trying to be. It definitely does not serve its membership anymore. Definitely doesn&#8217;t serve a segment of its membership. Even though I still keep an eye on what AIGA is doing and some of the things, the conferences, don&#8217;t get me started on AIGA in New York because they do nothing. I don&#8217;t see anything there. I will say I do see more faces of color on the speaker panels, which instinctually I&#8217;ll say when I read the bios and stuff, I&#8217;m like okay, you got folks of color here but they&#8217;re still not creative leads. They&#8217;re from other industries. If this is a design conference, show me the Black design leadership. Show me the Latino design leadership. Asian American, not Pacific Asian, basically darker skin Asians. They&#8217;re not represented. But you still have what I say, the Eastern Asian representation. That&#8217;s still there. But you don&#8217;t really have in terms of when it comes to a whole lot of brown folks up there, that it is more from some ancillary industry.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m like and that&#8217;s great, you may have some inspirational stuff, but I want to know about people in my own industry, how they&#8217;re leading, how they&#8217;re faring, how their experiences to get where they&#8217;re going. I can&#8217;t relate to somebody that&#8217;s speaking from, I don&#8217;t know, they just got a motivational speaking company, I could care less about them. Give me somebody who&#8217;s leading a top design company. I want to know the trials and tribulations with that. So to me, I still see AIGA&#8217;s doing this sort of face paint. They&#8217;re really not digging into it. I don&#8217;t even see them really digging into some of the major things that they always used to do. It&#8217;s dialed very back.</p>
<p>So I just wonder how long is AIGA going to be around, and who&#8217;s going to pick up that vacuum? Because to me it feels like there is a emptiness there of addressing this issue. Leading into OBD, which I thought would be a good variant to AIGA, they don&#8217;t do much either. Because I got aware of them both around the same time as AIGA and OBD. Because I learned about OBD back in the early nineties and I just stumbled on it. I forget how I found out about that. I think it might have been in HOW design, where they were talking about the conference that they put on OBD did in Philadelphia back in I think &#8217;93, no, I think it was maybe &#8217;96.</p>
<p>It was full blown. I mean, I saw so many design professionals that looked like me in these companies I never heard about doing this amazing work that I really thought that was going to do something, and it did nothing. It went nowhere after that. But that&#8217;s a whole of other reasons of internal fighting and the genders and what are they really after. Seemed like it was somebody&#8217;s method of supporting themselves. It was just a lot of, again, empty promises that kind of went nowhere. That didn&#8217;t really help the community at large and stuff. But it did, at least that conference showed me that I wasn&#8217;t alone, and that was just the one thing I wanted to do with AIGA so that beginning students or students coming in to design know that they&#8217;re not alone. That there&#8217;s other people out here that look like them that may have similar stories so that they can look up to and aspire to.</p>
<p>I still try to do that to this day to let people know that you&#8217;re not alone. That there are folks out here. They may not get the shine but it&#8217;s up to us to give the shine to them and stuff. But that was the experience with AIGA.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. So much of what you described just now is point by point what my experience was like being on the D&#038;I task force with AIGA, it almost felt like your hands were tied at some point. You couldn&#8217;t say anything, you couldn&#8217;t do anything. We had a large amount of members, most of them never said a word. They just weren&#8217;t out there. And it was clear that for the people that were people of color that were out there, we were sort of being elevated more as the main group to the point almost where the group was more so associated with us personally than it was with AIGA.</p>
<p>And so when people started leaving, because when I came on, which was in 2014, Antoinette Carroll was a co-chair with this woman Aidan O&#8217;Connor who worked at AIGA. Antoinette was positioning to have a full-time diversity and inclusion employee at AIGA headquarters because she was making the case that this affects everything. This affects membership, this affects other organizations, having it as the side thing along with women in design and voting and stuff, it sort of takes it off of the main plate. It doesn&#8217;t give it as much prominence as it should. I know she was lobbying for that to happen. It didn&#8217;t happen. AIGA eventually hired this diversity and inclusion fellow I think who worked with the task force for a while. This guy named Obed Figueroa, he left and then people just started dropping off the task force left and right.</p>
<p>I left in 2017, not too long after Julie left the organization. And it&#8217;s funny you mentioned Jacinda. I brought Jacinda in.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Oh okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I had met Jacinda prior to AIGA through, I had heard about the work she was doing with the Organization of Black Designers and with this studio out in Cleveland called GoMedia. They were putting together this event called Weapons of Mass Creation Fest every year. And Jacinda was on their ass about how come you all do this every year in Black ass Cleveland and ain&#8217;t no Black people there, how is that? What is that? She was getting on them about it. That&#8217;s when I first learned about her, and then she knew about the stuff I was doing with AIGA, and I was like, &#8220;Well, you should join. I feel like you can take what you&#8217;re doing on this local level and really amplify it.&#8221; This is before I knew how much they would tie our hands to do anything. Everything had to go through a particular AIGA conduit. This woman that worked there&#8230;I&#8217;ll say it, she was racist. She was racist, hands down. I&#8217;m not going to say allegedly. She was racist.</p>
<p>We would mention stuff to her. And the thing was us, the people of color on the task force, put this together. We put two and two together and I was like, wait a minute, why is she telling you one thing and telling me another thing? And she&#8217;d send us these random emails that looked like a ransom note because she would copy and paste from all these different places, and it just pissed a lot of people off because it was like we can do more individually than being part of this task force with this organization, because you won&#8217;t let us say anything through AIGA. We can&#8217;t do anything. We couldn&#8217;t even get an Instagram profile. The Design Journeys and all that stuff, we would recommend people, they would never push that stuff through. A lot of us left after that.</p>
<p>I know Jacinda was chair for a while. I know she left. And I think the only person that might still be around, because after I left, I know Douglas Davis has been on the show before, he also teaches at City Tech. He was doing stuff with them. This woman out of DC, Phim Her was doing stuff. George Garrastegui who&#8217;s in New York was doing things, and Carlos Estrada who&#8217;s out of AIGA Detroit.</p>
<p>I want to say Carlos might be the last surviving member of the task force. Because I don&#8217;t think George is doing anything with them. I don&#8217;t think Pam is doing anything. I know Jacinda&#8217;s does not. I want to say Carlos is the last person standing. But the way that AIGA internally eroded that task force from within, I mean it was like an ulcer just eating away at everyone&#8217;s motivation. We were trying to do surveys and we were trying to do all sorts of things and everything would just get, nope, shot down, don&#8217;t want to do it, can&#8217;t do this, this, this, that and third.</p>
<p>And I was lucky to have Revision Path and still fall on that. And they did one or two features about Revision Path, but then people would say, &#8220;Well how come you have Maurice doing Revision Path and doing 28 Days of the Web and AIGA isn&#8217;t doing something like that?&#8221; And I was like, you got to talk to them about that. I don&#8217;t know nothing about how to get things on the website. It was a pain to get anything on the website because it had to go through another channel and it was a mess. It was an absolute mess. And what I left, and I rescinded my membership I want to say in 2017, 2018, I still sort of kept tabs with the organization, or rather I should say the organization kept tabs with me. Because they would would keep hitting me up about stuff and different chapters would hit me up and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Leave me alone. I don&#8217;t want to mess with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It got to the point, especially with my local chapter, with AIGA Atlanta, I literally had to go to them and say, &#8220;Keep my name out your mouth. I know you are using me, you&#8217;re dropping my name to get other people in here. You&#8217;re dropping my name about stuff. It&#8217;s coming back to me. Keep my name out your fucking mouth.&#8221; And to this day they don&#8217;t. I mean, it&#8217;s whatever. But I say all that to say Benny came on 2019, 2020 ish. And I had him on the show. We talked about the importance of him coming on as the first Black person in the organization&#8217;s hundred year history. I know there was a lot that he tried to do. The pandemic I think also just threw a wrench in a lot of things. And I&#8217;m not using that as an excuse, but I don&#8217;t know what AIGA is going to do now. Because like I said, by the time this airs, news would&#8217;ve went out that Benny is no longer the executive director. I don&#8217;t know who else they&#8217;re bringing in.</p>
<p>And as you&#8217;ve said, and as I know, D&#038;I through AIGA is only as strong as whomever the executive director is that&#8217;s championing for it. Without them being the person at the top to say, &#8220;We&#8217;re doing X, Y, Z,&#8221; nothing really happens. And I&#8217;ve been on the nominating committee for the board. So I see how the board operates, I know how that operates. And they do hold a lot of power. They can oust an ED. They&#8217;ve done it before. So I don&#8217;t know. AIGA is, look, if you are a designer and you hear the sound of my voice and you are actively paying dues to AIGA, and I&#8217;m not saying don&#8217;t do this, but I&#8217;m saying really take a hard look at what the organization provides for you as a modern designer.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I say modern because for a long time AIGA did not acknowledge UX. They didn&#8217;t acknowledge product design. And the reality is a lot of working designers now that work for tech companies or other places are UX designers. They are product designers. They&#8217;re experience designers. There are other designers that&#8217;s not just visual or web. I feel like the organization has started to acknowledge that a bit through some events. But what is the value of an AIGA membership to the modern designer? If you didn&#8217;t go to design school and picked up everything you know from YouTube or courses or a bootcamp or something and you&#8217;re working as a mid-level product designer at a tech company, what importance is AIGA going to be you? How is it really helping you as a career professional outside of just saying you&#8217;re a member?</p>
<p>I mean, I could be a member of the Subway Sub Club, but that don&#8217;t mean anything to the random, you know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m comparing this to RGD in Canada. If you&#8217;re an RGD member and you&#8217;re an RGD registered designer, that means something to companies because they found a way to really get themselves a part of the business community. I don&#8217;t think being an AIGA designer, now saying you&#8217;re a member of AIGA really means anything when you try to get a job or you&#8217;re talking to clients as a freelancer, I don&#8217;t think that means anything. It probably means something on a more local level depending on the visibility of the chapter.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But as a whole, what does it mean? So I&#8217;m not telling people to give up their memberships. I am asking them to take a hard look at the money that they&#8217;re paying and see, is it really worth it?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, you&#8217;re right. I mean, Canada, I&#8217;ve been contemplating moving to Canada mainly because of how the design community is looked at up there. I actually like the idea of registering as a graphic designer. I like that classification that Canada does because it seems like it has a more of a value added perk to you as a working professional and signifies that, hey, you know what you&#8217;re doing and you&#8217;re the real deal and that we&#8217;re going to help you with that.</p>
<p>I mean, for a whole host of reasons it&#8217;ll be like pulling teeth through I don&#8217;t know what in the US to do something like that. I don&#8217;t look upon AIGA in the same light as I did 20 years ago. I don&#8217;t look at it as like, oh, they&#8217;re going to help me. Because honestly, in my career, has AIGA ever got me a job? No. Has AIGA ever really connected me to any of the superstars within AIGA? No. I&#8217;ve met some in passing through meetings and workshops, but no one&#8217;s ever really vested any interest in trying to talk to me more than just, &#8220;Hey, how you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve actually been kind of shunned by some folks in AIGA. A lot of the events that I used to go to, every time I would kind of step in, I&#8217;d always get this look like, what are you doing here? Even when I went into the headquarters, last time I went to the headquarters for something, I forgot what it was. I mean, the staff there was looking at me, and they were younger than me, I mean, looking at me like who&#8217;s this Black man in here? What you doing?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I&#8217;m just like, ooh. So tell students that, I tell them AIGA is a good resource to find information. That&#8217;s what I look at AIGA as of right now. Just an information tool. I still think AIGA is very good in terms of the business information they have on there. It&#8217;s great. I don&#8217;t need to get in, I don&#8217;t need to talk to anybody about that. I can just pull off the information, look at the resources and stuff like that. Cool. You&#8217;re a great library for that. But for the true socialization and the true advancement for designers, as I&#8217;m seeing now as I guess I fall into the seasoned category now, I don&#8217;t see them doing anything about seasoned professionals. It&#8217;s more like you don&#8217;t exist. We&#8217;re only focused on designers up to 30.</p>
<p>I try to tell students it&#8217;s a good resource for that information. But as a member, really think about the value that you may get out of it. You go to some initial events to see how you think about it and see if you see any concrete pros and cons is going to help you personally from that experience. And being the fact that the national headquarters is the New York City chapter is a double edged sword, because the New York City chapter honestly to me is dead as a doornail. They don&#8217;t do much. They didn&#8217;t do much before Covid, they don&#8217;t do much now. And it&#8217;s like, so if you join that, what is it really helping? And I hate saying that to folks, but I don&#8217;t want them to go through the experience I&#8217;ve went through, especially when there&#8217;s other organizations that I see. Yeah, they&#8217;re more of a specific design orientation like Society of Publication Designers.</p>
<p>They seem a lot more active and a lot more forward thinking on what they&#8217;re trying to do and who they showcase and how they extend stuff. I&#8217;m really thinking about joining them. I&#8217;m kind of gun shy because I&#8217;m like, do I really want to join another organization at almost $300 a year? I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know. And then walk away feeling unsatisfied. I mean, because I could do something else with that money. It is tempting, at least what I see in the presence of what they do, they&#8217;re [inaudible 01:01:18] above more stuff than what AIGA does. AIGA&#8217;s big focus is their conference. And I think that&#8217;s just a money driver. I think it&#8217;s fair for folks to start questioning the value of it. And if it&#8217;s not of value, then it&#8217;s time to either create something brand new or maybe just dissolve it completely and rethink this whole process from scratch.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean it&#8217;s interesting because, yeah, you&#8217;re right. You&#8217;re right. I don&#8217;t have anything to add. No notes. 10 out of 10, right?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What gets you truly excited about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
It&#8217;s different nowadays. I&#8217;m approaching I guess 30 some odd years, 32 years working. Because I started working as a sophomore in college. What gets me excited now about what I do is not so much, I&#8217;m not driven by the money anymore, which is kind of backwards to say. But I actually just like trying to educate people about what design really is in terms of a strategic path. I think too many people see design as just make me something pretty. And I&#8217;m like, no, it&#8217;s a lot more deeper than that. It&#8217;s about a strategic path on how you can make your company&#8217;s voice sing. And I like doing that. I get more excited about doing work for not-for-profits because they&#8217;re doing some really good work, a lot of them. But when you come across them you&#8217;re like, oh my god, what is this?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no thought, no rhyme and reason. They look mismanaged when the organizations really aren&#8217;t. They have a plan, they know what they&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s just the only thing is their front facing is not as organized as their internal specter. And that stuff is what gets me excited today is doing a lot of not-for-profit, dare I say pro bono work where taking away, I mean, yeah, I do non-profit work at a discounted rate, but pro bono stuff, you take away the money thing and you just focus on just creating to help them just for the altruistic nature. I don&#8217;t know, I just get a very different feeling. It just really inspires me because it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m helping you become better, to help you take yourself to another level that you deserve to be at.</p>
<p>And that I find in this aspect of my career is what truly motivates me today. If folks are willing, I like telling them about design and how it helps and what it can do, which is why I like teaching. And I think design education is paramount both for clients and students. Because I think as a designer, I think it&#8217;s our responsibility to also educate our clients about the power of design and what it truly is. But teaching, I feel like with all the experience and everything that I&#8217;ve gained over these 30 years, I feel I&#8217;ve been very fortunate and blessed. My career&#8217;s gone through so many different curves. It&#8217;s nowhere where I initially started seeing myself, where I envisioned there&#8217;s going to be some high powered VP of design at some mega billionaire company where I&#8217;m jetting from country to country and stuff like that. That doesn&#8217;t appeal to me and stuff. What appeals to me is just passing forward this design legacy to beginnings designers and so that they have a better experience than what I have had in my beginning journeys and stuff. And so that&#8217;s what excites me today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does success look like now? I mean, you&#8217;re at this point in your career where you have really seen design through all these different changes. Of course you mentioned being a design educator. What does success look like?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I would say immediately, right off the top of the head, some of the successes I like is when some of my former students have landed jobs that they really wanted and they come back and say they actually really value what I&#8217;ve done and help push them to be better than what they were when they were studying. They say, &#8220;Well yeah, you&#8217;re a little bit of a hard ass, but I get why you did that. It&#8217;s got me where I am today.&#8221; And we still keep in touch. They&#8217;ll contact me about industry advice, to just basically to have an air. That&#8217;s a success to me. But overall, I just find success in that, if I can actually just help someone, an organization, just put their message out a little more clearer. That they feel better about themselves, that I feel is a success to me. That&#8217;s how I&#8217;m counting that. Is how well does my knowledge or how does my help make them feel better about what they&#8217;re doing and stuff like that.</p>
<p>To me, I feel that&#8217;s more of a success I count today. I&#8217;m not discarding money. I still [inaudible 01:06:44] money, but I&#8217;m not driven by that, and that&#8217;s a fleeting success. Because I&#8217;ve been there when it&#8217;s been coming in like buckets and then when it&#8217;s dust, [inaudible 01:06:55] desert, it is more of the untangible successes that I think is great because that&#8217;s what&#8217;s lasting. So if I can help somebody else, they will remember that, and that just helps propel them. So while the name may not be there, the root of that help grows forever. I mean who doesn&#8217;t want that? That&#8217;s eternal. That&#8217;s great. And I find that success. Yeah, that&#8217;s how I&#8217;d answer that. If that&#8217;s clear. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think so. Yeah. Now this might be a harder question to answer, but I&#8217;ll ask it.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Uh oh.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I&#8217;m actually asking myself that now. I&#8217;ve been toying with the idea of in about five years, which I&#8217;ll be 60, which I still can&#8217;t get my head wrapped around. God, I got to take a breath on that one. In five years I still want to be a practicing designer, but I want to see myself pull back. I want to see where I&#8217;m doing design more at a leisurely pace. I see myself still teaching part-time but in a different scenario where I&#8217;m really seriously contemplating on starting my master&#8217;s next year to be able to teach at any institution. Because you need a master&#8217;s to move around outside of where I&#8217;m teaching at community college. And I&#8217;m 75% sure, I think I may actually move from being an in-house designer and going back to a full-time studio. I&#8217;m thinking in five years I may want to resurrect a physical entity of Straight Design, which it probably will not be called Straight Design because I&#8217;m thinking about rebranding myself completely.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s sort of where I see, I don&#8217;t see myself ever retiring. Because people say, &#8220;Well okay, five years you&#8217;d be 60, then there&#8217;s 65. What about retirement?&#8221; I can&#8217;t do retirement. I have some friends who are retired early, they look bored as crap, and I can&#8217;t do that. And the thing is, I still feel design. I still get very much invigorated when I see great design. I still keep my nose to what&#8217;s happening in the industry as fast as it&#8217;s changing. And I&#8217;m also very interested in that, I&#8217;m hoping within the next five years that I can actually transition into a field that kind of peaks my curiosity, and that&#8217;s motion graphics. Whether or not to get a full-time gig for that, but to be able to offer that as a service. And to be honest, just to be selfish, I just think it looks cool.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done a little bit of motion graphics now and it&#8217;s intriguing, it&#8217;s fascinating and it&#8217;s fun. It&#8217;s fun doing that to take this static idea and bringing it into a motion life,, is something that I&#8217;d like to do more of, especially since I see that as the way design will start changing as we move from the platform of the basic augmented and virtual reality platforms we have now, which is clearly in its cell phase. I can&#8217;t even call it embryo, it&#8217;s still in the cell. That doing something, and I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m a big fan of social media, it has its place, but I like the premise of how you, not necessarily the still aspect of social media, how Instagram originally started that it was all photos. Now it&#8217;s all videos. So you might as well just say TikTok.</p>
<p>That aspect of promoting stuff from a brand ad perspective is fascinating to me, because that&#8217;s where you can apply the motion graphics to that. It&#8217;s high hopes, but I kind of see myself doing more of that in five years. So like I said, I&#8217;m dabbling a little bit right now with it, that I&#8217;m trying to incorporate a little bit more into my full-time job. To feel comfortable enough to be able to offer that to clientele. That&#8217;s about as far as I can see what I think myself for five years, because in just the last five years I&#8217;ve gone through such a major transition professionally and personally that I&#8217;ve learned I&#8217;m not trying to forecast anymore, because tomorrow could be very different right then and there. So five years could be a very, very long way aways, and many different things go. But that&#8217;s kind of where I see my vision board for five years might be.</p>
<p>And that could change next week too. Because I have become very sort of transitory, I&#8217;ve been very flexible about, oh, where we&#8217;re going to go. I don&#8217;t know. Let&#8217;s see where the journey takes us kind of thing. Because at this point I don&#8217;t feel I need to prove anything to anybody. I don&#8217;t need to prove anything to myself. I actually just want to enjoy myself and I just want to contribute with, especially more so in terms of, wow, as I&#8217;m listening to myself in my head as I&#8217;m thinking about this, that Lord help me, do I want to actually become more of a social activist? I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;d like to actually as these issues are popping up more and more in society, as a global society because you can&#8217;t really say we&#8217;re stuck in our own little neighborhoods anymore. But I want to do my part and help on that kind of scale.</p>
<p>In some part that also too is in that projection for the next five years. Maybe it&#8217;s a lofty idea, but it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s kind of sparking some initial interest now that I want to see how that, once I plant these seeds where it may grow within five years. But that&#8217;s where I see still doing the stuff and just hopefully still looking as young as I do now for five years. And just hoping my kids are, because they seem to, my son&#8217;s on this creative journey that I hope he&#8217;s successful in what he&#8217;s doing, and helping guide him as much as I can. As well as my daughter who is still trying to find herself. But she has a really strong creative base, even though she keeps trying to deny it. To make certain that they, like I said, my son makes certain that his career path is as solid as it can be, and to really try and guide my daughter because by that time she&#8217;ll be going to college. Kind of push her to be a creative too. So yeah, that&#8217;s what I see.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
They can find me on my website str8tdesignllc.com. But the domain is not spelled as you would say straight, it&#8217;s S-T-R, the number eight, the letter T, designllc.com, had to play off of that because somebody took the domain Str8t Design. They could find me there. They could also find me on Instagram as Str8t Design spelled as you just say it on Instagram. That&#8217;s generally my main two points where you can find me, because my social media presence really is contained to just Instagram. I no longer use Twitter and I don&#8217;t really use anything else. I just use Instagram and my basic website.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Andrew Bass, wow. I mean, I knew that this was going to be a great conversation, but this was a conversation and a history lesson and a therapy session. This was so much wrapped into one. I mean, first of all, I just want to thank you for just the work that you&#8217;ve done. I mean a lot of what you&#8217;ve done in terms of just educating and then also even the work with AIGA has really kind of set the platform for me to even do what I do here with Revision Path. Like you were one of the first people that I interviewed back before this was all a podcast and everything. And to see that you&#8217;re still continuing to do this work throughout the years, that you can really speak truth to history about how things have went and how technology has changed design and everything. I hope folks get a chance to really listen to both parts of this episode, of these episodes, I should say, to really get the full breadth of what it is that you bring to the design community. And I hope to see you honored one day. I mean, through AIGA, maybe we&#8217;ll see, I don&#8217;t know, but I think what you&#8217;ve brought to the design industry is indispensable. And I just want to thank you so much for sharing that perspective here with our audience. So thank you for coming on. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Well, I thank you for that and I thank you for interviewing me. It was a really cool talk, great to listen and listen to hearing myself talk. And actually it was very therapeutic to actually share some of the agony going through some of this and just trying to lay groundwork for future folks, trying to lessen the burdens that they&#8217;re going to have to face. And the fact that in 2022, coming into 2023, that this is still going to have to go on is sort of mind numbing to me. But it&#8217;s still very much the fight to happen. I may not have as much fire in this fight as I used to because I&#8217;ve taken a reprieve and taken a step back because it does kind of wear you down a bit. But I&#8217;m kind of been refreshing myself to like, you know what? Let&#8217;s throw my hat back in this one last time.</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t be with AIGA, it&#8217;ll be actually doing through some other things, because forget them. It&#8217;s time to go to other means out there, and actually just basically ourselves. Because I still have floating in my head, even though we&#8217;ve had OBD, no, yeah, OBD, which has had mixed results, I still feel very much that if this is going to change, that we have to do it for ourselves. Completely independent and self sustained.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
A hundred percent, a hundred percent. I believe that. Again, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
No problem. Thank you.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re ending off the month talking to one of the unsung trailblazers for diversity in the design community &#8212; Andrew Bass Jr. Longtime fans of Revision Path will recognize Andrew as one of our early profiles back in 2013, and it was great to finally have him on the podcast to talk about his story and his work.</p>
<p>In the first part of this two-part interview, Andrew talks about his design consultancy Straight Design, and shared his story of growing up in Brooklyn and falling in love with graphic design. He also spoke about attending Pratt Institute, the battle scars he received working in print media and gave me a look at his career as a designer throughout the 90s.</p>
<p>Make sure you tune in next week for Part 2!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Well, I&#8217;m Andrew Bass and I am essentially design strategist, educator, art director, graphic designer. Day job I work as a art and production manager at an association called RIMS, handling their member publication. And I, on the side, I also have my freelance consultancy, Straight Design LLC, where I take on various different clients, focusing a little bit more on the small business side and not for profit as well as I&#8217;m an adjunct lecturer at City Tech or the full name New York City College of Technology where I teach Design Thinking, Design Studio.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2022 been going for you so far? We&#8217;re kind of near the end of the year. When you look back, how would you say the year has been?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
It&#8217;s actually been, in perspective has been pretty good. I&#8217;m employed so that&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hey.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I&#8217;m getting transitioning more from my basic print background into more digital design, which is actually good, where I also trying to kind of squeak my way into doing a little bit more motion graphics. But it&#8217;s actually been going pretty well as I&#8217;m been focused more on my full-time job in teaching and a little pulled back away from Straight Design due to family thing, personal issues. So I went through a divorce, had to sell the house and all this during COVID.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah. But 2022, has been compared to 2021 and definitely 2020, it&#8217;s been great. In the grand scheme of things, I really can&#8217;t complain about stuff, but it&#8217;s been going pretty well and I&#8217;m just trying to gear myself up to get, for 2023 to get a little bit back into focusing a little bit more on Straight Design and what that next evolution&#8217;s going to be for it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I feel like the last few years for a lot of people have been this sort of, I don&#8217;t know, period of trying to just gets get acclimated to the way of the world now and especially now that it seems like capitalism is trying to push us out of COVID in a way that everyone&#8217;s really trying to think, oh well for next year I need to try to get back out there more. I need to try to do more, try to resume what life was like prior to all of this, you know?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Well, I mean I will say for myself, and I&#8217;m still wrestling with quote, and I hate all these trend words that they keep coming out with, but quote &#8220;the new normal&#8221; because I now officially work from home and will be working from home for the next several years for my full-time job, saddle that with Straight Design, which is also still from home. The only time I actually go out for design is when I teach. Learning how to marry all that in one residence, basically my home without losing my mind and still maintaining that creative inspiration, is extremely hard and I&#8217;m still trying to formulate plans as to how to tackle it because I&#8217;m on what plan A.2 Now or something like that. Because I&#8217;ve gone through the 26 alphabet and gone through 1 through 10. So I&#8217;m on my third iteration of how to make this all go down seamlessly.</p>
<p>I think COVID just also put a pause on so many things that I think it is really hard to get, jumpstart ourselves back into, okay, this is how we did business, this is how we talk to each other, this is how we do stuff. And from the design aspect, I definitely have seen it become stagnated where I really feel that face to face has actually hurt a little bit of, at least my design process. In talking with both coworkers and clients that without that sort of personal face to face stuff, reading each other&#8217;s body language, playing off the vibes and stuff like that, that it has kind of stiffened a little bit of the creativity. I understand why everybody&#8217;s trying to say, &#8220;Okay, how do I get back into this normal life before COVID?&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of it I think is self-induced because for whole host of thing reasons 2020 was, I say from 2020, 2021 was a real big pot of let&#8217;s stir everybody, let&#8217;s scramble everybody&#8217;s brain with so much crazy misinformation about so many things. From the pandemic to politics to just how life is going to be to the state of the world and all that, that I think it really kind of, if I could say mind fucked us a bit that we still haven&#8217;t really kind of gotten out of it. But the thing is we need to, and the thing is, even during COVID, life doesn&#8217;t stop, you just have to adapt and figure a new way to do things.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s slowly coming, it&#8217;s slowly coming. And I think as more and more folks get out that haze things will kind of lock back into place and pretty much kind of sync up as to how things were beforehand with just new processes, that&#8217;s all. It&#8217;s just going to be new processes. So it sort of forced the change for a lot of things. And we all know humans don&#8217;t like change very much. So it&#8217;s a shock to everyone&#8217;s system and I think it&#8217;s starting now to seep in and okay, this is what we&#8217;re going to do now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. No, I mean you&#8217;re absolutely right. It&#8217;s been something I think a lot of us have just had to get comfortable with the constant pivots, whether it&#8217;s lockdowns or work from home or hybrid. And that&#8217;s we&#8217;re just talking about on a work kind of level. I mean personal level, there&#8217;s people that have lost loved ones, there&#8217;s people that have gotten COVID multiple times, they have long COVID, like there&#8217;s a lot that has really come out. And it&#8217;s continuing to happen, I would say even with the vaccines and such, there&#8217;s still just a lot that&#8217;s going on right now.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
It&#8217;s something we just got to have to learn to live with and navigate that as anything else.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And we have to do it unfortunately on the individual level because I don&#8217;t think that structures have really been set up for us to do it on a societal level yet.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
No, that it&#8217;s been misstep from day one and once it&#8217;s been misstepped, it&#8217;s very hard to start building that foundation and so that momentum is lost. So it is very much individually, which will be the success rate on that is going to be a wide range of stuff. Because some folks will do better, others will do worse. And the only thing is we just got to try and support one another when we can. I mean that&#8217;s lofty goals. Let&#8217;s hope that we all can do that and I think that&#8217;ll help things a little bit better. But yeah, it&#8217;s very much a matter of now it also kind of shows how fleeting life is and how, I mean a nanosecond, how things can shift and you have to either be ready to jump in and adapt or you just stay in that place and just cease to exist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s lighten the conversation up because people probably tuned in didn&#8217;t expect us to be going all deep about COVID and stuff. Let&#8217;s lighten it up and talk about your design consultancy, Straight Design, which you&#8217;ve ran now for 15 years. Tell me about that. How did it start?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
It wasn&#8217;t even planned, it just kind of happened because I will freely admit it started because of my arrogance. I was working in a time and a company and I was going to have the opportunity to start teaching as an adjunct and I just kind of took for granted that because we had such a relaxed work schedule there that oh I could teach classes during the day and come in four days a week and not just one day. This was before anyone ever did any sort of remote stuff. And I didn&#8217;t bother to tell my editor-in-chief that I had done this. And so basically I was tasked with, &#8220;Look, if you drop the teaching gig now or teach at night or you just got to leave the job,&#8221; it&#8217;s essentially you&#8217;re making, you accepted two jobs and this is your first job.</p>
<p>And I kind of refused. At that point, subconsciously I was kind of done with where I was working at. I had been there for a few years and there was a lot of changes. The company was going through a merger, I should say an acquisition. And things were changing in my department. My staff, they had had me actually cut my staff and so I was the only one working on the magazine at the time and through budget cuts. And I kind of just used that as an excuse subconsciously to of exit out. And so when I did that I realized, oh what am I going to do for money? So I was like, &#8220;Okay, we&#8217;re going to have to kind of freelance.&#8221; And I took some time to just kind of coast a little bit, get my head together and I was approached by a client to submit a proposal for developing a magazine prototype as well as what it would be to produce this magazine on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>And it was a magazine based in the Netherlands based on financial technology, which I had was completely unfamiliar with that subject. But I submitted my proposal and I was awarded the gig and that gave me the impetus to, okay, let me start Straight Design. Now at the time it was called AD Bass Designs until I changed the name later on. And that started the ball rolling for Straight Design and they were very good [inaudible 00:15:06] and it morphed from just doing the magazine and the production to doing event materials to promotional collateral and it spurred adding to my clientele roster.</p>
<p>And so I was running that in a physical studio in Manhattan for a good number of years, at least like five years in there. And then the recession of 2008 hit, as well as everybody else, I started losing some clients because they were cutting back on money, but I was still doing pretty well with that. But then once my big client sort of went away because the owner of that company didn&#8217;t realize what the financial investment was in starting up a magazine because a magazine doesn&#8217;t really break even for at least five to seven years. And the owner was like, &#8220;Whoa, this is taking too long.&#8221; And so they kind of pulled back on it, still kept all the event stuff and the event materials and stuff but just wasn&#8217;t doing the magazine.</p>
<p>I started losing clientele a bit because of the economic situation and at the time I was married and both my wife then and me were self-employed and with, we just had our daughter and I was like, &#8220;Okay, somebody&#8217;s going to have to go back inside because health insurance was as much as my mortgage.&#8221; And I was like this is killing my savings quick. And that&#8217;s when I had just made the transition to go back in-house. But I still kept Straight Design as my freelance consultancy so that I would basically do the projects that I still were very interested in on the side, but I didn&#8217;t have to worry about hunting down and bringing in clientele while maintaining my whole household. And I&#8217;ve kept that way from since 2012, I think. Yeah. From 2012 to now. Where I&#8217;m now thinking about eventually I might resurrect Straight Design in a more full-time capacity in the next several years. But that&#8217;s how I started it. It was really just a fluke.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s so interesting. Hearing you talk about how you started that reminds me of how I started my studio. It&#8217;s so funny that you said it was out of arrogance. Because I feel like I started in the same way. I was a senior designer working AT&#038;T. I mean I was completely self-taught. I just felt like, oh I got this, I got this. And I mean I was working there in AT&#038;T, for at least back then, I can&#8217;t speak to how it is now. This was 2008 when I quit. But it was very much a production house. It was all on the assembly line basically. You got packet with all your stuff that you needed to design and you did it in Photoshop and you sliced it up in Dreamweaver and coded. There was no love or soul into it because you had to crank it out and eight hours or less essentially.</p>
<p>And so you&#8217;re just doing this on a constant loop. And I was like I could do this better myself. And I just quit and started my own studio. I really felt like, yeah, I could do this, I got this. But yeah, it&#8217;s interesting because even when I started, I had a different name for my business. I started it out, it was called 318 Media because I wanted to, one, it was after my birthday and then two, I just wanted to have a cool kind of funky name. I ended up changing it later because there were other three blank blank media companies in Atlanta. There was a three, I know there was a 352 Media, there was a 360 Media and people were getting us confused and so we had to have a standoff, okay, somebody&#8217;s got to change.</p>
<p>And I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;ll change mine,&#8221; because I had a weird spelling for it too because I don&#8217;t know, I thought it was cool to have the number three, the word 18, but then I had to keep explaining it to people and then forms wouldn&#8217;t take a business thing that started with a number. It was a whole bunch of things.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then I just changed it to Lunch in 2014, 2015 and completely rebranded the company. So it made more sense after I did all of that. And I even found business increased once that happened because one, people weren&#8217;t getting us confused with other companies. And then I had all these kind of gimmicks around lunch. My business card was one of those plastic key tag things where like CVS or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It was like that was what the business card was. And every time I met with a client I&#8217;d mark off a little circle on the back.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Oh that&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Oh, if you get a certain number, you get a free whatever.&#8221; I could play all these little gimmicks into it and it was fun.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
That&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve thought about going back to freelancing now, especially since I am not working and the job market is trash, I&#8217;m thinking about it. So I get what you mean about always having it in your back pocket in a way is something that&#8217;s just your own thing, you know?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean it was great experience, still is a great experience. It was a great experience having the actual physical space, dealing with clients coming into the office, going to presentations and stuff like that. Contracting freelancers to work on projects and something like that. But it was also a good experience in understanding that New York City does not small business. They don&#8217;t like freelancers. Unless you are a huge company, the state is just going to rob you blind.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s really hard. It was harder than I really imagined to run a business in New York City and New York state because New York City is its own entity and then you have to deal with New York state as well and then you got the feds so you get triple hit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
It was very, very interesting. And I would probably not open up a business in New York City again. I would go to a different state. I&#8217;m starting to understand some of the reasons why some companies open up in particular states. Just from the business point of view, it makes a lot of sense. But it was a good experience I have to say. And it actually did very well, even to my surprise because I didn&#8217;t expect to do so well starting off. I thought I was going to have to kind of struggle a bit, but things just rolled in really nicely and I was like oh. And I knew that wasn&#8217;t going to last. I just didn&#8217;t know it was going to hit sooner than it did. But it was a great experience and it just helped strengthen how I do my consultancy now when I freelance and stuff, that I got a little bit better practice with clientele because I really don&#8217;t like that side of doing a business. I really just want to create.</p>
<p>And I was always trying to find, I said if I was going to do Straight Design as a company company again where there&#8217;s just more than me, I need to find somebody who&#8217;s this, who&#8217;s good on the business side that doesn&#8217;t mind doing all the numbers and the paperwork and stuff like that. Because now that stuff really does consume a lot of time and it really showed being a creative takes a lot. We all know being a creative takes a lot of our energy. But when that&#8217;s split with doing this sort of the other side of our brain, the more logical side sometimes how that can disrupt things now and it&#8217;s hard to get back into that creative flow after you&#8217;ve been dealing with invoices and setting out proposals and responding to RFPs and tracking down those clients that are a little late in their paying and then taxes. That, yeah. We don&#8217;t like taxes but that, that&#8217;s woo those quarterlies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:22:50] on that one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You are preaching to the choir on that one. I know exactly what you mean.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah. So it was a great experience and I try to pass that information to students now and always have incorporated a little bit of business sense in my teachings with students so that they&#8217;re better prepared for that. Because I never got that when I was in school. There was business not considered part of the curriculum. It was about technique and creating and stuff. Not like, &#8220;Okay now you got to make a living, how are you going to survive?&#8221; But it was a great experience. I mean it still is a great experience but what it is now is that I can pick and choose what I really want to work on.</p>
<p>And I really tend to working on not for profits or trying to help businesses get their start and really understanding how important the strategy of design is. And not so much get sidetracked by all the nice shiny bells and whistles, but to really understand how this design strategy is going to help them propel their company&#8217;s message to ensure they are successful in interacting with their consumer, their customer base and stuff. And I kind of like that. And that working full time and doing the consultancy on the side, that enables me to do that a little bit more without having to worry about the slow times and stuff like that. So it has worked out pretty well for right now. Although like I said before, I&#8217;m thinking of the next evolution that&#8217;s probably going to happen within the next year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean you mentioned nonprofits and sort of smaller businesses that you really like to work with. What does your creative process look like when you&#8217;re starting on a project?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Generally when I&#8217;m first starting on a project, this is assuming I&#8217;ve been awarded a project, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Okay. Because then there&#8217;s another process on trying to get that project. Once I&#8217;ve gotten a project, I really try to just hone in and identify what is the problem that they&#8217;re facing, what is it that they really need to happen? And in that, once I&#8217;ve kind of locked that solid, that kind of helps me figure out my focus on what I need to sort of really understand about them, their audience, what they&#8217;re actually trying to put out there. Whether it&#8217;s some sort of service, whether it&#8217;s about the face of their company. And I really try to learn as much as I can about them to sort of really put myself in their shoes and trying to put myself in the shoes of who they&#8217;re trying to reach so that way I can talk in the same tone, the same voice. And that usually that&#8217;s a lot of my discovery time.</p>
<p>I always tell my clients that I need a good, I give myself about four weeks of discovery time to go through stuff to understand, to talk to people, to be able to really understand the gist and the spirit of what this is and who they claim their audience is to see if it actually matches up before I ever begin thinking about creative solutions. And then once I&#8217;ve done that, that&#8217;s when I just go back to them and kind of confer my findings, where I sort of send back to them, for lack of, a creative brief, just letting them know, &#8220;Okay, this is of where I think this is at.&#8221; And just to get them the co-sign, &#8220;Yeah, this is what we see for ourselves, this is what we see our audience, this is where we definitely agree with this is what&#8217;s happening, this is the sentiment.&#8221; And then that&#8217;s when I start getting into my creative process where start trying to now understand the competitors, see what they&#8217;ve done, see what this company&#8217;s done and what works well.</p>
<p>Because sometimes companies don&#8217;t realize they have some good stuff, it&#8217;s just maybe not executed well or thought out correctly. And so I try to see what is good. Nobody wants to reinvent the wheel unless it&#8217;s necessary. And see, like I said, see what works, what doesn&#8217;t work and then start beginning to put those pieces together and start developing my own of creative point of view as to how I think the project should go and what&#8217;s going to be best for their purposes moving forward. Which again, that&#8217;s another big chunk of my time that depending on the scope of the project, definitely is at least a month for, I like telling folks weeks versus months because it seems shorter in weeks than months. Math. I tell them it&#8217;s usually about four to six weeks I&#8217;m going to start doing creative development if it&#8217;s a kind of small base project, small to medium side.</p>
<p>And that allows me to actually kind of run through a lot of my ideas because in all transparency, as a creative I also build in cushion time for myself with that. Because I&#8217;m not starting on that project right off the bat. I&#8217;m a procrastinator and I probably should not be putting this out on air, but I&#8217;m a procrastinator and sometimes it takes a while for me to jumpstart to get in things because deadlines really drive my juices. I don&#8217;t know why that is, but at least about a week or so I kind of just kind of float through the project in the development phase. Kind of looking at things inspiring myself before I realize, oh man, okay, I got to get my stuff going in into gear.</p>
<p>And then once I&#8217;m in gear though, I&#8217;m going through it. I&#8217;m flying through it to build up my mock so that way I can present to the clientele. And I walk them through the whole process and I explain, I kind of educate them about the aspect of design and why I have done exactly what I&#8217;ve done, the choices I&#8217;ve made from all the elements. So that they have a better understanding that this is not just about making things look nice and that colors, type, images just seems like random choices when no, there&#8217;s a calculated reason for the choices on this and what the desired result is expected from it because of these choices.</p>
<p>And then it&#8217;s a matter of, I don&#8217;t usually have not gotten from clients an extensive back and forth on things. It&#8217;s been a pretty quick, &#8220;Yeah, we like this choice, we&#8217;ve got these few little changes and then that&#8217;s it.&#8221; And then the end of the process is where I now start finalizing everything up. And that usually is the quickest part of the process because all the stuff I build up is to high fidelity in terms of the conceptuals. And so that way all I&#8217;m doing is just tweaking some things unless it completely requires a rethought and which we never want to do there. And luckily I&#8217;ve only had one or two of those and that&#8217;s an earlier part of my career because that&#8217;s embarrassing. Go back to the drawing board to because you completely did not catch what was going on. And then from there it&#8217;s just providing the materials to the clienteles and following up with them.</p>
<p>Now that&#8217;s one of the things that I think sometimes as designers, creators we don&#8217;t do is that we don&#8217;t follow up to say, &#8220;Okay, hey, how did things go six months out? How did everything happen? Are you satisfied? What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; To try and maintain and build those networks and those relationships so that it becomes a longstanding client base. But also I think it&#8217;s just good practiceship or businessmanship to follow up with your clients, make certain what you provided to them is doing what they needed to be done and that they&#8217;re satisfied and that it&#8217;s helping them. So, that actually tells you how well you&#8217;ve done yourself. But that&#8217;s [inaudible 00:30:48] my process. I hope I didn&#8217;t drone on that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, I mean I think that end part definitely is good because then it also means that you can possibly get repeat clients.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Repeat work from the same client. I mean that&#8217;s always good. I know back when I was doing my studio, I would have clients I do work for and then I would follow up and if they needed things on a more regular basis, eventually that graduated to becoming a retainer. And then that&#8217;s guaranteed monthly income, which we all love that. That&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
And referrals. Current clients can refer you to people, so you get new clients.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Absolutely. Let&#8217;s kind of dive a little bit into your personal story. I think folks now can kind of hear the New York accent.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Oh my god.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me about growing up there.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
You mean my Brooklyn accent? Yeah. Well I mean I&#8217;m born and raised in New York, specifically Brooklyn. Because people ask me, oh where I&#8217;m from, I say, &#8220;I&#8217;m from Brooklyn. I&#8217;m Brooklynese.&#8221; Because yes, people from Brooklyn, we have Brooklyn is a culture. Other folks realizing, or at least old Brooklyn now, because yes, I&#8217;m going to say Brooklyn is not quite the same as it used to be. So old school Brooklyn. Yeah, I grew up in Bedford-Stuyvesant, now during the &#8217;70s, &#8217;80s, and &#8217;90s. Crack era and blackout from 1977. So Bed-Stuy was rough. It was not for the week of heart. And me growing up as the nerd, because I&#8217;ve always been a nerd, always been the tallest dude out of everybody, very quiet, reserved. So I was the art kid. And so naturally I was bullied growing up and for me to deal with that, I always used to just draw. Now I would just go into my notebooks and draw these fantasy worlds just to escape from all the crap that I was growing up with.</p>
<p>Because I also, my dad was an alcoholic. When I was younger it wasn&#8217;t as bad as it was when I got older, but when he did drink, it was not a pleasant environment. So coupled that with the knuckleheads in my neighborhood who were bugging me and my brother, I retreated to my drawing. Now I just went in there and I just started drawing worlds to just escape for a few hours and stuff. It was great therapy for me. Unfortunately, as I think back, a lot of the scenes that I would was drawing were conflicts. It was like war, space invasions, shooting. I was just blowing up shit. If you talk to a therapist, that means that&#8217;s a manifestation of what&#8217;s going on out there. And I&#8217;m like, but I had fun.</p>
<p>And with the drawing that actually got me interested in do people do this? And so I started looking deeper into cartoons cause I love cartoons and how they were drawn. I was like, oh people do this. When I found out as a kid, folks actually do. Because I don&#8217;t know what I was thinking as a kid, I just thought they magically appeared. I didn&#8217;t know you actually had to do that. And that fascinated me because I was like, &#8220;Ooh, maybe one day I can draw some cartoons.&#8221; And that shifted my invasion drawings into drawing characters and doing little mini cartoons. And to date myself, I used to do these little flip books where you draw them on the edge of the paper and you just flip them. And then-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember flip books. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
We all did that back then. It was just so cool. And people loved when I did it at my school and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Ah, do one for me, do one for me.&#8221; And I started getting a little reputation for Andrew&#8217;s, &#8220;He&#8217;s the animator, he makes these cartoons that move,&#8221; and it was pretty cool. And I was like, oh, maybe one day I could do this for a living. But as I started growing up, I got into graffiti because the introverted kid started breaking out his shell a little bit. And I was fascinated with graffiti. Little did I know, that was my first introduction to design, specifically graphic design. Because what folks don&#8217;t seem to realize back then graffiti was just that was vandalism, got to get those kids. And I don&#8217;t advocate now at 55 to ever go paint up on people&#8217;s property. That is having been a property owner, I&#8217;m going to beat you up if you write on my property.</p>
<p>But it was beautiful work to see the letters, the formation of these characters and then the letters of the characters, and then actually the figurines you put into the pieces in the murals. Which all based off of the smurfs, Vaughn Bodƒì&#8217;s work, I forgot the character name with the mushroom head. Or at that time it was the, because that was the beginning of the hiphop culture. And I say hiphop purposely now because hip hop culture was the trifecta of MCing. Notice I say MCing and not rapping. MCing, breakdancing, and graffiti. Graffiti was the visual expression of all this, where breakdancing was the physical manifestation of the movement, and MCing was the verbalization of it. And there&#8217;s a distinct difference between MCing and rapping. Now, again, dating myself because we rappers today are not MCs.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh no, no. I would venture to say rappers today are barely rappers.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Bingo. But that&#8217;s got me into graffiti. And I just fell in love with how you create your own letters and create these characters into these stylized formations. And then the color, when I had my black book with the markers, it was Pantone markers. Little did I know Pantone would actually be so much a part of my life. But those Pantone markers with the smell, I love those smell of those markers. It was pure alcohol now. Yeah, pure alcohol. And they soaked through everything, but they left beautiful pieces. And that was actually my very first foray into being an artist and drawing and in design. And from that point on, I knew I wanted to do something creatively for the rest of my life. Now I just didn&#8217;t know what now.</p>
<p>And I went through different phases as I went from high school where I went to Brooklyn Tech, which was, and still is a very specialized high school that focuses on math and science. But they had an industrial design program in there and a little bit of arts. And so I took that because I suck at math, I love science, but I&#8217;m not a scientist. And so I did industrial design, which was very much equated to let&#8217;s say package design, product design and architecture, which did interest me. And for a time I was like, maybe I&#8217;ll do be an architect. But I really liked more the spontaneous creativity in design oriented projects.</p>
<p>So when I left Brooklyn Tech, I applied, was thinking about college and I applied to Pratt, I applied to City Tech. At the time, City Tech back then was called New York City Technical College. That&#8217;s what it was called back then. And those are the only two schools I applied to because I didn&#8217;t know of any other schools. And also because my mother told me I was either going to go to Pratt or City Tech because they&#8217;re in Brooklyn. And so that way I&#8217;m close to home. So my mother was very much the SuperMax warden growing up. So I looked at both. I applied to both. I got into both.</p>
<p>I went through, I first focused on going to Pratt, but I couldn&#8217;t afford that bill. I was like, &#8220;Ooh, that&#8217;s too much money.&#8221; And I didn&#8217;t really have a true portfolio back then. I just had my black book and some work from high school. Because like I said, Brooklyn Tech was not based, was not an art school. So I didn&#8217;t know anything about building a portfolio, what&#8217;s needed or anything like that. So I just had little trinkets. So I went to City Tech or New York City Technical College at that time.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s where I really started learning what it is to be in the creative industry. And I knew right then and there, yeah, this is the choice I want to do. I definitely want to be in the creative industry. Now I got to decide, is it advertising, is it this thing called graphic design? Is it this thing being an illustrator? Because a couple of my professors were pushing me to be an illustrator now. And they were like, &#8220;You just have this natural tone. You should be an illustrator.&#8221; I just didn&#8217;t like sitting in those classes for six hours drawing stuff. I was like, are you kidding me? That&#8217;s like, this is boring me. It did. It wasn&#8217;t as fun to me. And I did a year at City Tech and then I transferred, especially at the encouragement of one of my professors because I was all A&#8217;s, I got 4.0 for that first year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
All my projects just didn&#8217;t feel like it was a challenge to me. Even though at the professor who I&#8217;m revering right now, her name is Dorothy Hayes, she&#8217;s passed on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, I&#8217;ve heard of her. She&#8217;s been mentioned on the shows by a lot of people. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah. Dorothy Hayes at the time when I was a student of hers, I could not stand her. She was too hard. I was like, she was always on my. Always, always Bass. Because she always called me Bass. Never call me Andrew. &#8220;Bass, Bass, you could do better. You could do better. Where&#8217;s your work, I want to see your work.&#8221; But looking back, I mean that really forged who I am and I&#8217;m forever thankful to her, and a few other professors I met. By the way, which they were all Black. I was lucky. I had quite a few Black professors in my design education.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Which was unheard of. That&#8217;s why I was saying that was destined to be and stuff. And so I transferred to Pratt and that&#8217;s where shit got real ,when I went to Pratt.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me about it. How was it?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
It was challenging. I wanted the challenge. I got challenged. It was like I almost dropped out at my, what was it, sophomore year? Well actually not, it was my transfer year. Yeah. Because when I transferred over, some of my credits transferred over, some did. Because Pratt had a foundation year that they required everybody to take. So I had a mix of classes that were from the foundation class and then classes that were able to be transferred over. It was a completely different environment. And we&#8217;re talking about 1986. Pratt was intense. The workload was nothing I had experienced at any school. It was weekly. It was a lot to manage. I mean many projects very much about understanding and defending the basis of your projects, which I hadn&#8217;t understand before that. I thought it was just about, oh, how do you make this stuff pretty. And then that&#8217;s where I first learned, no, it&#8217;s about why are you doing this and for who is it for? Basically what is your thinking behind this?</p>
<p>And that tripped me up because I was like, &#8220;Oh that seemed like a lot.&#8221; As well as at that same time, there was a lot of things going into my, not childhood, but at my home with my focuses at that point now. My dad definitely was heavy into his alcoholism. And so going to Pratt was a good and a bad experience. Good in the fact is that the work was intense. It forced me to double down and really get involved in understanding the nature of the work that I&#8217;m building. Because the very coming from four A&#8217;s to where I just thought I automatically get that coming in the Pratt. And then the end of that first transfer year, I realized, now granted also too, I was doing a little more partying that transfer year. Because I was like, &#8220;Ah, I got this. This is easy.&#8221; That&#8217;s when my GPA went from 4.0, dropped down to 2.0. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a dip.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Oh it&#8217;s a major dip. And couple of my teachers came to me, professors came to me and said, &#8220;Look, hey. You can do the work. What is going on? You&#8217;re not applying yourself.&#8221; And that&#8217;s when I woke up and said, &#8220;Okay Andrew, you forget this partying, you can party after you graduate. Let&#8217;s get on the ball.&#8221; And I worked my house off to try and get my grades back up. And it was never back to 4.0. I graduated what? 3.0. I worked it back up. But that one year did that much damage to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah. And so the other good things with that was the, I&#8217;d have to say, with the intensity of the work, it was also the way the professors tried to instill some of the actual business dynamics into how you build a creative, but also how to be a creative. It wasn&#8217;t extensive, it was snippets. It was, what was her, it was my copywriting professor, Lorraine McNeil, who also happened to be Black. She was a Black woman. She would occasionally mention about the business aspect and what would be expected out of there. It wasn&#8217;t a full fledged business kind of introduction, that didn&#8217;t exist when I was going to school. But she did try to put some nuggets out there because I found out about business and stuff on my own.</p>
<p>Now that was the other good thing about Pratt is that they had an extensive library. And that&#8217;s where I really got a lot of my supplemental education was in that library. I was in the library too much. They had so many books I couldn&#8217;t keep my hands off those books. The bad aspects of Pratt was that I felt very isolated as a Black student. Pratt was predominantly white and there were students who basically came from more affluent families. There was a contingent of students of color on there. A lot of them stayed on the dorms because they were not basically from New York, they were from other states.</p>
<p>So I didn&#8217;t have that kind of connection because the folks who were in the dorms, they had their own clique. They focused more, a little too much more on partying than education. I always called the edutainment and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I already saw the effect of partying on my grades. I was like, nah man, I got to get serious because we want to get a job. We got this is going to be our career.&#8221; The isolation was very detrimental to me in that aspect because I didn&#8217;t have a vacuum. I had, I didn&#8217;t really have folks I can confer with about how their education was going, how classes were, how projects were, to bounce off ideas with somebody else is to, what do you think about this? And something like that.</p>
<p>The other thing is too, I thought the teachers, the white teachers, I thought they were very sort of offhand with the students of color. They seemed very apt to help the white students but not so eager to help the Black and Latino students. It was kind of like, &#8220;You can figure this out on your own. I&#8217;ll just give you this little nugget and let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s going on.&#8221; But then you see them confer very regularly with the white students after class, off premises. They would extend numbers to them. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Huh, how come we don&#8217;t get that?&#8221; The only professors actually did do that were the professors who happened to be of color. I had three of them. I had Richard Perry who was an English teacher, Dwight Johnson, who was one of my design teachers who also actually gave me my first freelance gig. Lorraine McNeil, who was my copywriter teacher.</p>
<p>Those were the three professors that I had through my years at Pratt that did offer me help, is particularly Dwight Johnson. Now he&#8217;s the one that really, in the beginning years, I modeled myself after him. Now he gave me first freelance job. I just personally and professionally, I styled myself after him because I just thought he was on point. I was like, &#8220;I want to be like him.&#8221; So Pratt overall, if I had to choose today, I would not necessarily go to Pratt. There&#8217;s so many other schools out here that are actually pretty good and cheaper that I probably would&#8217;ve went to. But that&#8217;s how Pratt was. There&#8217;s really not much to say about City Tech because at that time City Tech had a reputation of being a super high school. It was just a continuation. And then, I mean having worked at City Tech now and working at City Tech now I will say they definitely have changed that, which is for the better.</p>
<p>But back then it was really classified as just an extension of high school and folks acted the same way. So it was good to get that sort of foundation in City Tech. And actually meeting a few professors there, Dorothy Hayes, Joel Mason, Robert Holden, they were actually good teachers that kind of helped me build a real portfolio, so that when I, they applied to Pratt again to transfer over, my portfolio was much more readily accepted now that I had a portfolio. But yeah, that&#8217;s how my experiences, I don&#8217;t look too fondly on my college years. It was kind of rough on instances that I wish I had more camaraderie among some of my fellow classmates and a little bit more, actually not a little bit, a lot more help from my professors. It just wasn&#8217;t really there. May have changed now, I don&#8217;t know how Pratt is at this moment now, other than I know it&#8217;s highly expensive. But yeah, that&#8217;s how my experience was there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you graduate from Pratt. Tell me what your early career is like, because I want to also just kind of put this in a timeframe here. I mean you&#8217;re studying design at a time when personal computers were not really part of design.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
No. No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I&#8217;d love to kind of hear what was your early career like once you graduated?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I have to say, I think my early part of my career probably was the most fun part of my career. Where I think I chalk it up to youth where, I mean there was no holds barred. I thought I could do anything. I was like I was ready for every stuff and it was pre-computer. So I was pretty good with my hands in doing that. Because in the beginning, in my beginning career, we did everything by hand. So we did boards, type was done through a, we&#8217;d send it to our type setting department or you would send it out to type setting companies and they would run off, what was that called? A linograph, I think it was called linograph. Basically it was just a sheet of paper that had the type set on there and you would cut that up, paste it on the board, with rubber cement. It was very hands on. That was where you would get your-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, Letraset is that what you mean? Letraset?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
No, Letraset was for the, if you&#8217;re doing display type.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
But the actual body copy, the that text, if you tried putting that on Letraset, you would kill yourself. It would be tedious and oh so time consuming. So that was set by a machine that just ran off, sort of like photo paper you can kind of say it and you would just cut it down to size as you need.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, that&#8217;s linotype.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, linotype. That&#8217;s it. Not linograph, linotype. The Letraset really is for display type. If you want to do custom things and stuff like that. Especially like logos. If you were going to do logo stuff. Oh yeah, that&#8217;s what I was going to say back then, that&#8217;s where you would actually get your battle scars because by cutting all that stuff with the X-Acto blade or an actual razor blade, it was no way you were not going to cut your hand. And getting cut with X-Acto blade is better than getting cut by a razor blade. Because hoo, those razors are deep. But that was just par for the course. Your hands, your fingers would be all scarred up. You don&#8217;t see them so much now in my hands, but there&#8217;s one or two spots that you still see where I have some heavy cuts.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s how we actually did stuff by putting them on board, gluing down the type. The images we would actually have to send out to a stat house and they would take basically what was a full scale image or a film. It&#8217;d be like they would send you a negative and you would send that negative to the printer. You would put down sort of a for all intents and purposes, like a Xerox copy of what it is, just to get them in position, placing everything down with tracing paper to cover everything up, do some inking when you needed to do some things. And that was a lot of pen and ink work, which I think is solely missed from today&#8217;s work. Folks are so reliant on digital that they don&#8217;t know how to create stuff by hand anymore. And there is a beautiful nuance between hand created stuff and digital stuff.</p>
<p>Digital can be too clean. Even the stuff that try to simulate manmade stuff, it still has a cleanness about it that doesn&#8217;t exist in handmade stuff. And all that would take us some serious time. So if you wasted time, if say, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m not going to work on this today.&#8221; You lost 24 hours that can really impact your deadline. Now, unlike today where everything is like, &#8220;Okay, well I&#8217;m not going to work on this right now, I&#8217;ll do it tomorrow.&#8221; You don&#8217;t lose that kind of time because digital is so quick, it&#8217;s so instantaneous. But working there, my very first thought was I had gotten an internship at a small ad agency out of the result of, at that time I was the president of the Black Student Union at Pratt and I was all about business.</p>
<p>So I was looking at the Black Student Union as a way to start linking us up with job opportunities to various different agencies and studios in New York City so that we can get a head start on the other students, ie our white students who easily have these connections and get into stuff. But folks were not looking for us. So I was determined to try and get us a jump start. And one of the agencies who participated in that program, I was awarded the internship, which was a whole story because essentially folks didn&#8217;t participate. There was only a few folks that actually came out and participated, which really disappointed me on that. And I got it because my portfolio was the best out of it and folks had issues with that. But I&#8217;m like, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t apply, you can&#8217;t complain.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so I worked there for the summer of 1989. So once I graduated they offered me a full-time job. So I worked there for the summer and I was doing, it was an ad agency, but I was doing a lot more design work and I was the defacto art director because I was the art department because the agency was, it was a Black owned agency, it was just the principal and two other people in there. Excuse me. And it was a good experience because I was able to do my first photo shoots, meet these photographers, do [inaudible 00:55:03], set up model stuff. I had to battle folks because folks were like, &#8220;You sure you&#8217;re the art director? You seem a little young.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Well yeah, I am young but I am it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The only thing that kind of saved my grace a bit where people gave people a little pause at time was that, yeah, I towered everybody. I was six, was I 6&#8217;6 then when I graduated? I was either between 6&#8217;4 or 6&#8217;6, because I don&#8217;t think I reached my peak until around 23, 24. And so I towered over everybody. So my height kind of gave me some more credence and credibility and stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
But I always had a baby face. I still sort of do have a baby face. I mean it&#8217;s getting a little older. And so folks questioned that. But once I started doing the work, they were like, &#8220;Okay, no, you seem to know what you&#8217;re doing.&#8221; Because I kind of learned it as I went because if I didn&#8217;t know something, I was determined to go find out how to do it. And that&#8217;s where, I mean, because that was pre-internet. So again, I hit up libraries now. I mean there was so much information out there that people just don&#8217;t realize if you just get up and look for it, there&#8217;s a world at your fingertips. And I would just find out information on the rare occasions that I&#8217;d actually just ask people in the industry, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You don&#8217;t don&#8217;t know me, but can I just ask you a question?&#8221; And folks were surprisingly helpful. So I did that and I was pretty much given leeway to do stuff, which is not usually the case.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why that actually occurred. I consider myself lucky in a lot of the places I was employed at, I was given a lot of leeway. I was given the autonomy to like, you are the leader, create your stuff. Now I don&#8217;t know if it was the aspect of how I carried myself, how I did my work, because I always felt I was nervous. I was a nervous wreck. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Do I really know what I&#8217;m doing? I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; I was always doubting myself in my head, but I would not let that show, I would not let that be known to anybody. And so for those three months, everything was still done by hand. No, the only computers in there were for the administrative views. And I will freely admit I use that computer to play my video games. Because I&#8217;ve been on video games since Atari 2600. Even though Atari was crap, I had CalecoVision, but that&#8217;s a side note.</p>
<p>So we were still doing stuff by hand and I was doing some long hours. There was no, okay, it&#8217;s 5:00, everybody go home. No, I would stay until about 11:00 at night, 12:00 at night. And the owner would just give me the key to the place and say, &#8220;Just lock up when you need to.&#8221; Which I thought was, wow. Again, I seemed to endear confidence to people that they gave me this responsibility and I never broke that trust on that responsibility. So from there, after about three months, like I said, again, being a young creative, I was a little too cocky and I was like, &#8220;You know what? I&#8217;m tired of this. I can get me another job like that.&#8221; And so I quit. I was like, I wanted to do something else.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s when I realized, no Andrew, that&#8217;s not how it works. It&#8217;s like I got a hard dose of reality. It was like that I need to get my ego in check. And I was out of work for a good number of months. Back then you found your jobs through the classified ads in the paper, which I know today everybody would be like, &#8220;What&#8217;s a newspaper? What&#8217;s a classified ad?&#8221; But it&#8217;s equivalent to a job listing online. And I found a listing for an associate art director at this publishing company. And I said, &#8220;Oh, okay, that&#8217;s a different genre. Let&#8217;s kind of see how that is.&#8221; Submitted my resume, they called me in for an interview and I got a surprise because when I came in for the interview, that&#8217;s when I learned that the magazine was for an adult. It was an adult magazine, it was an adult publishing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
And I was like, okay, this is interesting. But then when they actually specified what market in the adult publishing, it was a gay lifestyle magazine, I was like, &#8220;Oh, this is 1989.&#8221; And that was in the height of the AIDS epidemic, the Black kid from Bed-Stuy, there was a lot of stigma to the gay community and stuff like that. My concern was like, &#8220;Well okay, this X-rated stuff, can I get a job after this if I take this?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
That was my main concern. And so did very well in the interview. It was interesting when they said this, I&#8217;ll share with everybody, in 1989, the starting salary at that position was $22,000. I thought that was a lot of money back then and it was a lot of money because it supported me very well. Went back home, had a conversation with my mom, like, &#8220;Hey I went to this job, it looked pretty good. What do you think?&#8221; And she was like, &#8220;Are you there to do what you earned your degree in?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8220;What are they paying you?&#8221; I told her the salary. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;So what is the problem?&#8221; I said, &#8220;There&#8217;s no problem. It&#8217;s just if you&#8217;re doing what you&#8217;re supposed to be do not supposed to be doing, but if you&#8217;re doing what you&#8217;ve been, you&#8217;ve got your degree on and this is your career. What&#8217;s the issue? It&#8217;s your starting point. Now it doesn&#8217;t mean that&#8217;s your end point.&#8221; And with talking to my mom, I was like, &#8220;You know what, that makes sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so after that conversation, it again, coincidentally I got a call from the art director that I met. She offered me the job now and I was like, &#8220;Okay, yeah, I&#8217;ll take it, I&#8217;ll see you.&#8221; And I started working, I stayed there five years. And so I rose from associate art director to an art director for monthly magazines. And yes, they were all towards the gay market. I learned quite a lot. I learned that if you are a good designer, you can design for any market. It&#8217;s about understanding your market and understanding what you&#8217;re doing for, what are you doing in that project to address your market. And the benefit of doing that magazine was that it wasn&#8217;t a straight just pictorial kind of magazine. It had lifestyle. So they had editorial in there and it was, unless you know what the magazine was, it could have just been in any mainstream magazine.</p>
<p>At the time The Advocate and Out were two magazines in the gay market that just kind of came out and they were getting a lot of shine. They were the number ones and they were beautifully done magazines. They were beautifully designed. And I kind of used that as my inspiration to model, to sort do my lifestyle stuff as, which was very successful. And it helped me transition from there to my next gig, which was at Essence Communications. But in those five years, that&#8217;s when I started. We transitioned about a year. Yeah, I think it was about a year after I started transitioning into computers. The Mac.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>

In 1991, I believe. Because that was the other premise I stayed with. Well I wanted to take the opportunity too is that they had said they were going to make that transition from doing stuff production wise with the mechanical boards to move into doing the work electronically. Now that they were going to use Mac. I&#8217;m sorry, that wasn&#8217;t in 1991. That was 1990.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, it was 1990 because I started in &#8217;89 and then I think in the spring of 1990, that&#8217;s when they started introducing the Mac, gave us courses. We went out there and myself and my other coworker who was the other associate art director on the magazine I was working on, we just blew it out. We were at class and then we would come back to the office and take what we had in class to apply it and continue it. Learning and doing stuff and seeing how things work when we were back in the office. And our art director at the time was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s great because you&#8217;re going to help me learn this because I don&#8217;t get what&#8217;s going on.&#8221; And he was older than us and stuff like that. But it was fun. And it made things go so much faster. And now we are doing our own type setting.</p>
<p>We now scanning images so we now can place them into our documents. We actually have the live files where we actually start learning how to photo retouch, photo calibrate how to type, how to create special print techniques like masking, fit colors, all this stuff that. The bad side of that was it actually, with the advent of the Mac, it eliminated whole industries. We lost type houses. Those faded out because now people could do it themselves. We lost a lot of production folks who actually, if you didn&#8217;t actually do the boards yourself, you could hire people to do it. No, just create and then give the directions to them, to losing some of the business with the photostat houses, those closed out. And those closed out [inaudible 01:04:52] within one year after the Apple came onto the market. Changed the whole face of downtown Manhattan, which used to be all type setting printers and photostat houses. By 1991 it was virtually a ghost town from those businesses. They had gone.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
They had transitioned to something else. So some of the photostat houses turned into scanning places. So they could scan some original art now because illustration, especially big pieces. Because at that time a lot of the illustrators still did the work by hand. They didn&#8217;t do digital work and some of these pieces were pretty big. They couldn&#8217;t fit your normal day tabletop scan because all this stuff back then was pricey as heck. Tabletop scanner poly was like next to a $1,000. That was a lot of money. So it was cheaper just to send it out and get a $50 scan now and you just get that scan to you and you can put it on. But that changed the where you no longer now had your battle scars so your fingers were saved, you didn&#8217;t have to cut up your fingers anymore. And it also kept from getting blood on the boards. Because that was always interesting when we got blood on the boards. Because you had to wipe that out. Otherwise that&#8217;s in the actual, when they shoot it. Now it&#8217;s just clean.</p>
<p>And now at this point though, our role shifted as creatives because so much stuff relied on us. We actually had to know how to operate this Mac inside and out. Especially when if there was a problem with the Mac. Yeah, we had IT, quote &#8220;IT department&#8221;, but thankfully the Mac was and still is very sort of self-sufficient. So when things go down it&#8217;s kind of easy to figure out what&#8217;s going on to get it back up. But that usually relied to us. In the beginning we had a service that would come in and fix that stuff, but eventually the owner was like, &#8220;Look, you guys are working on this. Do you know how to do this because we&#8217;re cutting this.&#8221; But it actually opened up more doors on the creative side.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, we lost a lot of industry and a lot of people had to adapt, some folks didn&#8217;t because of the manual nature of design at that point. A lot of them were older generations. So they did not want to learn how to use the computers and learned these programs, very much today. It&#8217;s a generational thing. The older generation just was like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t change. I learned all this. How am I going to, I don&#8217;t want to sit down and learn this whole new program and this contraption to do this.&#8221; And that&#8217;s where a lot of folks didn&#8217;t make that transition. They either had to leave the industry and do something else or just completely retire.</p>
<p>And like I said, that changed the shape of downtown Manhattan because it also changed the printers. And a lot of those started consolidating and shrinking down to what we see today. But it also sped up our creative process. So if we had an idea, we could actually instantaneously see how it works. Where at that time it was QuarkXpress, that was the defacto thing. There was no creative cloud. Adobe was this brand new company battling with Macromedia, battling with, what was the other one? Oh, Publisher. Yes. QuarkXpress had to battle Microsoft Publisher back in the day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember Microsoft Publisher.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, we had not Illustrator, but it was freehand and Photoshop was Photoshop. That never disappeared. And so you had to buy all these individually. So back then being a designer was expensive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Expensive. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Because the Macs themselves were these god awful paper weights. Because the face of the Apple, I mean at the time it looks sleek, but looking at it now, it&#8217;s like, oh man, that&#8217;s [inaudible 01:09:16].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It was a big rectangle kind of thing, right?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It was like the screen and the CPU were all in one.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yes, that version. Yes, they had that. The screen was probably no more than maybe 13 inches, which seemed big at the time. And then they transitioned to having the monitor separate from the tower because everything was a tower back then. And that&#8217;s where the screen started getting bigger and stuff. But it&#8217;s still, it cost a lot of money and everything was on a disc. Nothing was cloud-based. Because the internet didn&#8217;t come into play until 1985. Is that correct?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, the cloud wasn&#8217;t a thing back then. Everything was-</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, the cloud didn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Everything was floppy discs. And then the floppy discs gave way to those smaller hard discs.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Floppy to the ZIP to actually floppy to the Quest, to the ZIP to the dat. Thank God we didn&#8217;t have to do the dat much. And then there was something in between. It was a hybrid of a ZIP and the Quest, is that right? I forgot the technology in it. But it went through some iterations in the span of five years. Now each year was something new, which was expensive. It was crap. I mean it didn&#8217;t come out of my pocket, but it was expensive. But you had to adapt to each of those technologies and stuff.</p>
<p>Basically if you kind of damaged your CDs, there was no way to get a backup. If your machines got corrupted, the disc got corrupted and corrupted meaning by, just scratched the back of that disc because somebody did not put it up properly. It&#8217;s done. That would mean you have to spend another $1,000 to go buy some brand new disc of one program. Same with type, you have to do same with type, all that stuff. But it did enable to have more creative tools at hand. So if you had an idea, you could still do it by hand, but now you could translate it, do your sketch and translate it onto the computer where you can actually do different variations in the same day where it may have taken us a few days to do iterations of one idea.</p>
<p>And that sped up a lot of stuff and it was kind of cool. It expanded our imaginations. It put more responsibility on us, which I liked because I liked being in control and knowing what&#8217;s going on with the Mac and the program so that way I could troubleshoot myself. Because at that time I was thinking, okay, this is going to be helpful for one day when I want to start freelancing and get my own materials or when one day I have my own studio. Because back then I thought about my end goals. I had this studio, get this whole staff and become a small to midsize kind of well known studio. And that&#8217;s pretty much the early days. It was very much unexplored. So anything and everything was open and it was just, if you were into adventure, it was an adventure. You were so curious to see what the next thing was going to be.</p>
<p>Whereas today I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Look, slow down. Yeah, there&#8217;s too much stuff coming out. I just learned this, now you got something new. No, no, no, no, that&#8217;s not happening. That&#8217;s too fast.&#8221; As well as I think today, technology&#8217;s great, but I think it also makes people stupider, people put more faith on the tech versus their thinking and they&#8217;re not sort of, they&#8217;re relying too much on the machine and not relying on themselves. Because the machine is just a tool. And in the early days we did see that. It was just a tool. That&#8217;s all we looked at. It was like, unless we had our thoughts together before we went to the machine, we&#8217;d be wasting our time. Because you&#8217;re just fiddling around just getting lost in this virtual world. Today it seems to be the reverse. People don&#8217;t mind fiddling on there and they spend so many hours that basically are futile, they just waste stuff.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s how the early days were. It was a really a fun exploratory, I don&#8217;t want to say Wild, Wild West, but it kind of was a Wild, Wild West. And then when the net came on board, because I remember fully using the internet in &#8217;95, but we actually did have the internet. The company was called a Mavety Media. I think that came, we had that online around 1993 because I left Mavety Media in 1995. So yeah, I think it had just started. And at that time I think it was all, everything was AOL or Netscape. And the net just was, oh, we just went bonkers with that. It was just like, oh, I can get this right now. Even though that was on dial up. So that was taking a long time. Dial up, I don&#8217;t miss at all. You could not do any high files with that or anything like that. It just was too slow. But that&#8217;s what the early days were like. It was kind of cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When I give presentations sometimes I&#8217;ll tell people how in the early days of the web you had a fast lane and a slow lane. The fast lane was like if you had 56K and the slow lane was 28.8. I love that you&#8217;re talking about all of this because I feel like this is something which is definitely not talked about in this current age of design. Everything is done in the cloud, on the web, on a PC or a Mac so quickly. Sometimes even just on mobile devices. I see what people do designing on just mobile devices. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;This blows my mind.&#8221; Because I was in high school in the &#8217;90s when a lot of this technology was coming out. And to your point, as you were mentioning, these things were changing rapidly, as the technology was changing, there were no sort of monopolies like an Adobe, like we&#8217;re talking about now. But there was Adobe, there was Macromedia, there were other sorts of products. There was Quark. You had to try to figure out which one you wanted to do.</p>
<p>It was all extremely expensive and there really was no, I want to say there was no learning curve, but you learned by having to actually get in there and work it or go through those huge big, thick instruction manuals. Because there&#8217;s no-</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s no YouTube video, there&#8217;s no class you can go to that&#8217;s going to teach you how to do this. You got to read that 1,000 page manual and figure out how to type set these columns and how to do all this stuff. I mean, to your point about the Wild, Wild West, it really was a time when I think innovation was happening at a speed where people were really just trying to catch up.</p>
<p>You had these different options. Like you said, you could do Quark, you could do Adobe, you could do Macromedia. And a lot of jobs sometimes even when you applied to them wanted you to know one more than the other. It wasn&#8217;t so much about whether or not I think you had the skill, but more so whether you knew the program. And I think that&#8217;s something which technology has definitely changed a lot. It&#8217;s less about the skills and more about, &#8220;Do you know how to use Figma? Do you know how to use Sketch?&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;But I&#8217;m a designer.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well we really well we use Figma. So do you know how to use that?&#8221; It&#8217;s so different now.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Well, I mean back then when I was looking at stuff, when I was doing job searches, when I was moving from space to space, the thing that did start happening was that they wanted you to know this insane amount of programs. I think they just listed these programs because that&#8217;s what was out. And they were like, we want you to know everything. And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s impossible. You can&#8217;t know all this stuff.&#8221; And it was very much, I don&#8217;t think they really wanted skill set, but just to say, &#8220;Okay, well we have somebody who knows this,&#8221; regardless of whether or not they actually know how to use it. I could have just went into the program one time just to look at it, oh, I know this program now.</p>
<p>That kind of impeded some people as they looked for jobs back then because it was like, &#8220;Look, I don&#8217;t know this stuff. I&#8217;m not going to put this down and then get busted when they give me this.&#8221; And like, &#8220;Hey, we need this full fledged project done in this, by this time,&#8221; and you don&#8217;t even know what you&#8217;re doing with it. I mean, granted, there were some people who did do that and coasted by until they got found out later on. But by then they could kind of sweet talk it through and then others shamelessly got blasted. I remember that back then. But yeah, it&#8217;s where it went from it was like more, &#8220;Okay, what is your true skill set and experience that you&#8217;ve actually shown a pattern of this,&#8221; versus, &#8220;Here&#8217;s our laundry list. Just let us know you&#8217;ve done this.&#8221;</p>
<p>I still kind of see that today though. And whenever there&#8217;s some new tech out, I do see some of these listings out here. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, do you know this?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, that just came out last week. How are people going to know this?&#8221; But I mean I think that&#8217;s going to stick forever that&#8217;s going to be there. Because any new tech that comes out, I think people in the who post these jobs, I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re really the ones that, and we all know it&#8217;s HR departments, and so the HR departments don&#8217;t really know what people do in their day to day stuff. So I think they just put all the trendy stuff in there just to cover their bases.</p>
<p>But I do miss some of that from back in the day. And it was kind of cool. And I mean, there is some new stuff like that today, particularly in terms of web and video that I see some parallels that I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Ooh, that&#8217;s intriguing.&#8221; But now with a seasoned book, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s kind overwhelming.&#8221; I kind of feel overwhelmed at times. Like, oh, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m going to learn all that. Yeah. But it would be cool. Yes.</p>
