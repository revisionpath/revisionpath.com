Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>Summer is over, y&#8217;all. As we head into a new season, it&#8217;s a perfect time to pause and reflect, gain some clarity, and reassure yourself about your purpose. That&#8217;s exactly what this week&#8217;s guest Janessa Robinson is doing, particularly now that she&#8217;s at the beginning of a new adventure &#8212; moving to Los Angeles!</p>
<p>Our conversation began with Janessa talking about the recent move, and she spoke a bit about her day job as a content creator. We also dived into the backstory behind her company Artistry Land, and Janessa discussed how she works as a creative with Asperger&#8217;s, and how she cleverly uses design thinking as a way to manifest success in her life.

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I am Janessa Robinson and I&#8217;m an artist and an entertainer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So how are things going for you right now? What&#8217;s on your mind?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Oh, well, things are going great. I just moved to Los Angeles a month ago, actually drove down here from San Francisco.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It was an interesting experience. That&#8217;s the first road trip that I&#8217;ve taken by myself before. It was amazing because as I pulled into Los Angeles, it really hit me that I live here, that I&#8217;m moving here as a resident. Each other time that I came to LA, it was to visit. I stayed with a cousin once who lived in east LA, she&#8217;s a screenwriter. Every time before that, it was like I came through LAX Airport on my way somewhere else. So I just wanted to stay. I&#8217;m very happy that I&#8217;m here. It&#8217;s a very significant change for me because I spent three years living in San Francisco. And ever since I was a small child, I&#8217;ve always wanted to live here, and not just live here, but be a leader in the community here to contribute something. I just saw that my life is here. So it&#8217;s an amazing experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. It sounds like you&#8217;ve had a pretty transformative year then, especially with this move.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I would say COVID is interesting. There&#8217;s a lot of change for everyone. For me, I went from, oh gosh, spending four hours in traffic, just commuting between San Francisco and Santa Clara to staying at home. And me being like, okay, great. Well, now I can spend all the time I want on my art because we were essentially confined to our homes in the beginning. I decided that I would start dancing every day. I was recording myself and posting these videos on Instagram. I actually made a very intentional decision that I would turn my Instagram page into like a television channel. It&#8217;s like a show. It&#8217;s like an entertainment show. I called it Variety Nessa. [inaudible 00:06:08] dancing and rapping and singing and just shooting really interesting content in ways that would engage people since we were at home. I was like, &#8220;Hey, check this out.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
That led me into doing music actually. I was producing, writing, singing, taking singing and song arrangement lessons, piano lessons, mixing and mastering my own music. I used an algorithm actually to master my music. Yeah, it was really interesting. And sharing it on Bandcamp. My first project, I actually worked with a producing partner where he did the mixes and masters. So I just spent the last year growing tremendously, artistically, getting in FTs and graphic design, just blossoming, just honestly blossoming. It&#8217;s an amazing, amazing year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now you&#8217;re also breaking a bin into Hollywood too, right?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yes. Yeah. I actually literally live in Hollywood. That&#8217;s my community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
That&#8217;s where my home is located, which is really cool. Yeah, I am training at two Hollywood acting studios right now. One is Shari Shaw Studio, which is physically located in Hollywood, although I haven&#8217;t gone there yet because of COVID. And then the other is Leslie Kahn &#038; Co. Both of these studios are very special to me. The instructors there, my classmates, the energy and the way that we all invest into each other, it&#8217;s just very special to me. Then I&#8217;m very happy because for me, Hollywood, physically, and more metaphorically, the Hollywood community, which is spread out across the world. There&#8217;s Hollywood the location, and then there&#8217;s Hollywood the industry, which is just, it&#8217;s a bunch of us who are very, very fond of entertaining and see a lot of value in it.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
For me, something that over the last year I was really reminded of is my family history in Hollywood. I have a great, great grandmother named Eva Wheatley Jones who danced with Josephine Baker. She&#8217;s one of the first &#8220;tan girls.&#8221; Meaning that she&#8217;s light-skin, brown, but not dark-skin brown, but at that time it was considered progress, I suppose.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I guess they all just call it colored back then, right?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. I think that didn&#8217;t even come on mind. Yeah. She&#8217;s one of the first tan girls to dance with Josephine Baker. She is married to a comedian and he was a part of a comedy dance duo, same as Butter Beans. Then I have a great uncle, Arthur, who played in a jazz band for Al Capone at the Copacabana in Chicago. There&#8217;s just a lot of people in my family that have really contributed to make the Hollywood entertainment industry what it is today. The inclinations that I have for all of these different forms of art, I just love art, I just love design. For me, it&#8217;s about the process and the experience. Whatever the tools are, I&#8217;ll just use them to just make something magnificent. I don&#8217;t really care what the tools are. I want to do cool stuff.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It occurred to me when my mom was sharing all this information with me, that was shared with me in my childhood, but this is now, I&#8217;m in my adulthood, and now it resonates more to understand, oh, I see. These are the giftings that my family, that my ancestors, recent and much further back, that they&#8217;ve bestowed on me. So I feel very, very blessed and very grateful and appreciative to be in the position, to know that, to see that, and to activate on what it is that they have deposited into me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. It sounds like it&#8217;s literally in your blood to be an entertainer. You come from that lineage. That&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah. It is. It&#8217;s in my blood. That&#8217;s what my mom says. She goes, &#8220;This is who you are. This is in your DNA. These are your genes.&#8221; That&#8217;s what she tells me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So let&#8217;s talk about one of the things that you&#8217;re currently doing. You&#8217;re a content creator for a company called News Break. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting. So, News Break is a news publication that is available as a website, newsbreak.com, and as a downloadable mobile application. So people can go visit their App Stores or Google Play Store and download News Break. It is interesting because it solves a problem. It solves the problem of gathering local news over, gosh, I don&#8217;t know, the last, you could say 20, 30, 40 years. It depends on how far you want to go back. But we know that for some time, there&#8217;s been a trend of investment into local news dwindling. News Break prioritizes local news on the app and the website based on the geolocation of the user. It also pulls in national news. But the thing is that national news, it&#8217;s pretty repetitive. [crosstalk 00:11:37] the news wires. So it&#8217;s the same story over and over. It just has a slightly different, it depends if. It&#8217;s a news wire, it&#8217;s just going to be the exact same thing.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
But in most cases, it might be a slightly different tone based on the writer&#8217;s style or it just has a different mass head that it&#8217;s under. But national news, now that we have Twitter and YouTube and all these things that help us communicate one story to billions of people instantaneously, it&#8217;s just pretty repetitive. So local news is pretty cool because it&#8217;s specific to what&#8217;s happening in your community, in your neighborhood. Like what&#8217;s going on. I first started writing for News Break just as I was leaving San Francisco. I was writing stories there, and then as I moved here, I switched to writing local stories about Los Angeles. Honestly, I like to report on really interesting people, local businesses. I love reporting on food. I&#8217;m a pescatarian and I&#8217;m allergic to dairy. So I like to go out and see, well, where are the best seafood tacos? Because I love seafood food tacos. Where can I get a really good salmon sandwich? Just write about that. Also, I like to eat those things.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I like to be in that moment and just allow my palette to be dazzled and then take all of that energy in and write about that so that I can recommend to people where to go. I&#8217;ll say that LA is LA. There&#8217;s no place like Los Angeles. Reporting here has been very interesting. I just did a story on a luxury experience service company called the [inaudible 00:13:27]. I hope that people do not, the French people do not criticize French accent, but I do speak a bit of French. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s mostly accurate, but yeah, I got to report on this luxury experience company and meet the owner who&#8217;s a very private person. So I&#8217;ll respect his privacy.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s the fact that I&#8217;m talking about luxury experience company that we will, if I say, Hey, I wanna fly to Monaco for a private shopping trip tomorrow, they&#8217;ll put that together right now. They&#8217;ll have a driver come pick me up. They&#8217;ll have a private jet waiting for me. There&#8217;ll be food, snacks that are on the way, all these things. It&#8217;s just this amazing company that in comparison to my time in San Francisco, it&#8217;s not to say that that doesn&#8217;t exist there, it&#8217;s just maybe not as ingrained into the culture like in San Francisco. It&#8217;s more like, where&#8217;s the best vegan place to eat or what&#8217;s a really good mountain to climb, is what draws people there more so than LA, which is how fabulous can I live?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds very LA, something like that.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
LA was the last city that I visited before all this pandemic stuff. We did a live show there back in Jan&#8230; Well, it was January or February. It was February. Yeah, it was February of 2020. We did a live show down in Leimert Park. That was pretty good. I didn&#8217;t get to see a ton of LA. I just remember LA being so big. I stayed in Koreatown and the event that we did was in Leimert Park. Then I was in another part of town, not too far from Koreatown. Because I was also there for a work conference. People that were there were like, &#8220;Oh, you should go to the beach.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, but it&#8217;s going to take about an hour to get there.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, that doesn&#8217;t really sound like something I want to do if it&#8217;s going to take that long to get there.&#8221; It&#8217;s still in the city, I guess I didn&#8217;t realize the enormity of Los Angeles until I actually got there and was like, this place is huge, really spread out.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It is, it is very large, honestly. First of all, I hope that you come, that you return to LA and do another live show so that I can be on it. What I was going to say is that before I moved here, the last time I visited was just before the pandemic. I don&#8217;t know if it was around the same time that you were here, but it was just before the pandemic, where the Los Angeles Clippers flew me out here for an interview. I was interviewing for a job there and they flew me down from San Francisco. And oh my gosh, when I got to LAX, I had about, I think like maybe 45 minutes or an hour between landing and the time of my interview. I was like, oh, that&#8217;s plenty of time [inaudible 00:16:27]. I was like, oh my God, am I going to make it? What is going on?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It was just so stressful and I almost missed my flight on the way back. Because I was in those interviews all day and then I was like, I don&#8217;t think they know what time my flight [inaudible 00:16:47]. No one&#8217;s paying attention. So apparently I have to tell them, &#8220;Hey, I have to go catch this flight.&#8221; I almost missed it. When I was in the process of traveling back to San Francisco, I was like, wow. Yeah, it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve lived in a city that&#8217;s really large. I&#8217;m from Chicago. I lived in New York for a bit. Then I started to wonder, I was like, a city with eight million people? LA, do I want to do that? I don&#8217;t know. But then I do. I was like, I don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;ll deal with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right, right.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
So now it&#8217;s like, sure, it&#8217;ll take an hour to get to Santa Monica. That&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;ll just listen to some good music and chill in the car. It&#8217;s no big deal.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was surprised by how much traffic there was. I live in Atlanta, which is notorious for traffic, but Los Angeles has Atlanta beat it hands down. The traffic that I would see, or that actually was stuck in on the one on one was hellish. It was ridiculous.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s tough. I&#8217;ll say, I don&#8217;t have my only comparison points for being in traffic or me being a passenger because this is the first time in my life that I&#8217;ve ever driven regularly. This is the first car that I&#8217;ve ever owned. [inaudible 00:18:03]. I don&#8217;t know. When I was growing up, everyone drove me around for the most part. Even when I got a license, that was still the case. And then when I graduated high school, I went to undergrad. I studied at St. John&#8217;s University in New York, where very few people drove regularly around there.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Then by the time, I transferred and graduated from Tulane University in New Orleans, so by the time I did that, Uber was a thing. It was not yet an app, it&#8217;s text-based, but you could just text this number and a black car would pull up. I thought it was sketchy at first. I was like, [inaudible 00:18:47] kidnap me. Who&#8217;s in the car? But yeah, so then I just Ubered around for almost eight years. Now I own a car and I&#8217;m like, oh, traffic, this is what it&#8217;s like to drive in traffic. So yeah, it&#8217;s interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I missed those early days of Uber when they just had the black cars. But for what I remember, I would take them in different cities, but the one thing that I remember is how much the drivers hated it. Because for them, they&#8217;re used to, I guess if you&#8217;re a black car driver, like a Lincolnton car or something like that, there&#8217;s a certain, I think, clientele that you&#8217;re used to in terms of decorum and all that stuff. Now they&#8217;re picking up drunk kids at the bar and driving them three blocks and then having to clean up vomit from the back seat.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember talking to, I did it for an article, this was back in the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Jesus, maybe 10 years ago, I think. God, wow, [inaudible 00:19:48] services have been around that long. But I remember talking to some drivers and them being like, &#8220;Yeah, I hate it. I don&#8217;t know what this Uber thing is, but it&#8217;s some extra money. But I don&#8217;t like the fact that we have to pick up these folks and they give us attitude. And it&#8217;s just a different thing.&#8221; Now of course, ride sharing is a pretty, I think, common thing because now folks can even use their own cars. But I remember in the beginning though, just taking those black cars and it just felt so official. Like, oh, this is nice. I felt wealthy.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah, it is. I would agree. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re used to a very specific persona for clientele. I remember when I was in D.C., I was out with some friends and we ordered, this is when Uber was an app, but I think we got Uber black, because it was so many of us and we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get a SUV or whatever.&#8221; I had this friend who was giving the Uber driver directions, which is already like, I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re doing this, he has a map, what are you doing? He tells the driver, he was like, &#8220;Yeah, bang a right right here.&#8221; And the driver drove straight through the intersection.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Whoa.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
He doesn&#8217;t know what bang a right means. He was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what that is.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;Bang a right, what is this?&#8221; And just kept going straight. I think also, he maybe didn&#8217;t like that this guy was leaning over the seat, giving him directions. But yeah, there was some clear maybe mismatch of energy there. So, those funny.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to talk to you about this term, content creator, because it&#8217;s certainly one that I think has popped up, I don&#8217;t know, maybe with over the past two years or so. We&#8217;ve been seeing this generalization of people that maybe before have done specialized stuff, like they&#8217;ve been writers or illustrators or whatever. Now it&#8217;s just this generic term, content creator. When I hear it, I feel like it&#8217;s mostly associated with video. But I&#8217;m curious, when you hear that phrase, content creator, what does that mean to you?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Honestly, I don&#8217;t know what&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. It could be in a lot of things. I have Asperger&#8217;s. One of the characteristics of that is a person might see a word or a phrase and their mind starts to run through the multiple meanings or ways that it could be used, the etymology, at least for me because I&#8217;m a linguist. Honestly for me, it&#8217;s like a placeholder, just some words, just some letters, some syllables that go there to describe the way that someone moves through the world. It&#8217;s used in a lot of ways, I agree. Like sometimes it&#8217;s used for writers, sometimes it&#8217;s used for people who run podcasts, sometimes it&#8217;s for video people. I think in the context of News Break, it&#8217;s [inaudible 00:22:45]. I think it&#8217;s because they use content creator because in a lot of cases, they&#8217;re looking for someone who&#8217;s more than a writer.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Being a writer is great. It&#8217;s an excellent skill. But in the digital space, when you&#8217;re developing articles, unless you have a full editorial staff where you have photographers and art directors and video producers that are their own individual team, then the writer, the journalist becomes the person who wears all those hats. So I&#8217;m that person. I do interview people. I develop sources and relationships, I interview them. I shoot photography, I edit photography, I shoot video, I edit video and I polish it all up and I drop there. So for me, I guess that&#8217;s what I associate with now, is if I&#8217;m a content creator, I&#8217;m someone who I create any kind of content.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s like the same thing where I&#8217;m like, yeah, I can make my own music from end to end. Whatever the content is, it&#8217;s something I can create. It&#8217;s [inaudible 00:23:48] the way that I see it, but I don&#8217;t know. I think it can be one, is that now going to be the expectation. Our specialties no longer going to be as prized being a really excellent writer. I think for some people that might be maybe all they want or maybe they only want to do photography. I don&#8217;t know. I feel good about it because I can do all those things and I like doing all those things, but what about someone who doesn&#8217;t want to do all those things? But if they have a very strong interest in one area, I hope there&#8217;s still space for those people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It sounds like it&#8217;s a new way of looking at Jack of all trades. That&#8217;s how, I guess, it used to be called, where you did a lot of different things. You just brought a lot of different skills to the table. I had a friend that, actually, he really explained it to me in a way that made sense. It&#8217;s like, he says, &#8220;Content these days is water and whatever the medium is or the platform is the container that content can fill.&#8221; So for example, let&#8217;s say, oh, so there&#8217;s this guy, he&#8217;s a chef. His name is chef John Kung. He was mostly doing stuff on TikTok, I think. But the concept is him cooking, which can be extrapolated to any number of different platforms because he&#8217;s using video.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So in that video format, yes, it could go on TikTok, but it could also go on Instagram. It could also go on YouTube, but you could see how these different platforms would have different audiences, different levels of engagement, et cetera. But someone could also take that and take the video out, and now you just have the audio and that could be a podcast. Or someone could transcribe that audio, and now that&#8217;s an article. Or someone can take that article and make images of it, and now it&#8217;s an infographic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So content ends up being this, it&#8217;s the idea and then whatever that medium or platform is, is how it can trickle down and filter down. But yeah, that&#8217;s if you want to do all of that stuff. For example, I consider myself a podcaster, but I have had people call me a content creator because I can do video dah, dah, dah, dah. I mostly just do podcasting because that&#8217;s what form this particular idea is in. But yeah, Revision Path could be video and articles and all this stuff. I choose for it not to be, but it could be. I hear that term, content creator, and it&#8217;s like, I was bristle at it a little bit because I&#8217;m like, be specific. But then maybe that&#8217;s just me being older thinking it has to be in one of these finite categories or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
That&#8217;s interesting. I think I like it because it is flexible and broad. For me, today I might want to write articles, tomorrow I might want to shoot a film. I don&#8217;t like figuring out the way to label myself in regards to the way that I contribute artistically. I don&#8217;t know. I end up with a lot of words. If you go to my website right on Janessarobinson.com or artistryland.space, there&#8217;s an area in both places to read my bio. And it says Janessa Robinson is a publish journalist, a writer, an actor, a photographer, a this, a that. There&#8217;s so many, what would I call this? I was like, I don&#8217;t know what to&#8230; I like when there&#8217;s something that&#8217;s flexible or broad enough. The word artist, I love it because you could be a performance artist, you could be a singer, you could be a poet.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s flexible enough in a way where someone who creates art at this point is not just a singer or not just a poet. If you&#8217;re an artist, it means that you have a particular artistic vision, artistic gaze and artistic process and you apply that to whatever medium. The medium at that point isn&#8217;t as relevant as it is to maybe whatever the message is that you want to communicate. The question that becomes, is this the best medium or is this the proper medium or the best way to reach people? What&#8217;s the goal? So with content creator, I like it because otherwise, it&#8217;s like, well, am I a writer, video producer or this? And it&#8217;s like, it becomes this long list. In Hollywood when someone is multi talented that way, we used to call it a triple threat. Like Jamie Foxx, he&#8217;ll sing, he&#8217;ll act, he&#8217;ll produce like comedy, whatever. You call this person a triple threat. Today, we call it a multi hyphenate because triple is not true.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
At that point, it&#8217;s less about the specific activities, like what it is that someone&#8217;s doing and more about who they are and what they bring to whatever they touch. That&#8217;s how I identify. It&#8217;s like if you give me a camera, I&#8217;m going to start shooting things. If you give me a microphone, I&#8217;m going to start singing. It&#8217;s more this artistic energy. So with content creation, I feel very similar. Whereas my content creation might be NFTs and graphic design today. It might be videos and editing, cutting together audio the next day. I like that.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
When I formed my company, Artistry Land, you have to fill out this business paperwork and articulate, well, what are the products of the services? One of the things that I put is digital and physical content. Then I put some examples. I said, including but not limited to, because it&#8217;s Artistry Land, it&#8217;s a land of art. It&#8217;s just going to be whatever I need it to be. I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m figuring that out every day. I love that exploration. I think that&#8217;s amazing. I get to learn a lot and connect with people in ways that are relevant and timely to the present.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about Artistry Land. This is a company that you started a few years ago. Tell me more about it. What are some of the projects and things that you&#8217;ve done through Artistry Land?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah. I was already operating as an entrepreneur since maybe 2014. I began freelance writing and I was gaining all of these opportunities to be published in really great sources and publications like Huffington Post and Salon and Ebony and WAC, [inaudible 00:30:21], The Crisis Magazine and The Guardian. I just thought that was a cool thing to do on the side. And then maybe two years ago, I think, it was occurring to me that I could formalize this business. I could formalize this business into something that grows beyond just freelance writing. My father is an entrepreneur. He&#8217;s been an entrepreneur for a long, long time. He actually is a former professional basketball player. He was drafted to the Utah Jazz and then he went to play in Europe for about eight years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah. Then when he came back, he did some sales stuff while he still had entrepreneurial things going on, and then I just grew up with watching him build businesses. So I thought to myself, well, you know what I really like about my dad&#8217;s entrepreneurship, that it allows him to live, to be fully human, to not be tied to someone else&#8217;s schedule, to make his own decisions about where he needs to be, and when particularly as it relates to him living his purpose. So with Artistry Land, I did these brainstorm exercises and I was like, well, what is my business? What does it do? Who does it serve? Before I came to a name, by the time I went through my research, I was like, okay, well, who&#8217;s Janessa? Janessa does love to write, but Janessa is so much more than that. Here I was dancing on Instagram and I was like, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
At this point I had also had a short film. It&#8217;s a 30 second film featured in Time Magazine and Ava DuVernay&#8217;s Optimist issue, [inaudible 00:32:10] Optimist issue video project. I was like, I do love film. I studied cinema and I grew up in theater and I did do some acting classes in college. I was like, here I am, I want to do music. I was like, well, what is this company? So I just formalized it into Artistry Land as I developed my own artistry. I operate a blog at artistryland.space, where I do produce content. It&#8217;s mostly written, something I started doing. But this year, I think in the summer, was just highlighting artists because Artistry Land is really focused on the intersection of art and wellness. I see these things as so intrinsically tied together. I don&#8217;t know a single artist whose mental health or physical or otherwise holistic health isn&#8217;t impacted by their art or their ability to produce their art or the reception of it.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Every artist I know has some health related experience to practicing their art. And for many of us, I&#8217;ll speak for myself, art is healing. I love the idea of artists who are doing well and living well. And that&#8217;s exploring what that means, what it means to do well for yourself and to do good in the world and to live well. What are the practices that you do that cultivate that experience? I&#8217;ve begun interviewing artists who do good in the world and they live well. I ask them questions about what artistic projects are most meaningful to them, what art they practice?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I interviewed a friend of mine who&#8217;s an opera singer. She lives Japan. She&#8217;s a black woman. She&#8217;s an opera singer. It&#8217;s the year 2021 and she lives in Japan. She&#8217;s a rarity by definition. She talks about her time studying Buddhism, particularly while living in Japan. For just discussing how important it is for her to be a black woman, opera singer in this very old, traditional art form, I get to learn a lot. I think it&#8217;s really important that artists continue to learn from each other. There&#8217;s a lot of folks who talk about the need for artists to support each other, which I agree 100%. I just find that it is maybe more motivating if it&#8217;s clear in terms of what we&#8217;re learning from each other. If I&#8217;m learning something, I&#8217;m going to show up. If you just go, &#8220;Hey man, you should support me.&#8221; I&#8217;m going to be like, &#8220;I would like to, but this is like you&#8217;re asking me to hug a porcupine right now. You&#8217;re not being super endearing about this.&#8221; So if you go, Hey, this is what we&#8217;re learning together, then I&#8217;m very motivated to show up.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
That&#8217;s my approach with Artistry Land, is to say, well, I want to learn from you. I hope that people, by reading your interview and being introduced to your art, by following you on Instagram or Twitter, or checking out your website, that they learn from you as well. I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s really important. Something else that I&#8217;ve done with Artistry Land is I&#8217;m developing relationships with clients. I do design work under Artistry Land. Graphic design, brand strategy, brand design work. So I have some business to business clients. One of them is called, Where is My Meeting, which is a digital video production company. I think most recently they ran a press conference for Muriel Bowser in D.C. about COVID and vaccinations. But they also did, I partner with them on this, it&#8217;s like a virtual talent show in February, which feels like a really long time ago. I was like, is that last year? It was definitely [inaudible 00:36:07]. It is called Celebrate Black Voices Talent Show. Where is My Meeting did the video production for, and we gathered all of these black artists to spotlight. So there&#8217;s poetry and there&#8217;s rap.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I shot and edited my own music video and aired it in that talent show, which is really cool. Then I also, I&#8217;ve just been searching for organizations to partner with and invest in. One of them is, oh, you probably know this, it&#8217;s the Queer BiPAP Design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. [inaudible 00:36:47].</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Exactly. I saw what they&#8217;re doing in terms of promoting design, thinking, empowering queer BiPAP people with resources to be designers professionally. And I said, &#8220;Oh, I would love to contribute.&#8221; So I decided to donate after our call that I had with Steve to just learn more about who they&#8217;re serving, how they&#8217;re serving people, what the offerings are. And then another organization that I decided to donate to is one that I used to, it&#8217;s a theater that I used to train at when I was in Chicago, it was called the Chicago Beverly Arts Center.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
When I was in high school at Morgan Park High School, I participated in an off-campus drama program at the Sphere. Because every Thursday, I was done with classes, maybe like, I think halfway through the day. Then I would go to the theater and we&#8217;d be in class all afternoon to the evening. It was me and a small group of students. The staff at the Beverly Arts Center trained us one theater. They took us into the theater onto the stage, which is not the first time I&#8217;d been on stage because I did do stage plays in elementary school. But they go, &#8220;This is downstage. This is upstage. This is what happens behind the curtains.&#8221; And then we went and we started to replays and then they had us write our own play, produce it. Do costume design, then we get to act in it.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It was the most amazing experience ever. I called the Beverly Arts Center a few weeks ago and I said, &#8220;Hey, do you still have this partnership with Morgan Park High School?&#8221; The artistic director at the time said, &#8220;Yeah, I actually need to write a grant for scholarships.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; So I donated some money for that purpose so that students there would have a scholarship to help cover their classes at the Beverly Arts Center, because it now dawns on me that someone did that for me at some point. I didn&#8217;t know. I just was there having fun, but I didn&#8217;t know that someone paid for it. Now something that I&#8217;m exploring with the Beverly Arts Center is as someone who has Asperger&#8217;s and has learned in my adult life in the last maybe year and a half, two years about it.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
When I look back, I see how much growing up in theater camp and drama class really helped me understand social settings, social norms and expectations and experiences. Because when you&#8217;re reading a play, whether it&#8217;s a table reading or you&#8217;re performing, you could be off book, whatever, you have this concept of setting and characters and relationship and subtexts under the dialogue and action. It just broke down things to me that were somewhat confusing. So I thought, Hey, maybe I can talk to the Beverly Arts Center and see if they&#8217;re interested in doing something that focuses on empowering people on the autism spectrum through this particular medium, through theater and acting.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s something we&#8217;re having a conversation about. It&#8217;s something we&#8217;re exploring. I hope that we&#8217;re able to come up with something because I just know the impact of that on my life. People have all these conceptions about, if they&#8217;re aware of autism or Asperger&#8217;s to begin with, then they might have conceptions about the way that it presents itself or what the person looks like. Generally speaking, people seem to think that I don&#8217;t &#8220;look like someone with Asperger&#8217;s,&#8221; which is like, whatever. [crosstalk 00:40:32]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, what does that mean?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know. I cringe, but then I&#8217;m like, I just listen. Thanks for sharing that. Thanks for being open and honest, but I agree. There&#8217;s not a look. And then the second thing they&#8217;ll say is, well, also I can&#8217;t tell. You don&#8217;t seem awkward or whatever. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s interesting. Because, one, I studied communication. I work in that field. So I was like, this is a very intentional set of choices of media. And two, I&#8217;ve spent my life in acting and theater and speech class and all these things that I guess at this point, people, they have no idea. But when I was a child, I remember being sent home a lot because I would go play with friends and then something would happen.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t really know what it is, but they would send me home and be like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, sometimes she&#8217;s not getting along with the children. She won&#8217;t apologize.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What would I be apologizing for?&#8221; I just didn&#8217;t understand. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Are you sorry?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;You&#8217;re supposed to say you&#8217;re sorry.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Why would I say something I don&#8217;t mean?&#8221; It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t have a problem with remorse or regret. I&#8217;m a human. It&#8217;s just that whatever the social norm or expectation that I broke, I didn&#8217;t understand the concept of it. I was like, what is it that you&#8217;re expecting? Because you haven&#8217;t stated it directly to me. And if you haven&#8217;t expressed it verbally to me or in writing, that&#8217;s preferable. If you put it in writing, then I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on. I was like, I just don&#8217;t&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Simple things like&#8230; A friend was mentioning to me the other day, he knew a child on the spectrum and he sat down as a child on the sofa and started talking to him and the kid was just locked gazed on the television and wouldn&#8217;t look my friend in the eye. And I was like, even that, I don&#8217;t get that. If you came over to sit down next to me and I&#8217;m watching television, you&#8217;re now disrupting me. I was like, [inaudible 00:42:38]. I don&#8217;t understand. So anyway, I like Artistry Land because it gets to explore these different aspects of art in the way that it shows up in people&#8217;s lives. It&#8217;s typically connected to someone&#8217;s early childhood experience or some transformative life change that they&#8217;ve made in their adulthood, but people that I talk to feel drawn to it.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I see Artistry Land as a publication by an artists for artists and also this house, this art house of content that I am developing as I grow my business. At some point I want to hire people. I&#8217;m just trying to figure out how to go about that. The whole thing about being a business owner with employees, that seems intimidating, but it&#8217;s really important because I want to employ artists. So I&#8217;m figuring it out along the way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I think LA certainly is going to be a great city for that. To me, I always see it as this destination location for people that are trying to strike out on their own. I think that&#8217;s just part of the, how am I going to say part of the American story of moving out west, manifest destiny, going into parts unknown and that sort of thing? But LA in particular, when it comes to creativity, it&#8217;s one of the few cities people really look to make a name for themselves. They&#8217;ll do that in LA or they&#8217;ll do it in New York. It&#8217;s one of those two places.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I agree, 100% agree. So funny you say that because what led me out here at this point in my life is a series of very mystical metaphysical experiences that drew me to say, I was working in policy in Washington, D.C. at the time, which is if you work in DC, you pretty much work in policy. What else are you going to do there? Yeah, I enjoyed the work in that it&#8217;s so impactful. I worked with an environmentalist organization, human rights organization. I met community leaders and organizers from Guatemala, from Brazil. People were literally fighting for their land rights, for their homes, for their access to food and water. Yet as an artist, I was not being fed. I don&#8217;t know what the bounds are of this podcast, but I&#8217;ll just mention that I did [shrooms 00:44:59].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Okay. It was a very, very interesting experience that led me to being reconnected with these aspects of myself that weren&#8217;t being fed. So art and being an artist is one of those things. I had all of these moments in meditation, where I saw myself living in Los Angeles as an artist and doing so in a way that&#8217;s incredibly meaningful. Because I had built up all of this awareness about politics and the intersection of race, gender class. And these are all things that I was writing about. Yet we were looking at Hollywood at that time like, why is it not getting what&#8217;s going on in the world? Why does Hollywood not understand that some of these pictures are not going to do well or that some of these narratives are no longer acceptable?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Basically, it just came to me that I&#8217;m going to be moving here and I&#8217;ll be someone to contribute something of significance in the area of progress. It all happened very quickly. I found myself quitting my job. I was in a relationship, breaking up with my boyfriend, breaking my lease and just all in two weeks, everything changed. I actually traveled around the country for a bit at that time. I visited LA, where I stayed with my cousin in east LA and I spent time walking around. I visited Vegas and Arizona and I went to concerts and then I spent all my money and I had to go back to Chicago.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I had to go back to Chicago. I actually went to take care of my grandfather because he was in his late age at the time. And then I worked at my father&#8217;s basketball program called In the Paint Basketball. I had to go back to Chicago, not just because I ran out of money, because I had $70,000 in student loan debt at the time. So I needed a lot of money, and that&#8217;s where I rebuilt myself. I spent about eight hours in meditation per day just getting to understand what most fulfills me and allowing my subconscious to open itself up to my super conscious mind so that it became very clear to me about what to do and how to do it. So I went through the process of job seeking. I did some temp work for a little bit and I was interviewing.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Then I landed a job at Greater Good Studio in Logan Square on the north side of Chicago. It was a really amazing experience because when I got there, I was introduced to design thinking. I had been curious about it, heard about it, but when I got there and I learned about design thinking, I learned that there are some elements of it that I had already been using, which helped me find that job, like this idea of developing product features. So sometimes designers will write whatever product is or what it&#8217;s meant to do at the top of a page or they&#8217;ll use a board and use post-its or whatever. And then they&#8217;ll write down its features. Like what does the product do? How it does it feel like physically? What color is it? If it makes sounds, what are the sounds it makes, what do those sounds indicate? Where&#8217;s the product use?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
You have to think about designing this. And it could be a physical product or it could be software, it could be artistic project. But I was stunned because I had already written down on a sheet of, excuse me. I had already written down on a sheet of paper, &#8220;Janessa&#8217;s ideal work environment and Janessa&#8217;s ideal job.&#8221; Then I wrote down all these characteristics, which as a writer, is the word that [inaudible 00:48:55]. Like these are the characteristics that make up this experience. As a designer, you go, these are the features. I wrote down that it has to have sunlight and people were really kind. I wanted something that had an industrial feel and it was open air and I needed it to be near places I could eat at. So when I showed up for my interview at Greater Good Studio, I was like, this open air office with exposed brick had these huge windows and across the street is this vegan place. I was like, &#8220;Oh my God, this is the place. This is so cool.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I got to work with people that were very artistically and creatively inclined, as well as people that are very research driven. I worked on a project where our client was the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. And the name of the project is called Raising Places. It&#8217;s basically a community design project where we went to communities across the United States, those six communities from the west coast to the east coast, and we taught them the process of design. So we had workshops and design sprints and research fronts. We just helped them map their community challenges. Some of the challenges that came up were street lighting and safety, safety for bikers on the streets, like people who are bicycling across the road and they want to feel that there&#8217;s enough space for them, food security.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I spent time on a native American reservation, it&#8217;s Crow Nation, reservation in Montana, and they have one grocery store on the reservation and it didn&#8217;t carry very many fresh foods and vegetables. And there are so many systemic reasons about what created those conditions. We could look at policy, we could look at legislation, we could look at the land grabs from native Americans, colonization overall. These were very, very heavy, serious conversations. Yet there was a lot of fun because the people are, they&#8217;re just families, they&#8217;re just people.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
We got to get to know people and share a bit about ourselves and do as best as we can to empower them through that process. It was a very good experience. It was a lot of traveling, is what I&#8217;ll say. I did 18 trips in six months across the country. Some of those flights were from Jersey to LAX or [inaudible 00:51:35]. And it was like, when I got on the plane, I was eating dinner. When I got off the plane, I was like, should I eat breakfast? Because I don&#8217;t know if my food is digested. It was very confusing. It was just [inaudible 00:51:49], but it was an amazing experience. I hope that there is some lasting impact overall that really improves the conditions that people experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a post that you had up on Artistry Land, where you wrote about using design thinking to help manifest. I&#8217;m curious, how has that practice helped you as a creative? Because I&#8217;m pretty sure our listeners might be able to learn about how they can do that themselves.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting. Some of that gets into the example I gave with Greater Good Studio, where I was as a writer, writing down characteristics. I was like, oh, Janessa really loves politics and photography and writing and she loves traveling. I was just writing down all of these lists of things about myself. I was doing that as a manifestation tool. So I meditate in a space that&#8217;s very open and honest and vulnerable. That might be physically, it could be anywhere. I just mostly sat on the bed or laid on my bed or sat on a yoga mat. But when I closed my eyes and began to breathe very intently, I did so with the intention of being vulnerable and being honest and being true to myself. Because previously living in Washington, D.C., I ended up there because I basically decided not to go to law school.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I&#8217;d spend all this time applying to law school again and got in to Loyola in Chicago, decided not to go and move to DC. Wasn&#8217;t really happy with my life there, and it&#8217;s because I wasn&#8217;t being honest with myself. I didn&#8217;t really want to go to law school either. I wasn&#8217;t being honest with myself. So I had to sit down and go, what do I want? And find this intersection of what do I want with what is very meaningful to contribute to the world? Because the thing about manifestation is sure, people can manifest objects or experiences. However, I believe that the point at least for me, is to do so in a way that is contributing to my purpose. So I&#8217;ve come here with a life assignment. So I would just visualize what is most meaningful to me. I have allowed these visions to pour into me.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Sometimes they&#8217;re very sharp and clear and sometimes it was like a little bit of light in a room full of darkness. And in any case, I&#8217;ll be come out of meditation and then go and write those things down on a sheet of paper. Then as I was job searching or apartment hunting or meeting strangers, I just found that the things that I have written down on a sheet of paper with a pen, it&#8217;s not like, no one can see this, just me, just me in the universe. Those things manifested before me. It just happened. So there&#8217;s a particular frequency that I was operating on that is beyond myself though. I think that&#8217;s really important to say that the intention for me was to move beyond my own ego. Because if it was just ego, it would have been like, I probably would have gone to law school because lawyers make a lot of money. [inaudible 00:55:01].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Pay up those student loans. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah, done. But that would have made me happy. I think the issue with that is that it not making me happy means that my contribution to the world wouldn&#8217;t have been from a place of love. So even as an attorney, I may have thought that I would have been helping people, but how much would I have been helping people if I wasn&#8217;t operating from a place of love and compassion because I wasn&#8217;t being loving and compassionate to myself? So finding some balance between, this makes Janessa happy and this is what Janessa contributes that also makes people happy and is compassionate. So it decreases their suffering. There has to be balance there. So yeah, the design studio, I became more trained in design and I&#8217;ve since worked in Silicon Valley and completed a product design bootcamp in addition to that. Now I use design thinking and manifestation. I don&#8217;t know, they&#8217;re the same thing to me at this point.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
What I do is I&#8217;ll write at the top of a page the year, like 2021, and then I&#8217;ll sketch things that come to me. At one point I sketched a studio, and in the studio there&#8217;s a microphone and a camera and a whole desk set up. Then maybe nine months later, I realized that I was living in a place that I sketched on that book. And I didn&#8217;t even [inaudible 00:56:30]. I didn&#8217;t go out and say, oh, let me match this sketch. It was just, it happened. So I think that when it comes to design thinking, design thinking is about understanding a problem and you apply these phases of design thinking to the process. So there&#8217;s a point where you&#8217;re only focused on the problem. And for me, that was, well, I just blew my life up. I was like, I really need to understand what&#8217;s going on here.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
So I spent months just focusing on that. It doesn&#8217;t have to be months, but you do have to focus on the problem so that you can be clear about what solutions you can develop. My solutions were, it&#8217;s pretty simple, what area of my life do I want to focus on? Personal life, family relationships, intimate relationships, career, home. I can find solutions in these three areas. And those solutions would be, well, what is that balance between Janessa&#8217;s happiness and increasing happiness in the world? Going to work in a design studio is one of those things. Because I knew I&#8217;d learn a lot of things that I could use in other aspects. Moving to Los Angeles, moving to California in general, it&#8217;s very sunny and there&#8217;s a lot of nature and I&#8217;m surrounded by people who also value those things.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Then also, it is important to me to have economic security and to develop wealth because in order to do the things that I see myself doing, where I see myself contributing, I have to have some resources. So for me to say, Hey, I want to donate to the Beverley Arts Center because that place helped make me who I am, I have to have money to do that. I can donate my time too, that&#8217;s a thing. But I was specifically wanted to donate money because that&#8217;s what got me the time to be there in the first place when I was in high school. Well, someone somewhere got a grant or developed a relationship with a funder, and that pulled me to the Beverly Arts Center. So for me, it is really important to look at the intention behind whatever is desired to manifest and to be very clear and honorable in that intention.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Once there&#8217;s clarity about that intention, I use design thinking as a way to align my physical reality with my metaphysical reality. I think sometimes with manifestation, I&#8217;ve learned that someone might be seeking to manifest something and they&#8217;ve created, say a vision board. Maybe they stop there. So they&#8217;ve gone to the metaphysical reality by using intention and finding things that represent these experiences or objects they desire. And in the physical world, they&#8217;ve gathered magazines or cut them out. But then they stopped. Where I think it&#8217;s important to look at is to say, well, how do you continue to align your present physical reality with the metaphysical? And metaphysically, all things exist simultaneously. But the way that we experience them in a physical reality is a bit different. We have this perception of time or limitation. Metaphysically, there are no limitations. Everything is infinite.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah, sure. In infinity somewhere, there might be a version of you that has whatever you put on this vision board and this reality, what are you going to do? What steps are you going to take to actualize that? Now, design thinking can say, let&#8217;s research it. If you want to manifest a trip to Paris, well, let&#8217;s research that. What does it take to get to Paris? I would add, and this is my secret sauce in manifestation and design thinking, is who do I need to be? Who is that version of me that&#8217;s living in Paris? What am I doing there? Who am I meant to meet? Whose life am I meant to contribute to? What lessons do I bring back with me? Those are the things that make it very clear about what I meant to do. If I know that I&#8217;m living in Paris one day and I&#8217;m there as a filmmaker, and I&#8217;m telling the stories of people who otherwise might go unheard, then I know, okay, I need to be someone who is somewhere contributing to a community that needs me. Otherwise, I don&#8217;t become that person.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
So, design thinking can say, okay, let&#8217;s research it and let&#8217;s ask questions about, well, if it could be very basic, what do you need to get to Paris? Passport, all these things. But what types of people visit Paris? What are the choices those people make? What are the problems they&#8217;re looking to solve or the solutions they bring if they&#8217;re business people? What person might be an expert there? How do I become that type of person? What version of myself is that? And it becomes very clear once you&#8217;re doing persona-based work, what the decisions are that someone&#8217;s making, but it&#8217;s important to be clear about the desired outcomes.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
So is it just to live in Paris? Oh yeah, I would love to live in Paris. Is it to cultivate a sense of culture there so that I can translate? Because I do speak French and I want, personally, I&#8217;d like to increase my proficiency so that I could be a translator in a way that&#8217;s very diplomatic and I can particularly communicate amongst French-speaking countries and English-speaking countries across the world. I think it&#8217;s really important to think big and to be specific about what can I do for where I am right now? So if I want to be a translator, a diplomat who translates and deals with issues and builds alliances between French-speaking and English-speaking countries, well, where can I learn more about French-speaking countries? I can research that for my computer. It doesn&#8217;t stop me from doing that. That&#8217;s simple.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s something that I use in a way that at this point it&#8217;s very intertwined. I think I need to find my own name for this approach because design thinking is a very specific thing and manifestation can show up in a lot of different ways. There are folks who do have approaches and particular rituals and ceremonies that they use. A vision board is a great example. It&#8217;s just that it has a title and I don&#8217;t have a title for my process yet. So I&#8217;ll add that to my list of things to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? I know you&#8217;re, it seems like throughout your creative career, you&#8217;ve been on this never ending Odyssey in a way. And now you&#8217;re here in Los Angeles, you&#8217;re about to start off with this new, really this new chapter of your life. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want to accomplish?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I see myself as continuing to lead innovation. I don&#8217;t just mean from a technical standpoint or innovation and business. Innovation and business, of course, innovation in the way that we experience our human lives. That would be leading in Hollywood in the area of diversity, inclusion, equity. I&#8217;m looking at things that would create system change and practices change, particularly when it comes to people on the autism spectrum. But also people generally, that identify to have disabilities, people of color, queer people and women. Because when I was in Silicon Valley, I got to lead, I got to advocate for and develop the existence of employee resource groups at a publicly traded company. And then I became the co-chair of a specific employee resource group or employee belonging group is what they call it there. So I want to apply those learnings to Hollywood and develop ways of working with people to grow our consciousness awareness and to shift our habits and behaviors to reflect our values.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Then simultaneously, I see myself continuing to build relationships more broadly across the business to make it more collaborative and to make it more reflective of a community oriented mindset. That may be the millennial in me, where for me what&#8217;s really important is to collaborate with people and yes, be inclusive. I think that competition is somewhat innate to us as humans, as human beings. There is some sense of an animalistic side where there&#8217;s competition. I don&#8217;t think that we need to over-rotate on that, particularly given the circumstances of climate change or a public health pandemic. I don&#8217;t think that we need to over-rotate on being competitive. I think it&#8217;s a time where it actually behooves us to be more collaborative. That&#8217;s something I see myself approaching through content development, through my choices in who I partner with business-wise, through working with different organizations to see how do we embed those values into the way that we practice our work, whatever that is?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I&#8217;m interested in seeing Hollywood be more dynamic in the stories that we tell and how we tell and what we do with those results. And when I say results, I mean monetary results in this sense. I would like to see that Hollywood is contributing to the communities of the stories that we&#8217;re telling and that we&#8217;re telling stories that are broad enough to represent all communities because people show up. Well, most of theaters are closed or limited, but people show up to the theater to watch stories. They&#8217;re watching those stories either in their own community or in a community that&#8217;s adjacent to them, but someone across the world or across the country might&#8217;ve produced that picture. I would like to see that all of the parties that are participating and contributing to that picture are compensated well. Additionally, that the communities, it&#8217;s not enough basically to have black folks in your movies. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I want to see that these communities who are having their stories told are, one, having those stories told in a way that&#8217;s justified and respectful. And two, that they get to benefit in some way economically from having their stories told. I don&#8217;t know exactly what that looks like, but basically it&#8217;s to say it&#8217;s not enough to commodify someone&#8217;s story and be like, oh, but I told your story. It was like, okay, yeah, you walked away with all of the material benefits of that. I want to see that communities are being reinvested into, and that people have the chance to develop their own content and their own stories. And that the way that the system operates is in a way that&#8217;s more integrated and collaborative. That may be, I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a new idea or a repackaged idea. I&#8217;m not sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
The audience can find out more about me at janessarobinson.com. They can find out more about me also on social media. So on Instagram @JanessaE.Robinson, it&#8217;s here I&#8217;m often hanging out, is on Instagram. And then folks can also find out more about Artistry Land at www.artistryland.space.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Janessa Robinson, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you for really, one, describing where you&#8217;re at right now in embarking on this new journey in your creative career, But also really diving deep into how the sum total of your other experiences, whether it&#8217;s been traveling or working in other industries and such have brought you to where you are right now. I hope that when people listen to this, they take away that they can have these divergent paths that can lead them towards what their goals are, Because it certainly seems like you&#8217;re doing that for yourself. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Thank you for having me, Maurice. Thank you. I love your show. I love the work that you&#8217;re doing and I&#8217;m very excited to be a part of it.</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
My name is Brent Rollins, and the short answer is that I&#8217;m a multi disciplinary designer, the long answer would be that I&#8217;m a creative who collaborates with people, organizations that are passionate and sort of driven in their mission to kind of spread their ideas and positivity to the world and to sort of create guiding paths for people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How is 2021 been for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
You know what, man? 2021, I&#8217;m ready to go. 2020 was actually the year that I was like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s do this. Weird. I&#8217;m ready to make some stuff happen.&#8221; Well, we know how that sort of ended up. So I think it&#8217;s been&#8230; I think a lot of people, including myself have been kind of bubbling and if you&#8217;re driven and if you have ideas and you&#8217;re creative, you&#8217;ve been using this sort of sabbatical or this time or this kind of slower period to think about things and formulate things and come up with ideas and plan. Like the people that have passed unfortunately, I know a few people that have been affected by the virus and stuff. So my heart goes out to them, but for those of us who are alive, this is a moment for us to be alive and to embrace that, and to really like&#8230; This is a blessing in that sense, if we haven&#8217;t been devastatingly affected. This has been a blessing to have this moment, to think about what we want to do and what we want to accomplish into what&#8217;s a forced introspection.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And I hope rather that people kind of use it to better themselves. So, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m about, man, I can&#8217;t wait for this year, unlike I&#8217;m ready to go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I have talked to a lot of people that are saying that this is going to be like the new roaring 20s in a way?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Oh, man. Is it ever? This is going to be yo, roaring 20s, baby boom, it&#8217;s going to be crazy. I think, come June, July, this is going to be wild, bro.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, No. And I think even now, there&#8217;s this sort of like, I can feel this renewed energy in the air, especially as people are starting to get the vaccine. And even as some places are starting to relax restrictions, things are starting to open up again. So, people are anxious to get back out there and experience the world, whatever that may look like.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah. Some people unfortunately continue to experience the world and they didn&#8217;t really care, no shots, no judgment. But for the rest of us hopefully like I said, we&#8217;re sensible enough to kind of use it to our advantage and kind of make plans and sort of think about things. And it&#8217;s really funny because at the top of 2020, I distinctly remember thinking, I can&#8217;t tell you where it was, but I can distinctly remember thinking. I was like, &#8220;Man, the world is moving really fast. This thing needs to slow down.&#8221; It was like I felt just how much stuff was going on. Because I live in New York City, and I see construction going on everywhere. And I see all this stuff happening. And it just felt like things were kind of out of control. And so it was&#8230; Like I said, it&#8217;s been a weird, mixed, I guess, [inaudible 00:07:08] and kind of blessing that this thing sort of forced everyone to slow down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What does a typical day look like for you now?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny, because I was never a very structured person, and I&#8217;ve become a little bit more regimented. And I actually really enjoy it. Or I feel like I need that. So, typical day for me right now is I&#8217;m in this kind of like new cycle. So, I&#8217;m actually implementing kind of new sort of regimens that I didn&#8217;t really do. So, I don&#8217;t know how typical it is. It&#8217;s only like maybe four months old. It seems like this has been Rollins&#8217;s day. But I typically go to sleep late, just because I&#8217;m a night owl. And I don&#8217;t get much sleep. So, I sort of wake up maybe about five or six hours later. And kind of like I want to read and sort of see what&#8217;s going on in the world and fix myself a little pot of coffee, and maybe take a little walk, get some air, get out the house, kind of just sort of take in what the environment has to offer, and start working on one of the multiple sort of projects that I got going on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And what are some of those projects? I mean, as much of them as you can sort of talk about at liberty.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s really funny like&#8230; Because I was thinking about before this interview, I was like, &#8220;Man, you know what? I can&#8217;t really talk about the things that I&#8217;m working on right now.&#8221; Not because they&#8217;re secret, but I don&#8217;t want to get ahead of myself. A few of the things that are maybe like projects for people, again, like people that are doing sort of very interesting, sort of passion projects, or things that have sort of a larger good, I think that&#8217;s the kind of stuff that I can maybe talk about, as far as there&#8217;s this brother Waajeed, who is a DJ based in Detroit, who is pretty well known. And Detroit as you know, has amazing music history. And so, Waajeed has got this fantastic opportunity to open. I don&#8217;t want to call it a school, but he is spearheading this project to create a&#8230; I think it&#8217;s called underground music academy. It&#8217;s sort of a place for people to sort of engage in musical creativity. And it&#8217;s on this Boulevard in Detroit, that has a lot of insane Detroit musical history. So, I&#8217;m working on the identity for that. And I&#8217;m very excited about that.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Some of the other projects that I&#8217;m working on, are really entrepreneurial projects that have been in the works for the past year. One of them, I had to put the brakes on because of COVID, but is still moving and I&#8217;m super excited about it. And I really can&#8217;t wait to sort of show the world what that&#8217;s about. But the short story is that it&#8217;ll be a sort of a restaurant or cafe or something. And then the other project, there&#8217;s another entrepreneurial project that I kind of don&#8217;t want to talk about. But I&#8217;m also very excited about. Other than that, yeah, everything else is really working on stuff for people for short films and some album covers and things that&#8230; Or people that I&#8217;ve creative history with, people that really want to kind of put something out into the world that&#8217;s a little bit different. I&#8217;m at the point in my sort of life or career, or however you want to talk about it, or however you want to think about it, where I just want to be a little bit selective, and I&#8217;m okay.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I need to figure out&#8230; Everything has to&#8230; You have to make a living. But I can be a little bit selective about things because I don&#8217;t want to depend on those projects for the things to make a living, I&#8217;d rather have the entrepreneurial things be the things that I use to make a living.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And that way, I have more control over the creativity, because it&#8217;s my projects. And then if I&#8217;m working with anybody, it&#8217;s going to be because I really believe in what they&#8217;re doing. There are people that have hit me up via social media. Man, people are like, &#8220;Yo, I&#8217;m doing this, would you do an album cover for me?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Number one, you don&#8217;t talk to people like that.&#8221; You know what I mean? I also am like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not getting your hustle, but I&#8217;m also&#8230; I want to lend myself to projects that I feel that I understand and I feel have some sort of worth and value, and prove it to me.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting how Twitter&#8230; And I guess you could say social media as a whole. But it&#8217;s amazing how Twitter has kind of almost flattened the&#8230; Like it&#8217;s flattened the hustle in a way. People will talk to you on Twitter in any kind of way. They don&#8217;t know who you are, and to that respect, I guess it&#8217;s that way with social media in general, they&#8217;ll just approach you on like some, &#8220;Hey, can you do this for me?&#8221; I get so many people that will&#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t even say that they write to the show, they tell the show, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why you haven&#8217;t interviewed me yet.&#8221; Who are you? Person with no website and I can&#8217;t tell what kind of work that you do and you have 100 followers?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting how social media kind of flattens out in a way. People just don&#8217;t approach you with the same kind of not necessarily gravitas, but just the same sort of urgency. It&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Hey, do this for me.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, I mean, people don&#8217;t&#8230; I can get into my old man, I&#8217;m going to put my old man pants on right now. It&#8217;s a little bit of number one, you should just learn if you&#8217;re going to&#8230; Like I said, if you&#8217;re going to approach people, show some respect, if you really like their work, at least be like, &#8220;Hey, I really like your work, this is what I&#8217;m trying to do,&#8221; and come with some humility and be like, &#8220;I&#8217;m doing this thing, would you be interested in it?&#8221; Yes, no, if not, I understand. I don&#8217;t really appreciate this sort of informality. I think social media enables people to be in contact, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
But it doesn&#8217;t mean that you should abandon sort of what has been traditional decorum and sort of like, just respect in terms of like how you approach people. I wouldn&#8217;t talk to any of these kind of design heroes that I have, as though they were my peers, they&#8217;re not my peers. Those are people that I look up to, and they&#8217;re deserving of that respect. And you&#8217;re right, yeah, as far as flattening, I think most of the people or a large amount of people that are using social media, it is flat, because they&#8217;re all peers. So, they can sort of approach people like that, but then there are other people that are within that space that are old like myself, that are like, &#8220;No, man, this is not how you run up on folks.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t run up on people like that. I was very-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Respectful?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah, respectful. But whenever I&#8217;d meet people that were in a particular state, I would just approach them [inaudible 00:13:57]. You know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I think that that&#8217;s&#8230; Not that I&#8217;m suggesting, &#8220;Yo, I&#8217;m better than you,&#8221; but I&#8217;m just kind of like, &#8220;Come on, man, I&#8217;m a grown man. Don&#8217;t talk to me like that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. And also, it&#8217;s clearly when someone&#8217;s approaching in that way, it&#8217;s one way transactional. Like, &#8220;What can I get?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8220;Can you do something for me?&#8221; Not like, &#8220;How do we help each other out in that kind of way?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. But you know what? I mean, if you&#8217;ve been doing anything for a moment, and you&#8217;re worth, you&#8217;re like us all, you can filter out who&#8217;s real and who&#8217;s not.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And even the people that are not, maybe they haven&#8217;t found their tribe yet, but you can tell that, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re looking.&#8221; If you can identify the people that are like the junior use.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, no, I get it. Yeah, this person, they&#8217;re definitely on that vibe. And you know what? I&#8217;m going to put you under my wing because I can see that in you, and come along for the ride homie.&#8221; So, yeah. Oh, man, people hacked up on social media.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, you&#8217;ve mentioned all these different kind of projects. First of all, I have to say I love the way you kind of just slowly was like, &#8220;Yeah, this is DJ in Detroit Waajeed.&#8221; You&#8217;re not talking about what Waajeed from slum village.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
No, no, no. Not at all.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Just like, &#8220;Yeah, this guy, he&#8217;s starting a school.&#8221; Doing the thing like, okay, all right. But when it comes to all these different projects that you do, what does your creative process look like when you&#8217;re starting a project?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
That is depending on the project, but I think that&#8230; I do a little research depending on what it is, one of the things that I try to tap into where&#8230; It&#8217;s really funny, because I have a great appreciation for sort of like, very learned kind of design approaches. But I think I&#8217;m really like a designer that came from an art background, I think, or more so just the act of creativity itself. And so I approach things in a way that&#8217;s more about emotion. And oftentimes, what is the feeling that I got when I encountered X? And so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to tap into in terms of like that sort of intuitive sort of feeling. I&#8217;m sure there have been moments in your life where there&#8217;s been some baby&#8230; I&#8217;m going to just use music, because it&#8217;s such a common denominator. When you&#8230; There was like maybe a club that you were just like, &#8220;Oh, man, that club was just&#8230; That was it. Because the DJ, the music was just right, and the vibe was right and the crowd, and the this and the that, and the&#8230;&#8221; All those kind of things.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a feeling. And if it&#8217;s done right, there&#8217;s a visual component to it as well. And so what I look towards is tapping into that visual trigger. That&#8217;s the thing because that&#8217;s my language. So, that&#8217;s the thing that whenever I was in any of these kind of environments, that&#8217;s what I latched on to, as my sort of like, this is my flotation device, this is what&#8217;s going to keep me up in this space. And I&#8217;m going to use this design thing or this visual thing and I&#8217;m going to sit back on my floaty and chill, while I&#8217;m observing the rest of the stuff that&#8217;s going on. That&#8217;s kind of like how I go. The creative process is about tapping into that vibe, that thing, that emotion that people get that is very subconscious. If you&#8217;ve been to the Caribbean, or certain countries, I don&#8217;t want to say third world countries, but just developing countries or something. There&#8217;s like the smell of like gasoline and burning jungle foilage. I was exposed to it as a young age.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And then as an adult, I go back to those places and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, whoa!&#8221; It&#8217;s like automatically, it&#8217;s something that I totally forgot about, like, boom, it just triggered me. And I was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m back here. I&#8217;m ready to roll.&#8221; So, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to try to reach for, is to think about those kinds of things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So yeah, you try to tap into a certain&#8230; You said like a visual trigger or a vibe, or a feeling and then you kind of build out from their sounds like?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, it&#8217;s really funny man, the emotions and the memories. Like I said, people don&#8217;t necessarily&#8230; Sometimes people don&#8217;t remember them. But when they see them, they get excited. Like, I love remembering things that I&#8217;ve totally forgot. Sometimes there&#8217;s a thing that maybe happened to me as a child, or that maybe I went to, and someone else will bring it up and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, whoa! Oh, man, I totally remember.&#8221; I love that. That&#8217;s like the best feeling ever, because you&#8217;re taken back to something that you had kind of pushed in the&#8230; It&#8217;s like in the back of the storage room. It&#8217;s like if you have stuff in storage, and you kind of go through things, and you rediscover them. Like recently, I was going through my parent&#8217;s garage sort of cleaning things out. And kind of came across two boxes of old comics that I had left behind when I left Los Angeles from New York. And I hadn&#8217;t thought about those comic books in 20 plus years, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
It&#8217;s not that I&#8230; I knew that I had comics, but I had got to the point where I just sort of disassociated and attached myself to those as possessions. Comic books are really important to me, the stories and the illustrations were&#8230; Some of the artists were very significant to me, and rediscovering those comic books in the back of my dad&#8217;s garage, and kind of going through it, man, I got a little teary eyed because I was like, &#8220;Oh man, a few comics.&#8221; I was just like, &#8220;Oh, man.&#8221; Because I decided to sell them because I haven&#8217;t looked at these things in so long. What&#8217;s the point of keeping these things? I just sort of resolved to sell them. I was going through some of the comments, I was like, &#8220;Man, do I really get rid of this? Oh, this is so awesome.&#8221; And it was like, yeah, I reconnected with something that I completely forgot about.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
So yeah, when I do&#8230; So, take it full circle. So, when I do design, there&#8217;s a tinge of nostalgia I guess, in some of the things because I think that&#8217;s what people are relating to, in some cases. And then other cases it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, I want to do something completely new.&#8221; And how do you do that? Even when you make something new, it&#8217;s rooted in something because if you do something that&#8217;s too new, you lose people. So, you want to put a little bit of something familiar in it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting you mentioned that sort of tinge of nostalgia, because I feel like there&#8217;s&#8230; We&#8217;ll get into the work that you&#8217;ve done with Ego Trip and Rap Pages, et cetera. But there&#8217;s a very temporal quality to your work that is kind of evocative of the 60s and the 70s in different ways. I think one, there&#8217;s this sort of like collage, mixed media kind of thing that I see you do sometimes. But then there&#8217;s also&#8230; And maybe I&#8217;m thinking of the more visual stuff that I see on television, but it&#8217;s also like a nod back to projectors. And there&#8217;s an audio element of a film reel, or noise grain that you see on film and stuff like that. And then just even the playful way that you use typography, it&#8217;s almost like you see those old school horror movie title cards or something. I get what you mean about that kind of tinge of nostalgia. But I think that&#8217;s a pretty big theme in your work though.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah. The thing about using that as a device, it&#8217;s funny, because I don&#8217;t know what&#8230; I really want to talk to some younger designers now and kind of get where their head is at, because when I would resort to those options, it&#8217;s because that&#8217;s what I know is familiar to people. And the idea of design, in my world design meaning kind of visual communications, graphics, that type of design. It&#8217;s really about I want to communicate with you. What&#8217;s our shared language? What are our shared memories? What is our shared sort of commonalities? And when I pull from those kinds of things, this is very conscious. Those are things that I want to trigger you. I want you to be like, &#8220;Oh, I get it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I think there&#8217;s the idea of design as ornament and sort of fireworks, where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yo, I&#8217;m doing something new and this is [inaudible 00:22:39].&#8221; And you&#8217;re going to get about five people that understand what you&#8217;re doing, which is cool. I&#8217;m not against that. I love that kind of stuff. But the idea of design, my foundation, or my understanding of design is rooted in the old idea of what a graphic artist was, which was communication design. Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
So the idea of, I&#8217;m trying to reach you, I&#8217;m trying to talk with you. And for me, the shortcut is shared experiences. For me, the shortcut is what I&#8217;d surmise as being the things that we grew up with. And that&#8217;s how we begin to talk to each other. That&#8217;s kind of where I&#8217;m coming from. When I was doing that kind of stuff, it was based off of&#8230; It&#8217;s not the nostalgia because it looks&#8230; Sometimes that nostalgia can be about the kitsch factor or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm, okay.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I could&#8230; Man, I can go [inaudible 00:23:33].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was actually careful not to use the word kitsch. So, I&#8217;m surprised you brought that up.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s sort of like the idea of&#8230; Well, when I say kitsch, I think&#8230; Let&#8217;s talk about the 70s for instance.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And when you see things that are about the 70s and particularly black culture, it&#8217;s always expressed in these very kind of superficial, simple&#8230; It&#8217;s like the lettering is groovy, whatever that means.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hobo standard kind of&#8230; I know what you mean. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah. You think of afros as kitsch. It&#8217;s a little bit kitsch, right? People don&#8217;t look at afros as&#8230; They don&#8217;t look at afros as what it was, which was like this assertion of black identity and being sort of proud of kinky hair and all this other kind of stuff. They look at it as being a style. Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And how big it was, or how large your afro was. And sometimes there&#8217;s this sort of&#8230; There&#8217;s definitely like a silliness to some stuff from the 70s. I think that&#8217;s the sort of kitsch thing and it becomes like this kind of joke. I think about that movie, Black Dynamite, which avoided it because it was&#8230; That movie wasn&#8217;t&#8230; It took place in the 70s, but it wasn&#8217;t about afro jokes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
It was, but it wasn&#8217;t. It was really like a very loving, sort of understanding about that sort of aesthetic. But it was deeper than an afro jokes. I don&#8217;t like afro jokes. I don&#8217;t like afro jokes&#8230; [inaudible 00:25:10] my fist on the table. Yeah, it&#8217;s not about the kitsch today, kitsch isn&#8217;t about&#8230; It&#8217;s about like, &#8220;Oh, I remember that vibe.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to tap into.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you mentioned Los Angeles, where you&#8217;re originally from. Tell me what it was like growing up there.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Oh, man, what a weird place! I have a love and hate relationship with Los Angeles, because it made me who I am. So, I can&#8217;t hate on it. And there&#8217;re some really beautiful things about the city. There are some other things that I didn&#8217;t like, because I grew up around the entertainment industry. And so it was just sort of like a preoccupation that&#8230; Yes, it generates money and it generates attention. But sometimes I have to wonder why people sort of got into that world. But the world that I grew up in, was a middle class, black neighborhood called Windsor Hills, which I love to say, the Issa Rae&#8217;s character on Insecure, she&#8217;s from the neighborhood that I grew up. So-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Uh-huh (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
They got to her and when that show came out, I was just like, I just couldn&#8217;t believe that anything was shot in my neighborhood. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, my God, they&#8217;re shooting there, they&#8217;re doing a scene there or some other place.&#8221; And it just blows my mind. So, I have to admit, it&#8217;s like a place that I&#8217;m very proud to come from, even though ironically, when I was growing up, I wasn&#8217;t. It was very conflicting because it was a neighborhood that in the 60s, I would say was probably&#8230; It was&#8230; I think my understanding was predominantly white, predominantly&#8230; A lot of maybe Jewish people who lived also in the neighborhood of Windsor Hills, View Park, Ladera Heights, Baldwin Hills, that area. And I think as black people started&#8230; I like to say or not like to say, but I kind of refer to the 60s as being like when black people actually arrived in the United States.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
That was when actual opportunities started opening up in the same way that other immigrants sort of arrived in the United States and they have to kind of scrapped their way, they&#8217;re at the bottom, but they still have this sort of legitimate way to sort of move on. In some ways, the 60s was kind of like that, finally being able to participate. And so a lot of folks who had been able to get like civil service jobs, or other types of sort of middle class jobs started buying into the neighborhood that I grew up in. And so, I think that was great to see. Some things I didn&#8217;t necessarily like, because I don&#8217;t&#8230; I had problems with sort of the kind of class segregation that was apparent and less about money, but more about social segregation. And the idea that&#8230; The idea society was something that I kind of struggled with. I grew up around people that&#8230; I want to make it very clear, I&#8217;m not knocking something like Jack and Jill or those kinds of organizations.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I think at the time, I wasn&#8217;t part of those things and I didn&#8217;t understand them at the time. So, my limited understanding was, this was just a weird, boujee, kind of whatever, I understand it, or have a better appreciation of it now in the sense of&#8230; The way I like to think about it, is if your parents, regardless of the situation that they come from, they want something better for you. And so, that sort of situation exists because they want their children to succeed, or they want their children to have a guaranteed better life. But I didn&#8217;t understand that at the time. And so even though my father worked in or rather was trying to make his way in entertainment during that time, we ourselves were not probably as well off as maybe the people that were around me. So, that kind of gave me a different sort of perspective on things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). I remember Jack and Jill growing up, but I didn&#8217;t think it was just some boujee black people. Like, seriously. But then I grew up as folks who listen to the show know. I grew up in Selma, Alabama, and it&#8217;s like at the end of the day, we&#8217;re all poor black people in the country. I think when I was looking at it from sort of as like from a teenage perspective, and I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s this way for all of Jack and Jill, but it certainly was this way back then in Alabama. It was by sort of social class of course, but then also by skin color. Pretty much everyone in Jack and Jill was light skinned and I am not. And it&#8217;s like I would have people say, &#8220;Well, you would be so good at Jack and Jill, but you know.&#8221; So, if you were just a few shades lighter maybe and this other thing that we had, we&#8217;re like&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And this was in high school, I don&#8217;t know if this is even a thing or if this was just a thing endemic to our high school, but we had these high school fraternities and sororities that were based off of black fraternities and sororities. So, you had the mini Alpha Phi Alpha, we&#8217;re the African Knights, and like the mini AKAs, Alpha Kappa Alphas we&#8217;re culture Rama, and the mini Delta Sigma Theta, were delta teams. And I never understood any of it. My mother was in a sorority, my mother&#8217;s a delta, but I didn&#8217;t get it. Like, &#8220;Why are we doing this? This doesn&#8217;t make any sense. You&#8217;re just sort of lording this imaginary social position over someone else for what?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s funny, I don&#8217;t&#8230; Again, I don&#8217;t really understand the motivation for that. I could say that as I&#8217;ve grown older, I don&#8217;t want to say I&#8217;ve grown more boujee. I&#8217;m not going to say that though. I&#8217;m not going to say that I don&#8217;t like nice things. Let&#8217;s put it that way. But I don&#8217;t really quite understand that point of view. An interesting thing that&#8230; And I don&#8217;t know how this connects, really. But what comes to mind is, I got the opportunity to work with Don Cornelius.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow!</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And one of the things that he said to me was, black people don&#8217;t recognize class.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And which sort of defies what we&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
But in some ways, I understand what he&#8217;s saying because at the end of the day, in the United States, we&#8217;re all black people. We&#8217;re all structurally, socially, second class. And so, that&#8217;s our commonality. And I don&#8217;t know, I just thought it was a really interesting statement from him. I think we are people in general, I don&#8217;t know. Sort of seek to separate ourselves. But at least in the United States, there&#8217;s still this thread, that we&#8217;re all on the same boat.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I think in the south, certainly there was probably just an additional&#8230; There may have just been an additional element of wanting to&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, maybe have what white people had in some way?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I wonder if that&#8217;s part of it. For example, like I mentioned the high school fraternities, we had both a cotillion and a beautillion. I had a beautillion that was stupid. But like you-</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Thank you. But you&#8217;re like-</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Black tie.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re a distinguished man of a certain age.&#8221; And it&#8217;s a whole thing with like, they do a cakewalk and you have to be in a suit. A tux actually, be in a tux and you do the waltz. It&#8217;s so stupid, I don&#8217;t know if any other&#8230; I hope they don&#8217;t still do that. Because when I think back on, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;This is like some midnight in the garden of good and evil kind of shit. This is weird.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I&#8217;m going to offer the inverse of that. I think that there&#8217;s an opportunity to create expressions that are highly developed. And I don&#8217;t necessarily have a problem with that. I think that, to your point, when it becomes about emulating the surface aspects of white culture, then that&#8217;s where it becomes problematic. But if you&#8217;re celebrating the things that are great about your culture, I think that&#8217;s a different point of view. And maybe that&#8217;s not the way we&#8217;re going to solve this problem, or be able to put a suggestion box to Jack and Jill, but maybe that&#8217;s how it transforms, or maybe there&#8217;s some other organizations or people who are less about that sort of take on things. And more about, &#8220;This is what&#8217;s beautiful about black culture.&#8221; And we should celebrate those things. And we should aspire to those things. I think that that&#8217;s the thing.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
There should be a quality and execution and decorum level that a lot of cultures have that are had been sort of codified and sort of expected like we were talking earlier about like, I go to Japan or something like that. I expect Japanese design to be kick ass. Or even like Scandinavian design. I expect it to be pretty damn good. And so that&#8217;s okay to me to be like, &#8220;Are you at that level?&#8221; No. And when you reach that level, dope, we&#8217;re going to knight you. You know what I&#8217;m saying? It&#8217;s like, you did it. We have a sense of that with music in terms of it doesn&#8217;t matter necessarily what genre it is. And even if you don&#8217;t like it, you might be like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m not really necessarily feeling this particular take, but I can tell that it&#8217;s the person behind it, they put a lot into it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I think music is like one of the things that black Americans do very well, and is worldwide considered to be of excellence. And we have grown up and been exposed to something of excellence, that when it&#8217;s time for those who decide to participate into those avenues, even when they&#8217;re doing something new, they&#8217;re trying to shoot for a particular bar.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right, right.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And I think that having those kinds of standards, absolutely. I think that I see no problem in that sort of higher culture participation. Does that make sense?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That makes sense. Certainly, I get what you&#8217;re saying about when you&#8217;d look at another nation&#8217;s culture for example, there&#8217;s a certain expectation there. And I think that&#8217;s because that play that particular aesthetic, similar to what you&#8217;re saying with like black people in music, it&#8217;s been distilled and exported in a way where you already have a presupposition of what it&#8217;s going to be before you even know what it is. Like if you order&#8230; I&#8217;ll give you an example. I ordered some pants from, I forget what the&#8230; It was something I saw on Instagram, that was probably my fault. But I saw some dope pants on Instagram and I was like, &#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re like some Japanese, Myketo pants. So I expect when I get them, they&#8217;re going to have a certain flattering cut or something different than maybe you wouldn&#8217;t see with American apparel or something like that. Not the brand, but just apparel in general.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And like for black design, I think that&#8217;s a moving target in a way, because it&#8217;s going to depend on your experiences, where you grew up, where you pull inspiration from. I just had a German American designer on the show, Julian Williams, who is currently in Amsterdam. Young kid, 25 years old, has done design work for Karl Lagerfeld, Nike, Tommy Hilfiger, has this very distinct, bold graphic type of graphical design. But then he also pulls inspiration from voguing and the ballroom scene that he&#8217;s a part of. And so it&#8217;s all a part of his general design aesthetic. Is that black design? Because he&#8217;s a black designer? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Absolutely. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I&#8217;m saying like it&#8217;s like a moving target, because then you could look at your work, and your work is definitely very steeped in like I said, these kind of references from the 60s and the 70s, and this tinge of nostalgia. And a lot of what you have done has kind of set the&#8230; I feel like has set the visual cornerstone for an entire culture when people think of hip hop design, it comes down to a lot of the stuff that you did with Eagle Trip, a lot of the stuff you did with Complex, these very interesting graphic styles. That also is black design.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s the goal. Like I said, it&#8217;s not one&#8230; What you&#8217;re alluding to, it&#8217;s not one thing, it&#8217;s not one particular genre, but is when you enter that space, it&#8217;s going to be executed at a particular level. It&#8217;s going to be&#8230; It&#8217;s going to cover specific things. And there are sort of expectations that you get. Like jazz is totally different from R&#038;B and is totally different from Samba, is totally different from reggae, is totally different from dancehall, but it&#8217;s all black music, right? It&#8217;s totally different from the blues, it&#8217;s all black music, they all sound different, right? But there&#8217;s this thread of expression and commonality. And when these genres develop themselves, the execution is you can&#8217;t deny it. So, that&#8217;s a goal, is to create things that even though they&#8217;re not in one particular space, or they may jump from place to place, which is what&#8217;s going to happen, you want them to leave a mark.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I will say speaking about how kind of having black design being internationally recognized in a way similar to how black music is, a lot of your work has been exhibited in group exhibitions, both here in the US, as well as internationally. What does it mean to have your work kind of shown in that kind of fashion?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
When my stuff is recognized internationally, it means a lot because a lot of it was pre-internet and that means that the people that decided to talk about design or whatever, they&#8217;re seeking, they&#8217;re looking for. They&#8217;re looking for content like anybody like anything or anybody now, but they have a certain standard in mind. And there&#8217;s a filter that they have in their head. So, what I&#8217;m most proud of, I guess, is publications and people that have reached out to me. Yeah, like I said, particularly before the internet was popping. Because they were like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve seen this, I&#8217;ve seen a few of these things. I really was affected by this, or this was a music artist that really meant a lot to me. And I see that a couple of other artists that mean a lot to me were represented visually by this guy, Brent Rollins. And so let me look into it.&#8221; That&#8217;s a good feeling. And to know that people around the world who are on the same wavelength as you, and who are seeking out things, find you. That&#8217;s incredible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
That makes me feel good. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, we&#8217;ve talked about Ego Trip, just kind of briefly touching on it. But I want to go more in depth about that. You came on as our director, you&#8217;re kind of one of the co founders of this group with some titans in the industry, Sacha Jenkins, Elliott Wilson, Jeff Mao, take me back to that time. What did it feel like sort of coming together and building something like Ego Trip and the work that you all were able to do?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Oh, sure yeah. And we have to remember the one titan who is always like never wants attention, was Gabriel Alvarez. Yeah. I mean, Ego Trip was kind of like&#8230; We were like a band. And in some ways for that world, we were like a supergroup. And I got to know&#8230; I started working with Gabriel Alvarez when I was working at Rap Pages, got the gig through very awesome, incredible woman named Sheena Lester. And Rap Pages was an early sort of competitor to The Source Magazine. And-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Larry Flynt.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Larry Flynt, my man. Yeah. Enough respect to that guy, rest in peace. What a person to work for. I didn&#8217;t work for him specifically, but just to know that he was in the building, what a&#8230; Very bizarre to be early 20s and working for a pornographer. But yeah, he had started this magazine, Rap Pages basically to kind of reap some attention that The Source was getting. And Sheena had taken it over, after maybe a few issues, I guess. And we wanted to build an editorial team. I was one of the later people to join, and one of my compatriots, there was Gabriel Alvarez. So, between myself, Sheena, Gabe, Blau, Dorothy, and I apologize if I can&#8217;t remember Hannibal and some other folks that&#8230; Nikki, incredible person. We kind of were a little kind of a group who kind of wanted to take on The Source. At the time, that was like the main kind of hip hop music magazine. It was the first and undeniably significant. But we sort of had our take on things or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
But we had hired freelance writers, and among them was Sacha Jenkins, and Elliott Wilson, and I&#8217;m not sure if Mel&#8230; I believe Mel may have been hired as well, as a freelance writer, but that&#8217;s how I got to know those guys. Or that&#8217;s how I made first contact with them. And after a few years of working at the magazine, Gabe had moved to New York to work with Sacha, on Ego Trip. And Sacha Jenkins, who for people that don&#8217;t know, I would say in recent years, he&#8217;s probably known for producing these documentaries called, I believe it&#8217;s called Fresh Dressed, which is about hip hop fashion. He also directed this Wu Tang documentary on Showtime. And so he&#8217;s been&#8230; And he&#8217;s also in a punk band and all this other kind of stuff. And Sacha has always been doing all these kind of great self-started initiating things and had this sort of fledgling magazine, or zin rather, called the Ego Trip.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And Ego Trip was&#8230; It was coming from the perspective of mainly, mostly writers of color to talk about hip hop, with a love and reverence, but also an irreverence towards the subject matter, and also had interest in other music such as punk rock, indie rock, what have you. And so, as Sacha would say, it was like Rolling Stones, but the inverse. So Rolling Stone would mostly cover rock, and maybe occasionally do hip hop. And so, Ego Trip was the flip side of that. And so that&#8217;s how I got to know those guys, and I eventually moved to New York in 1997, because of having some contact with Sacha. Sacha had sort of said, &#8220;Hey, we need to step up our magazine visually,&#8221; sort of invited me to join the team for no money, but more just out of like an outlet to do something creative.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I looked at myself, as the Terry Gilliam to everybody else&#8217;s John Cleese, and the rest of the Monty Python crew. As far as being the visual person, I understood editorial, and I also wanted to do sort of humor. We were doing a lot of funny, goofy stuff. And so I had my take on how to express that. And eventually, that became the collage. There were&#8230; The magazine itself was instrumental to me in terms of my creative development, because it was very DIY, it was like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s just take&#8230;&#8221; We used to do precursors to memes called Ego Trip Ads. So we would find these funny images from Jet Magazine or, or Ebony or something like that. Just older magazines, like ads of black people in Burger King ads and write funny captions to them. But the captions were always like hip hop lyrics. And then we would kind of put the little slug like Ego Trip.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And so basically, they became ads to fill in the unused ad space in the magazine. But they were fun. They helped us sort of develop our creative voice and make the magazine more individual and sort of unique. And so, that&#8217;s how I kind of got down with them. I had myself this irreverent take on hip hop and sort of making fun of hip hop, but loving it at the same time. This was the vehicle for it. And so, once we got together, yeah, Sacha was working, I think at Vibe Magazine. Elliott was working at The Source, Jeff was writing for a lot of other music magazines and Gabe, he&#8217;s the glue and like I said, he doesn&#8217;t get the credit that he deserves because he&#8217;s very much behind the scenes, he doesn&#8217;t want the attention, but he is the funniest MF around the planet, and super creative.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And so, collectively, yeah, we kind of just became like Voltron, like superhero group and looked at the magazine as a vehicle to express just how we&#8230; Just things that we were interested in, and also to try to put it to&#8230; Like every issue, I only did like the last three issues, but it felt like making an album. And each issue got more and more personal. Like there&#8217;s running&#8230; It&#8217;s a magazine literally with like running jokes. Because if you turn the pages, you&#8217;ll see a reference to something that came earlier, and we made it this kind of like goofy puzzle. And it became semi&#8230; Everything in Ego Trip became this&#8230; It started blurring the line between music, journalism and autobiography.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. How was it received at the time?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I think you&#8217;d have to ask a lot of journalists maybe how they thought about it. I guess at the time, no one was doing what we were doing. And I don&#8217;t say that to sound like arrogant, I just mean in a sense-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No. Hey, talk your shit.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
But I&#8217;m not [inaudible 00:48:30]. It wasn&#8217;t usual for people to get together to be like, &#8220;Hey, we want to talk about this with this particular voice. That isn&#8217;t straight ahead. So, when we got together to do that stuff, we just had fun. We would just goof around and just make jokes and it was like one of the&#8230; Those guys were like my brothers, brothers that I never had. And so, like I said, it&#8217;s kind of like we were sort of a supergroup. Yeah, we used to do some stupid things. In my head, I&#8217;m thinking about this time we kidnapped this journalist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wait, wait, wait. What?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. So, there&#8217;s this journalist who writes for the New York Times now named John Caramanica.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, my God! Okay. No, I&#8217;m sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Wait, do you know&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know of him because of some of his shitty reviews. But no, go ahead.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
So, I can&#8217;t remember what he was interviewing us for, maybe it was for our first book. I can&#8217;t remember probably. But we were like, &#8220;Okay, this is how we want to be legendary.&#8221; So at the time, we used to have this one office on 16th Street in Chelsea Market, and we used to have this really dope&#8230; The fourth floor, we had almost all to ourselves. We were sharing it with this graffiti brand named Bullets of Brooklyn, but they were never there. So, we kind of just had the run of the space. And then for reasons that I won&#8217;t get into, we had to vacate that space. And so we ended up moving into the basement of the building. So, we wrote our first book in the basement of this building on 16th Street in Chelsea. And so, there were pipes of bolus than you&#8217;d hear like toilet flushing, and you&#8217;d just hear all this sewage going by and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And then we have this room in the back&#8230; We only have like two rooms, we have this one room that was where, if you see the cover of our book, the book of Rap List, that was the room that we shot this in. And we were like, &#8220;Okay, I guess we&#8217;re going to get interviewed.&#8221; I think it was probably for the New York Times, and we&#8217;re going to get interviewed and we can&#8217;t just do a normal thing, man. We&#8217;re like, &#8220;We&#8217;re Ego Trip dude, we&#8217;re [inaudible 00:50:49] this shit.&#8221; So we told them to meet or show up someplace in the Chelsea Market, which is like this kind of food court now. This glorified food court in Chelsea. And we had this really cute girl who was a friend of ours, go meet him and she was like, &#8220;Are you John Caramanica?&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Come with me.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
We wanted him to have a story to tell. So, she leads him&#8230; I can&#8217;t remember if she&#8230; We weren&#8217;t there. So, I can&#8217;t say exactly. But I believe she probably blindfolded him at this venue, and probably walked him outside across the street and then walked into the building took him downstairs in the elevator. He shows up, he&#8217;s blindfolded, we walked in [inaudible 00:51:39].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve still a thought of the fact that he just went with this woman and got blindfolded, just went with her.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah, man. It&#8217;s like, what is he going to do? Is he going to say no?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah. He did it. So, it was just funny.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, you say kidnapping, I&#8217;m thinking like somebody got shoved in the back of a panel van or something. He sounds like a willing participant in this case. Well, go ahead. Go ahead.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I can imagine that for someone in his position, it must have been definitely strange. He thought he&#8217;s going to an office to talk to somebody, he&#8217;s being blindfolded by some attractive young lady and brought to who he doesn&#8217;t even know where he&#8217;s going.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
This white van as far as we&#8217;re concerned. She takes him into the back room and we have the lights down low. I remember exhaustion now, Jeff and I we&#8217;re back there. So we had turntables in there. And I remember because I was in the other room. I just remember Sacha had something&#8230; He had some record on the turntable, and he kept looping it. So it was just super creepy. He was just scratching it, [inaudible 00:52:50] just back spinning it. Super creepy thing. And then we instruct Caramanica to take off his blindfold. And then the guys proceeded to talk with the flashlight under their heads.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow!.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And then they do the interview. And finally, it&#8217;s time to leave. I do remember Jeff going like, &#8220;It&#8217;s time to go.&#8221; And I do remember Jeff now going like, &#8220;Hey, thanks. Thanks for coming by, you know what you got to do now, right?&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; So we asked our friend to&#8230; The young lady to blindfold him again. We span him around a few times, and he exited the building. And the rest is history.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow! That&#8217;s a wild story. That&#8217;s a wild story. So, Ego Trip eventually evolved from this magazine to a book, to several television shows. I mentioned prior to us recording how I remember watching those shows on VH1 as a teenager, the White Rapper Show and Miss Rap Supreme, and Race-O-Rama and everything, and just being so&#8230; Well, maybe not so much the reality shows, but certainly, the visual elements from like Race-O-Rama and stuff like that being so enamored with&#8230; I had never seen anything like that before talking about black culture, hip hop culture, that kind of thing. I&#8217;ve never seen it done in that way. And it blew my mind. It was really&#8230; I have to say it was kind of an early design reference for me, I wanted to make stuff like that. I wanted to be able to kind of have that sort of tongue in cheek irreverence towards culture in that way, in a way that felt familiar, but also felt kind of new and fresh, unlike something that you haven&#8217;t really seen before.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Oh, man, thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I think that was again, the&#8230; For me, that was a little bit of a Terry Gilliam in terms of all the crazy animations that you would see from Monty Python. That was my inspiration in the sense of the humor of stuff. And how do you express that stuff visually. And everything that we were doing in Ego Trip was really&#8230; It&#8217;s funny, because I&#8217;d like to think that we&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say that we originated things, but there definitely wasn&#8217;t any sort of bigger reference. And it&#8217;s funny how meme culture has years later sort of assumed some of the similarities to what we were doing. So, was it a human thing? I don&#8217;t know. But it was in terms of like pairing these references and music lyrics to things and doing so like tongue and cheek, but I don&#8217;t know, but we definitely did it early. And so yeah, for Race-O-Rama, each episode, or there was three series, I&#8217;m sorry, three episodes in the series.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And Race-O-Rama was this kind of fun house idea. And the idea that looking at race through this sort of voyeuristic lens. And so each of the shows was blackophobia, which used sort of the visual language of horror films, and pulp alien invasion movies and stuff like that. In Race We Lost, which was pulling from the visuals of like&#8230; I mean, I love this time square CD, porno theater graphics and all that kind of stuff. And the other one was, &#8220;Dude, Where&#8217;s My Ghetto Pass?&#8221; Which was kind of like this we call an urban safari. So this idea of cultural sort of, not necessarily appropriation, but this sort of&#8230; Everything was about the voyeurism of race, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
So, once we started thinking about those kinds of things, it was just like, it was just super fun to kind of riff off of them, because our take on on discussing race or presenting race was about the idea of not so much making fun of it, but at least making it less about some of the typical things or things that people would immediately associate when you&#8217;re talking about race. Particularly at that time, that series was based off of&#8230; Well, that series sprang from a book that we wrote called The Big Book of Racism. And that was a book that Dana Albarella, our beloved editor, who also produced our Ego Trip&#8217;s, Book of Rap Lists, she had moved on from St. Martin&#8217;s Press to HarperCollins, which was headed by Judith Regan, who was kind of a big shot in the publishing world, particularly at that time. And so we had the opportunity to do that book called The Big Book of Racism.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And our thing about that book was that it was about race, because that was our secondary preoccupation after hip hop, the title and the premise kind of started off as a joke. And then we actually kind of started really getting into it. The thing about that book was we wanted to talk about race in a way that people could relate to, because generally, when people talked about race, they talked about sort of the history and we&#8217;re talking about the history of race from the arrival of slaves in America, up until the civil rights era. And so&#8230; And it tended to be very academic. And our lens as far as how we related to each other and joked with each other, was always through the lens of popular culture. And so the idea of doing a look at race through the lens of popular culture, was an interesting challenge. It was a crazy challenge for us.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And on top of that, to bring attention to things and to make fun of it, or to joke about it, in that sort of sarcastic sort of coping mechanism kind of way. And it was really hard because we wrote it during 911.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh!</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Which really&#8230; Yeah. There was a point where we had started writing that book, The Big Book of Racism, and then 911 happened and we were just like, &#8220;Man, we don&#8217;t hate anybody, we&#8217;re critiquing things.&#8221; But it was very difficult. But we kind of decided if we&#8217;re going to do this, it&#8217;s going to be&#8230; If we&#8217;re going to fail, it&#8217;s going to be a magnificent failure. We were just like, let&#8217;s&#8230; Man, I&#8217;ve never doubted myself as much. I don&#8217;t edit and perhaps I&#8217;m speaking for the rest of the guys when we were doing that thing because we were just like, &#8220;Should we do this at a time when people needed unity?&#8221; And we&#8217;re just writing, not so much a divisive book, but a book to sort of in our minds, illustrate why people of color feel the way they do based off of the treatment that popular culture has presented. And so that was always my interest personally, was understanding how popular culture affects the perception of people. And so like I was saying, a lot of the academic books spoke to a very specific audience. And our goal was to be anti-academic.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Chock full of information and intended to be sort of ingested sporadically wherever you want to enter it, but also for you to walk away to understand like, &#8220;Oh, damn, this country is built on race, there&#8217;s so much race in this country that people want to not acknowledge. And here&#8217;s our sort of listical way of doing it with jokes.&#8221; With comedy, but trying to make it apparent. That&#8217;s the role of an artist, is to make you see things that are right there in front of you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Wow! During 911. Yeah. That was certainly a very interesting. I think that was definitely a pivotal point in the country as it relates to race relations. Because aside from that, you got the formation of the TSA and how that has changed. Just so many things around screening in airports and stuff like that. But it really turned the dial on how race relations were in this country.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah, there was a lot of internal examination going on. And that tragedy. Tragedy sort of expose what you&#8217;re made of, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Even just the recent craziness that we, as a country have been going through the past few years, it&#8217;s ultimately I guess, a good thing because it&#8217;s being brought to light. And then you see where people are trying to reach out and where people are trying to find those commonalities, and that common ground, and where they&#8217;re not. And so that just reemerges.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know that you have worked with Ego Trip for a number of years, but during that time, you also were the creative director at Complex for a while. What were some of your memories from that time?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I was creative director after Ego Trip, we had sort of kind of fizzled and disbanded.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, okay.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah. So there was a period where I was kind of back to sort of doing&#8230; I was always kind of working on independent projects concurrently while doing Ego Trip, when Ego Trip was in sort of in full rev, that&#8217;s where I spent the most focus on. But there were always opportunities to do album covers, or things like that during that time. But complex kind of came about because actually our former Ego Trip intern, Noah was an editor at complex and he sort of, he needed, I like to call myself a substitute teacher, because the previous art director had left, and they needed to finish a few issues. And so that&#8217;s when I kind of came in to work on the magazine. And then what was interesting about working there, was I came in and sort of helped finish the issues. And I was like, &#8220;Okay, cool, this is fun.&#8221; Got to work with some younger designers, and really start to exercise my kind of delegation, and start to teach in some ways or pass along whatever information that I could and knowledge that I could to other people, and to learn how to shape things.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Because when you&#8217;re creative, you tend to keep it to yourself and you do things that you don&#8217;t need to do. Like you don&#8217;t need to scan, you don&#8217;t need to&#8230; If we&#8217;re talking about graphics, you don&#8217;t need to do the silhouetting. You don&#8217;t need to do that stuff. Maybe you do it sometimes out of necessity, and maybe you might get really good at it. But the bigger thing is just really putting all those pieces together. So it was a great exercise to learn how to orchestrate a symphony. And that&#8217;s kind of what I refer to myself as a creative conductor, because at a certain point, it&#8217;s less about my actual hands and more about my actual thought and how do you put all those elements together. And so Complex became from a magazine, and this is during start of the decline of print as a popular media form, and the ascension of the web as the dominant media form. And so Complex, all the business heads behind it, were very perceptive in terms of growing that business.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And so that&#8217;s what also kept me there, was learning. I learned about media when we were doing stuff with VH1, but the opportunity to work with teams of people and to build a business really, was exciting. That was an exciting opportunity because now, I&#8217;m dealing with for the first time in my life, a generation of people whose references are different than mine. And I&#8217;m now in this position of also learning from them. So, I like to learn new things. And I get excited by new stuff. And I&#8217;m always looking for that new drug. Like, &#8220;Yo, I need to get high again, give me that design crack. Give me that culture crack.&#8221; That was an opportunity to stay plugged in and to learn new things. And also to be able to work with people. And also Ego Trip as &#8220;successful&#8221; as we were, we hit a wall in a sense, and going to Complex was an opportunity to sort of flex some different muscles and to see&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Ego Trip was patronizing in the sense of that we had the VH1 give us money. VH1 gave us money and before that the book publishers gave us money. But we were not successful in the sense of able to generate money ourselves. So, Complex was an opportunity to sort of look behind the curtain and then kind of step behind that curtain and see how business, or how entrepreneurial minded business grows and develops and becomes like this media titan that it is today. So, that&#8217;s what kept me there, was to learn from the younger designers, to help shape them also, to pass on that information and that knowledge, and they would also show me some things or helped me&#8230; I used to say they helped me think. Because they would try different things and I&#8217;d be like, &#8220;No, no, no, no, no.&#8221; They would create these different options&#8230; I&#8217;m a good critic, I think. As a graphic designer or a communication designer, or that kind of visual designer, you&#8217;re taking these kind of existing elements, and arranging them versus an artist necessarily who kind of create something from scratch.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
So, they would create these things from scratch in some ways, or create these options and then I can look at them and be like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, no, no, no, no, no, this is not communicating, or this is not tapping into that feeling that we were talking about before. This is not communicating this thing.&#8221; And helping to shape them. So, that was immensely satisfying. And working with celebrities is interesting and fun. And traveling around the world is great. And so, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you define success now?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Success is kind of about satisfying the need to create projects that actually propel ideas and culture. And I guess that&#8217;s maybe always the idea of success for me. I think the idea of monetary success, yes, I&#8217;m not going to say that that&#8217;s not important. But I&#8217;ve come closer to this understanding of when my time is up, for me, what am I putting forth in the world, or what&#8217;s my legacy? And so I can&#8217;t do everything myself, there are things that I&#8217;m working on that are about personal vision, but as a group, we can accomplish a lot of things. Ego Trip as a group, we accomplished things that we didn&#8217;t think we would ever accomplish. Working in Complex, we accomplished things that were in that&#8230; The metrics for that world, we surpassed them. And so for me, when people tell me that they&#8217;ve been influenced by something that I did, or they show some sort of appreciation for the things that I&#8217;ve done, and even more so when these things are attached to something that has some sort of cultural importance, man, that&#8217;s a great feeling.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I want to keep doing that. For me, that&#8217;s the metric of success. Again, know how to make money, [inaudible 01:08:48] money, love me some money. But we&#8217;re put on this world to do things. And so I&#8217;m happy and fortunate that whatever mark I&#8217;ve made in the world, I&#8217;ve been able to do. I think the thing about it is, it&#8217;s also fleeting, and it&#8217;s also like you got to keep doing things. Success is also somewhat short lived. You know what I mean? I&#8217;m happy to inspire people, but I&#8217;m also like, I want to inspire more people and I need to keep doing to continue to be relevant, not because I&#8217;m trying to be the cool of the week, but because a large enough body of people are viewing and affected by the things that I work on. Right now, that would be the marker of success to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. That&#8217;s a very interesting answer.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I guess because I&#8217;ve been kind of dropping these little pins like throughout the interview like your work, and the work that you did with Ego Trip, the work you did with Complex, is really like been a cornerstone in the design style of when people think of hip hop culture, a lot of that boils down to work that you have done, whether that&#8217;s been magazines, we didn&#8217;t even touch on the album covers that you&#8217;ve done. I feel like a lot of people are inspired by your work, but they may not know that it&#8217;s from you, maybe.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. It&#8217;s funny. The thing about [inaudible 01:10:15] is because it&#8217;s still kind of being done in the service of whoever. And I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to work with people who more or less are like, &#8220;Hey, Brent, I like your style.&#8221; I had to develop a style because the more you do something, the more people recognize it. And then if they like it, then they come to you. But in some cases, yeah. There&#8217;s been the suppression of Ego in the sense of, it&#8217;s not about me, it&#8217;s about I&#8217;m doing this for someone else. And so yeah, there&#8217;s been things that I&#8217;ve done that maybe people don&#8217;t see that thread, I have a good friend, Phil McMillan, who he was another designer. And he&#8217;s&#8230; Some people are really in tune with it. He&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;I saw this and I was like, yo, I think Brent did that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
So he sees it. And so whatever is the essence of me creatively shows up in those things and he&#8217;s in tune with that, and he can find that. And there are other people that can do that too. And so that&#8217;s a much more honest relationship, when you can work with those people, because that means you guys are on the same wavelength. And so that&#8217;s&#8230; I found that those have been the best projects for me, is when people come to me because they do know, because they are familiar with the things that I&#8217;ve done, and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;That&#8217;s the vibe that I want.&#8221; And it&#8217;s freeing because it lets me be me. I&#8217;m a designer in the sense that I&#8217;m problem solving, but I&#8217;m also an artist in the sense that I&#8217;m trying to express something emotionally and I connected with those people. And so, yeah. Ramble, ramble, ramble, ramble.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, is there a dream project that you would love to do one day? I feel like you&#8217;ve done television, you&#8217;ve done magazines, you&#8217;ve done album covers, you&#8217;ve done a book. What&#8217;s next? What do you really want to do one day?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
There are many dream projects that I want to do. There&#8217;s personal projects that I&#8217;ve finally started initiating. One is really getting into furniture design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Yeah. And so I had gone to Italy in 2019 to start that. I&#8217;m working with a friend of mine over there. And then just the nature of the project really meant that I couldn&#8217;t restart it until the warmer months. Totally happens and dashes those dreams on the Mediterranean rocks. That&#8217;ll still happen. And then I have a sort of a creative&#8230; The dream projects, yeah. I mean, it&#8217;s really more about when does Brent start putting his own voice forward more? Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
My voice has been forward in people&#8217;s projects, and mostly because I&#8217;d never&#8230; I would probably say that there&#8217;s one critique with myself, it&#8217;s like I devalue what I think I have to say. I have an idea&#8230; I actually started this project during the pandemia, I&#8217;m going to is like Black Star Wars, and let people kind of go from there. But I started some stuff in making models, telling friends who are also creative, and they got super excited about that stuff. And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, man, I wanted the soundtrack.&#8221; And you got to have this character do this, and you got to do that. And it&#8217;ll happen. And I&#8217;m not afraid to say it. I thought about like, &#8220;Should I even talk about this?&#8221; But hall yeah. But really, just more personal projects are exciting. My father was a phenomenal creative person who passed away recently.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
And my mission I guess, is to let the world kind of see what this guy who inspired me, what he did, and with the hope that maybe he also inspires other people, so that&#8217;s also another project. Man, I got a lot of projects. God, I got a lot of things. Yeah. Like I said, 2021 let&#8217;s go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I hear you. Well, Brent, just to kind of wrap things up here. Where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
I guess online you can look me up Brettrollins.com under my website that really needs to be updated. You can follow me on Instagram, my handle is Brentronic, B-R-E-N-T-R-O-N-I-C, and then at that point, by the end 2021, hopefully you&#8217;ll be seeing my name in a lot more places when you won&#8217;t even try.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Brent Rollins, I have to thank you. Just thank you so much for coming on the show. I guess prior to us recording about how much of a design influence you&#8217;ve been to me seeing your early work, and it&#8217;s been just such a pleasure to one just introduce you to the Revision Path audience, I have a feeling that people are going to listen to this. And they&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Wait a minute, he did that!&#8221; They&#8217;re going to now know that you are the person behind so much iconic work out there. It&#8217;s just been a joy to talk to you, it&#8217;s been a joy to hear about the work that you&#8217;re doing. And I want to see what comes next absolutely, because I have no doubt it&#8217;s going to be hot. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Brent Rollins:</b><br>
Man, thank you so much. And I know other people will say the same thing to you, man. But dude, you&#8217;re doing God&#8217;s work. Thank you so much for doing Revision Path.</p>

<p>The best way I can describe Ari Melenciano is that she is a renaissance talent. As an artist, researcher, and creative technologist, Ari is always finding new ways to express herself, speak to social issues, and find ways to use her art to enhance the lives of everyday people.</p>
<p>Ari talked about her residency at NYU&#8217;s Interactive Telecommunications Program, which helped her create <a href="https://www.afrotectopia.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Afrotectopia</a>, a multi-day new media arts, culture and technology festival. She also spoke about growing up around art and music, including how technology ended up being the catalyst for the work she does now. I don&#8217;t want to spoil this great conversation too much &#8212; we were both coming off of this year&#8217;s Black in Design Conference, and I think you&#8217;ll really feel the spirit and energy that both of us still had from the event! Ari is out here doing important and vital work, and this episode captures that perfectly. Thank you Ari for showing us a vision of an equitable future!</p>

<p>Adrian Franks is a one-of-a-kind renaissance man. His work as a UX creative director at IBM focuses on experience design (iX) for their global business services brand, but trust me &#8212; his skills don&#8217;t stop there.</p>
<p>Our conversation began with Adrian walking us through his typical days of meetings and projects, but things really came alive when we talked about his days growing up and learning design in Atlanta. Adrian also talked about how he connected with the venerable film maker Spike Lee for a series of art projects, and shared some great advice on the types of skills designers need to have in order to achieve their best work. I&#8217;m so glad we have designers like Adrian out there who can show us what the true possibilities of creativity can be!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a part of Chicago&#8217;s design scene, then you&#8217;ve no doubt heard of the multitalented Jonathan Sangster. They are currently an assistant professor of design at Chicago State University, and they also collaborate on projects involving visual art, design, printed matter, typography and visual experimentation.</p>
<p>We spoke about Jonathan&#8217;s recent exhibition at this year&#8217;s¬†<a href="http://typeforce.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Typeforce</a>, and from there they shared a peek into their creative process which challenges binary thoughts by layering experiences and pursuing different points of view through visual outputs. Jonathan also talked about what he learns from his students, the Chicago design community, and a lot more. Thank you Jonathan for your work and for talking with us about what you do!</p>
