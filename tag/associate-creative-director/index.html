Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>These past two years have been stressful for all of us in a lot of ways, but this week&#8217;s guest is proof that you can find a way to redirect those feelings into something positive. Meet Roneka Patterson, an associate creative director at Hawkeye in Dallas, Texas, and the co-creator of <a href="https://unwrittenrulesproject.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">The Unwritten Rules</a>.</p>
<p>Roneka and I talked about adjusting to work from home life, and she shared a bit about her process and what it&#8217;s like to be a creative director. From there, we discussed The Unwritten Rules, including how the project was launched last summer with other Black creatives, and she shared how she got Hawkeye on board with amplifying its message. Roneka also spoke about mentorship and how she&#8217;s helping local high schoolers discover their creativity as well. Roneka&#8217;s motto &#8212; &#8220;keep going&#8221; &#8212; is one I think we can all adopt as we move forward and chart our own paths to success in this industry!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I&#8217;m Roneka Patterson. I&#8217;m an associate creative director with an art director background. I work at Hawkeye, which is an agency, an ad agency in Dallas, Texas. I&#8217;ve been at Hawkeye for about four and a half years, and I work on the Capital One account. So we do just basically a little bit of everything for Capital One, but a lot of CRM and direct mail, email messaging for them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now we&#8217;ve had quite a few advertising folks on the show, probably since the beginning of Revision Path, but certainly over the past year or so. How has it been adjusting to the work from home life?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s had its ups and downs. I think when we first started last year, there was definitely a lot of anxiety for me. I&#8217;m kind of an introvert and so I really relished having my time at my home with my family away from work. I think there was just a lot of nervousness on our team when we first went home. I was just getting pinged all night, 7:00, 8:00, 9:00 at night through our messaging apps. Finally had to like, &#8220;Guys, we still need to have some boundaries here even though we&#8217;re at home.&#8221; So that stuff has kind of leveled out, but there&#8217;s still I&#8217;ve three year old daughter and so there&#8217;s times when she&#8217;s at home trying to work and my wife and I are juggling who&#8217;s got her now. It&#8217;s been a challenge.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I&#8217;ll say that from a creative standpoint, I don&#8217;t feel like the work for our team has dipped any. I feel like we&#8217;ve actually been a little bit more creative working from home. I don&#8217;t know. I think there&#8217;s a freedom of being able to work at your own pace with things, whereas if you&#8217;re in an office there&#8217;s a little bit more like, &#8220;Okay, how are things coming,&#8221; you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
But this has definitely been my most creative year in a while in terms of just the types of ideas that I&#8217;ve had, the thinking I&#8217;ve been able to do. I&#8217;m grateful for that. It&#8217;s been ups and downs, definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How long did it take for you to get into a groove where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, I can do this day to day.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Oh, man. I think maybe over the summer. Maybe the fall of last year, of 2020, I think that&#8217;s when things kind of started to level out. So it was a good six months of it just being very chaotic. Not chaotic in the sense like, &#8220;Oh, I wish we could go back to the office,&#8221; but just this is just a lot. And I know that it&#8217;s a lot more than it would be if we were in the office. I think that fall is pretty much when it started to feel like okay, I feel like I&#8217;ve got the handle of this and it just wasn&#8217;t as intense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about your work at Hawkeye. You mentioned you&#8217;re an associate creative director. Is the Capital One account the only project you&#8217;re working on or do you work with other clients?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah, I work with a couple of other clients just on project by project basis. I&#8217;m dedicated to Capital One. Our team that I work on, there&#8217;s about 30 of us. I think we&#8217;re one of the larger accounts in the agency and so we work pretty much primarily on them. But there are little things that come in the door that we can help out with for other clients. So I&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s about a 90/10 split.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So let&#8217;s say a new project comes in. Talk to me about that process. Where do you come in? How do you work with the particular client? How does that work?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
So as an associate creative director, I&#8217;m a half manager, half hands kind of person, I think moving a little bit more towards manager. So basically when a project comes in, I&#8217;m helping staff the job. So it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, we think this project is going to need two art directors and a writer, or two art directors and two writers.&#8221; I&#8217;ll help with that and then I&#8217;ll just be providing oversight and guidance as those projects happen. So I&#8217;m helping out with brainstorming, helping check files to make sure that they&#8217;re built correctly per the standards of the client. Basically just oversight.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Occasionally I&#8217;ll still get in there and do some design work. If we&#8217;re a little understaffed and we&#8217;ve got some people out on PTO, I can definitely help out in those cases. But generally just providing oversight and guidance based on the experience that I&#8217;ve had working on the account.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so how long did it take you to get to that point within Hawkeye? Because I would imagine coming in you have to work your way up to that, right?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah. So I&#8217;ve been an associate creative director for a year and a half now. I think it&#8217;ll be two years in January. So prior to that I was a senior art director, and so a lot of what I was doing was the associate creative director level of things where I&#8217;m having to lead presentations and oversight on jobs. It hasn&#8217;t changed much, but yeah, a lot of it was just getting familiar with the company, getting familiar with the team, establishing a name for myself on the team. And then again, just starting to do that next level of work that finally they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, yeah, you should definitely be doing this job because you should be getting paid for this because that&#8217;s the job that you&#8217;ve been doing.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s a typical day for you working at Hawkeye?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
So a typical day for me now, a lot of meetings. Whether it&#8217;s kickoff calls, like we&#8217;re kicking off new jobs, status calls just to see what everyone on the team is working with and help allot resources for the different projects. We do a lot of check-ins. Our account is very agile, so they love to meet. They&#8217;d much rather over communicate than things get dropped. And so we&#8217;ll do a lot of check-ins internally with our creative folks, like this is how the work is coming along. We&#8217;ll give feedback, we&#8217;ll do check-ins.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Capital One has their own robust creative department, so we&#8217;ll do check-ins with them to make sure that the work that we&#8217;re creating meets the brand needs. And then we&#8217;ll do check-ins with the client, the business managers who&#8217;ve actually requested the work. So a lot of meetings. In between there is time for brainstorms and occasional sketching, but a lot of it is just making sure that things are moving properly, that creative folks have the help they need so if they&#8217;re stuck on something or if they need an extra set of eyes on something, providing that support. But that&#8217;s pretty much how my days go nowadays.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s something that you think people underestimate about your role?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
So when you&#8217;re at a CD level, and this may be me making assumption about that level, there&#8217;s a lot more strictly oversight. It&#8217;s understood that your job is to lead and to direct. With an associate creative director, you&#8217;re kind of in this in between area where there&#8217;s an expectation that if we get in a jam, you&#8217;re going to have to help out designing something or laying out something. Because of that, even though my workload, it may look like Roneka is only designing on a couple of things, I&#8217;m actually overseeing seven or eight things. So I think sometimes there&#8217;s the assumption that because you don&#8217;t see me doing the art direction stuff, that I&#8217;m not doing direction.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s one of those things, it&#8217;s not like a woe is me type of thing, but it&#8217;s something that I didn&#8217;t realize about the role before I got into it was just that there&#8217;s a lot of oversight takes time, to make sure to check in projects, to be able to switch on a dime to remembering, where are we at with this one? What kind of feedback can I give here that would be helpful? Presenting to clients, just being able to manage if something goes wrong and how do you talk to that? How do you speak to that in the moment? There&#8217;s just a lot of that kind of stuff that I think I wasn&#8217;t cognizant of before I got into the role.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve heard that from other folks that are in advertising as well, so what you&#8217;re saying definitely lines up with that. I want to go more into your background. I know you&#8217;re at Hawkeye, which is located in Dallas. Are you originally from Dallas?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m from Austin, which is about three hours south of Dallas, so I didn&#8217;t go very far. Yeah, most of my family is from the Dallas Fort Worth area and my parents just kind of branched down to Austin and had me. I just stuck down there while I grew up and then I ended up moving back to Fort Worth for school.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you know early on that you were into design and advertising and all of that?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah, so I always loved art. I love to paint, I love to draw, I love sculptures. Always had a passion for that. I mean, I can do think back to grade school and just being super into that kind of stuff. So I didn&#8217;t necessarily understand how to make a career out of that in terms of what design was, what advertising, art direction, all that kind of stuff. But I knew that I was really passionate about that.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Funny, actually, when I was in middle school, I used to run track. Pretty good at it. We were city champions my eighth grade year, which was a highlight for me. When I got to high school, it&#8217;s a different ball game when you&#8217;re changing sports in high school. There was a lot of practice for running track in high school. And I remember going home with my mom one day and I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do this anymore.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I want to just focus on my art.&#8221; And my mom was like, &#8220;Well, whatever you do, just make sure you go a 100%.&#8221; So she let me get out of track and I really started focusing on art.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I was taking art classes. I got some AP credit in art that I was able to take to college with me. I loved to create, to draw. I used to joke that my favorite class in high school other than art was history class because it allowed me time to just draw. I&#8217;d sit in my seat and just draw during the class and I loved that. But that&#8217;s where that love started to really strengthen. From there I was like, &#8220;Okay, I want to go to school, to college, and I don&#8217;t know how to do this.&#8221; So I was able to find TCU had a really good graphic design program, so I was able to get into that and the rest was history.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s talk about that. Tell me what your time was like at TCU.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
It was good. It&#8217;s a small private school and there&#8217;s a lot of money that gets poured into that school. They&#8217;ve got a pretty good football program. The Black community there is pretty tight knit because I think there&#8217;s only like 8% Black students there out of the entire school. So created some camaraderie that was nice.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
In terms of the design program there, I think I was the only Black woman in my coursework, but there were other Black folks in the fine arts, studio arts degree path. So I was able to make some connections with them. Some of them I still speak to to this day.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
So I think that overall, with all of the creatives that I&#8217;ve met through my career, I do feel like it was a really solid education, a really solid foundation. It taught me design fundamentals, an understanding of conceptual advertising thinking. I&#8217;ve met some folks that didn&#8217;t have one or the other, who went to an ad school or a design school. I just feel like TCU gave me a really good balance of the two things.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I&#8217;ll say that that&#8217;s where I had my first design job. I had a professor who pulled me this side one day and he was like, &#8220;Roneka, the dining hall is hiring.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Excuse me? What&#8217;s that have to do with me?&#8221; He was like, &#8220;No, no, no.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;They have a marketing department and they&#8217;re hiring. They&#8217;re looking for a designer and so I think you should check that out. I think it might be a good fit for you.&#8221; It was great. I got to design posters and little logos for advertising around the dining hall. I got a free meal every day, which was amazing. And so that was my first design job was at TCU.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. In a way they really did prepare you for getting out there, working as a designer because you got a job working for the college while you were there.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yep. Yeah, it was awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. So when you graduated, what was your early career like? I see you worked for an agency called Sonus. Tell me about that experience.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah. So that was a privately owned small boutique marketing agency. And so I think when I got hired, there was one other designer there and then I think she left within a year so I was the sole designer there. We had an account person and me. It gave me a good foundation of these are all the things that are entailed with marketing, kind of had to do it all. I learned how to present to clients because I was the person that had to present. I did the work and I had to present the work. Timelines, budgeting, all that kind of stuff. I think I learned more in that experience than I think I would&#8217;ve learned just being dropped into an agency environment or a larger agency because there just wasn&#8217;t enough hands. I had to do a lot of it.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I left there to work at an ad agency, and I worked there for six or seven years. It was at Moroch in Dallas. That experience, high highs and low lows. I think that I got to work on a bunch of different clients. I got to do a lot of different types of projects. The range of work that I got to do there really was amazing. It was the aughts, the mid-aughts, the late-aughts, so there was a lot of&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, the reckoning that&#8217;s happened in advertising over the last year or so, that was not a thing back then. So there was a lot of just political, cultural things that just really just wore me down.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
There&#8217;s too many things to name. Just random things that happened that I think if you talk to any Black person who&#8217;s worked in corporate America, they could probably be like, &#8220;Yeah, yeah. That sounds about right.&#8221; After the time that I spent there, I left that agency and I said that I was never going to work in advertising again. I don&#8217;t care where I work. I&#8217;ll be a postal worker, I&#8217;ll work at the art museum. I don&#8217;t care. I can&#8217;t do this anymore and I don&#8217;t want to go back. This isn&#8217;t for me.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
So I ended up at a greeting card company. So we did basically the B2B greeting cards, the type of cards that corporations send out during the holidays. So I worked in the marketing department there and got to lead and also just to see how things go from the business side because that&#8217;s another thing that you don&#8217;t really get to see when you&#8217;re working in an agency is just the business side of things. How are some of those decisions made? How are our agencies received? Because we worked with some freelance agencies, some of our projects and just sitting on the other side of the table, how are those things received?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
So I did that for a little while and then I started to get the itch about potentially moving back into an agency environment. I&#8217;d said for myself it needed to be the right agency. It needed to be the right environment. I needed to feel safe. I don&#8217;t mean safe in the sense of boring, but safe as a Black queer woman, am I going to be safe in that environment? Am I going to have opportunities in that environment? So that&#8217;s how I ended up at Hawkeye. Actually, I got interviewed by two women who were creative directors and immediately I was like, &#8220;Okay, this may be it.&#8221; I&#8217;d never actually worked with a female creative director before in my entire career. So that was a very big reason why I wanted to work there. There are a bunch of other women creative directors at Hawkeye, which was really, really comforting for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is it that appealed to you about going back to work at an agency?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I missed the creative department. I missed having a team of other creatives that you could bounce ideas off of, that could help push you and help push your work. I missed that. I missed having writers that could help me generate ideas and say it in a way, a lot more concisely than I could say it. I missed all of that. I missed the direction and just opportunities to just solve different types of business problems for people. I missed all that.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I didn&#8217;t realize it when I left that first agency, but I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I definitely miss&#8230;&#8221; When you don&#8217;t have it, that&#8217;s when you realize, yeah, there&#8217;s some value in having people around you that are super smart and super talented and they can just help make your work better. Also, they get it. You&#8217;re not having to explain and reexplain why creative is valuable and why it&#8217;s important.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s good that you had that break after working for two agencies for a long time. You can sort of separate yourself a bit from it. There&#8217;s that saying that hindsight is 2020. So you&#8217;re able to then look back and say, &#8220;All right, well, these are things I liked and this is why I want to have more of these things and maybe less of something else.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yep. You got it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you talk about encountering a female creative director and that&#8217;s sort of what made you decide to work with Hawkeye, but did you encounter a lot of Black creatives in advertising throughout your career?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
A handful, Maurice, a handful. when I was at Moroch I think there was about maybe five of us total Black creatives there. Traditionally in advertising, I met more Black strategists, account folks, relationship management folks. We had a few of those there. But creative, it was just few and far between really, and it was very discouraging.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I never saw anyone that outranked me. It was either a peer or someone that was a junior level. It gets in your head a little bit because you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, maybe this is not thing that women can do. Maybe this is not a thing that Black women can do to be leaders, to be creative leaders.&#8221; I know logically that&#8217;s not true. I keep an eye on the industry, I know that that&#8217;s a thing that happens outside of where I&#8217;m at right now. But when you&#8217;re young coming up, you just don&#8217;t know. I was like, &#8220;Maybe I have to move account side or move into strategy and that will allow me to grow, have advancement.&#8221; But yeah, it messes with your head a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you found now that you&#8217;re more into your career in terms of tenure that you&#8217;ve encountered more Black creatives?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely, definitely. I&#8217;ve gotten a lot more comfortable and confident with networking. Like I said earlier, there is a camaraderie that we have, those of us in this business, even if we don&#8217;t know each other. There&#8217;s just a little like, &#8220;Oh, yep, yep, yep.&#8221; You know you&#8217;re probably fighting some of the same battles and trying to champion some of the same causes. And so yeah, I definitely, any time I&#8217;m out and about, whether it&#8217;s an industry thing, an industry event or a conference or something, I&#8217;m definitely connecting with folks because you just never know.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
You never know when you&#8217;ll run into those folks again, there may be an opportunity that you can provide someone or vice versa. I see a lot more now and I&#8217;m able to connect with a lot more now, which is really, really nice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You created a project called The Unwritten Rules, which you did in conjunction with a former Revision Path guest we had on the show before, Alex Pierce, along with some other Black creatives. Talk to me about that. How did this come about?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah, so this came about last summer. Obviously we had just a period of months of just&#8230; It was like a drumbeat of violence against Black people. Shootings and police violence and intimidation and gaslighting. Obviously a lot of that, the feelings of that culminated with George Floyd&#8217;s passing, murder rather.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
So Alex reached out to me and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m going to get some folks together to see if there&#8217;s just something that we can do or create just to get some of our feelings out about what&#8217;s happening.&#8221; And so I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yep, just invite me to the meeting. I&#8217;ll be there.&#8221; There was about 20 of us, and so mostly creatives, couple of strategy folks. And Hawkeye, like most agencies, it&#8217;s a predominantly white agency, but the Black creatives there, we all have a side group chat and we keep in contact with each other, check in with each other. It was Alex and myself and Adam Johnson who&#8217;s a Black copywriter formerly, at Hawkeye. He was at Hawkeye at the time. Couple of other creatives.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
We just talked, the Black folks on the team, we just kind of talked. We were like, &#8220;What are we feeling? What message can we say? What can we create? What can we do?&#8221; We did some brainstorming, we just did some really just brainstorming. What could we do? What could we create? We settled in this idea about these rules, these unwritten rules that Black folks all know that the larger population may not be cognizant of. In the conversation, it was just a little bit like, &#8220;What if we came up with an encyclopedia or just a foundry of these different rules?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
We talked a lot about tone because part of the thing last year that happened with a lot of agencies, immediately there was a lot of like, &#8220;Things are bad and here&#8217;s your black square and we need to do better. And we will.&#8221; Okay, great. It was like the universal we need to do better. Okay. We&#8217;ve been telling you that for a while, but okay. I&#8217;m glad you caught up. Tonally, we were like, &#8220;These rules are not melodramatic, trauma porny kind of stuff.&#8221; As a Black person, they don&#8217;t make me feel anything other than, yeah, this is just the way we have to&#8230; These are the things we have to know to stay safe and to avoid craziness.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
It was very similar, in a lot of ways, to we&#8217;re doing some research on The Green Book If you read The Green Book, or any of The Green Books, there is a very matter of fact tone about the fact that this magazine needed to be created to keep Black people safe. It wasn&#8217;t like a so and so got lynched yesterday. It was very much like, &#8220;Hey, if you&#8217;re going to be driving to El Paso, here&#8217;s a body shop that you can go and get your car serviced. They won&#8217;t hassle you.&#8221; Very matter of fact. That kind of tone resonated with us. It made sense to us as Black folks. Again, these are rules that we just have to know, and we thought it would be a great matter of fact way to present these rules.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
One of the main things that we really wanted to do with it was not just to say, &#8220;Hey, these are rules that Black people need to know.&#8221; But the so what. So what is here&#8217;s some data that backs up why this rule is a thing. Here are some things that you, person who&#8217;s reading this rule, can do to help make this situation better. For all of the rules that we have that we outlined, we came up with some different resources that we thought would help pay off. You read this rule, here&#8217;s something if you want to get involved, here&#8217;s a thing that you can do that can hopefully help make this rule not be a thing anymore, to erase that rule.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
And so once we solidified this idea, we did some design exploration. There&#8217;s a designer at our agency. Her name is Rosie Ulloa, I always mispronounce her name. But she helped create the visual, the color scheme, the fonts, the visual direction for this. And from there, we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, we&#8217;re going to build a website. We&#8217;re going to do a social media campaign. We&#8217;re going to start creating some things with this.&#8221; And so from there, we started developing the website and we had an interactive designer, a web developer rather, from the company who was able to donate his time to help us build this thing. From there, it was once we had the look established we started working on our social calendar, because we did want to do an entire social media campaign that&#8217;s tied to this website to help promote the website. We wanted to do some user generated content. We want people to write in about rules that they&#8217;ve experienced that we may not have covered.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
The website ended up being pretty robust just from a researching standpoint. We did the audio, we did audio narration of all the rules so you&#8217;ll hear my voice on the website in some spots. We really wanted to do a full audio visual kind of multidimensional thing.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s kind of the origin of it. We did this on our own time. I do think the pandemic helped make this a thing. I think had we been in the office it would&#8217;ve been a little bit more challenging to, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re meeting on the fourth floor at four,&#8221; kind of thing. It&#8217;s a lot easier to just, here&#8217;s a Zoom link. Let&#8217;s link up. Just a lot of nights and weekends and some holidays just turning on it and refining it and getting the content, the writing.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
We had some great writers that have helped flesh things out. Oversight is what I was talking about earlier, making sure that the tone is right and making sure that we&#8217;re not saying things that are improper. Yeah, it was a big thing. At a certain point we had to tell our agency, &#8220;Hey, this is the thing that we built.&#8221; And they were super supportive. It was really just a passion project that&#8217;s still going, still reviewing social posts once a week. But yeah, it was a side of desk thing that took a lot of love and heart and we wanted to do it for Black people so that when Black folks see it they&#8217;ll know we got you. You&#8217;re being heard. You&#8217;re not alone in that experience. And then we wanted to do it for the broader population so that they see in writing that these are things that Black folks have to be aware of and why.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You said something interesting in there I want to, I guess, learn more about. You said at some point you had to let Hawkeye know that this was something that you were doing. Why is that?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Well, we needed some support. I think part of it, we needed some legal counsel with some of the user generated content stuff, ideas that we were thinking about. We wanted to be clear with Hawkeye that, while we are all representatives of Hawkeye in our day to day, this was a separate thing. We don&#8217;t want this to be The Unwritten Rules courtesy of Hawkeye. Our CEO, Joe DeMiero, he&#8217;s a great guy. He was very much from the get go like, &#8220;Whatever you guys need, let me know. I will help provide it. We are here to support. So whatever you guys want to do.&#8221; They&#8217;ve been very, very, just the right kind of support.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
We did want to do some promoting. [inaudible 00:30:53] has 70,000 employees globally. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, can we get this on some of our inner agency communications?&#8221; They were more than willing to do that. So we got some articles in our inner agency ecosystem. Hawkeye social promoted it and they basically were providing some promotional support, which was really, really, really appreciated on our part. But yeah, that was the extent.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
One other thing that we definitely said we wanted to do from the get go is we don&#8217;t want to really submit this for awards. This is not just a how to fix racism from an ad agency. We just so happen to work at an ad agency and we&#8217;re going to use the talents that we have just because we work in advertising to do this. But this isn&#8217;t awards bait. This isn&#8217;t a play to get advertisers to care about this cause. We wanted it to be bigger than that. We wanted it to be for the general public to experience and react to. Yeah, that&#8217;s kind of how we ended up where we are now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see this project going from here?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
So we have some things in the works. I&#8217;m not going to say specifically, but I probably should just to make sure we name it, claim it. Our social media calendar, we&#8217;ve got that planned out through next summer. And our social media, we&#8217;re basically taking the idea of the encyclopedia and kind of expanding it a little bit. We have a rule breaker series. These people in history who&#8217;ve broken rules, broken some of those unwritten rules. We&#8217;re doing definitions like defining what do we mean when we say defund the police? What does that mean? Sometimes just putting it in writing for people, making a record of it. We&#8217;re not the first people to talk about the unwritten rules. We&#8217;re not the first people to try to define defund the police and why it matters. But those are the types of things that we feel like The Unwritten Rules should talk about. That&#8217;s the big thing that&#8217;s continuing to happen. And like I said, we&#8217;ve got a couple of other things that we&#8217;re working on down the line.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s been the feedback so far from the project?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been positive. The best feedback I&#8217;ve gotten I think was from my family, who I&#8217;ve got Black Texans. Grew up in West Texas, East Texas, for them to be like, &#8220;This is amazing,&#8221; that says it. It says it in it&#8217;s beautiful. It says it in the right way. That&#8217;s been the best feedback for me. It&#8217;s been very, very positive, very, very affirmative. And it definitely does make the time and the love&#8230; There&#8217;s this moment when you send stuff out where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how this is going to be received. Is this going to work on Black Twitter?&#8221; Yeah, it&#8217;s been overwhelmingly positive and I think that&#8217;s part of why we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s keep going.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s good. The reason I was asking that before about why get your employer involved, because it sounded like this was something you really were all doing as a labor of love. I&#8217;m not saying this to cast dispersions on Hawkeye specifically, but I could see how an agency, particularly during this sort of time, would look at a project like that and try to claim ownership over it in some kind of way, you know?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;m sure there was probably a little twinge because there was some things that were presented to us where we had to turn it down. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, we have this newsletter.&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;No. It doesn&#8217;t really align with what we&#8217;re trying to do.&#8221; It was like, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re thinking we can create a training module that&#8217;s&#8230;&#8221; Like, &#8220;No, nope. It doesn&#8217;t really align with the time commitment that we have for this, for that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I know that if it had been a specifically Hawkeye driven project, I think definitely the rollout would&#8217;ve been different. And that&#8217;s just the nature of they&#8217;re in the business. They&#8217;re trying to get clients, they&#8217;re trying to show their clients that they&#8217;re a different type of agency than they are in a lot of ways, hence the support that we got for the project. I know it&#8217;s a fine balance, but they were all very, very respectful. Our executive leadership folks, they were very, very respectful and very grateful that we did this and just very supportive of whatever you guys need, we&#8217;re going to do it. We&#8217;re going to help you make it happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. That&#8217;s really great to hear, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, in your spare time, I noticed from going through on your website, you&#8217;re quite the photographer.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When did you first get into photography?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve always loved photography, even back to when I was in high school, picking up, figuring out what kind of art I wanted to create. I got my first camera in college. I&#8217;d had to take some photo classes to get my degree, and love it. I love being in the lightroom. I shoot all digital now so just love the ease of that.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
But I really got more serious about taking portraits when I was working back at the first agency that I was working at. This business, it&#8217;s a grind. And so I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll meet a single person in advertising, creative, who doesn&#8217;t have some type of side hustle or is like, &#8220;Oh yeah, I do murals. I paint.&#8221; And so that just ended up being the side hustle that I really gravitated towards.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
And so I started shooting with my friends and then that had started to lead to some actual work, some paid work. And it&#8217;s something that I love to do. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve kept up with. I take classes and tutorials. I&#8217;m a part of the Black Women Photographers group. They have speakers speak to us about working photographers who talk about the business. So I&#8217;m always just soaking in all of that stuff. I hope, as I get older, that that&#8217;s something that I can retire into. I would love to do that full time in my golden years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at your career, and even to where you are right now at the moment, talk to me about mentorship. Has mentorship been something that has really helped you out throughout your career? Is this something that, at the level you&#8217;re at now, you feel you have to give back? Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
So mentorship has always been valuable to me. I feel like I&#8217;ve only in the last maybe four or five years been able to adequately provide it to others. I had to get over my issues with advertising and be able to view it in a way to where I could actually impart words of wisdom or good vibes on someone who wants to make it in this industry. But I love it. I&#8217;ve worked with the Marcus Graham Project last summer to&#8230; I had a couple of guys that I was mentoring. Anytime I&#8217;ve been around Black creatives, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s network, let&#8217;s talk. How can I connect you with something?&#8221; So it&#8217;s definitely something that I&#8217;ve pushed.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
This year, my group at Hawkeye, the team that I work on, we started a mentorship program with Dallas ISD. So there&#8217;s a school here locally, a high school, it&#8217;s mostly predominantly Black and Brown. And we wanted to teach them about advertising. We basically figured out that part of two twofold issue that&#8217;s happening with Black and Brown folks in advertising, it&#8217;s recruitment and retention, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Retention is how do we make this environment inhabitable for Black and Brown folks? Make them feel like they have a sense of community and safety. And then with recruiting, do kids know what advertising is? A lot of us backed into it. If you had asked me in high school if I wanted to work in advertising, I probably probably would&#8217;ve told you no because it sounded like, I don&#8217;t know. It sounds like suits and briefcases, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I didn&#8217;t know that it was something that I could do and still have creativity and also pay the bills every month. So we partnered up with a high school in Dallas, and so we meet with them once a month and we just tell them about advertising. At the beginning of each meeting, we have rotating people that are hosting each meeting. They&#8217;ll explain how they got into the business.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Our session that we had the week before last, we used the Apples Shot On iPhone campaign to talk about all of the different roles in an agency that would help contribute to an idea like that, to help execute a campaign like that. It was really cool. We do quizzes with them to see what kind of things did they want to be? Do you want to be a strategist? Could you see yourself being an account person who manages relationships, client relationships? Could you see yourself creative or a production role?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
And so it&#8217;s just an opportunity for us just to impart some knowledge and hopefully make some connection so that in a couple of years, when those kids are in college, they&#8217;ve got a connection with us and we can help link them up with someone. We do internships at Hawkeye, provide some opportunities for them. It&#8217;s something we&#8217;re really, really excited about. I love working with kids, so it&#8217;s just definitely fulfilling for me.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I just recently stepped down. I was the co-chair of my Delta&#8230; I&#8217;m a Delta. We have a group that we work with with middle school girls and I&#8217;d been doing that for 10 years. Finally I was like, &#8220;Okay, chapter president, I&#8217;m going to have to step down because I&#8217;m exhausted.&#8221; But picked this up just in time and so it&#8217;s just fun working with them and they&#8217;re open to learning. And hopefully we&#8217;re planting some seeds that will grow into an understanding of the business and hopefully some pathways for getting into this business.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. See, I think that&#8217;s awesome on multiple accounts. One, it goes back to that old adage of you can&#8217;t be what you don&#8217;t see. So the fact that you&#8217;re able to expose them to these career paths so early on gives them a sense of knowledge to know that this is a possibility for them to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, and I feel like also that&#8217;s the best way that you learn is by teaching. By showing other folks what it is that you know, and it can help you become more effective communicator and things of that nature. I think that&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I talk with a lot of companies and they&#8217;re always like, &#8220;Well, we have to establish a pipeline and how do we do this pipeline and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.&#8221; I never liked the term pipeline because to me pipelines always strip resources away. It&#8217;s not about putting things back into the place where you have discovered them, it&#8217;s always about take, take, take, you know?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s very kind of like Western paternalistic in some kind of way, doing that sort of thing. What you&#8217;re doing though is establishing this connection. It&#8217;s almost like you&#8217;re planting flowers in a way, you know?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Because you&#8217;re not recruiting them directly from middle school or elementary school or whatever to come work for the agency, but you&#8217;re letting them know this is what I do in case you&#8217;ve never seen this as a position. This is the work that I do and if it sounds interesting to you, then this is how you can do it as well. That opportunity is what we&#8217;re really looking to give to the next generation.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah. We took a vote. We were like, &#8220;Do we want to focus this on high schoolers or colleges?&#8221; Because we&#8217;ve got a couple of HBCUs in Texas. We could work with Paul Quinn over in Dallas. And we said there is something really nice about talking to high schoolers who are still trying to connect some of those dots, as you said, planting those flowers. Let&#8217;s say, okay, the goal of this is not to&#8230; You guys are going to be interned at Hawkeye sometime, but if we can figure out this framework, we can hand this to other agencies. Hey, you&#8217;re in Chicago. This is something you could set up with a local school in Chicago. I think we felt like there was a void. And not to say that there aren&#8217;t other people doing this elsewhere, but we knew that here in Dallas it wasn&#8217;t being done, or this way rather, because I&#8217;ve definitely worked with some other agencies before.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
But is there something unique and special that we can do just to drop some knowledge? Because there&#8217;s a big push for STEM and business. That&#8217;s great, but we&#8217;re STEAM. That A, that art. What if people have the creative? There&#8217;s this little creative nugget. Black folks are hella creative, Brown folks are hella creative. If we can make that connect connection, you that are supremely awesome at editing TikToks, that&#8217;s a production role. You could make a lot of money doing that. If we could start to make some of those connections for kids, I think we felt like we will have done our part. Obviously we&#8217;re going to do more than that, but this is definitely how we wanted to start that kind conversation with them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of that mentorship, who are some of the mentors that have helped you out in your career?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Oh, man. Honestly, I&#8217;m kind of on an Issa Rae thing where it&#8217;s been peers that have really helped me along the most. Fellow creatives who were in the trenches with me that gave me encouragement. I&#8217;ve had a couple of creative directors where it was just like, &#8220;Okay, this person is definitely&#8230;&#8221; I had a creative director when I was at Moroch that I still keep in touch with today. We&#8217;ll occasionally have lunch together. He was just super brilliant, creative and helped push me creatively.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
But yeah, a lot of it has been peers. It&#8217;s been one of the writers that I work with on The Unwritten Rules. He&#8217;s helped inspire me and just a connector. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, there&#8217;s this thing that I found out about. You should try this out.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go to the museum. I heard about this thing that&#8217;s happening.&#8221; To me, that stuff, it encourages me because being around super talented people, it just helps raise you up a little bit. But just that friendship has been invaluable to me.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t want to name drop anyone specific, but I&#8217;ll just say that it&#8217;s been a lot of people being in the trenches with me, peers that have helped push me and encourage me. And I do that for them too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are you obsessed with at the moment?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Oh, this is bad. In my personal life or my work life?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Personal life.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Oh, this is bad. So my wife and I have been watching The Haves and the Have Nots by Tyler Perry. It&#8217;s on Hulu. There&#8217;s eight seasons of it. There&#8217;s 30 episodes a season. It&#8217;s insane. We&#8217;ve been binging it. It&#8217;s a soap opera. I grew up watching soap operas. Me and my mom used to watch The Young and the Restless and my grandmother and I used to watch it together. So I kind of got out of that over the last maybe five or six years, because life just got too busy and I didn&#8217;t have time to be watching soaps every day. But yeah, we&#8217;ve gotten into it the last couple of weeks and it&#8217;s just been insane. It&#8217;s like an addiction. We just got to get one hit tonight and then we&#8217;ll&#8230; It&#8217;s crazy. But yeah, that&#8217;s probably the thing right now. It&#8217;s kind of crazy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think we&#8217;ve all got an escape show that we dive into every now and then. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that. Especially during this pandemic.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. This is a judgment free zone here. [crosstalk 00:46:25].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look, grab your creature comforts wherever you can. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I could turn my brain off and set it on the table and just zone out, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Do you feel creatively satisfied at this point in your career?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I feel like the last year and a half have allowed me to do things creatively that were kind of passion projects, explorations, just the type of work that I&#8217;ve all always wanted to work on in my career. A lot of it was the pandemic and just having the freedom, the personal freedom to do those things, to explore those things. And so, yeah, I would say I am feeling creatively fulfilled.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I&#8217;m definitely thinking about the next five or 10 years. What is that going to look like? Leadership is great. Being able to lead teams. I&#8217;m definitely doing more of that now. But the downside is that you&#8217;re not getting to create as much. You&#8217;re giving feedback and helping push other creatives to come up with really brilliant, amazing ideas. And so I think there&#8217;s always a little bit of tension with that. Do I want to continue on this path where I&#8217;m just going to be pushing and challenging and supporting? Or do I want to be in a position where I can still roll my sleeves up and do some of the work? I kind of go back and forth on that.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
But I will say, between my photography and just the personal projects that I&#8217;ve gotten to work on over the last couple of years, I do feel like I&#8217;m getting a lot of the stuff in my brain out into the world, which has been nice and fulfilling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you hope to be working on?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I hope that I&#8217;m doing work that has positive impacts on the world. So whether that is more pro bono work, I&#8217;ve gotten to do a lot of that over the last couple of years and it&#8217;s super fulfilling for me. It&#8217;s merging the two things that I care about a lot, which is how can I help make things better out there and how can I create and express myself. So I think I would love to do more of that over the next five years.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
As I said, I&#8217;m in a leadership role now, so I would like to continue that. I&#8217;m very much a let me pull some people up with me kind of person. So that&#8217;s a natural fit for a leadership. I&#8217;m trying to find opportunities for people. I&#8217;m trying to connect people, I&#8217;m trying to make sure that especially younger creatives don&#8217;t feel grinded up in this business the way I did. I don&#8217;t want anyone to feel like I got to quit because this isn&#8217;t&#8230; I got to quit this stuff because it&#8217;s not for me. I want to definitely encourage folks and get them to find that right balance to where they are getting their fulfillment, they&#8217;re safe and they&#8217;re allowed to grow. Any ways that I can help do that, that&#8217;s what I want to be doing over the next five years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and your projects and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah. So you can visit ronekapatterson.com. So it&#8217;s R-O-N-E-K-A, Patterson with two T&#8217;s, .com. I&#8217;ve got design work and photo work there. You can find me on the gram, @RonekaP. And you can find me on LinkedIn too. I think you just search Roneka Patterson, I&#8217;ll probably pop up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And we&#8217;ll also make sure to put a link to The Unwritten Rules in the show notes as well so people can check that out.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;d be awesome. Would love that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Awesome. Roneka Patterson, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. One, of course, for telling us more about this project that I&#8217;ve heard about now probably for the better part of a year, in terms of it getting around in the world and getting around amongst other Black creatives. But also about just giving your own story and testimony about being a Black creative in this industry. And that even if there are setbacks, you can still find your way towards something that&#8217;s fulfilling, which I think we all need to hear that from time to time. Thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Thank you so much, Maurice. This has been great. I&#8217;m so glad to get to talk to you finally and just happy to be here. Thank you so much for having me.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s great to be able to look back at the early days of Revision Path and see just how far some designers have come. Take for instance Alex Pierce, one of our first interview guests from 2013. Fast-forward nearly seven years, and Alex has risen to the ranks of associate creative director at Publicis Hawkeye!</p>
<p>Alex talked about his day-to-day work at the Dallas-based outpost of Publicis, and spoke on how he approaches new projects and how his career has grown since starting at the agency over seven years ago. We also discussed the absence of Black people in the creative industry, Alex&#8217;s feature in NET Magazine, and what success looks like for him at this stage of his career. Thanks for the updates, Alex!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Hey, I&#8217;m Alex Pierce. I am an associate creative director at Publicis Hawkeye.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Well, first off, congratulations on your recent awards. I was looking at Twitter and I saw you got site of the day from &#8230; how do you say? Is it a wards? Because it&#8217;s like awwwards. Do you just say awards?</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        I just say A Awards. I don&#8217;t know. Maybe there&#8217;s some fancy way to say it, like you know how people in France say publicists versus people in America say publicists. So yeah, something like that. So I say A awards.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     All right so you got site of the day from A award. You got also site of the day from CSS Design Awards for your recent homepage redesign. So congratulations on that.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Thank you very much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     It&#8217;s been almost seven years since you&#8217;ve been on Revision Path. For people that are listening who are long time fans, listeners of the show, Alex was the last text interview I did before I did my first recorded interview, which was episode one of Revision Path. It sounds like a lot has transpired for you since then. Now you&#8217;re &#8230; well, you&#8217;re still at Publicis, but you&#8217;re now an interactive associate creative director. What are some of the responsibilities that you have in your current role?</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Yeah, so I&#8217;m an associate creative director on the digital team. So some of my responsibilities, I&#8217;d say, and I remember one of my colleagues and friends, Dan, he&#8217;s a creative director, he told me this. He&#8217;s at a different point in his life now with his career and he&#8217;s given me advice, as an ACD, you&#8217;re in kind of a weird limbo, right? So you&#8217;re 60% &#8230; I would say 50, 60% still kind of hands-on, but then 40% of my time is managing other creatives and their work and their goals and stuff like that. So my current lead or kind of role on my team is I am a design lead. While I work at the agency, our team is kind of device, or not device, but I say device agnostic on a lot of client presentations, so I just automatically say that. No, our team is pretty client agnostic in terms of, we work across all of the agencies, brands, and portfolios, but we do have our own digital clients as well. So, I currently manage the creative for Disney that we have, the piece of Disney work that we have at the agency as well as US figure skating, actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Nice.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        I don&#8217;t skate. I don&#8217;t skate, but I learned a lot about skating, apparently. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Now, I think when we first talked, you were just a art director, I think.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Yes sir.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     At Publicis.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     So what&#8217;s been sort of the big change between art director and associate creative director? I&#8217;m not super familiar with the latter hierarchy as it relates to agencies, but it sounds like you &#8230; of course in seven years you&#8217;ve leveled up, but what are the differences between those two?</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Well, yeah, it&#8217;s funny, even though I started at Publicis and I&#8217;m currently at Publicis, there was a whole period &#8230; so I went to Publicis as a mid level art director and I was at Publicis. I left Publicis to go to Hawkeye, I would say in 2012, and I stayed there for a while. Then, not too long after that, we got acquired by Publicis group and then they merged the Publicis Dallas office with the Hawkeye office, which is now Publicis Hawkeye. So, I saw all of my old friends and coworkers again.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Yeah. So it was a little bit of a boomerang kind of situation. They were like, &#8220;Oh man, we couldn&#8217;t lose you, so we just acquired the whole agency.&#8221; They like to make that joke. It&#8217;s obviously not true, but yeah. No, I think the difference was really just in terms of responsibility from art director, it&#8217;s basically just a mid level position. Senior art director, I think I had leads explained this to me. I would say senior director is more responsibility in terms of being able to be client facing, be able to manage presentations without a creative director in the room if needed, that kind of stuff, being able to be lead design leads on projects. Then, really the big shift from senior art director to associate creative director is really &#8230; I&#8217;m still figuring out myself. I&#8217;ve been in the role for a year and some change now, but I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s really just basically what I&#8217;m doing except now I am in a role of more mentorship and more creative direction, managing the vision and process for projects and accounts, doing scoping, doing hours estimates, that kind of stuff. Some of the more administrative tasks that I didn&#8217;t have to worry about as a senior art director, I have to definitely consider more of and then working with the account leads and strategy and being very client facing, that kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Now, are you also coming up with strategy or is that left to a more senior creative director?</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        That&#8217;s really more, I would say, for that big picture stuff, that&#8217;s really more related to, I&#8217;d say the group creative director, but even more so we really rely upon our strategy team to kind of help guide that. We actually take that strategy, help enhance it, give our feedback, and then we help interpret it into the creative work, but yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Okay. Yeah, I figured there were certain discrete levels at agencies where you have that kind of division. I&#8217;m working ostensibly for a startup and even, I think, if you&#8217;re someone who is at the, let&#8217;s say like VP level, you find yourself doing not only strategy, but also management and execution, which is probably more on like the individual contributor level. So it&#8217;s kind of like the shifting of roles, no matter what your particular title is, so that&#8217;s interesting to to see. How do you approach new projects at work?</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Well, I think how I approach is really, and this is what I like about working on our digital team. It&#8217;s definitely a collaborative process. So, it isn&#8217;t like everything&#8217;s put on the creative team. Everyone has their role to play, so I definitely rely upon account service and project management and strategy to kind of help come to the table with a fully fleshed out, approved brief from the client. Sometimes, depending on the situation, that&#8217;s not always the case, just depending on the type of client and the type of timeline and process, but usually we work out with a brief. So, usually start there, give our feedback there, ask any questions, and then really think about timeline roles and responsibilities. Is what they&#8217;re saying &#8230; Are the deliverables in alignment with the strategy and what the client is asking for, ultimately from a goals and KPI kind of standpoint? That kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Now that you have worked at the same company and moved up the ranks as you have, that feels like a real rarity in today&#8217;s current creative industry. Even now from what you said earlier, you were at Publicis, you left and went to another company, that company got acquired, and now you&#8217;re right back at the same company. I&#8217;m curious to know, what has being at Publicis taught you and what makes you continue to stay there?</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        I think, it&#8217;s kind of a cliche, but it comes down to the people. An agency isn&#8217;t really anything without its people, right? We&#8217;re the ones producing the work and the product. I mean that in a more general sense because I don&#8217;t mean just in terms of creative, but I also mean in terms of strategy, account service, managing client relationships, all that kind of stuff. I think, as you go across agency, and I had this piece of advice from my creative director, from &#8230; and it&#8217;s funny because he, actually, this guy, Gary Hawthorne, he&#8217;s actually a group creative director at Publicis Hawkeye right now, but he was actually my first boss ever in the industry and he hired me straight out of school as a junior art director at Shaffer Advertising in Fort Worth. He told me this a long time ago, &#8220;Don&#8217;t ever just leave one agency for another just because they maybe offer you moderately, a little bit more money because I think it&#8217;s really just all kind of the same thing.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        He didn&#8217;t mean that in a cynical way, but it&#8217;s just kind of like, be sure you&#8217;re leaving for the right reasons. Be sure that you&#8217;re leaving to do something different or to really pursue a specific goal because you kind of get that money trap with those golden handcuffs and then you&#8217;re just kind of beholden to that and you might be getting more money, but you&#8217;re not happy doing what you want to do.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Also, I love the people at my agency. I love my team. They&#8217;re super talented. I love working with everybody. We&#8217;re just kind of like a family. It&#8217;s like a home away from home for me, so that really means a lot to me. I think some people &#8230; everyone has their off days, and even on my off days, I still &#8230; I think about like, &#8220;Well, if I&#8217;m having a bad day, I&#8217;d rather have a bad day with people I like than a bad day with people I don&#8217;t like.&#8221; That&#8217;s kind of why I stayed at Publicis.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Then, in terms of Publicis as a agency and kind of things I&#8217;ve learned is, frankly, just interpretations of interactive and digital in the context of what I do. It&#8217;s interesting, Publicis, I think as a larger agency, their interpretations of digital and interactive versus where I came from. It&#8217;s funny, I actually &#8230; when I left Publicis to go to work at Hawkeye and I interviewed with the managing director of digital at the time, he still is today, Wes, he interviewed me. I was showing him my stuff and I was showing my web work. I started showing him some banner ads and he was like, &#8220;Oh no, no, no, no, no. We don&#8217;t do that here. We don&#8217;t do banner ads. Can you move that on?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, sorry. Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        I think there&#8217;s just like this interesting dichotomy, and what I&#8217;ve learned is just really thinking bigger picture. Right? So, I really love just UI, UX design, just visual design, interactive design for obvious reasons based off of my portfolio site just redesigned. Working with Publicis, it definitely opens me up to learning more about brand centric kind of work and more strategic, larger, big picture things. So, thinking about the website as a tactic and a larger strategy about talking about this customer journey, right? So, how are we communicating to these people through a variety of different channels? And really kind of opening my mind up to all those different avenues, whether it be display advertising, email marketing, web, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     How is that different from, say, user centric design?</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Yeah, user centric design, I&#8217;d say, and this is the kind of funny thing because I actually gave a talk about this I think a year ago, at the American Advertising Federation conference for kind of the Midwest or Texas area, Texas and Oklahoma. I forgot, it&#8217;s like district 11 or something like that. I think user centric versus brand centric sometimes there is a clash. I think the mistake that people make is that these goals are mutually exclusive. I think if you&#8217;re always designing for the user, you&#8217;re ultimately designing for those business goals as well. When you think brand centric in a more traditional sense, it&#8217;s really more traditional media, that kind of stuff and you kind of think about that one way communication. It&#8217;s really all about trying to deliver on the client&#8217;s or the brand&#8217;s goals and approaching that advertising creative or that digital creative in that context.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        I think the mistake that we make is, just because &#8230; I guess the mistake that we make is, when we look at it from that lens, I think it&#8217;s easy to make mistakes or get so myopic and looking inside that bubble. Our job as creatives is to help them look outside of that bubble and really think about their customer and their consumer and the users that use their product or service or brand or whatever. When you&#8217;re doing research and learning about those people, you need to open yourself up to learning that, this and product design, I would say. Sometimes just through user testing and interviews and feedback, you learn that people use your product in unexpected and in amazing ways.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        I actually saw an interview, I think the &#8230; Was it the Glitch cofounder? He was talking about why he loved Glitch and just all the cool, crazy shit that people make on the platform in just unexpected kind of ways. That&#8217;s kind of where my mind is, strategically, when I think about user centric versus brand centric. Just thinking about the user doesn&#8217;t mean being boring. It&#8217;s really thinking about the context of, like &#8230; and I always think about this and it sounds cynical, so stay with me here. I think about this in the context of, what value does this serve the user with? What value does this give the person whose product you want, the person that you want to use your product or brand or service? If you&#8217;re making like this cool crazy idea, ultimately, how does this serve them? Because for people, when we&#8217;re alone, by ourselves, using this in the comfort of our home, no one&#8217;s watching us, we&#8217;re selfish. I want this to benefit me in some way and I don&#8217;t want this to be some sort of masturbatory kind of thought experiment from a brand to try and win some awards because awards are cool, but at the end of the day it&#8217;s not creative if it doesn&#8217;t sell.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     It&#8217;s an interesting thing about awards. There was a while back on here, I&#8217;d say maybe &#8230; Oh God, I&#8217;m dating myself by saying about a hundred episodes ago, but it literally was about a hundred episodes ago when I was talking about awards and black designers winning awards and what awards actually mean. It&#8217;s so interesting now because the conversation around awards in the creative industry &#8230; this episode will come out kind of during the &#8230; I want to say the end of the awards season, I think, for creatives. When I say creatives, I&#8217;m lumping in music, television, films, kind of all into that. So many times we see work that is clearly chasing an award. We&#8217;ve all seen a trailer and we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re trying to win an Oscar.&#8221; We&#8217;ve all seen the thing that&#8217;s like, you can tell they&#8217;re trying to chase the clout that this particular award can get. I wonder often, one, what that is in service of. Yes, it&#8217;s in service of the award, but just because you get the award doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that opens up a new level of understanding or what have you from that, but I&#8217;m just always interested in that because it&#8217;s something that we want those awards to validate to other people that the work that we do is worthy. Yet, everyone can&#8217;t win an award. So.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Yeah, I think for me &#8230; I&#8217;m going to go on a sidetrack in a little bit, but for &#8230; just to speak on that, I think talking internally, it&#8217;s like that vicious cycle, right? You hear about specifically an advertising industry where that kind of desire to win awards kind of goes wrong and you hear about campaign fraud, that kind of stuff, with companies and agencies or brands just putting out work and they&#8217;re buying a billboard for like one hour in the middle of the night to say that it&#8217;s published and to try and win awards and it&#8217;s a whole big controversy and you see cons trying to crack down on, in other words, that kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        You ask yourself like, &#8220;Well, why is it that people are trying to do this?&#8221; I think ultimately it comes down to money, right? I think it comes down to &#8230; and I don&#8217;t necessarily &#8230; I think it&#8217;s shady, don&#8217;t get me wrong, and it&#8217;s not great, but you think about why people enter award shows and I think ultimately it comes down to new business, at least from your thinking about a larger agency picture, why agencies wouldn&#8217;t enter into award shows. It&#8217;s about demonstrating to clients that we do work that gets noticed and we do work that is validated in the industry and work with us. I think that sounded like a very simplistic kind of surface level of the reason why, and then when you get down to the individual level, right? I think it also just comes down to, I want my work validated. I want people to know that I&#8217;m competent at my job. That being said-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     It all boils down to validation.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Yeah. Yeah. I think when you&#8217;re talking about Oscar season and stuff like that &#8230; and I have to talk about this, man, but did you see the Irishman?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     I have not seen the Irishman. I&#8217;ve heard a lot of talk about it, particularly just it&#8217;s runtime, but I haven&#8217;t seen it yet.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Oh my goodness. Oh my God, man. If there&#8217;s ever a movie, I felt like, that was chasing something, it was that. You see the memes about it, man. Just people just, &#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s five days in and I still haven&#8217;t finished that movie.&#8221; I&#8217;m that guy. To be frank, it&#8217;s my fault. Frankly, I&#8217;ve &#8230; the last two times, I ate a Popeye&#8217;s chicken sandwich right before I started watching that movie and then I just kind of passed out and I woke up kind of sweating in the middle, so that&#8217;s kind of problematic. Then also I just felt like it was a meandering plot and then that face-aging technology that&#8217;s supposed to be all amazing. Robert De Niro did not look like he was in his twenties. I&#8217;m sorry. It just looked like they just smoothed Robert De Niro&#8217;s face. It look better when he was in his middle age. They were kind of showing the middle age, but anyway, that&#8217;s this whole rant. I could talk about that for a while, but we&#8217;re not here to talk about Robert De Niro and his smooth face and Irishman, but I just think about, it seems disingenuous.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        I guess, when you see the ads and you see those ads come out and you see those ads that are clearly awards bait, it just feels disingenuous and it doesn&#8217;t feel like they made that creative for the actual end audience. They made it to speak to the judges, right? They make stuff for the judges and not for the people. I say that, like, I&#8217;m not some &#8230; I&#8217;m not the guy. I&#8217;m not some guy who&#8217;s supposed to be &#8230; who has all the answers. So, for anyone who&#8217;s listening to this and they&#8217;re thinking like, &#8220;Who&#8217;s this guy? I promise you, I don&#8217;t have all the answers.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Well, I have to butt in here now. We&#8217;re both members of the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences. We are also both current Webby Awards judges.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     We kind of operate, I guess, a little bit on that level, but go ahead. Keep going. Keep going.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Yeah. No, you got me. You got me. No. Yeah. I think &#8230; and actually, I will &#8230; I don&#8217;t want to call out a brand but I &#8230; because I don&#8217;t know what agency did this, but I did something and I was just talking about it. So we had our holiday party last night and I made sure not to drink too much because I knew I had to do this today, but we were just talking about the Webbies and I think I need to actually get my judging entries done today at some point, but I was looking &#8230; Last year, I was looking at this one entry and it was for a popular bacon brand. I won&#8217;t say who, but it was crazy to me, man, because I looked at this and amazing technology. It was some sort of VR 3D website experience that you&#8217;re kind of exploring. It was very black and white and noir and very abstract.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Yes, man. I had no idea what was happening in this thing. All I saw was at the beginning because it was like a black label, bacon brand, whatever and I was looking at this. People are probably going to infer what that is, but whatever. I was looking at this and it was like &#8230; I&#8217;ll say this, the execution was amazing. It was cool, but I just couldn&#8217;t give it great marks because, well, one, from a navigation standpoint, I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing. I was just like out exploring this world. I had no idea. I even wrote in the notes, &#8220;I have no idea what this has to do with bacon, but I guess this is kind of cool.&#8221; I was just thinking in my head like, &#8220;What? How did this creative director sell this?&#8221; Because I want to talk to him and learn his secrets because this website looked like it cost a million dollars to make and it had nothing to do with the brand whatsoever.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        So that&#8217;s kind of what I was thinking. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Who are you making this for? Are you making this for the user? Are you making this for the brand? Are you making this for yourself? What&#8217;s the motivation behind that?&#8221; That&#8217;s kind of where I was getting at. I think, because I think to a certain extent even judges have their limits, right? You&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Okay, what is this?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Yeah. I need to start looking into what I&#8217;m going to, I guess submit as my picks, because I&#8217;ve been keeping track of a couple of campaigns and seeing what&#8217;s new and what&#8217;s interesting and what I feel like are interesting ways that people are using the social media tools that are out here. I see how different people use Instagram and Facebook and Twitter for different implementations, because I think it&#8217;s one thing, of course, to use it as intended, but sort of like how you said earlier, people will use these tools in all kinds of different ways. So, who&#8217;s using Instagram not just to post pictures, but like to post mini magazines?</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Things like that.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Did you see the adult swim, the Rick and Morty thing? That was amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     No, I didn&#8217;t see that. What was it?</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        No, they, for their promo &#8230; I think this is last year, but they made their own Rick and Morty adventure experience. So you&#8217;re traveling. So, they made a bunch of different Instagram accounts that are all linked to each other and like they&#8217;re tagged to each other, so you&#8217;re basically traveling the different planets and universes through these Instagram accounts. It was so meticulously well done and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;How much time did they take to do this?&#8221; Because you&#8217;re looking at those Instagram grids for each of the profiles and you see the galaxy and you can zoom in to the planet and you can zoom out and go to-</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        You can zoom in to the planet and you can zoom out and go to different and&#8230; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Man, this took a lot of time.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s just like people taking mediums and using them in unconventional ways always just fascinates me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Yeah, I&#8217;ve been saying that a lot on YouTube also. This kind of, almost choose your own adventures style of, I don&#8217;t want to call it videography. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s really the best way to categorize it, but I&#8217;m thinking particularly about this show that I saw, it&#8217;s called A Heist With Markiplier. It like starts out with the intro video, Markiplier is trying to break into a bank, and for those who don&#8217;t know, Markiplier is a YouTube influencer guy. But he&#8217;s trying to break into a bank and then the video is short, maybe like 20, 30 seconds. Then you know how you can have annotations that will pop up on the screen so that you can choose, okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Very similar to how Netflix did the Bandersnatch episode in Black Mirror, but it&#8217;s all done through YouTube videos. So you select what the right path is and there&#8217;s different endings, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;That is really an ingenious way to look at how to even do something like this.&#8221; Because at least with YouTube you can sort of unlist all the videos so then you can&#8217;t really track what the right path is. It&#8217;s really interesting way to use the platform, but I think it also speaks to honestly, the disposability of these types of mediums. The fact that you can spin something up that quickly and easily for just that purpose and it can also be gone just that quickly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Actually, another interesting thing, and this actually might be one of my webipics, so I might be spoiling this, but the same guy Markiplier, him and this other guy Ethan, who&#8217;s a YouTuber, are doing this project called [Latin 00:01:45]. I think it&#8217;s Latin for one year. They&#8217;re going to release a video on YouTube every day for a year, and then once the year is up, they&#8217;ll delete everything. They&#8217;ve gotten already over a million subscribers, they&#8217;re selling March, doing all that sort of stuff. I&#8217;m interested to see what they are trying to get out of it. What the end goal is, because they&#8217;re both already YouTubers. They already make videos. So making more videos isn&#8217;t the point. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s just a creative exercise.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     They&#8217;ve sort of implied that it speaks to the ephemerality of life and things like that. I&#8217;m interested to see where they go with this because you can tell as you, so I&#8217;ve watched all the videos cause I&#8217;m a dork. But you can tell that there&#8217;s an underlying slightly sinister theme that connects all the videos and I&#8217;m wondering if that will play out as the year plays out. I&#8217;m just interested to see where it goes from here and it&#8217;s those sorts of things that I really like seeing, brands and people take the tools that are given to you and use them in a way that no one would have expected.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Yeah. You&#8217;ve touched on something interesting, to be clear, I mean I think there&#8217;s, when you think about user centric, I also about using the medium as an art form, right? I think like as a creative exercise, so sometimes it&#8217;s what separates visual communication in graphic design from more fine art, right? It&#8217;s open the fine art aspect being a little bit more open to interpretation and it&#8217;s really meant to provoke a dialogue and discussion. It&#8217;s really all about the artist&#8217;s intentions and thinking and the message they&#8217;re trying to communicate. Visual communication touches on some of those subjects. But ultimately the idea is to communicate a clear message that a large group of people can understand. I don&#8217;t know, you touched on that, because sometimes entertainment is just entertainment and we don&#8217;t need to overthink it that much, but then there&#8217;s times when you actually need to service a specific goal.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. I want to go more into your design career, but first let&#8217;s take it back to the beginning. Where did you grow up? Was design a big part of your childhood and everything growing up?</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Absolutely not. No. I think, it was just growing up it was me, my mom and my brother. My uncles played a big influence on my life. Two of my uncles were Army dudes, one Army, one Air Force. I even think when high school they were trying to get me to sign up when I was trying to figure out how am I going to pay for college? They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Air Force is the way, Army is the way.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I do not have the discipline for either, so I&#8217;m going to get a student loan.&#8221; I think, what actually started me down, this whole path of creative exercise and graphic design is kindergarten. I think about this to this day. I love Garfield. Garfield basically got me to where I am today.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        If you want to sum it up. Garfield, I love the cartoon Garfield. I was obsessed with it. We didn&#8217;t have a lot of money, but my mom would give me for my birthday, every year I think until maybe I was like a pre-teen or whatever. She would give me a Garfield book every birthday and I just was obsessed with it, I always try and draw Garfield cartoons and stuff like that. Then I got really into drawing and then for the longest time I swear to you I wanted to be a comic book artist. I wanted to be like Jim Lee. I wanted to be like, was it George Perez, I think that&#8217;s his last name. Jim Lee&#8217;s the one that comes to top of mind always because I loved his style or [Linelle Hue 00:00:27:38].</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        But I think I really obsessed with comic books. I still love comic books, it&#8217;s kind of a bad habit. I go through spurts of just buying a whole crap ton of comics, stacks of them. I just spent too much money and my girlfriend makes fun of me for it. But it&#8217;s fine, whatever. But I think for me I just love that medium, I love the storytelling, I love the art, the visuals and just the message and just the art form of it. Going through high school, I was in Houston, I grew up in Houston and Westfield High School and then I transferred. I had a, I would say it was a Fresh Prince of Bel-Air moment kind of situation.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        I didn&#8217;t get into a fight at a basketball game and I got transferred. But my family we got help from a family member and we moved out to the Woodlands, which is a more affluent area and it was definitely a different world, right? Not a lot of black people up there in more the suburban area of Houston outside of Houston. But good schools and that kind of thing. I was on all the art classes and I actually got introduced to design from this teacher. God, forgive me, I forgot her name, but in high school she showed, it was like this digital design class or electronic media class or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        We go in there and we use MS-DOS to make animations. I remember the first thing I ever did, we had an assignment to use Photoshop and this was old Photoshop, right? We had to use this, what was it like? I had to Photoshop myself into a picture and of course for some reason I chose to Photoshop myself into a Run-DMC album cover. I was obsessed with that after that and I was like, &#8220;Well drawing&#8217;s cool but I like this too.&#8221; I just went down the rabbit hole on that and just designing things. Then a person from SCAD came to the school to talk about all the different programs and of course, the thing I learned and the reason I didn&#8217;t get into comic book art man is, drawing comics is freaking hard.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        If you don&#8217;t know this, I have a lot of respect for those guys because basically the program was called sequential art, which is basically just fancy for comics, right? But being able to do character study and drawing the same person from different angles and consistently, that&#8217;s very difficult apparently. But they had another program called the Visual Communication and Graphic Design Program. I was like, &#8220;What is that?&#8221; I learned a little bit more about it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;This is really interesting.&#8221; Because I love computers, I love the technology of it, I love making things that people see and interact with and I just had really awesome time with it.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        I decided to pursue that and actually looked at a few schools in the DFW area. I think University of North Texas is like, I don&#8217;t know if you knew this, but University of North Texas is one of the top design schools and at least the Southeast or whatever you want to call Texas Central area. At least in Texas it&#8217;s the design school to go to. [inaudible 00:30:57] has an amazing design program and it&#8217;s a public university. I went there and I just found the program to be not really what&#8230; It didn&#8217;t really seem like a right fit to me. So I went to actually, UTA and to this day he&#8217;s still my mentor, but Robbie McEwen, he was a professor in the design department at the time and I remember he had a Hummer, this huge hammer.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        He took me and my mom around the campus and to this day I&#8217;m trying to think, &#8220;Why did he do that?&#8221; He took his time, drove us around the campus, he showed us the senior student work and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m sold.&#8221; He&#8217;s cool dude, he looks like Santa Claus if you ever meet him in person. He&#8217;ll even joke about that himself, he&#8217;s an awesome guy, he&#8217;s the coolest guy ever. I learned so much from him over the years at that university and I owe a lot of what I am today to that guy because he really took me under his wing and he really taught me about design, about communication, about art versus design, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        I would say, went a little tangent, but that&#8217;s my journey from kindergarten, drawing Garfield and reading Garfield comics to going to college, University of Texas at Arlington and getting a official design BFA degree there. Then getting my first job, which how I got my first job was actually very lucky because I graduated in the middle of the recession.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Yeah, it sounds like, I mean that&#8217;s when you knew that you could do this for a living, I guess at that point, right? When you saw the campus and saw the student projects and everything?</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. My mom and bless her, I think&#8230; This touches on a larger question and I would love to hear your thoughts on this, but in terms of why we don&#8217;t have more black people in the creative design industry. I have my own guesses, but I think it just comes down to opportunity and thinking that, &#8220;If I&#8217;m going to go to college, I need to go to college to learn a skill that will really make me money.&#8221; As a kid I loved animals and my mom was thinking I was going to be on some Dr. Dolittle stuff, right? I&#8217;ll be a veterinarian.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Because I told her I wanted to be a comic artist at first and she was like, &#8220;What?&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, but you love our dog Hershey, right?&#8221; Our dog&#8217;s name is Hershey, our childhood dogs names. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;You love her, you love animals.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, I love animals but I don&#8217;t want to necessarily work with animals.&#8221; Then I think she saw, and when I was talking to her about majoring in graphic design, I didn&#8217;t go to college not knowing what I wanted to do. I knew what I wanted to do and I was telling her Graphic Design Program and she&#8217;s looking at it and she was looking at how a graphic designer could make money. It isn&#8217;t necessarily a full on art degree, although I have respect for those people too, for sure. But she saw that and she said, &#8220;Oh okay, I&#8217;m okay with this. I&#8217;m okay with this.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Yeah. Once she could see it, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, now I can get it.&#8221; To answer, I guess the question, I think that&#8217;s part of the answer is that the lack of visibility is why we don&#8217;t see more of us in the industry because it&#8217;s really a mix of things, right? First of all, it&#8217;s complete economics. In order to be really working in the creative industry, you need to know these industry standard tools, these tools are expensive. Folks don&#8217;t make a ton of money, so it&#8217;s like how are you going to get the money to get access to the tool? Then the time to learn the tool to get good at it, to then get jobs and then get in the industry. So it ends up being this pipeline situation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     It&#8217;s lack of resources, lack of professional training. I would say even sometimes accurate information about the industry, getting into it. But also I think it&#8217;s a matter of visibility. As you stated before, your parents didn&#8217;t really see like, &#8220;Oh, this isn&#8217;t something that I want you to do because I can&#8217;t see you being successful or making money. You&#8217;re making a living from it.&#8221; Art ends up being treated as a hobby and not a profession and so oftentimes that lack of visibility into seeing the ways that you can get paid from this, is a reason that we&#8217;re not in the industry, I think.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        I want to be very clear, my mother, Marsha, she does support me very much. Because he&#8217;s going to listen to this episode and I don&#8217;t want her giving me grief. My grandma gave me grief about this, she&#8217;s very supportive of me. She actually talks about me a lot to our co-workers. She features me on her timeline, which in my opinion is the biggest award of them all. So thank you mom. I love you. I obviously owe everything to her because I&#8217;m existing because of her, so just want to throw that out there. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     But yeah. That&#8217;s probably a big reason into it. I mean, that&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve discovered honestly from doing the show is that for a lot of folks, they just weren&#8217;t exposed to it. They didn&#8217;t know that they could do this until much later on in life. After college, after working a few jobs and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Wait a minute, I really like design and art and I can focus on this.&#8221; Or, &#8220;I really like coding and I can focus on that.&#8221; That being a part of the creative industry, it&#8217;s like the exposure and the visibility to this ends up happening at a time where for us, I think it ends up being just much later in life, than with other places where the viability of that as a profession is a much earlier and easier opportunity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     I mean, as kids we&#8217;re all exposed to cartoons, drawing and art and painting at the same time. At least here in America, that&#8217;s part of the American primary school system. So how is it that there&#8217;s this huge bifurcation of people of one particular race or culture that are over index in the creative industry and then so many others that aren&#8217;t? What happens, where does that split happen? So, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Yeah. It&#8217;s tough because yeah, to your point, man, I didn&#8217;t think it was a thing that people&#8230; Intellectually, you know someone made that stuff but you don&#8217;t really think about it. Then you get a little bit older and then you just realize, yeah. I actually have Michael Beirut&#8217;s book on my desk right now and I&#8217;m going through and it&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Man, I can&#8217;t imagine doing anything else but this.&#8221; I realize I&#8217;m in a position of privilege that maybe people of of the same race as me are not in the same, really or they don&#8217;t see that opportunity because of socioeconomic factors or the fact that there hasn&#8217;t been exposure or in terms of just education in the arts program, that kind of stuff. Or the fact that, thinking about how to get into that, it might be too late. I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t have all the answers on that. That&#8217;s a larger topic that I&#8217;m assured that you are definitely tackling at the AIG level.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Well, I mean it&#8217;s one of those answers that just has many layers to it. There&#8217;s no simple answer to the question. There&#8217;s so many layers as to how that happens, so yeah. Now you said you graduated in the middle of a recession, but you got your first working design gig, working for your school. You were working for University of Texas in Arlington. What was that like?</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Working for UTA, it was exactly what you think you would be. Now, I mean it was a great job. I think in high school and one of the things that I did in high school as I worked for Kroger, I was a sacker all through high school. As soon as I was old enough to get a job, my mom was like, &#8220;You going to Kroger.&#8221; Because Kroger was one of the few companies that hired 14 year olds. You have to wear a special name badge to indicate that your managers can&#8217;t abuse you. But, I mean you can&#8217;t work extra hours and stuff like that. But I worked there and then I just remember thinking, I learned how to deal with people and I guess that I still think about that.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        I wasn&#8217;t a waiter or a server, I didn&#8217;t work in the food service industry, but I worked in a different thing that I dealt with people. A lot of different types of people every day and working in that environment, one thing I did learn is, I definitely did not want to work at Kroger during college. I wanted to try and do something that can help hone my skills and learn more about the profession I wanted to get into. Actually before that, I think a little bit of overlap, I actually worked at The Shorthorn, which is the college newspaper and it&#8217;s actually a pretty big newspaper, pretty award winning.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        I was a page designer, a layout artist and then I also did illustration, cartoon editorial illustrations and stuff like that. Obviously it is a school job, so I think I got paid like 90 bucks every two and a half weeks. That was not sustainable for me. So that&#8217;s why I looked at getting into the design program. I applied to different departments but they are the ones who finally hired me and really I just managed just vendor relationships and stuff like that and making assets, helping student events, making all the graphics and displays for that.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        I think my proudest moment was, I got to make a label for a water bottle that they were handing at events. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s kosher to say today, necessarily making labels for water bottles and the plastic is choking our ocean or something like that. But I think at the time I was like, &#8220;Oh, I got to make a little label for a water bottle. That&#8217;s cool.&#8221; But I think I just got experience with a lot of different types of mediums. I got to work on web work, I got to do email stuff, I got to do website stuff. I got to do packaging and print stuff. It was all just kind of like a generalist initial exposure.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        That being said, I mean, I was a designer and I didn&#8217;t really have any design mentors in that program. I just was really working and getting mentorship and guidance from my actual design teachers and professors in that. When I mentioned Robbie McEwen, which he&#8217;s awesome dude. So I was learning that along the way, but I was working in a corporate little office environment. I was in a cubicle way in the back, it was almost like a closet. I shared and office with [inaudible 00:41:52] smell like pancakes, it was really weird. That was definitely in my first [inaudible 00:41:56] into professional design and learning about how my design decisions affect other people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     I&#8217;m going to show you a photo, and I want you to first describe this photo to the audience and then I want you to tell me the story behind it and the feedback. So I&#8217;m going to show you the photo now if you want to take a look at it.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Okay. Oh boy. Yeah. This photo, I&#8217;m wearing my Bob&#8217;s Burger t-shirt. I am clean shaven for the most part, I didn&#8217;t have my beard yet. But it&#8217;s like a me of my feature and net magazine. This is like back in 2017, I believe. Yeah. I&#8217;m holding just the cover art for the article, the featured article, diversity in design. It&#8217;s an article I wrote talking about how to be more inclusive in your design and UX and visual design overall experience for people, audiences, users, that kind of stuff. I&#8217;m in my agency&#8217;s office and I actually had my co-worker Ale, short for Alejandra.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        She actually took a photo of me, she&#8217;s one of the art directors on my team. She took a photo of me and she actually forced me to do this whole photo shoot. This was one of like 50 photos at different angles. You could actually, in one of the other photos there&#8217;s actually a scene of one of our junior art directors at the time, she&#8217;s way in the background and she&#8217;s rolling her eyes and she&#8217;s just very fuzzy and we still make fun of that to this day. But yeah, I was like a really proud moment of me. I bought like 10 issues. I sent a couple to my mom because she had requested them. But yeah, that was a really proud moment for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Nice. What was I guess the feedback behind it? As I&#8217;m looking at the image and I&#8217;ll make sure to include this in the show notes so people can take a look at it too. But it says diversify your design. Five steps to diversify your UX design.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Yeah. Do you-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     &#8230; steps to diversify your UX design?</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Yeah. Do you mean feedback in terms of what people were saying about it or what I was [crosstalk 00:44:07]?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Yeah, about the article and everything. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Overall, I had a lot of positive feedback. I think the thing was just people&#8230; You hear a lot of people getting on their soapbox talking about diversity is important, diversity is important. For me, I&#8217;ve always been a very practical person in terms of how I approach things, in terms of how I approach things in my professional and personal life. If you know me in real life, you know if someone were to ask me, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re going to go out to this lunch spot. You want to go?&#8221; And my first question, and they know this, is, &#8220;What&#8217;s the parking situation? Because if the parking situation ain&#8217;t good, I&#8217;ll see you all later.&#8221; I have to think about that.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        But in this context, for diversifying your design, for me, I wanted to do something that was very practical like, &#8220;okay, yeah, I need to be more diverse in how I&#8217;m thinking about approaching my work, my creative work, but how do I actually do that? What&#8217;s some simple initial steps that I could do?&#8221; And like I said, I don&#8217;t promise to be the guy who has all the answers, but I just thought this is actually kind of a therapeutic piece for me to do. Because actually, it was funny because how I got into doing that article was I had reached out to NetMag and I was saying, &#8220;Hey, I did my Black in History Tumblr site.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        And for people who don&#8217;t know the Black History thing, I did a Black in History Tumblr, which it&#8217;s still up, it&#8217;s still live, blackinhistory.tumblr.com. And it was basically about just game changers, figures that have affected everyone&#8217;s lives, not just black people&#8217;s lives, and they&#8217;ve fallen through the cracks. So I just think about an entry that uniquely talks about this person and I put that to them and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Man, this is great. We&#8217;re going to feature this as a side project of the month.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh that&#8217;s great.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Also, hey, our issue&#8217;s on diversity. So maybe if you can write a feature about that, you have two weeks.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, okay.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m definitely not turning it down.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        But I got advice from my fellow copywriter colleagues and just friends and I interviewed coworkers and colleagues, my bosses to get a really holistic view, because I definitely wanted not only to talk about diversity, but have a little bit of diversity in the thought and opinions about how to approach that from.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        So I have five different steps. So it&#8217;s the first one, just understanding that it&#8217;s the right thing to do. I think a lot of people call it PC Culture, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s PC Culture to think holistically about your audience. I think it&#8217;s opening your mind up to the fact that not everyone who uses your product or uses that brand looks exactly like you or lives exactly like you.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        And then I think it&#8217;s just stop being lazy. I think as designers, especially when you&#8217;re in the grind, the daily grind of things and stuff like that, it&#8217;s easy to get caught up and just go to your go-to sources, that kind of stuff. So just learning to actually force yourself to take a step back and think about, &#8220;What am I doing? Am I representing this product the right way? Is this the actual thing I need to show or the say or to write?&#8221; et cetera. And then just the other ways to do it through visuals, so advice around photo shoots, video, that kind of stuff. Doing it through copywriting, so using inclusive language and strategy around that.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        And then UX, obviously there&#8217;s a lot of talk lately around accessibility and then just overall thinking around inclusion in your user experience design, and I think that&#8217;s been a big conversation these last few years around that. Then just the last thing, selling it to clients, which is sometimes actually surprisingly, well, actually maybe not surprisingly difficult to do, especially if they think it&#8217;s a counterintuitive to maybe what they think their audience is or their own envisioning of their goals for the brand.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     What do you think is the most important skill that a designer needs to possess these days?</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        God. Man. I think it&#8217;s a combination of two things. I would say first and foremost, it&#8217;s cliche answer, but empathy. But to get specifically around this, because I had actually a designer reach out to me and ask me, &#8220;What&#8217;s an important skill set?&#8221; And I actually told them this, this guy. I said, &#8220;The most important thing you could have this self-awareness actually.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        I think self-awareness is always the first step in making some good decisions. I think being self-aware of your position of who you are as a person and how people perceive you, how you present things, how you talk about things, your creative design decisions. I think you take a step back and you objectively look at yourself and you learn about maybe you have some unconscious biases, and I think that&#8217;s where the empathy and the self-awareness combine to each other.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        But I think it&#8217;s really more of a soft skill, I would say, but it also lends itself into actual creative skill in my opinion, too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Now, you mentioned the Black in History on Tumblr. That&#8217;s actually when we first talked seven years ago. I think you had just started that project or it had been out for a little while. I don&#8217;t recall, but I know that that was a project that you ended up getting a good bit of acclaim from. I think even got a Webby, not an award, but you got a Webby mention.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Honoree, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Honoree. That&#8217;s the word I&#8217;m looking for, Webby Honoree for that. Is there another dream project that you would love to do?</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        I think about this a lot. I think for that it was just something that came up. My family liked to joke about that every time during the holiday seasons or during some sort of special season event. You see all the brands put out some R&#038;B music and show black people doing stuff with their products. And it just got me thinking like, &#8220;Man &#8230;&#8221; Or in Black History Month, right, just where it just becomes so myopically focused on just a few key characters. And it turned into that.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        For me, I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m still exploring that to be honest. There&#8217;s a lot of things I&#8217;d like to approach in a dream project for me. And maybe if people see my Instagram, you&#8217;ll know this about me. I love food. I love everything about the &#8230; I love making food more accessible to people. I think for me that&#8217;s a dream project for me to work on.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Another thing, and I&#8217;ve been getting more and more into this, I&#8217;ve been exploring it, but I love games. I love video games, which sounds like a typical nerdy black guy thing to say. But I love video games and I would love the idea of working on interactive experience, gaming interactive experience, maybe using pixel or I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ve been getting into pixel art lately, as you might know. And actually, what got me thinking about that is I saw something, I think it was on A Awards or I can&#8217;t remember, but it was this guy who did this interactive side scroller or pixel art game about is Japan cool, and he gave this history of Japan and I think talking about Nintendo and that kind of stuff. And it&#8217;s this interesting interactive side scrolling experience I can&#8217;t remember the name of. It&#8217;s killing me.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        But I don&#8217;t know. It just got me thinking, &#8220;What a cool, educational way to talk about something and make it engaging too.&#8221; And I don&#8217;t know. I like the idea of making an interactive game and getting deeper into that. I&#8217;m not a developer myself, at least not first and foremost. I know enough development to be very dangerous. That&#8217;d be something for me to explore, getting deeper into the interactive space.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     What is it that inspires you these days? How do you keep that creative spark going?</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        For me, it&#8217;s just I learned a long time ago not to get invested in my work so much that my identity is wrapped up in my job, because I think once you start doing that, it&#8217;s easy to get burnt out or get depressed about certain things or &#8230; Not that I&#8217;m saying you shouldn&#8217;t get any fulfillment out of your job, but I think it&#8217;s really important for you to try and discover personal interests outside of that.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        And for me, what inspires me, and it sounds, once again, simple, but I just like going on the internet and just looking at cool shit. I like looking at Sidebar, I like all the inspiration blogs, but then I just also think about what are ways for me to explore something and take it back into my work at the office. I like to explore different technologies. I like to do things.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        But in my personal life, what actually inspires me is I love to read actually. I love reading science fiction. I love reading novels. I am actually in a book club. I&#8217;m in a book club and people are going to be like, &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s all right. Wow, that&#8217;s fancy. That&#8217;s hoity-toity.&#8221; No. We meet at a bar and we talk about our book. We&#8217;re half in the bag before we actually start talking about the book. But I think for me it&#8217;s just helped me expose myself.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        And you know the designer, what&#8217;s his name, Tobias van Schneider, I think? The guy behind Semplice and he&#8217;s the guy at Spotify. I remember him saying how he gets his inspiration from people outside of the industry and how little he talks to people in the design industry. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d go that far, but I think it is useful to live outside your bubble and just sometimes taking a step away from the screen. And I&#8217;m very technology focused, so I&#8217;m not saying, Put down your phones. Rah, rah, rah.&#8221; I&#8217;m saying just find things that you enjoy and have fun with, and I think you can learn how to connect those things together.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        For instance, I did a thing a few years ago. It&#8217;s one of my actually things on my case studies, but I did this thing called, &#8220;We Lunchin&#8217;, Bro,&#8221; which is just an in-office term of just, Where we going for lunch, man? What are we doing?&#8221; And my old creative director, he made this word document of just lunches or lunch spots or restaurants in the area, that kind of thing. And I thought, &#8220;Okay, this is interesting. So how can I take that and make something a little bit more accessible and interactive for people to help make better decisions during lunch?&#8221; And I did that on my own time for the office and I made it a thing. I made it a little mobile website and it was fun to do that. But it&#8217;s just one of those things where I&#8217;m taking something from another part of my life and seeing how can I apply my own personal skillsets to enhance the experience for me.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        So that&#8217;s where I come from, how do I find inspiration? I have my passions and interests and hobbies and I think about how can I inject that into my own creative mind a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     So what does success look like for you at this point in your career?</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Success? I think success looks like I&#8217;m working on stuff I want to work on. I think success for me is I think having good synergy with your team. For me, I think it&#8217;s about &#8230; Man, that&#8217;s a tough question.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Success, I&#8217;m still trying to figure that out myself. But I would say I love where I&#8217;m at right now in terms of my team. I think success is me continuing to learn, and I think this is one of the things I tell people on my team all the time, which is, especially in our industry, in our field, interactive work, you always have to be learning. You always have to stay on top of things. And I just have that passion around just making sure that I am moving ahead. And success to me looks like I always have something on the horizon, I always am looking forward to the future, I have something that is fulfilling my creative passions and desires. And people might recognize that. Maybe they don&#8217;t. I would guess success would be that people do recognize it, I guess, maybe formally or informally or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        But for me, and I think this is a long time ago I said this, for me success is me making something that people get a use or enjoy out of, whether that be functionally, whether that&#8217;s an app or product or tool, making products that outlive me would be great. But obviously, as we talked about, sometimes especially interactive design can be ephemeral and doesn&#8217;t last forever. But I think making things that serve a purpose or function and I want to make experiences that people enjoy. And yeah, that&#8217;s where I would leave it at. I think just getting some sort of satisfaction out of people utilizing whatever I make to serve their goals or needs.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Yeah. Well, it&#8217;s 2020. It&#8217;s like the future now, which is &#8230; it&#8217;s so wild to think about. But where do you see yourself in the next five years? In 2025, what will Alex Pierce be working on or what do you want to be working on?</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Maybe I&#8217;m designing a website for the first hoverboard. I don&#8217;t know. Right now, I&#8217;m currently an associate creative director and I love where I&#8217;m at right now. I love the mentorship and guidance as well as still being hands on. I think five years now, I think I&#8217;m still doing both those things, maybe at a higher scale, hopefully at a higher scale or larger level. I think my goals are just continuing to just do cool work. Just remember that, for me, we&#8217;re so lucky to do the work that we do.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        A lot of people, for them, you want to make sure that, I want to be clear about this. A lot of people, their job is not their career or their first passion. Sometimes, a job is just a job and everything outside of that, that&#8217;s what they &#8230; they go to work to earn money to live their life. And that&#8217;s perfectly fine and that&#8217;s great. And for me, we&#8217;re lucky because we get to take our passions and our creative thinking and we go to work and we get to express that. And I used to joke not a lot of people can go to work and their job is to just dick around on the internet.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        My brother, he&#8217;s like a super genius. My brother, he has like three degrees and he&#8217;s a VP over at &#8230; he&#8217;s actually in Atlanta actually. He&#8217;s a VP over at Citi, and he&#8217;s a math genius, a math nerd, a math whiz. He was a mathlete in high school. Oh, hey, congrats. For him, he tried to explain to me his job once and it just flew over my head. I got a lot of good grades in college, but math was not one of those classes I got great grades in, unlike you, which you&#8217;re apparently a creative genius and a math genius.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Well, let&#8217;s not go that go that far. But no, go ahead.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        I&#8217;m just grateful for working on stuff that a lot of people &#8230; and I want to make sure that people don&#8217;t take that for granted, especially if there&#8217;s a takeaway from this, is that don&#8217;t take what you&#8217;re doing so seriously. Some people are like, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re doing work that&#8217;s going to change the world.&#8221; Yeah, there&#8217;s certain &#8230; design does have a very important impact on people&#8217;s lives. And I think that&#8217;s one of my goals, to have my design work impact people&#8217;s lives in a positive and in an meaningful, impactful way.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        But I think at the same time, sometimes you just want to make people smile. Sometimes you want to just entertain people. Sometimes you&#8217;re just wanting to have fun. And that&#8217;s what I did with my portfolio site. That was the goal. It&#8217;s not for everybody, but I made something that &#8230; And I remember one comment from a designer on Twitter. He was just like, &#8220;Thank you for making personal sites fun again.&#8221; And granted, there&#8217;s certain flaws with the site, I think from an overall maybe architecture standpoint, but I think the goal for me was just to experiment and have fun and just do cool stuff. And I want to keep being able to do that. And I think that&#8217;s something I want people to remember, just we&#8217;re really lucky. Just have fun and don&#8217;t take yourself so seriously and &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     So just to wrap things up here, Alex, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        They can go to my personal site, TheGeekDesigner.com. I&#8217;m on Instagram quite a bit. It&#8217;s at AlexJamalPierce, all together, lower case obviously. And then I am also on Pinterest, strangely enough. So if you want to see some random recipes that I like, go on Pinterest. I think it&#8217;s Alex Jamal Pierce, Pinterest, something like that. If you see a black guy&#8217;s face, and I have glasses and a beard, it&#8217;s probably me. So, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Then I also still have my Black in History Tumblr up and going. It&#8217;s been a little lapsed since I put any entries in, so I need to get back into the flow of things for that. But if you want to check that out, there&#8217;s that too. But otherwise, I&#8217;ll be at home trying to finish The Irishman. Pray for me on that. I probably won&#8217;t. I&#8217;m probably going to watch that Six Underground movie that just dropped by Michael Bay. So-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     Isn&#8217;t that wild how we can binge watch a whole series of a show, but then a three and a half hour movie is too long?</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Yeah man. I was [inaudible 01:01:55] in that Avengers End Game movie, so I can sit through a long movie, but you got to give me something, man. You got to give me something.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     All right. Well, Alex Pierce, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Well, first, I think thank you for, I guess I would say coming back on Revision Path. Like I said before, you&#8217;ve been on here before seven years ago, which is wild to think I&#8217;ve been doing this now for seven years. My God.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        I&#8217;m impressed. That&#8217;s [crosstalk 01:02:24]. I&#8217;m glad to be an OG.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     OG. Yeah. Well, I think it&#8217;s been good to see not only your growth as a designer and really your growth in your career, but also to see how you uniquely approach projects, as you were talking about brand-centric design and user-centric design. I think it&#8217;s that level of intelligence about the field and about the work that more people need to see, I think just from us in general.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:     And hopefully, that will inspire more people to want to get involved, even in some small way. Like you said before, you want people to not take themselves so seriously. But I think it&#8217;s important to show that there are folks that are in this industry that can bring that level of play to their work, but also be very serious and smart about it too. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Alex Pierce</b>:        Thank you. I&#8217;m glad to be back.</p>

<p>If you want to know what it&#8217;s like working in the high-paced field of advertising, then this week&#8217;s interview is for you! Meet Alanna Marshall, an associate creative director at¬†<a href="https://www.ten35.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Ten35</a>¬†in Chicago. Whether she&#8217;s presenting to clients or directing shoots on a set, according to Alanna there&#8217;s never a dull moment.</p>
<p>Alanna also talked about how she first got into the field, shared a bit about her process behind her work, and gave her thoughts on the future of advertising for agencies and clients. Her advice for creatives is simple and powerful: know yourself and put yourself and your work out there for the world to see. And we couldn&#8217;t agree more!</p>
