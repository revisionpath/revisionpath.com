Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>I first learned about Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton way back in 2015 when I interviewed <a href="/silas-munro/" data-wpel-link="internal">Silas Munro</a>. Since then, Tasheka has gone on to become one of the leading voices behind discovering Black people omitted from the graphic design history canon. Even design legend <a href="/dr-cheryl-d-miller/" data-wpel-link="internal">Dr. Cheryl D. Miller</a> has sung her praises, so I knew I had to sit down with Tasheka and learn more about her remarkable journey.</p>
<p>Tasheka spoke to me about her experience as an educator and researcher, including an examination of her teaching philosophy. She also talked about growing up in New Orleans, her shift into design, working for the Navy Reservists, and even starting her own studio, <a href="https://blacvoicedesign.myportfolio.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Blacvoice Design</a>. Lastly, she discussed her upcoming book <em>Black Design in America</em>, and shared how the different aspects of her work keep her motivated and inspired. </p>
<p>If there&#8217;s any lesson you learn from Tasheka, it should be this one: you have control over your own path as a designer, so work hard and you can make your dreams come true!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Hi, and first, I want to say Maurice, thanks for having me here on Revision Path. I&#8217;ve been a listener for a long time now, so I feel really grateful and honored to be here. My name is Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton. I&#8217;m a designer, design educator. I run a design studio called Blacvoice. I also am a researcher, I guess, or design historian in regards to Black designers, as well as design writer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has this year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Very busy, but good for the most part. It&#8217;s been a really, really good year with lots of new projects on the horizon. Exciting and exhausting, all at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Any plans for the summer?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes, family vacation is one of the plans. I will be attending Typographics, and I&#8217;ll be a speaker there. So it&#8217;s exciting because I&#8217;ve never been to the conference before, and it&#8217;s kind of strange to have that my first attendance there would be me actually giving a talk, so I&#8217;m excited about that. I&#8217;m going to be teaching, I guess, this summer. I don&#8217;t normally teach in the summer, but I&#8217;m co-running a design residency program at the University of Texas, Austin where I teach. So I&#8217;m looking forward to that as well. And I have a couple of writing projects that I&#8217;ll be working on over the summer, and some design stuff as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Sounds like you&#8217;re going to have a busy summer ahead.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, speaking of teaching, you are teaching at two universities right now. You&#8217;re at Vermont College of Fine Arts, and you&#8217;re at the University of Texas at Austin, which is pretty new. You&#8217;ve been at VCFA what, for 10, 11 years now?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s been 10 years in April. 10 years. I started there in 2013.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
It&#8217;s kind of crazy to think that I&#8217;ve been there that long, actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What has the experience been like there?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Wow. The experience at VCFA has been truly amazing and transformative, and I think a lot of it has to do with the amazing faculty that&#8217;s there, that I teach with, who are not only colleagues but longtime friends now. It has to do with the sort of non-traditional structure of the program. We don&#8217;t have any classes or any courses. The program is, if you think about it as a two-year-long independent study, basically it&#8217;s a self-directed program where students decide on what they want to study and what they&#8217;re interested in. And the faculty is there basically, to sort of guide them and offer them resources, but it&#8217;s a self-directed program.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, that&#8217;s really interesting. No classes or courses?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you don&#8217;t have to put any curriculum together. That&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
No. So yeah, it&#8217;s definitely a different experience. So you do work with the students during the residency to come up with a semester plan on what they&#8217;re going to be working on throughout the semester. So as a faculty, you are there to help guide them and shape that semester plan. But again, it starts with what they&#8217;re interested in. We meet once a month. Students send their work via email, and then we have an hour conversation through, usually Zoom, and to talk about the work and sort of reflect on it, and kind of give feedback on how to move forward over the next month.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love how sort of open that is, especially I think during this time when I know we&#8217;re not out of the pandemic, but certainly, I think it&#8217;s still a time where some schools are trying hybrid models or things. That sounds like the way that it&#8217;s set up at VCFA, it allows you to really still be able to learn in that type of environment.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes. I think the one thing that at the core of the program is, first of all, it&#8217;s really tailored to, working professionals are people. You don&#8217;t have to quit your job for two years to get an MFA. You can still work or run your business, or whatever it is you&#8217;re doing and still go to school. And this is something that we&#8217;ve been doing prior to the pandemic.</p>
<p>So when the pandemic happened, not saying that it didn&#8217;t change the program and how we teach, but we were already sort of interfacing in that way. So the only thing it stopped was having the week long residencies that we would have twice a year in person. Then that programming got moved to Zoom. But as far as the interaction between the student and the teacher, or we say the student and the advisor, that was already happening.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now one of the professors that&#8217;s also there, we&#8217;ve had on the show. Oh God, that was a long time ago. We had Silas Munro on the show. This was I think, episode 85, 86, something like that. But he&#8217;s also a professor there, I believe.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah. So Silas, so you brought Silas up. Silas is one of the reasons, that&#8217;s how I ended up at VCFA actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
He&#8217;s one of the founding members of the program and Silas and I, we overlap by a year at CalArts. And so yeah, when the program was starting up, he sent me an email and asked me to join the faculty. And I wasn&#8217;t able to join at the time because of obligations with teaching. But then the following semester in April of 2013, I was able to come on board as a visiting, as a guest. Sort of a preliminary or, I wouldn&#8217;t say probationary period, but just to test to see if it would work out for me and if it would work out for the program.</p>
<p>So yeah, I credit Silas to bringing me in to a community in the program that&#8217;s, like I said, it&#8217;s been really transformative. Especially, the sort of approach to design pedagogy, this openness and not having this one idea of what design is. That sort of shift and change and marks according to the students, and the type of work that they&#8217;re interested in, and the type of diversity and the faculty and what we study and research, and type of work we&#8217;re engaged in. So that&#8217;s the thing that I really like, and it&#8217;s probably one of the few places that I&#8217;ve worked where I really felt a sense of family with my coworkers. Not that I didn&#8217;t have that relationship with other places, but there it&#8217;s really genuine. It&#8217;s not forced, it&#8217;s not fake. We actually truly do like and love each other.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, first of all, props to Silas for bringing you in, but it sounds like it is a great environment because you&#8217;ve been there for 10 years. Nobody&#8217;s going to stay there for 10 years if it&#8217;s not good.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, no, that&#8217;s true. Actually, you saying it, it&#8217;s technically the longest job I&#8217;ve ever had.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
When I think about it, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;re also teaching at University of Texas at Austin, which is fairly new. Tell me more about that. How&#8217;s that experience?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Wow, it&#8217;s been great, to be honest. I haven&#8217;t been there that long. I just moved to Austin, so I&#8217;m new to Austin and I&#8217;m new to UT. It&#8217;s been a really good experience as far as working in an environment with, I guess kind of similar to VCFA, where you don&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s this sort of one way that the faculty or the program is trying to teach design. It&#8217;s a little bit more flexible, it&#8217;s a little bit more nuanced where students get to dabble in a lot of different areas of design. Graphic design, industrial design, interactive design, design history, product design. So it&#8217;s really sort of flexible in that way and that&#8217;s one of the things that sort of drawed me in into UT.</p>
<p>The program itself was revamped around 2017, 2018. So the program as it is today, design, it&#8217;s the Department of Design and Creative Technology, is fairly new in a sense compared to a lot of other programs that are out there. So I think there&#8217;s something about that sort of newness. There&#8217;s a lot of vulnerability and a lot of questioning about the direction of the program. So it&#8217;s kind of exciting to be somewhere where we&#8217;re constantly thinking about ways to evolve and improve the experience for the students.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What is your teaching philosophy? I would imagine, between the work you&#8217;ve done at VCFA and are currently doing, and now with teaching at UT. And you&#8217;ve taught at some other places as well. What&#8217;s your overall teaching philosophy?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Well, one is, I try to approach teaching, one of the things that probably on the first day of class, I let my students know that, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m interested. I&#8217;m more interested in what you&#8217;re interested in learning, and what you&#8217;re interested in general out there in the world.&#8221; Not that I don&#8217;t have anything to impart or to give to them, but it&#8217;s less about me walking into the classroom saying, &#8220;Hey, listen up, I&#8217;m the expert here. You all need to learn what I have to offer.&#8221; Obviously, there is an important exchange that&#8217;s sort of happening, but I&#8217;m not interested in the hierarchies that traditionally plagues, I think, academia. So that&#8217;s the first thing is, to let my students know, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m curious about you, who you are as a person, and what you&#8217;re interested in.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other part of my teaching philosophy is, so how do I nurture that? How do I give them assignments, and give them projects and things to learn, to help nurture those interests? So often, I give projects and things that are about to help students investigate their community, and their environment and their identity. I think it&#8217;s really important for students to feel a connection to the project brief, to what they&#8217;re working on. And to figure out how to sort of channel their life&#8217;s experiences, as well as who they are into their projects. There are some practical exercises that are given to topography to talk about kerning and leading and that kind of stuff. But the start of bigger projects, I really try to figure out how to give assignments to help them sort of explore who they are in their environment and their community. Also, really, I think it&#8217;s important, one of my other goals is to make sure that I&#8217;m giving them projects or I&#8217;m giving them things to read and write about, and to consider about what&#8217;s going on in the world.</p>
<p>I like having discussions and I don&#8217;t shy away from, I won&#8217;t say controversial conversations, but I don&#8217;t like to shy away from, there&#8217;s always a group of students that have a certain perspective about another thing, and then you might have another group that have a different perspective. So I like having those type of conversations so we can learn from each other, because too many times that we all are always listening to and engaging in conversation with people who have the same perspective as we do. So, I always often give reading assignments, or articles or essays, or just come up with topics or things that might make some of them feel uncomfortable sometimes, where they have to talk about things that they don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;s going to be received by their classmates. And also, try to give them a sort of sense of agency and responsibility when it comes to their own learning, and not just take everything at face value to question, even question me, right? But obviously with the mutual respect, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d love to hear an example of something you would cover in class with your students.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Sometimes, it&#8217;s as simple as, I think this project isn&#8217;t something kind of, out of the park, but giving them &#8230; One time I had students design sort of protest signage. So they could approach it with whatever topic, anything that they felt really strongly about. Some people feels really strongly about, you should have solar panels on your house. Some people still feel really strongly about abortion, which sometimes for me, some of these topics that are still surfacing are kind of surprising. And some people feel strongly about police rights and things like that.</p>
<p>So any type of way I can give them some kind of assignment that addresses these issues, usually I try to get them to think about stuff that&#8217;s relevant in the media. Things that people are on opposite sides or sort of butting heads about, just to see, how do you handle that in the design context? Even, how do you handle as a designer having conversations about, &#8220;Well, if you have a very specific social or political agenda, what does it means to do design? Or could you do design for somebody to have a different perspective than you do?&#8221; So those type of conversations I think, are important to have.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I totally think that&#8217;s important because at any point throughout your design career, you&#8217;re going to encounter some conflict. I mean, I think we know the goal is to try to not have this sort of conflicts with clients or prospective clients or anything like that, but it&#8217;s going to happen. I mean sometimes you&#8217;ll have a client, you think they&#8217;re one way, and then you start working with them and it&#8217;s completely different. And even as you&#8217;ve said about personal views and such like that, it can get really tricky because the world is not just, I mean, not to use this as a racial thing, but it&#8217;s not a black and white place. There&#8217;s all sorts of ambiguity and things in there. So the fact that you&#8217;re able to work out those scenarios and issues with students in a learning environment is really important, because then they don&#8217;t get out there in the real world and have greater consequences for those sorts of scenarios.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah. So that&#8217;s one of the reasons why I do it, because I feel like if we can&#8217;t have these open discussions and conversation and academic space, then what&#8217;s the point of education or school in that environment? At least, that&#8217;s how I look at it.</p>
<p>Another project that I did when I was working at NC State last year was, I tasked my students with doing some design research in their hometown. So if they were from Charlotte, if they were from, I don&#8217;t know, somewhere in Germany, it didn&#8217;t really matter where they were from, but they had to do research about design in their particular community, where they were from. It was up to them if they wanted to pick where they live presently or somewhere where they were raised. And I gave them some sort of guidelines or places to start, I would say, because obviously if you said, &#8220;Okay, go research Charlotte, they may not know where to start.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I gave them four different areas to start. So I said, &#8220;Hey, why don&#8217;t you research the educational institutions, find out what schools offer design programs and research their faculty to see who&#8217;s working there? What type of design work or research that they do? Research the history publications in your particular area,&#8221; because I think newspapers and those type of print media is a good place to find the history of a place, sort of like the pulse, right? Design studios, talk to people there, make a list of all the ones that exist, maybe find out information about ones that used to exist. And I think the last place was printers. If they&#8217;re like print shops, go talk to those people. So those were the different areas as far as starting points that I gave them to start their research.</p>
<p>And then they had to interview people to help fill in the gaps of trying to create that sort of storyline. Because part of what they had to actually design was some kind of information design, but this wasn&#8217;t about charts and graphs. It was more like a storytelling or narrative sort of based research project, if you will. And then it was all the data, information was sort of collected in this zine that each student sort of designed together, and got it professionally printed at the end of the semester.</p>
<p>And I think it was a really good project. They learned a lot about design from where they were from, that they didn&#8217;t know, that they probably wouldn&#8217;t have even thought about if they didn&#8217;t have this project. And they learned something about themselves. I think for some of them, it was confidence boost. If you&#8217;re from somewhere or you come from an area where maybe design isn&#8217;t talked about or there are not a lot of people you see in design that look like you, and I think this project sort of helped them do some research and some discovery in those areas.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, what do you learn from your students? I mean, you mentioned earlier that you tell them at the beginning of the courses that you&#8217;re interested in learning from them. What kind of things do you learn?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I learn a lot from them. I think I can admit as a seasoned educator professional, but sometimes I go into the classroom with certain types of assumptions or misconceptions. So a lots of times, I might have assumptions what I think they might be interested in or what they should be. But then I learn actually, what they&#8217;re actually more interested in, and that sort of shifts and change sometimes. So for instance, a lot of students, now what I&#8217;m seeing, maybe something that&#8217;s trending because of technology is that, this sort of longing for tactile things, this longing to create and print things. Lots of times I think that students wouldn&#8217;t be interested in learning about letterpress, or screen printing or these sort of, or electroset. Electroset is something I love, doing electroset exercises with my students. And I really enjoy being able to talk to them about the history behind these all ways of printing.</p>
<p>But I find they&#8217;re really interested in these things. And I mean, you do have some that are like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m really more comfortable in a digital space, and that&#8217;s fine.&#8221; Again, I&#8217;m not there to try to not nurture what their interests are. But, I feel like I&#8217;m also there for to say, &#8220;Hey, look over here. There are these other ways of making and approaching design that sort of outside of maybe what you think you should be doing.&#8221; Or lots of times, I feel what I have learned is there are very specific things that sometimes students think, &#8220;Okay, design should be this way or look this way.&#8221; And a lot of it has to do with the tools that they&#8217;re using, because everybody&#8217;s using Adobe Sweden, everybody&#8217;s using Illustrator or whatever. And I try to tell them, &#8220;Well, if we&#8217;re all using the same tools, then everything starts to look the same. But why not take your ideas, and have your ideas and the content have to dictate what type of tool you use.&#8221;</p>
<p>So a lot of times I learn a lot that I shouldn&#8217;t make assumptions, about technology or different ways in which how they&#8217;re interested in making, or what they actually want to make. Sometimes I assume, &#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re probably interested in developing an app,&#8221; and they do have those type of interests, or they&#8217;re interested in AI. But then I find so many of them when it comes to technology, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t even want to touch that stuff over there. I want to get my hands dirty.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That is so fascinating to hear that students want to do kind of tactile things. I do a lot of different types of judging throughout the year. I&#8217;ll judge design competitions. I look at portfolios and things like that from students. And I have started to see more actual tactile work books, or pamphlets or zines or something like that. It&#8217;s such a stark contrast to 20 years ago. Now, I didn&#8217;t go to design school, but I knew people that were in design school at the time that I was also in school and everybody wanted a piece of digital. I guess it&#8217;s because it was just coming about at that time. I mean, when I went to college, there were computers. I remember vividly wanting to, I majored in computer science, computer engineering, and then switching my major over to math. Because I told my advisor I wanted to learn web design, and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s a fad. No one&#8217;s going to be into that sort of stuff.&#8221; And the school that I went to didn&#8217;t have an arts program, didn&#8217;t have a design program, so I just switched over to math.</p>
<p>But I knew people that were at the Atlanta College of Art, which existed back then, and the Art Institute of Atlanta. And everybody was just clamoring to try to do something with digital because they were tired of print. They were tired of, I guess, I don&#8217;t want to say they were doing maybe more traditional things like electroset or things like that. But everybody wanted to get in on the newness. And now, 20 years from then when technology is everywhere, now students want to get tactile, they want to make stuff. Yeah, I think that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>

Yeah, I think the thing that I have to keep in mind is that the way they&#8217;re growing up and how they&#8217;re entering these spaces in this world is very different from how I entered it, where I was there prior to computers and then post. Not that, to be honest, I don&#8217;t have the pay stop experience. I mean, I was in school at the advent of, Adobe was already there, Photoshop was already there. The Mac computer was already there in the early two thousands. So I was sort of a little bit post the desktop publishing area. But I think the thing that I forget is that, well, they&#8217;re so consumed, this is all they know. So for them they need a break. They are exhausted from the screen is what they tell me. So they&#8217;re kind of exhausted from it. And so when you show these other analog processes, they really light up. It&#8217;s really nice and encouraging to see that they still have these interests.</p>
<p>But again, there are some that are really interested in the technology. A lot of them are interested in the 3D sort of space and the digital space, but also the physical space. There are sort of a range. But I think that&#8217;s what I learn. The more I teach, the more I learn about what the sort of dynamics to what they&#8217;re interested in. And they have various interests and it&#8217;s not good to even put them into a box and assume what they&#8217;re interested in because, it&#8217;s a lot of different things that are out there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I love that. I love that. Students are tired of screens. I&#8217;m loving hearing that. Now, let&#8217;s learn more about you. Let&#8217;s hear your origin story. You&#8217;re originally from New Orleans. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me about what it was growing up there.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, I grew up in the inner city, not on the outskirts. I grew up in New Orleans, we sort of identified with the wards, which are actually voting wards. So I grew up in the seven ward, New Orleans, which the time that I grew up was predominantly Black or all Black maybe, don&#8217;t know the statistics on that, but a very urban inner city. Grew up poor, single mom, family. I&#8217;m the oldest of four siblings. Had a good childhood. I remember going outside and play, making games up as we go, just started using resources and things that we had around to play different sports, so to do different things. My mom was always really supportive in whatever it was I wanted to do. So when I was younger, I wanted to go to law school. Actually, I wanted to be an attorney. And so, I actually approached going to college, thinking that I was going to go to law school and practice law, actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow. What interested you about law?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
To be honest, Maurice, it was, the part of it that was probably really superficial, meaning I watched a lot of court shows growing up, and I got sucked into the drama of the investigations. And this aha moment when the real person, suspect was revealed. And the banter in the court and the back and forth between the attorneys, all the drama. So that seemed exciting because I always felt like, I&#8217;ve always had a strong voice, I guess, and a strong personality and perspective in that way. I can be very argumentative about things that I&#8217;m super passionate about. So I just thought I would be a good attorney. Why not? I was a good student, usually brought home good grades. So yeah, I could do this law school thing, and I can go to law school and do that.</p>
<p>The other side of it is, I also saw law as something that oppressed us as a people for a long time, and I wanted to understand it better to help us. So that was the sort of flip side of my interest in going to law school. But yeah, that faded when I actually, I mean I was really, up until my last year in college, I was still pursuing going to law school, to be honest.</p>
<p>Now, I was at Loyola, I was an English writing major. And the reason I picked that major was because I was told &#8230; I can&#8217;t remember if it was a job fair or a college fair when I was in high school and somebody said, &#8220;Oh, people who do really well in law school, they major in English because of all the writing and research you have to do,&#8221; whatever. So that&#8217;s really how that came about. And I did a lot of reading growing up. So the idea of having to read and write was kind of made sense, something I was sort of interested in. So yeah, that&#8217;s how that came about was because I wanted to be a good law student, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you had been on this path, I mean, to the point where you went to school, you were studying in it, you were getting all the way up to your senior year. Was there a deciding incident that kind of changed your trajectory?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
The incident was preparing to take the LSAT, I would say. So it was more like a process. So I want to say the first semester of my senior year, I was preparing to take the LSAT, researching what schools to go to. And all of that became extremely overwhelming and stressful, but it wasn&#8217;t exciting in a way, how things could be really overwhelming, but you&#8217;re still sort of excited about it, and if it&#8217;s you&#8217;re anxious. And so then I did some soul-searching and it was like, &#8220;Well, why do you want to do this Tasheka? Why do you want to go to law school?&#8221; And so, one of the things that is at the time it was really hard for me to admit, was that I honestly didn&#8217;t think I was good at anything, or I didn&#8217;t know what I was really good at. So because I was always sort of a good student, I just kind of looked at it as that way. I can go to law school, I&#8217;m going to be a good student, and then I&#8217;ll get a decent job.</p>
<p>I have always been a very goal driven oriented person. And so for me, it was always just sort of scratching things off the list. So go to school, major in English writing, do well, go to law school, take the LSAT, get a high grade, study. It&#8217;s just this constant thing. But when I actually really looked within, I realized that, well, I didn&#8217;t want to do it for the right reasons. You shouldn&#8217;t choose a career path just because it&#8217;s sort of checking off the list. I can accomplish this thing, but it&#8217;s not something that, I mean, I had a genuine interest in the law, but when I look back, yeah, it definitely wasn&#8217;t the right path for me.</p>
<p>So I just remember there was this one day, I used to do work study in the library. I just started going online and doing research about what do creative people do. So copywriter came about because I&#8217;m getting a degree in English, but at the time I didn&#8217;t feel too confident about my writing skills. So I was like, &#8220;Eh, I don&#8217;t really want to do that.&#8221; And then I remember, topography kept popping up, and this isn&#8217;t a time where in the early two thousands, when they had a lot of portfolio schools, like Miami AD and those type of schools.</p>
<p>So I was doing research and those type of schools kept popping up, and then I kept seeing topography and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What is topography? I don&#8217;t even know what that is.&#8221; So I looked in the school course catalog and I saw topography one and two, and then it was graphic design and I didn&#8217;t know what any of these, I wasn&#8217;t aware of any of this stuff, or what that meant as far as a career. And so the more I read and the more I did my research, I was like, &#8220;Oh, this design thing sounds really interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the next semester, I just went head first. I signed up to take a type one and a design one class, the year, the semester I was supposed to graduate. And then I fell in love with it. And then I pushed my graduation back about a year so I could get a minor in graphic design. And I didn&#8217;t get a true minor. I kind of had a relationship with the director of the art department at the time, because throughout my time in college, I took drawing and painting classes as my elective, because I&#8217;ve always had an affection for art and drawing. So I talked to her at the time and about getting a minor, and so they sort of told me that, just take the main classes. I didn&#8217;t have to take the foundations and stuff like that. So they sort of fast tracked me into design one and however many classes I could take within a year, because Loyola is a private Jesuit liberal university, just very expensive. And I was on a scholarship, so that extra year, I could only go to school those two extra semesters.</p>
<p>So I did that. After that year, it was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m a graphic designer now. That&#8217;s it. This is what I want to do.&#8221; Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a really interesting turn. I mean, you were already set to go along this way, and then you kind of just had another idea and there you go.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah. It wasn&#8217;t something that was obviously planned out in that way, but I&#8217;ve never looked back. I can&#8217;t honestly imagine being in any other field than design, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s really awesome that it sort of came about that way. I&#8217;m curious now on what Tasheka the lawyer would be like, if you would&#8217;ve went there.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I think about it, too. I don&#8217;t know, honestly. I mean, I think there&#8217;s a way that I would&#8217;ve found my niche. I would&#8217;ve found an area of law that would&#8217;ve been good for me. I don&#8217;t know how lucrative that would&#8217;ve been, especially if you think about going to a private undergraduate school, and then law school and then student &#8230; It&#8217;s just sort of the bills and student loans to pile up when you think about it. So yeah, I don&#8217;t know. I think I would&#8217;ve found my way, but I think that it definitely wasn&#8217;t the right path for me. And I think the sort of activist in me, I would&#8217;ve found whatever I guess sort of industry I would&#8217;ve ended up, I think I would&#8217;ve found that sort of angle.</p>
<p>But I do remember this one conversation I had with a lady at a job fair my senior year, and she said that her husband was an attorney and that he had a studio in their attic and he was a painter. And she said that, but once he started really getting into law, he stopped painting as much as he used to. And so I started thinking that I never wanted art to not be a part of my life. So that was sort of a reality check where I was, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want to go into law if this is going to prevent me from being creative or being a maker,&#8221; I guess.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So you graduated from Loyola, and I know later you went and got your MFA from CalArts. Between then, did you get out in the working world and experience a little bit of what it was like to not be a student for a while?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes. It was a very short time. It was exactly a year and four months to date. So yeah, after I graduated, I end up working as a designer at the Navy, which was such a strange thing for me personally, to end up working for the military. But yeah, I worked for the Navy Reservist Public Affairs Office, and they hired me because they saw my resume, that I took topography classes, which is kind of funny when I think about it. Because it&#8217;s like, well, when you go to, you study design, you take topography. It wasn&#8217;t nothing special. But anyway, but one of the other reasons they hired me was because they wanted somebody young with fresh ideas. And at the time, they were publishing and producing a tabloid newspaper. And so they wanted me on board to help transition that newspaper into a monthly magazine.<br>
I actually stayed there long enough just to do that, basically. We had a few firsts. I guess half the time I was there, we were publishing the newspaper. Then the second half, we transitioned over to a magazine, and that&#8217;s my first job. I will say that it was a really great learning experience in school, as far as print production and that kind of stuff. You don&#8217;t necessarily learn. So the Navy, I would drive to Panama City to go see the publication on press, that kind of stuff. So I learned all the production there. So yeah, it was a really good experience for me, as far as my first professional design job.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you were able to get that, I mean, one right out of school because you had this small amount of design experience just from studying, and they were like, &#8220;Yeah, we&#8217;ll go with that.&#8221; Nowadays, for entry level position, they already want you to have three years experience somewhere. So it&#8217;s good that they kind of took a chance and said, &#8220;Yeah, we&#8217;ll move forward and see what you have.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, I will say it was actually a head hunter that found me, or like a temp agency, I would say. And they put me in contact with the Navy. And I think that they were, because they were producing a publication, it was probably a time crunch. And so, I don&#8217;t know if I was the first person they referred them to. I don&#8217;t know if they had interviewed a bunch of other people. I have no idea. But I just knew that, oh, they were also impressed that I studied abroad. I&#8217;m trying to think of the things that they said to me during the interview or that made them sort of intrigued or want me to come in. They liked that I had spent some time abroad and that I took topography courses, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Where did you study abroad?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I studied abroad in Prague, in the Czech Republic. And it was mainly, it was more of a printmaking study abroad than graphic design. I mean, the graphic design aspect of it, was it that there was this workshop or this class that we took to set up design posters by hand. All analog, which was great, but it was really for printmaking, like lithography, learning to do aquatints and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And it was interesting, because it was actually with a program that was through NC State, and one of my professors at Loyola at the time was the person who was in charge. I had started that study abroad program. So it was kind of weird last year when I worked at NC State, it was like, &#8220;Oh, I did a study abroad program at this place and now I&#8217;m teaching here.&#8221; So I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s just kind of funny how things kind of happen that way in life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So tell me how your experience was getting your MFA at Cal Arts.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
That in of itself was an experience. CalArts was tough. I mean, I definitely went there knowing that it was going to be difficult, that it wasn&#8217;t going to be easy. Actually, I was there for three years. I got accepted for the three-year track. So a lot of schools now have a three year and a two-year track, and normally the three-year track is reserved for students who don&#8217;t have a traditional graphic design background. And so since my degree wasn&#8217;t in design, it was in English. And then, I had that limited experience, that year and a half working for the Navy. So I actually did three years instead of two. So the first year was, I guess an adjustment and challenging, in and of itself. For one, I was the only Black student there in the graduate and the undergraduate program, which for me was pretty shocking.</p>
<p>And the reason it was surprising is because I think, to be honest, at the time I was just starting, right before grad school and doing my first year of grad school. I was just starting to notice how there was a lack of visibility of Black people in design, or how the design profession didn&#8217;t seem to, or the lack of diversity that existed. Honestly, I don&#8217;t know why it took that long for me to actually realize that, but it wasn&#8217;t until, I think it was the 2004 AIGA conference that I realized that, where I saw maybe four or five other Black people at the conference. It was in Vancouver, I remember that. And then that&#8217;s when, that was not long before I actually started school at CalArts.</p>
<p>So that experience, and that was the thing that I think started me on this kind of trajectory, or the path into doing the research that I do, was looking around, not seeing anybody like me. Not learning anything about anybody who looked like me with the history class, or so, yeah, that&#8217;s sort of where I started. And me being at CalArts as a student, sort of asking the question, talking to faculty or just saying. Even sometimes it was in my work, I was questioning, where are the Black designers? When was the last time CalArts had a Black student in the MFA program? Nobody can answer that question. Or can you tell me something about Black people in design history? Nobody can answer that question.</p>
<p>So it became this thing where, and I know we&#8217;ve done similar sort of scavenger hunts. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Where the hell are all the Black people?&#8221; So anyway, that is where my research started. So because I couldn&#8217;t find anything out there that was tangible to hold onto, I just started doing my own research and investigation. Because I was like, &#8220;There&#8217;s nobody who&#8217;s here to tell me or give me that information. I have to discover it from myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I will say the faculty there was all, for the most part, it was, I felt supported. Although it was tough. It was like bootcamp, going to CalArts. It was a really, really tough, intense program. But I did feel encouraged most of the time for the type of projects that I had. And some of them was filled with a lot of emotion and anger, and aggression and frustration, and a lot of times that came out. But I will say that they sort of helped me nurture and cultivate my voice, and they also always encouraged me to be true, to keep that investigation and then that energy, and to being inquisitive about my design, Black design history, and culture and identity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s such a good thing now that it almost feels like, I&#8217;d say maybe within the past, I don&#8217;t know, 10, 15 years perhaps, we&#8217;ll say that. But we&#8217;ve started to see more Black design educators out there, and we&#8217;ve also started to see community efforts. I mean, Revision Path is one of them, but we&#8217;ve started to also see community efforts with making sure that Black people, and I would say Black and brown, I mean, I would kind of widen that lens a bit. But we&#8217;ve started to see now more people of color in general, being talked about, recognized, showcased, researched as it comes to design. I mean, I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;ll get to a point where there&#8217;s full equity with regards to that, but I think within the past 10 years, we&#8217;ve seen a lot of headway in that direction, where we&#8217;re starting to now see more Black students, or at least more talk about Black designers throughout history. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes, I would agree with that. There is definitely some sort of shift. I mean, if I&#8217;m honest, I&#8217;m not seeing it enough or as much as I would like to see it. But I&#8217;m also aware that things do take time, and especially when you have things that are so systemic and that&#8217;s a part of system that&#8217;s been there for so long that it&#8217;s not, it takes a long time to sort of dismantle it.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m honest, I do believe that it doesn&#8217;t have to, or it shouldn&#8217;t take it as long, but I understand it. I try to understand it. I do think that things can happen a lot quicker, but I do realize that there are still certain structures that are there, that&#8217;s way more difficult to dismantle to where it takes a lot longer. But I am happy to have colleagues. I didn&#8217;t think that I would see a day where I could name at least three other Black women that are doing similar type of work or things like that. So I am happy to see that there&#8217;s a change, and there&#8217;s a lot of work and way more work that needs to be done. But yeah, I agree. There are more efforts, I guess, and more initiatives that are happening at different places.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think with schools, it&#8217;s just always going to take longer because schools are just such, these large institutions. Of course, they get funds from different philanthropists and foundations and stuff like that. But I agree with you, in that I think the change could be happening a lot quicker. I a hundred percent agree with you there.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah. I just think that one of the things that I liked about UT was they started changing their admissions process. I think there are still more work to be done, but they have done away with the traditional portfolio. And so, their admission process is more a design prompt, so a student could &#8230; So the design program looks at just that one particular piece that they&#8217;re doing, and then they submit a 60-minute video that sort of talks about their process and their ideas, alongside the piece that they made for admissions.</p>
<p>So I think that, that takes a lot of pressure off because you still have so many students that, they don&#8217;t have the resources in their high schools to submit even a fine arts portfolio, let alone something that&#8217;s specific to design. Where you need all these different, you need a computer, you need the Adobe software, you need all these digital tools that a lot of high schools still don&#8217;t have those type of resources. So it&#8217;s nice to see that they&#8217;re at least trying to change that process a little bit, to make it more equitable for students of color to have access to the program.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, along with you being a design educator, and you mentioned this a bit earlier, you have your own design studio called Blacvoice Design. Tell me more about that. What are some of the projects or other work that you&#8217;ve done through your studio?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Well, a lot of projects I would say, first start off with the type of clients that I work with. So most of my clients are educational institutions like universities, colleges and things like that, nonprofit organizations, as well as kind of start up or small businesses. And I actually like the work that I do within those spaces. The type of projects that I do, format wise, most of them are books. I design a lot of books, but I don&#8217;t like to just consider myself a book designer because I do do identity projects and things like that. But a lot of the books that I do design, because a lot of my clients have modest budgets, usually I&#8217;m given texts and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>And so, I think that&#8217;s why I wear this hat of an image maker, because a lot of projects might call for me to take photos and I&#8217;ll take my own photographs for a particular project, or I do my own illustrations and create my own imagery for them. And so that I actually like. I like that whole process of generating the imagery, and doing the type setting, and doing the layout and the design. I really do enjoy being a part of that process from the beginning to the end. I thought at this point in my career that I would want to be in a more creative director sort of role, but I actually like and still enjoy being hands on.</p>
<p>So some projects that I&#8217;ve worked on in the past that are really kind of dear to my heart is, I used to do some work for a nonprofit organization. They&#8217;re now called 826 New Orleans, but they used to be called Big Class. And Big Class is a nonprofit organization. They started off basically sort of reaching out to the inner city public schools. And so, they would have writing prompts or writing projects for students to engage in after school. And so they would come up with themes, the students would come up with themes or topics that they wanted to write about. Usually it had to do with their feelings around their culture and their community.</p>
<p>And so, what I would do is basically, I would come in, talk to the student editorial board, find out what ideas they have about the design and the design process, and basically use that as information or inspiration and design a book for these individual projects. And so Big Class would take those books, they would have these readings, they would get people, they had their own press and their own imprint. And so they would publish and sell the books, and then they would just feed and go back into the sort of program. And I really like that program, because it not only gets students excited about writing, and writing is a form of expression, writing can be creative, right? Writing, I think gave them a sense of agency because they get to write, they get to publish, they get to put it out there, they get to have open mic and spoken words.</p>
<p>And so, I really love to see the sort of confidence that it gave these students, that maybe in their school, they may not ever have that type of experience. So for me to provide a platform for them to express themselves through words, through writing, I really did enjoy working with them. But now they&#8217;re part of this larger, more national collection of programs, that&#8217;s like 826 New Orleans, you have 826 Valencia. So 826 sort of exists in a lot of different cities. And my hope is to, there isn&#8217;t an 826 in Austin. Honestly, have no idea how to even start one. And it&#8217;s not that I even want to be in charge of one, but I would love to try to figure out how to create a rapport with some of the schools, some of the public schools here in Austin to try to get one started here. And then that way, it&#8217;s something that I would like my students at UT to be involved in that process, of helping those students design and get their work printed and published.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m a big advocate of designers needing to do more writing. A hundred percent. We had at one point in time, kind of design anthology called Recognize that we were doing through Revision Path, where we had designers just like, we would give a particular prompt or theme. I think the one we did before we shut it down was reset. I think reset was the theme. And so based off of that, we wanted people to submit essays up to 3000 words, centered around reset in whatever way that they wanted to. But it had to be design focused, like design writing. We didn&#8217;t get great ones. I&#8217;ll be completely honest. I think a lot of people rather wanted to design something than write something.</p>
<p>And even the first year that we did it, we would get some pushback from people, &#8220;Well, why do I have to write something?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;It&#8217;s a essay.&#8221; I mean, you have to write something because that&#8217;s the structure of it. I do want to bring it back one day if Revision Path can get the right funding and all of that. Because, I&#8217;m still a big proponent and believer of designers, I think, need to be, they need to know how to write because of course, it just helps you get your ideas out there. But it&#8217;s just so helpful for, and I think this probably ties into your research focus. It ties into your work being part of the cannon. If you can write down what you did, the work you did, case studies, et cetera, if it gets put out there in some way, if it gets preserved in some way, you&#8217;re now part of the cannon.</p>
<p>One thing with me, when I try to find guests for the show, it&#8217;s very hard for me to book a guest when I can&#8217;t find anything on them. I could maybe find-</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, you could maybe do some research.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, yeah, because I can maybe find a website or there&#8217;s maybe a blog post or something somewhere, but I need to be able to see what you&#8217;ve done so I can get a sense of who you are as a designer, if this is going to be a good fit, that sort of thing. But I say all of that to say that I&#8217;m a big, just huge fan of designers being writers, and write it down, write down your work, show your work.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I agree with that too, Maurice. And even as a person, I still think I have a very strange or uncomfortable, I think it&#8217;s a better word, relationship with writing. It&#8217;s something that with my teaching, I always make sure that there&#8217;s some writing component in a project for students, whether it&#8217;s a reflection to something they read or something they saw. I think it&#8217;s really important. I see a lot of similarities in the writing, in the design process. So for me, it&#8217;s been, although it&#8217;s still a place where I&#8217;m super uncomfortable in lots of times, a few years ago, to be honest, I think it was back in 2017 when I was teaching at Southeastern Louisiana University, and I had just gotten tenured there. And I didn&#8217;t realize at the time that until I was at NC State during that interview process, that up until that point, I had got tenured because of my creative work, because of doing exhibitions and things like that.</p>
<p>And at that point, I realized that with the research that I was doing, and then at that time, my research was startup, sporadic, how I was engaged with it. I started this research in graduate school, and then I would start to engage with it from time to time when somebody would ask me to give a lecture. And at some point, going back to what you were saying about the importance of the canon and sort of writing things down, that became a real turning point for me because at that point, I wanted to change my practice a little bit, and have it more focused on writing and publishing. Because in my mind, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, I can continue to do these lectures and talk about this stuff, but then what?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
What do you with it? And so I knew at some point I always wanted to write a book about Black design history. I knew, even from grad school back at CalArts, that&#8217;s something I wanted to do. I think, not until that point, I became more intentional about it. I was like, &#8220;Okay, if I want to shift,&#8221; not do away with making, not do away with freelance, not doing away with that work, but I wanted to be more intentional about the scholarly part of me, I guess, in that work. And sort of getting it out there and not have it just be through lectures. And I think, oral history and that stuff is valuable. I&#8217;m not trying to devalue that at all, but I do think there&#8217;s something about having something written and on a page, and printed and sort of documented. Right? I mean, I think it&#8217;s really important for our work and stuff to be documented, so it can be passed on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Exactly. I mean, the oral storytelling, and I realize we&#8217;re saying this on a podcast, but is mean that is important. But being able to write it down, pass it on, put it in a book, have it stored somewhere, that is what is really, that is the canon. That&#8217;s what you end up preserving. Speaking of books, I mean, we&#8217;re both working on books, but part of the research that I find is trying to find these writings and trying to find where people have talked about stuff. And you know what we&#8217;re doing now? Interviews. We&#8217;re having to talk to people because we can&#8217;t find where folks have written stuff down. So to that end, about books, as I mentioned that just now, you&#8217;re working on a book called Black Design in America. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, so I&#8217;m a co-author of Black Design America, African-Americans, and African Diaspora and Graphic Design, 19th to 21st Century. My co-authors are Silas Munro and Pierre Bowins. And how this book came about is not a linear kind of trajectory of story. So back in 2020, when George Floyd was murdered and you had the protests going on, and a lot of things were sort of happening online, VCFA had started this sort of virtual programming. I believe they contacted me and asked me if I was interested in doing a lecture or something about my research. And so at the time, I want to say around that time, I can&#8217;t remember exactly, but I know at some point, me, Pierre, and Silas had created a Google Doc, and we just started populating it with our research. And some of our focus on our research was slightly different. There was some overlap, but we started this Google Doc, and I think we started it with the intent of writing a book someday.</p>
<p>So the idea was that, &#8220;Okay, we want to have this document populated to start working on the outline.&#8221; So VCFA came to me. I decided that I didn&#8217;t want to just be the only voice talking about Black design history. So I invited Pierre and Silas to also give a lecture. So they call it these micro lectures. So still had the same amount of time that I had to give my lecture, but instead of me talking for an hour or 45 minutes, we each had 15 minutes to do a micro lecture, a mini presentation about our specific research.</p>
<p>So again, around that time, I met Dr. Cheryl Miller, and she was just starting, or had already started her archive for Stanford, a Black design history archive. And somebody gave her my name. And so, I met with her about sending my work there. And something that I still feel weird about saying was that was my first time hearing about her and her work, but I&#8217;m glad I did. I&#8217;m glad that we had that opportunity to talk and connect. And now she&#8217;s a huge mentor and influence, inspiration in my life. But that conversation with her sort of gave me a little focus. So I was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m really interested in the history of Black women in graphic design too.&#8221; So my portion of the lecture was about that.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re in the midst of the pandemic, and Silas had this idea. And so we all talked about how this information needs to get out there. I don&#8217;t know if we have time to go through the process of writing a book and getting published, and trying to do all the stuff that you have to go through, as you you&#8217;re working on one yourself. It&#8217;s a huge timeline. You don&#8217;t just do it overnight. It takes a lot of time. So Silas and his studio, that&#8217;s how they came up, and they put together the BIPOC Design History Classes, went live January of 2021. And so again, it wasn&#8217;t the intent to have the classes. And that sort of happened first. That idea, we thought, prior to the pandemic and whatnot, that we would be working on a book first. So that happened. That was the success. And so then after the chorus, then we felt like, &#8220;Okay, now we have to write this book now, because we kind of already have a structure. We have content.&#8221; But little did we know, Maurice, that it was not that easy.</p>
<p>These small classes. Okay. Yeah. There are chapters in the book, but I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s just, yeah, they&#8217;re still talking to people. There&#8217;s still more research to be done. There&#8217;s still more archives to visit. So it wasn&#8217;t just that simple to just make that transition from the series of classes, and then to make it into a book. So we&#8217;re still in the process of writing now. We have a hard, hard deadline coming up on June 1st, where we have to really turn over the manuscript. And we&#8217;re all also collaborating on the design of the book, too. So yeah, it&#8217;s been an interesting process.</p>
<p>And I think the thing that, I know for me, and I think from my co-authors as well, the thing that&#8217;s been most difficult is that it&#8217;s a design history book, but we&#8217;re not approaching it like a Meg&#8217;s book in a way, or this book came out a few years ago, it&#8217;s called Graphic Design Pioneers, or Pioneers in Design, where it&#8217;s focused on individuals. So we do talk about individual designers and sort of their impact, but it&#8217;s more about the diaspora, it&#8217;s more about Black experience in a way, and what we had to go through and deal with. It&#8217;s more about how we&#8217;ve been represented through visual culture, and who&#8217;s responsible for that and that kind of stuff. So it&#8217;s not necessarily about a clothesline of designers, although we do talk about individual people, because you can&#8217;t write a history book without acknowledging individuals. But, it&#8217;s not just about highlighting people, I guess in that way. It&#8217;s more about the different movements that happened, throughout time and throughout history.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, because I mean-</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
And we&#8217;ve been affected by it, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Because you&#8217;re, like you said, it&#8217;s set up with, it&#8217;s in the context of America during that time, and so there&#8217;s been wars, there&#8217;s been civil rights movements, there&#8217;s been other sorts of radical movements. And so, being able to talk about how Black design has been a through line with all of that in this country, we don&#8217;t learn it in school, in K through 12 schools. And based on what you&#8217;re saying, and probably from others, it&#8217;s probably not even something that&#8217;s really readily learned in colleges.</p>
<p>So having a book like this is super important, I think, not just to the design canon, but just like to American history in general. Because everything that we go through in this country has been designed in some capacity. That don&#8217;t necessarily mean that it&#8217;s been done with a pen and paper or in some visual aspect, but the systems of oppression that are in this country and many other things that sort of hold people back or push others forward, these are designed constructs. And so being able to talk about Black design in this country is super important to, I think, informing that for a lot of people. So, I&#8217;m excited to see the book when it comes out. Congratulations to you, because I know it&#8217;s a lot. I know all too well. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I mean, I think writing a book is a challenge, in and of itself, but I think history, and I think we have a special challenge in the type of history that we&#8217;re trying to bring to light, because it hasn&#8217;t been well documented or readily available. So it&#8217;s a lot of things you have to do to discover these stories. That&#8217;s definitely been a challenge. I think, one thing that I want to say I&#8217;m proud of about how we approach the writing in this book is that we sort of try to do away with &#8230; we&#8217;re being ourselves. We feel like using I, then we use I. If we want to throw in a little snarky, something that maybe a long time ago would be unorthodox for a history book, but we are just throwing it and putting it all out there. We&#8217;re not sort of concerned about our voices being the same, and we like that our voices are fluid and they&#8217;re sort of interchangeable.</p>
<p>We collaborated and wrote the introduction together, and there are parts of it, it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t even remember what I wrote. And we do have our chapters that the three of us have been responsible for, and we have contributors to certain chapters as well, but we&#8217;re not sort of concerned with the more traditional approach to this type of book. We don&#8217;t even call it a textbook. We&#8217;re not really approaching it in that same traditional way, I guess, if you will.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So you&#8217;re teaching, you&#8217;re running your own design studio, you are working on a book, you&#8217;re doing this research and your research focuses on, as we&#8217;ve talked about throughout this interview, Black people being omitted from the graphic design history canon. Given all the different spaces that you occupy, designer, educator, et cetera, what does the path forward look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I think about that a lot. I think it&#8217;s going to continue in this realm of writing and publishing, and designing. I think I like the idea of being a content generator and being the one to design that content. So I see more books around the same topic, but in different iterations. So for instance, I&#8217;m completely obsessed with Louise E. Jefferson. She is a Black woman who was one of the first art directors in the publishing industry at Friendship Press. She started working in the mid, late 1930s, and she was a designer, a calligrapher, a cartographer, an illustrator, a researcher. I mean, she was a real true renaissance woman, and she rubbed shoulders with all kinds of people during the Harlem Renaissance. But I&#8217;ve been doing research on her for a really long time. And so, I envision writing and designing a book about Louise E. Jefferson. And right now, I&#8217;ve been in touch with Friendship Press where she worked at as an art director for 20 years, and they&#8217;re interested in me writing a book about Louise and her work.</p>
<p>So those type of projects I see still continuing. The past few years have been great. The writing, the lecturing have been amazing, meeting amazing people, and have been great with giving me more opportunities to write into research. But I would like to hopefully, have more of a balance between that and my making, especially maybe even more so personal projects. I really enjoy doing small collaborations with other designers, whether it be zines or just random, creating compositions and giving files, going back and forth between digital files and things like that. Well, not really knowing what the outcome is. I think I just miss making and playing, and having fun.</p>
<p>Not that the design work that I do isn&#8217;t enjoyable, but it&#8217;s just a different type of making, I guess it&#8217;s different. You&#8217;re doing research and you&#8217;re writing. That&#8217;s a lot different than like, &#8220;Okay, I have this idea for making this thing using these materials, or even this tool or this technology. Am I making?&#8221; I&#8217;m really interested in this sort of synthesis, and analog and digital tools and how they sort of come together, and how to expand our uses in ways that they weren&#8217;t actually meant to be used. So I would like moving forward to be able to engage more, and just being a maker and not thinking about what I&#8217;m making so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, being a designer and an educator and all these things, you&#8217;ve talked now about how you want your path to go forward, but in your current work, how do you balance these different aspects? Do these different roles inform each other in some way?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, I definitely see there are so much overlap in &#8230; For a long time, I actually didn&#8217;t know how to bring all these things together, especially in the classroom because it took a while before I started teaching design history, and actually I&#8217;m not teaching it right now. I haven&#8217;t taught it in maybe three years. But I think, that doesn&#8217;t mean that I can&#8217;t still bring that into the classroom. So to me, it doesn&#8217;t matter. I don&#8217;t care that I&#8217;m not teaching design history. Whatever I&#8217;m teaching, you&#8217;re going to learn something about Black design. Some kind of way I&#8217;m going to insert my agenda, because I know that these are things that are, in part, it&#8217;s not just Black design history. I talk about queer history. I talk about other areas of design where people are marginalized or we don&#8217;t know a lot about, and I know a little something. I still try to impart that to my students, so I make sure that I&#8217;m trying to be equitable in that sense.</p>
<p>But yeah, I&#8217;m just starting to see where these roads and where these things are starting to overlap. So am I making? Now I think about, well, how could, besides designing books about Black design history or whatever, and the publishing aspect, but I start thinking about, well, what are other things that you can make that sort of has to do with your research? So I&#8217;m starting to think more about that, like timelines and things like that. So to me, the crossover is starting to happen. It&#8217;s slow and maybe not as fast as I would have liked them to be. And then I see them in the projects that I give to my students too. So it sort of reverts back to the classroom in that way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, I like that it all feeds into each other then. That&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Kind of makes less work for me in a way, as opposed to try to compartmentalize everything. So for a long time, everything used to be in these separate buckets. Black design studio, freelance here is writing and lecture. But now, they&#8217;re just starting to morph together, and that has been good, and that&#8217;s how I would like things to continue in the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hey, look, work smarter, not harder. I get it.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to someone out here that&#8217;s hearing your story, that&#8217;s hearing about all these different things that you&#8217;re interested in, and they want to follow in your footsteps? What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I would say, learn how to be comfortable in your voice, in your skin, and how to &#8230; I didn&#8217;t always feel comfortable being Tasheka, being authentically me, because sometimes I had moments where I didn&#8217;t want to step on people&#8217;s toes, but I noticed moments where I did do that, and I was just kind of myself and just kind of put it out there. Those have been the best experiences.</p>
<p>And I would say that we all have control. You have some kind of control over your path, and so if there&#8217;s a certain direction that you want your practice, or your craft, or your skill or whatever it is you are into to take, that you can kind of plan for. Talk to people who are doing the thing that you want to do, align yourself. Reach out to them. I know sometimes, we think and we look at people that we admire and we put them on this pedestal, but if they&#8217;re the right people, they&#8217;ll talk to you and they&#8217;re not full of themselves. And lots of times, people are more than happy to talk to you about your path, and this is especially to younger designers. Don&#8217;t be afraid to reach out to people who you admire, and have conversations with them about what they do and how they got to where they are. But yeah, I just say be bold.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Be bold.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Be bold and intentional about how you move through this world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love that. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want the next chapter of your story to be?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I do see myself still teaching. I do see myself still being at UT, and I&#8217;m hoping, my hope is that in five years, I have a couple of books under my belt by then. Maybe, I&#8217;m just going to throw it out there, Maurice. I would say at least three of them, because I have a list of projects that I&#8217;m really like. It&#8217;s kind of like these have to be done before I die. No, maybe they don&#8217;t have to be done in five years. That&#8217;s pretty ambitious of me, but I&#8217;m already working on one, so I can get the other two at least in the works by that time, that would be great.</p>
<p>I do have sort of a passion project that I&#8217;ve been sitting on on for a while. I have a collection of drawings, maybe it&#8217;s like 200 and something drawings, that I would like in five years to have their own sort of brand, where it&#8217;s a collection of, whether it&#8217;s greeting cards or home decor or apparel. Not or. I should say and. So I&#8217;ve been procrastinated on this project for a really long time, and I hope in five years that that project sort of sees the light of day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I&#8217;m probably most active on Instagram and Facebook. So Facebook is Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton. On Instagram, it&#8217;s Blacvoice. I am on Twitter under Blacvoice, but I&#8217;m not that engaged with that platform as much. But, I&#8217;m on there and I tweet every now and then. I&#8217;m on LinkedIn, which is, you can find me under Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton. Again, that&#8217;s not a platform that I&#8217;m super engaged in, but I&#8217;m there, and you&#8217;ll probably find me multiple times under LinkedIn, but I&#8217;m there. But Instagram, I would say, it&#8217;s probably the place to see me. I&#8217;m more active there. I would hate to throw out my crappy Adobe Portfolio website. That&#8217;s just a bunch of stuff that&#8217;s thrown on there right now. But hey, why not? Blacvoicedesign.portfolio.com. That&#8217;s just something that&#8217;s there right now, just to have an online presence, until I have time to do something else with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. You and your work have been on my radar for many years, I think probably, maybe since 2015? For a while now. And it wasn&#8217;t until recently, I had spoken with Cheryl, had Cheryl on the show for 500th episode, and she sung your praises to the high heavens. And I was like, &#8220;I feel like I reached out to her before. Let me reach out again just to see if she might be interested.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Actually, you did, Maurice. I thought about that. I was actually just telling my sister right before, and I was like, I feel weird because you did reach out to me a long time ago, and I think at the time I was just not ready, and something that had nothing to do with you or the show. I love the show and listen to it, and I think that was just like, &#8220;I&#8217;m still in my boldness. I&#8217;m kind of shy too, and more of an introvert.&#8221; So I think that, yeah, it just took a while, but you did. You did, but I&#8217;m glad you reached back out again.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, but I mean, I also just want to say from hearing your story and hearing about everything that you&#8217;re working on, I think it&#8217;s evident that you have a passion for design. You have a passion for honestly getting the story right, whether it&#8217;s through writing, through education, through your visual design work. I&#8217;m really excited to see and hear more from you in the future. I feel like you&#8217;re one of our bright shining stars that are really going to help represent us, as we move forward in this crazy world that we&#8217;re in right now. I feel like the work that you&#8217;re doing is really going to stand out and help showcase what Black designers are doing everywhere, so thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>

Luckily, it&#8217;s not too late to reset, break any unhealthy patterns, and get on track so you can live a life rooted in passion and purpose. And guess what? This week&#8217;s guest, Justin Shiels, is just the person to help you make that happen.</p>
<p>We talked about his theme for this year &#8212; intentional growth &#8212; and Justin spoke about the big life change that inspired him to not only take a break, but to write a book to help others experience their own breakthrough.

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Hey there. My name is Justin Shiels and I&#8217;m a creative consultant, a speaker and an author. Honestly, what I love is solving complex problems using the lens of emotional intelligence. And so a lot of my focus is on how to use empathy and design and illustration to create cultural moments.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s the year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Ooh, 2023 is a good year so far. I feel like 2022 for me was my year of the pivot. There were just a lot of changes. I got a book deal, I switched to a new job in marketing, and I feel like through that time of working on the book, finishing the book, writing and illustrating, I changed as a person. And so 2023, I stepped into this new year focused on intentional growth. That&#8217;s kind of my theme of this year. How can I be centered in my vision as a creative professional and continue to grow in a sustainable way?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In what way does that intentional growth look like?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Intentional growth for me is really focusing on delivering incredible content via social media platforms. This was my year of embracing video and not being afraid to show my face on camera. That has always been a little bit of a scary part of my creative process. It&#8217;s been opening myself up to new speaking opportunities, and it&#8217;s been teaching workshops around emotional intelligence and how to reset your life as well as how to be a better creative professional.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so let&#8217;s talk about this book deal that you mentioned. The book&#8217;s coming out later this year, right?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes, that&#8217;s correct. In December 2023, my upcoming title, The Reset Workbook will come out with Spruce Books, which is an imprint of Penguin Random House.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Can you tell us a little bit about it?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, as much as you can. I mean, we want people to buy it, of course, but tell us a bit about it.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
The Reset Workbook is a guided journal that utilizes emotional intelligence to help readers discover their inner magic. It includes some original content created by me, lots of beautiful illustrations and really meaningful questions that help you on your self-reflection journey. I like to say that the book really came from my experience of having a total life reset.</p>
<p>In 2016, I went through a really intense breakup, and that breakup was profound for a number of reasons, but the reason that I think it changed my life is that it opened me up to the idea of going to therapy for the first time, and therapy for me was transformational. Reading books, journaling, creating new habits around how to be a healthier person all came through this experience, this transformational life experience, and I wanted to take the things that I learned along the way in that journey and build it into something that is meaningful and useful for people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So with that in mind, what do you want readers to take away from the book?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
The biggest thing that anyone should take from The Reset Workbook is that you can break free of unhelpful patterns and live with more passion and purpose. I like to think of this as a gateway for people that maybe aren&#8217;t used to journaling regularly, that want to do some internal reflection and some self-discovery and learn more about themselves. And for some people that end up purchasing the book, my hope is that this is your gateway to trying therapy. I know that in my past experience and especially with my family, the idea of going to therapy was controversial, and I&#8217;m trying to normalize the idea that mental health and mental wellness is important specifically in the Black community, in the LGBT community, and it&#8217;s a tool, a useful tool for us to grow and change and develop.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like a lot of conversations around therapy now are, I think they&#8217;re starting to become a lot more commonplace. I hear about it in videos and podcasts, et cetera. It&#8217;s starting to become, I should say, a pretty common talking point from what I hear that folks are like, &#8220;Are you in therapy? Are you going to therapy? You need to go to therapy,&#8221; that kind of thing. So it sounds like your book is going to help really facilitate that. That&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Oh, 100%. I feel like millennials we&#8217;re much more open to doing that deep reflection and understanding how we can grow and change. I still feel like there&#8217;s the opportunity for more people to explore therapy, and I am very thankful to be an advocate in this space, encouraging people to step outside their comfort zones and open themselves up to some new opportunities.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now the book comes out in December. Do you have some things that you&#8217;re doing leading up to that?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes, absolutely. Leading up to the book launch, I&#8217;m hosting a number of workshops and doing speaking engagements with the variety of organizations, and my hope is really to just spread inspirational stories, give encouragement and also to teach people how to make meaningful change in their lives.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about your overall work. You said something earlier about last year kind of being this pivot, and part of that was going into marketing and how this whole process of doing that with the book changed you, and it sounds like one of the outcomes of this was creating your own company, your media company called SoCurious. And you wear a lot of hats in that. You&#8217;re a creative consultant, you&#8217;re a speaker, you&#8217;re an author as you mentioned, you&#8217;re a coach. Tell me more about that transition.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yeah. I think so much of being a creative is learning how to wear many hats. For me, my creative journey started in advertising, and so I started as a graphic designer at an ad agency and was able to work my way up to being a creative director at an ad agency. That was an incredible experience, very, very stressful, very, very intense. But what was beautiful about it was that I learned how to become an incredible storyteller as well as have the capacity to work under intense pressure. It also was useful in learning how to manage teams and how to be an advocate for my employees. I feel like working in advertising was really my first step in learning emotional intelligence. So I transitioned from my position at the ad agency and started a job as a creative director for a tech company.</p>
<p>What was different about this experience was that it was much more of a marketing role, and so my focus instead of just coming up with the creative concepts, I did that as well as ran the ad campaigns or utilized agency partners to run ad campaigns and other freelancers, and it&#8217;s like the culmination of all these skills come together to kind of help me become the person that I am today, someone that loves storytelling, that loves to create, and that also loves marketing. And so I&#8217;m using all of those skills now trying to spread this idea that emotional intelligence matters and that we can reflect and grow and change.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like from the name of the company, curiosity is a big part of the work that you do.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes, 100% curiosity has followed me at every step of my journey. As a kid, I stayed in the library. I love reading books, and I as a child would just sit and read and read about anything that I could. Similarly, I feel like creativity has always been at the heart of the work that I do. So learning to draw as a young person, focusing my attention on learning skills like Photoshop and other animation programs, it&#8217;s all been a part of who I am as a person from the very start.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you mentioned with your time being a creative director in the advertising field, how that taught you certain skills with running a team, et cetera. What are some important lessons you&#8217;ve learned on this leg of your creative journey, creating this inspirational content for curious and thoughtful people?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yeah. I feel like we live in a time where people are overwhelmed by the amount of information that we get in the day, and specifically, we receive so much negative information in our day, primarily from the news, sometimes from our social feeds. It just comes from a variety of ways, and I wanted to focus my energy and my intention on creating positive content that encourages people. My focus with everything that I do is how can I give just a tiny little spark of joy to someone&#8217;s day and encourage them to think about the deeper questions of what it means to be a human being in this world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you&#8217;re currently in Austin, right? Austin, Texas?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes, that&#8217;s correct.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me what it&#8217;s like there for you. Are you tapped into the creative community there?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Now, I&#8217;ll tell you one thing that I am loving about my experience in Austin is that it is a wonderful city that has encouraged me to get outside and do things. I have never been an outdoor person at any point in my life, and I moved here and now I&#8217;m going on hikes and exploring new outdoor terrain in ways that I have never done. It&#8217;s actually pretty incredible. Another really great benefit of living in Austin for me is the people here are genuinely incredible, and I&#8217;ve been able to connect with a lot of like-minded Black creatives primarily that work in tech, but that also are doing their own set of interesting projects. And so being able to cultivate a community in a new city, I&#8217;ve only been here three years, it has been great, and I feel actually pretty proud that I was able to do that, especially with the constraints around living through the kind of strange and unusual times of the past few years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, the pandemic, I feel like really threw a wrench in a lot of people&#8217;s just general social activities, but we&#8217;re starting to get out there and do things again. I haven&#8217;t been to Austin since&#8230; God, when was the last time I was in Austin, Texas? It was for SXSW, I know that. It might have been. Yeah, that was the last time. It was 2015 was the last time. I was supposed to go in 2020. The company that I was working for at the time, we had a presence at SX [South By] and we were going to go, but then Coronavirus.</p>
<p>So then all of that got canceled and we were all waiting to see if it was going to happen. I already had my tickets and everything and then just all got canceled and shut down, so I need to try to make it back. Austin&#8217;s a lot of fun. It&#8217;s a lot of fun, especially during SXSW, but then there&#8217;s just so many folks and it&#8217;s just mad crowded. I think it came back last year. Right? Last year was the first time it was in person for a couple of years.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
It did come back last year. And you are 100% correct. It gets so crowded here in Austin during SXSW. It is packed, but definitely make your way down. You got to come back and enjoy some of this music and food and just some of these outdoor experiences I was telling you about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I need to come during the non-SXSW season. It&#8217;s a nice conference. I mean, I used to go really back in its heyday when it was really something, but now I&#8217;m just like, I&#8217;m old. There&#8217;s too many people. Like y&#8217;all need to. It&#8217;s a lot, but I need to come during the off season. So you&#8217;ve been in Austin for three years, that&#8217;s not where you&#8217;re from originally I would take it.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
No, I&#8217;m actually from Memphis, Tennessee originally. Grew up 901 proud, but I left when I turned 18 to go to college in New Orleans. I went to Loyola University, a Jesuit institution, and I ended up staying in New Orleans after I graduated for 16 years. And so New Orleans is one of those places that just is still very, very near and dear to my heart. I literally just got back from a wonderful one week vacation there where I got to catch up with all of my old friends.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to lie, I miss New Orleans. I miss New Orleans a lot, but I feel like a lot of the significant life changes occurred because I was confident enough to move away. Honestly, I feel like stepping outside of my comfort zone pushed me to become a better creative and encouraged me to push myself in some new and exciting ways.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, taking it back to Memphis for a second, I mean, you grew up there. You went to high school and everything there. Were you really a creative kid into design and illustration back then?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve always been a super creative person for sure. I learned to illustrate very, very young, and as a kid, my mom got us a computer. I think I was in the fourth or fifth grade, and that computer was incredible. I don&#8217;t know if you remember AOL days.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
We got that CD in the mail with AOL, and it opened my mind up because it went from, oh my gosh, my entire world is Memphis to, oh my gosh, my entire world is the world. And so way back then I started an email newsletter before email newsletters were a thing. It was called Iconoclast. That was the very first kind of side hustle project that I had as a little person sending out this monthly email about art. And so creativity, developing content and doing storytelling has been a big part of my life. In high school, my focus was really on visual art. I did a little bit of theater, but I feel like the computer was really their turning point because I loved Photoshop and building little tiny animations during that time period, too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you were a real pioneer back then, sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if I would&#8217;ve thought of myself as a pioneer, but I feel like the ideas around communication and media have always been central to my identity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So like you said, you ended up moving from Memphis, going to New Orleans, went to Loyola, like you said, studied graphic design, but then later after that you went to the University of New Orleans and that&#8217;s where you got your master&#8217;s degree. When you look back at those times, what do you remember the most? What stands out to you?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yeah. What I think is beautiful about the city of New Orleans is there are no barriers of entry. Every single person in this city is one degree of separation from the mayor probably.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Really?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
So if you have an idea, you can start it. There is nothing that will stop you from starting it. During my time in New Orleans, a lot of my core focus was on building brands around culture. So I ran an online magazine called InvadeNOLA for six years. That was a passion project of passion projects, and it kind of came from, there was an article in a local magazine that said that all these invaders had come and they were ruining New Orleans, and I was a transplant to the city that fell in love with the city.</p>
<p>I moved to New Orleans before Katrina. I of course evacuated but came back after Katrina and stayed, chose that place as my new home. And so I felt really passionately about the local culture as well as our capacity as transplants to create positive change. So I focused my content on the millennials living in the city, doing creative projects that were interesting, and I was able to build it into a pretty popular and successful organization, writing regular content, sending out lots of email newsletters and publishing a few printed books and magazine issues.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, look at that. So what&#8217;s you&#8217;re describing with InvadeNOLA&#8230; That&#8217;s what it was called? Invade New Orleans?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it sounds a lot like, and I don&#8217;t know if this even still exists, but do you remember, or does the phrase Not For Tourists sound familiar?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Not For Tourists had something like that in some major cities where they would&#8230; It was almost like a guide to that city in every city, almost like Frommer&#8217;s, which I guess is old school. I don&#8217;t know if they still make those, but they&#8217;re like these city guides, but it&#8217;s written by the people that lived there, the locals, so they can tell you what&#8217;s good, what&#8217;s bad, do this, don&#8217;t do that, that kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes. Actually, the book that I published during that time period was called The Invader&#8217;s Guide to New Orleans, which was a tourist guide for under the radar things to do in the City.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. So you were, again, another pioneer in publishing, email, books, magazines. And just to give a sense of when this is, so people know, this was what, mid 2000s?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes. This would&#8217;ve been, I think I started the publication in 2010.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Actually, it would&#8217;ve been 2009 to 2015-ish. That should be the right timeframe.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. All right. Yeah, no, that&#8217;s thinking of what all else was going along culturally during that time. So after you graduated, you&#8217;re big in this project, Invade was one of them. Another one that you created was called Venture Pop, right?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes. So actually as I decided that I wanted to step away from the event culture, I as the founder of Invade, I ended up having to do so many local events, and a part of it was that I wanted to cover it for the magazine. A part of it was because I had made all these great connections and friends and wanted to support them, but it was actually taxing, right? I was going out almost every single night, and that just was not a sustainable lifestyle, especially because even though I&#8217;m an extrovert, I need a lot of time to recuperate, and my favorite way to recuperate is through my creative practice.</p>
<p>And so I was like, I really want to lean into my creativity more, and it was just the perfect confluence of events. I went to a conference in Texas and ran into a woman that I knew from New Orleans at that conference, and we spent that weekend together going to all these really great speakers and seeing these really incredible workshops. I was so encouraged by that experience that I was like, we need to have this in New Orleans. And so I partnered with two women to start Venture Pop, and we successfully held three live conferences. They ended up being regional conferences that invited a lot of incredible creative talent to the city of New Orleans, and they were fun informational experiences that allowed people to grow in their creative journeys.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like there used to be this conference in Ohio in Cleveland called Weapons of Mass Creation Fest. It sounds like it was similar in scope to that where it&#8217;s not necessarily a design conference, it&#8217;s more like a creative conference, so it&#8217;s people of all kinds of creative stripes coming together and learning from each other and networking and fellowshipping and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes, that is 100% true. While my experience has been in graphic design and web design and then advertising, I think instead of having it focus on any one specific discipline, a big part of our goal with Venture Pop was to create experiences that allowed people to push their creativity to its limits, to learn new skills, to create new things. In many ways, we were kind of a part of that content creator movement that we&#8217;re living in right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In what way?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
I think in many ways we were bolstering the idea that in order to become an incredible creator, you have to find and define your own creative voice and share that message with the world. I feel like that actually encouraged me on my journey of having a public facing persona that spreads positive messages on the internet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve worked for some agencies as well. You alluded earlier that you were a creative director in the advertising industry, so you&#8217;ve worked for FSC Interactive, you worked for Springbox, you worked for Fragment Media Group, and we don&#8217;t have to spend a lot of time talking about them because that was in your past, but when you look back at those experiences, when you think about them, what did they kind of teach you that you really still carry with you to this day?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Through my time working in advertising, I had the opportunity to work with a variety of incredible clients in New Orleans. I actually was fortunate enough to do a rebranding of the City of New Orleans, the New Orleans Tourism Focus campaign where we did a full rebranding of the visual identity as well as creating commercials. I also had the opportunity to run the social channels for Visit New Orleans and here in Austin as a creative director, I worked with really awesome B2B clients, the most notable one, being Amazon Business.</p>
<p>As a full-time creative director, a lot of my focus was on how do you tell a compelling story through advertising and how do you communicate that information effectively? But the value of that experience more than anything is that it really exposed me to emotional intelligence. Naturally, I am kind of a chill guy. I have resting smiley face. I tend to be a little bit of a people pleaser. And so the experience of being a manager of people challenged me to learn about myself and grow. I had to recognize, understand, and manage my own emotions, but then I needed to also do that for other people, and that&#8217;s the heart of emotional intelligence. I really had to focus a lot on building my own self-awareness so that I was prepared for the relationship management that goes into managing a team of people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can imagine just in the advertising industry, having to do all of that on top of working with multiple clients and deadlines and changes, that&#8217;s a lot to pile on.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
It is so much hard work to create consistently under those circumstances, but it also is incredibly profound and awesome. I became a creative director, and this is crazy to say, because I saw the movie Boomerang. Have you seen this movie with Eddie Murphy?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Of course. Of course. Of course. It has been a constant&#8230; I mean, for me, it&#8217;s been a constant inspiration, but there&#8217;s so many people I&#8217;ve had on the show, and I plan to write an article about this one day about the impact of that movie in the Black creative industry. But no, go ahead. Go ahead, go on.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Well, I mean, on rewatching, it&#8217;s incredibly problematic for a number of reasons. But eight-year-old Justin saw Boomerang, and I knew that I wanted to be a creative director before I knew what a creative director actually did for a living. I only knew if I can learn how to do the art for commercials, I can become a leader of teams. And so it put that bug in my ear that it was possible for someone like me, a Black man in America, to be able to lead advertising campaigns for big companies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But of course not to be a Marcus Graham type.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
I am definitely not a Marcus Graham type at all, but it was such an influential movie because it just exposed me to the idea that that was even possible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. How have you seen the creative industry evolve over the years?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
I feel like the biggest thing that has shifted and changed is the way that we disseminate information. I feel like early in my career, it was heavily focused on TV commercials. TV commercials, and print media were at their height when I graduated school in 2007, and then by 2008, the magazine industry was essentially shuddering because of the proliferation of internet media, new blogs, as well as the introduction of social media. So early in my career, I was like, there&#8217;s something special about social media, and I worked to be a part of that early on. So I&#8217;m signing up for all the services, making sure that I&#8217;m regularly posting content, and made that a big part of how I grew InvadeNOLA and how we worked with Venture Pop. I think the biggest change that we&#8217;ve seen over the course of the past few years is that it went from very few voices being able to control the narrative, to now it&#8217;s literally endless voices controlling the narrative.</p>
<p>Now, with that, I feel like there are some interesting challenges that have popped up. And so for example, when you look at how Instagram was five or six years ago versus how Instagram is now, not many people see the content that an individual produces. It&#8217;s just like, you can have, like me, nearly 10,000 followers and you&#8217;ll have a video that only a hundred people actually get to see. That is insane to me. It kind of takes away from the beauty of that platform, but I feel as though there is still this democratization of information, and in many ways it feels like everyone can have a voice and share their message to the world, even if it is being slightly dampened by these kind of changing norms on the platforms.</p>

First of all, let me step back from what I was about to say. I hate how these different creative fields have been condensed into the term content creator. I hate that so much, but I say all that to say I see so many creators, and by creators I do mean podcasters, folks that make TikTok videos, et cetera, expressly saying that they&#8217;re doing what they&#8217;re doing or that the pitch that they&#8217;re doing for their audience is to appease the algorithm.</p>
<p>If you watch YouTube videos, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Make sure you subscribe and hit the bell to get notifications,&#8221; or if you&#8217;re on TikTok, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Could you please comment? Because I&#8217;ve been shadow banned.&#8221; It absolutely sucks how telecommunications has evolved to the point where we can take a message, broadcast it across the world, and yet we&#8217;re still beholden to these weird algorithmic things to get the message out to people. I mean, I understand it. I just don&#8217;t like it.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yeah. I think at the heart of that is we are always in a consistent battle between humanity and technology. I think as we continue to develop and grow, I&#8217;m obsessed with artificial intelligence right now, partially because I think it has the potential to upend the creative industry in many ways. But the only solace that I have is that people want to connect with people. They don&#8217;t want just information. And so it&#8217;s how can I be a real human being that shares parts of myself with the world as a way to connect with the people in my audience?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What I&#8217;m starting to see now, especially on some of these platforms that people have built, I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily say built content on, but certainly have built a following off of are starting to erode. Facebook ain&#8217;t what it used to be. Twitter for damn sure ain&#8217;t what it used to be. And so now people are having to go back to email, hey, there you go, go back to email or live events or other ways to try to connect with folks, because as you said earlier, there&#8217;s just so much information out there and it&#8217;s hard, I think, for people to try to really, I don&#8217;t know, grasp all of that, but I also think a lot of that information is pushed to us. There&#8217;s certainly information that we go out there and see and obtain on our own, but so much of information&#8230; I don&#8217;t even want to say gathering. A lot of stuff is just pushed to us.</p>
<p>I think I noticed this particularly this year. I mean, it&#8217;s not a new phenomenon, but I&#8217;ve started turning off my phone on Sundays. Saturday night before I go to bed, turn my phone off, I turn it back on Monday morning when I wake up, and that Sunday is so peaceful. I get stuff done, I cook, I catch up on a show. It is so peaceful. But it reminds me of how much information is constantly pushed to you and notifications and Twitter feeds and Instagram feeds, and so much stuff is coming at you in a way where you&#8217;re like, it&#8217;s relentless. You&#8217;re kind of bombarded with it.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes. I feel like so many of us are addicted to doomscrolling, sitting on our couches and just absorbing information, absorbing information, absorbing information. I feel like so many of us actually need opportunities to create, and I tend to believe that everyone is creative. Sometimes that can be a controversial statement because many people are like, oh, I&#8217;m not creative. I work in accounting, or I work in tech and I don&#8217;t know how to be creative. But to me, creativity is using the skills that you have to come up with interesting solutions for problems. You can be creative while cooking or cleaning your home, or you can do it in the traditional forms like writing or illustrating or simply doing tiny doodles on the edges of your notebooks. That creativity is the impulse that I think we need to bolster in order to have a more beautiful world. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m doing the work that I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I imagine you&#8217;re also going to continue to explore that in the book that&#8217;s coming out.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Absolutely. Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
See how I tie that together? See how?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
I feel like so much of why I published The Reset Workbook was around how can we go through these life changes that we&#8217;ve had and come out of the other side with hope and inspiration. I think it&#8217;s really about pushing people to find new inspirations, pushing people to step outside their comfort zone, and really it&#8217;s focused on how can you design a life that you love.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve mentioned though a lot of your journey as a creative and even I think growing up and always being into drawing an illustration how that&#8217;s really shaped your current path. What do you find to be the most rewarding part about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
The most rewarding part of what I do in my career and in my communications online is that I&#8217;m able to connect with real human beings by sharing parts of my story with the world. There is nothing more profound or interesting to me than to say something that feels like is totally niche and just me and have somebody connect with that on a really, really deep level and reach out to me via DM and message me saying, &#8220;Oh my God, you mentioned that you love Christmas movies on the Hallmark Channel because you can fall asleep during them and wake up and still know what was happening.&#8221; I always do that. That&#8217;s why I love them so much.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like that kind of direct connection with people is just so profound and interesting to me. I would say though, the thing that is underscored throughout my career and specifically my persona online is that we are empowered to change our lives as frequently as we want. We can all have resets whenever we see fit. And I really want to underscore that idea that change is possible and it&#8217;s a good thing. It&#8217;s okay to embrace change, it&#8217;s okay to learn new things, and your life doesn&#8217;t have to be in total shambles to kind of need to reevaluate where you are in order to continue to be on a path of joy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of that, how do you stay creative and inspired in your work so you can keep on that path?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
I am incredibly disciplined when it comes to my creativity. I try to either write or draw every single day no matter what. I have been doing this for the majority of my career, and so it started very early on. I would wake up before work and spend one hour of just creating for creativity&#8217;s sake. That has continued for years and years and years. Now that I&#8217;m working for myself, I don&#8217;t have to wake up as early. I can wake up at 7:00 and kind of get going, but the very first thing that I do every day is I journal. While I&#8217;m drinking my coffee, I read a little bit, and then based on what I read, I either write a reflection on what I read or I will create a piece of art related to how I&#8217;m feeling that morning. And that practice has been transformational in that it allows me to come up with new ideas and it serves as kind of the impetus for the content that I ultimately post on my social feeds.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So for people that are listening and they aspire to become creative professionals like you, what you&#8217;re doing, what advice would you give to them?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
If you want to be a creative person, you have to invest in the actual activity of creating. That&#8217;s all. It&#8217;s really that simple. If I see myself as a writer, all I have to do is write and I am a writer. The hard part is you have to figure out how writing fits into your schedule. We all are busy, busier than we&#8217;ve ever been and everything in our life is competing with our creativity. In order to commit to your creativity, you have to be willing to practice. And so that practice should be daily. If you can&#8217;t do daily, it should be every other day. If you can&#8217;t do every other day, it should be once a week. If you can&#8217;t do every week, it should be once a month. But the more that you flex those muscles and commit to practicing, the better you get. A part of getting better in my journey, at least, it&#8217;s being confident enough to share my work. And so you make regularly, you share regularly, and then through the course of that, you become the thing that you say that you&#8217;ve always wanted to be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like it&#8217;s just this continual process of working till you get to that point. I mean, I don&#8217;t want to say fake it till you make it, but you&#8217;re kind of continually pushing yourself forward towards that goal.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, it&#8217;s really a question of outcomes versus inputs. In many ways, when we&#8217;re setting a goal for our life, we always will focus only on the outcome of the goal as opposed to the things that we need to do in order to achieve the goal. And so following that same realm of as a creative professional or as a person that aspires to be, in this case, a visual artist, how do I become a visual artist? Well, the only way that you become a visual artist is by painting every day. When you paint every day, suddenly you are a visual artist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It kind of sounds a little bit like the old, well, it&#8217;s not old, but the whole 10,000 hours thing that sometimes gets kind of tossed around. You have to do something continually to kind of build up to that.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Yes, yes. I love that concept that if you&#8217;re willing to put 10,000 hours of effort into something, you will become an expert in that. It&#8217;s interesting because I don&#8217;t know that it&#8230; 10,000 hours seems arbitrary of course.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
It&#8217;s sticky. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so popular, but that&#8217;s arbitrary. I think it&#8217;s committing to daily practice, putting it out there regularly, and then through that process, growing and developing and changing. I feel like even over the course of my own career, I have had moments where I was creating things that I liked but I didn&#8217;t love, and I&#8217;m finally in a stage in my creative process where I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wait, the things that I make are pretty dope, and I came up with this myself. It came from my brain specifically.&#8221; That has not always been the case, but I think it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m willing to put in the daily effort to continue to maximize my skillset, find my own voice, and also to just regularly develop new takes on things that I&#8217;ve made before.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
At my core, I am an artist and I am a teacher. Those are the two most important parts of my year of intentional growth, and so my focus is to continue to make great content to come out with a bestselling book, The Reset Workbook coming out in December, 2023. And I want to continue to teach both through workshops and through speaking engagements where I can help people amplify their lives, find joy, find peace, and encourage people to step into building their own version of happy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, your work? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
You can find me online on most platforms at justinmadethat or at Justin Shiels, but the best way to connect is really to visit socurious.co. That&#8217;s socurious.co. From there, you can see many of the articles that I&#8217;ve written and you can sign up for my newsletter that I&#8217;ve been sending out since 2019 called The Weekly Reset. It helps people live a more intentional life, and it kind of pairs my personal philosophy with illustrations that I&#8217;ve created that give you a little bit of a pep talk during the week.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And the man writes some email newsletters. He&#8217;s been doing it since he was a teenager, so you know it&#8217;s good. You know it&#8217;s good. Justin Shiels, I just want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you for just sharing your authenticity. I mean, I can really sense and feel the passion that you have for this behind your work, and I think that certainly in this time that we&#8217;re in, I&#8217;m sort of waving my arms about here, but with all the stuff that&#8217;s going on in the world right now, it&#8217;s good to have some sort of a way to know that while things may feel out of control, at the end of the day, what you can control is how you react to them. So whether that&#8217;s having that life reset or breaking unhealthy patterns, I think it&#8217;s really important to always know that, and I&#8217;m glad that the work that you&#8217;re doing is helping to get that message out to more people. Thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Justin Shiels:</b><br>
Maurice, thank you so much. I really appreciate this opportunity.</p>

<p>Summer is here, and with the start of a new month, I&#8217;m bringing you my conversation with Treavor Wagoner, senior product designer, author, and quite the avid traveler! We spoke just as Treavor wrapped up his latest trip and right before the launch of the ebook version of his latest book, <a href="https://treavorwagoner.com/books/somuchtrouble" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">&#8220;So Much Trouble&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>Treavor talked about what drew him to working at Redfin, and from there he spoke about life growing up in a small Texas town. Treavor also went into his college days at University of North Texas, and shared how his love of writing drew him to teaching himself HTML and CSS. We also touched on a number of different topics after that, including how he&#8217;s unlearning harmful habits and how his non-linear career path has allowed him to indulge in a lot of his personal passions. According to Treavor, being Black and queer in tech is hard, but navigating it is possible &#8212; keep going!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Hi, my name is Treavor Wagoner. My pronouns are he/him, and I am a system designer by day, and then a seeker, traveler by the rest of my life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2022 been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
I would say it&#8217;s been going pretty well. I moved back to Austin to kind of start going after my dreams. It&#8217;s been going well so far. Well, it&#8217;s been kind of going well so far. I just adopted a dog and so it&#8217;s a little bit of a harrowing experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. What kind of dog?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
So he&#8217;s a mutt, but we just got back his DNA results and he is German shepherd, Australian cattle dog, Shih Tzu, and a small poodle mix.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That is quite a mix.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Yeah, a lot of energy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can imagine. Yeah. Aside from the new dog, do you have any kind of plans for the summer I saw on Twitter, you mentioned that you&#8217;re touring US national parks. Is that still going on?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
No, actually, I did that last year, so that kind of ties into what I&#8217;m back in Austin for. But last year I did a seven month road trip around the west and where I was seeing national parks, as well as seeing friends who hadn&#8217;t seen in years because of the pandemic. And then also kind of keeping an eye out for land to buy or a house to buy or whatnot because Texas prices have gone up so wildly, so it&#8217;s been kind of difficult to find places to live. But I moved back to Austin to kind of reassess, save money, just prepare for the next five years of my life. But as far as this summer, no big plans. I think it&#8217;s just beat out the heat here in Texas, train my dog, take care of my dog and hang out with my friends who live here while I can.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Now you were there for South By this year. This was sort of the first year back, I think, after two years, roughly of sort of remote South by Southwest. Did you notice like a big change in the city with South By coming back?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Typically, before or BC, before COVID, South By would shut down the whole city and all the local residents would leave or just stay in the house until South by went away. But this year, it was very quiet. It was a slow ease back into city shutdown. Typically, when South By is going on, you can&#8217;t go downtown, can&#8217;t find a parking space to save your life. But I went down to downtown once or twice and it was like any other day, to be honest. No streets were shut down as far as I saw. So yeah. I mean, I didn&#8217;t really participate in South By, but just because I didn&#8217;t want to deal with crowds and COVID and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you live there, so what&#8217;s the draw?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Exactly. But the thing about South By which a lot of people don&#8217;t really realize is that you have South By film, music and all the other treks associated with South By, but there&#8217;s also a lot of free shows or peripheral shows that are happening that you can go to, parties and things like that. Restaurants and local vendors are doing cool things for all the traffic, all the South By people coming into town. So yeah, I mean, that stuff is fun, but like I said, dealing with traffic and parking, all that stuff kind of is a drain sometimes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So currently I see you&#8217;re working as a senior product designer at Redfin. Tell me about that. What drew you to the company?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Actually, I didn&#8217;t see it for Redfin initially. So I was the former head of design. Colin Gregson reached out to me on LinkedIn and he was like, &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to start up the design system at Redfin and we need someone like you.&#8221; I guess he had heard about what I did with Indeed. And he wanted to kind of do the same with Redfin, but at the time I wasn&#8217;t really looking for a job. I wasn&#8217;t working at the time. I was actually taking a break. I was on another sabbatical. I had just left a company where I had experienced racial discrimination and was taking some time to heal from all of that.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
And I let him know. I was like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m not feeling it right now. I&#8217;m not feeling it right now. I&#8217;m healing from that. I&#8217;m dealing with COVID.&#8221; I mean, I didn&#8217;t catch COVID, but the pandemic was fresh and new. This was like March 2020.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Yeah. So I was like, &#8220;Uh-uh (negative), I&#8217;m not.&#8221; It was at a time where I was once again, wondering if I wanted to stick with the tech industry or just, I don&#8217;t know, do something else, but I&#8217;m a completist and obviously I decided to stick with it and he kept reaching out a couple of times to see how I was doing, where I was at. I think that the next time that he reached out was around June 2020, and of course around that time, it was not a good time at all because of protests and police murders and things like that. Which again, just kind of reopened the bullshit that I had experienced. And I was just very frustrated and angry and jaded and bitter and old.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
I think it was around December is when I told him, &#8220;Hey, I feel that I can jump back in and actually provide or do what I&#8217;m here to do when it comes to systems design and really help you out.&#8221; So we began interviewing and all that stuff, and it was probably the best interviewing experience that I&#8217;ve ever had hands down. They really made me feel comfortable, and in the past, what I&#8217;ve experienced with interviewing as a black person is that people don&#8217;t really see it for you, or they don&#8217;t think that you actually have the expertise that you do have. And with Redfin, I just felt like they allowed me to present my work and the stuff that I consider to be my craft, the things that I study, things that I love to do, which is signing a system and they heard me out, and they loved it. And they were like, &#8220;Yeah, you&#8217;re the on.&#8221; And then they offered me a deal. And I was like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
The story of trauma doesn&#8217;t stop there. In Texas, we had the winter storm maybe a week before I was supposed to start.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, with the power grid and all that stuff, right?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Yeah. It was very bad. I was one of the unlucky few who did not have power or running water the whole time, and we&#8217;re talking single digits. Yeah. It was traumatizing. The whole time I was thinking, &#8220;Am I going to survive?&#8221; I&#8217;m checking in with friends and they&#8217;re telling me, I&#8217;m not going to say it here, but it&#8217;s pretty traumatic stuff that they experienced. We&#8217;re talking death and things like that. And I, like a crazy person who has experienced a lot of trauma in his life, I was like, &#8220;You know what? Sure, I can start a job following all that.&#8221; So I started the next week and I did it with a smile on my face, but definitely it was a mental wear down for me eventually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You know, I think we&#8217;re going to look back in the history books and just see how much repeated trauma and shit black people had to put up with that summer of 2020, because I got laid off right around that time, in May, around Memorial day. And I remember I didn&#8217;t really feel like going back and trying to jump into finding another job. I had just been at this place for two and a half years and I sort of wanted to take a break, but I felt extremely guilty about taking a break at a time when people were out protesting in the streets for such a worthy cause. And I&#8217;m like, I really need this rest, though. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to have another time in my professional career to actually be okay with staying still for a few months because we got severance and all that sort of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And what ended up happening, and I think a lot of black folks, again, during this time will mention this is that now you have this influx of companies that are not only pledging to do better in the face of all of this, but now all of a sudden I got work. I&#8217;m getting bombarded with offers and things to do and talking to companies internally about ways that they can change their DEI and all this sort of stuff. But then also being said, this is such a watershed moment, and do you think that this will continue? And I&#8217;m like, no, but also it&#8217;s not really up to me to do that because you, as the white people in power, it&#8217;s on y&#8217;all to continue this. It&#8217;s not on us. It&#8217;s not on the aggrieved to try to fix this. It&#8217;s on y&#8217;all. And of course now two years later, pretty much all of those promises have gone up in smoke.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Yeah, I think I would say with Redfin, you asked me about Redfin. I would say that I&#8217;ve really seen them try. Not trying to be the spokesperson for Redfin, because I don&#8217;t think I could do a good job at it, but I&#8217;m really impressed with how they&#8217;ve been leaders in the real estate industry of trying to do the right thing for not only black people, but marginalized individuals.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
They&#8217;ve removed crime stats. Because our researchers are amazing, they&#8217;ve removed crime stats from house listings or property listings because they found that the areas that see a lot of &#8220;crime&#8221; are over policed and are predominantly black or brown, it&#8217;s kind of skewed data that they&#8217;re getting. So why have that on there? It&#8217;s not clean data, it&#8217;s not representative of the actual neighborhood, so let&#8217;s remove that.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
And I think they&#8217;ve kind of put the pressure on other real estate companies to do the same as well. So that really impressed me. Not only have you cleaned up house, clean up your own house, but you&#8217;re also encouraging other people to clean up their houses too. I thought that was really great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I should mention, this whole conversation is not to bash your employer. So I don&#8217; want them to think that we&#8217;re going in on Redfin or anything.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Oh, no.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, but I think it&#8217;s just worth mentioning that during that time in particular, there were so many friends of mine I know that were finally getting more speaking gigs, getting more design gigs, more companies were hitting them up. They were getting more job offers and it&#8217;s kind of bittersweet because yeah, it&#8217;s great that you see what I&#8217;m able to offer, but this is what it had to take for that to happen? And for it to not even be a sustained thing, it&#8217;s just sort of this one spike, and then that&#8217;s that. It&#8217;s crazy.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting because it&#8217;s like, finally. For me, someone who&#8217;s been in the industry for almost 15+ years, who has been around a lot of designers who get awards and things like that, or whatever or just get a lot of recognition; it felt good to finally be recognized in some way, but it was also bittersweet because I&#8217;ve been here, I&#8217;ve been doing the dang thing. I&#8217;ve been doing a great job at it, and in a sense, it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re not really recognizing me, the work. You&#8217;re recognizing me, the black designer. I&#8217;m more than that. I do more than that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Or if anything, they&#8217;re kind of trying to maybe wallpaper over some corporate guilt.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, not to dwell too much on work or anything, but I&#8217;m curious what&#8217;s a typical day like for you at Redfin? What&#8217;s your day-to-day look like?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
So my title is product designer, but our design system team is very small. It&#8217;s just mainly me and my co-lead, who is a designer as well. So we don&#8217;t have a direct manager. We don&#8217;t have a product manager in our &#8220;pod.&#8221; We work with an engineering team, but they&#8217;re a separate team. They&#8217;re not actually a part of our team, but we work very closely together all the time. So my day-to-day is looking at roadmaps and kind of filling in for the product manager role. It&#8217;s also doing some design tasks as well, so designing components, researching systems, checking in with my co-lead to make sure that we&#8217;re on track to meet our goals for our MVP of the design system and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Sometimes we get questions from our design system customers, which are designers and engineers from the company. If I know the answer, which most of the time I don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll chime in and kind of help out wherever I can. So doing support, thinking about educating, how we&#8217;re going to educate our customers about the new system that we&#8217;re working on, checking in with our stakeholders as we&#8217;re building the design system, to make sure that we&#8217;re in alignment and we&#8217;re doing fulfilling business needs as well as our customer needs. And then also making sure our partners we work with to build the system are happy and aligned with us as well. It&#8217;s a lot of engagement. It&#8217;s a lot of communication, which for me as an introvert can be a little draining sometimes. But I would say that I have a pretty good self care regimen. I could do better, but I try my best.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I think especially throughout the pandemic, we&#8217;re all just trying to hold on. Especially with all these other things that are happening out in the world that are not pandemic related that are still compounding stress. I don&#8217;t want to specifically give name to any tragedies, but for folks that are listening, they know what&#8217;s going on right now in this time in the world. It&#8217;s heavy, it&#8217;s heavy.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
It&#8217;s like a landmine. You&#8217;re just walking through this really beautiful field and you come across landmines here and there. Like you mentioned, not to name any tragedies that have happened, but there&#8217;s so many, so take your pick. But each one of those, it affects me. It affects me in some way. I&#8217;m an empath, so I see people hurting and I want to do something. I want to take the hurt away, but I can&#8217;t do anything about it. Yeah. I feel like the closest I can get is donating money, but even that feels like it&#8217;s not enough.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s switch gears here and learn more about you and your origin story. Like you mentioned, you&#8217;re in Austin, Texas right now. Is that where you grew up?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
I did not grow up in Austin. Austin was always this cool city, but I grew up near Waco, Texas. Which, if you&#8217;re not familiar with Waco for some reason, it is in the center of Texas, central Texas. I grew up in a very small town, maybe 15-20 minutes north of Waco. Very small town, we&#8217;re talking less than 900 people growing up. Yeah. I&#8217;m from the country. Right now, you&#8217;re probably not hearing my Texas accent, but it&#8217;s deep in there somewhere.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
At a certain point, my mother who at the time was a microbiologist, couldn&#8217;t find a job in the Waco area. She was also involved with the military. So we had our house in near Waco, but we also lived up in Arlington, Texas, which is in DFW. So we had a dual-residence type situation where we would live in Arlington throughout the week and then go down to the country on the weekends. So I had a city life and a country life at the same time, which I think hopping up and down I-35, sitting in a car for an hour and a half each way kind of yielded into me being a traveler when I got older, and just wanting to explore more of the world, more of our country.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
When I was at the age where I needed to start going to school, I started going to Christian private school in Arlington. It was non-denominational, so all walks of life were there. Catholic, baptist, Christian, Asian, black, white, Latino, et cetera. The neighborhood that we eventually settled in in Arlington was predominantly Hispanic, or at least it became predominantly Hispanic. And my babysitter who I went to hang out with after school was Hispanic, she was from south Texas and she taught me Spanish.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
So I was exposed to a lot of culture at a young age, but I was also from a small town, so I faced a lot of small town mindset, which is not being exposed to a lot of different cultures. So I was always met up with encountering people who did not realize that there&#8217;s a world outside of the small town, outside of where Walmart Super Center was the biggest thing, the happy place.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
So yeah, it was fun. It was interesting, but I eventually had to get out of there because I&#8217;m a queer person and it&#8217;s a small Texas town, so you can gather what that means for me. But I had to go find myself. I had to see what kind of life I could lead being a black queer person. And that&#8217;s where I ended up in Denton, Texas, going to UNT, or University of North Texas.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So before that, though, you started off at a community college at McLennan, was that in Waco or nearby Waco?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
It was in Waco. So I went at the same time. I&#8217;ve always been kind of an overachiever. I think it&#8217;s because of the private school education that I had. But while I was a, I think junior and senior at West High, which is in West comma Texas. We say West comma Texas because when we say West Texas people think Western Texas, and it&#8217;s a town called West. You may have heard of it. Speaking of tragedy, there was a fertilizer explosion that kind of almost demolished the whole town. It was around the time the Boston shooting happened in 2013, &#8217;14.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Yeah. Anyway, so I went to high school there, but at the same time I did dual credit, which is when you take government and economics and some other courses, you also get college credit for them. So the local community college that was doing that was McClennan community college. So I didn&#8217;t actually do full fall spring semesters. I did summer school, summer classes. And then I eventually went to, I transferred those credits to UNT. So I consider University of North Texas my full on college experience, and McClennan, or MCC was my kind of interim exposure to college.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Was that a big shift, going from a community college to a four year?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Yes. It was less of a big shift going from community college to a full on university and more of a big shift going from being very sheltered to just all of a sudden having no rules, no one to watch over me or keep me out of trouble or whatever. No one to keep me from figuring out what queerness is or my identity is. So yeah, it was a unique experience, I would say. It wasn&#8217;t something that I wasn&#8217;t used to, because I would say going from a private education to a public education was far more of a big shift, and that happened when I was in sixth grade, where all of a sudden you&#8217;re enforced to be very prim and proper, no cursing, to being in an environment where people are fighting, kids are fighting all over the place, cursing, having sex. Like, what did I get myself into?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It was a totally different world, it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
It was a totally different world. No offense to Mormons, but I felt like I was a Mormon kid actually going into the real world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Was your Rumspringa.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Yes. But at 12, 13. Looking back, it&#8217;s funny and hilarious, but at the time it was kind of scary. So I would say when I transitioned from graduating from high school and attending some community college courses or doing some community college courses to full on living in a dorm, being on a college campus, meeting people from different parts of the world, I would say that was very exciting for me. I just felt very free.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hear that you were dubbed &#8220;the guru&#8221; while you were there.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Yeah, that was a nickname that my manager at the time gave me. That&#8217;s funny. I started as a web designer, so I was designing blogs when I was in high school, and online blogs were my saving grace as a black queer person. I didn&#8217;t have any friends, really, in high school, so I would just write online and that was my escape. So in escaping to writing blogs, I started designing them and created a service out of that for other bloggers. So I would create their templates, their blog templates. I learned CSS from doing that, and I think a little bit of HTML at the same time, and also got to flex my creative muscle as well and creating color schemes and finding this rinky dink image creation software, editing software, and creating mass heads for blogs and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
But that led me into wanting to do that as for actually getting paid to do it. And so within a couple of months of being on campus in my freshman year, I found a job flyer for a web designer for the rec center on campus. And I kind of just begged my way into that job. They gave me the job and after about a year or so of doing that, the head of IT for the division that the rec center department was under saw my work, and he was like, &#8220;Hey, would you like to do this for the whole division?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;What does that entail?&#8221; He was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s like, you get to be the webmaster, web designer for 30 to 40 websites.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Okay, sure.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
He was grateful for it because it was cheap labor, but I think that was the first time that I learned how to be&#8230; Not learned how to be, but I think that&#8217;s where I adopted my skill as in what I call an octopus. Like I mentioned, I had to maintain design, develop 30, 40 sites and they all kind of looked the same, but they had all had to look the same because they reflected the division, not so much their department. So I guess in a sense, it was my first time working with multi-brand design systems, which is crazy, because I didn&#8217;t really make that connection until just now. Like oh, I&#8217;ve always been working on multi-brand design systems.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
But because I understood system thinking, even at that age, which was around, I think it was 20, 22, he called me guru. So I understood our process was important. It was almost necessary to maintain that many properties all at once. You have to have some semblance of organization. So he just saw my approach and the fact that I plastered this cubby hole wall that I had. I was working from the storage room because we didn&#8217;t have an office or a desk for me to work in. And so while I was in the storage room, I would just plaster all the walls with site maps and diagrams and whatever, just to keep myself organized with all these many different properties that I was maintaining.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So what was that early post-graduation career like?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Because I had already had a lot of experience under my belt already having been paid to do web design, salary wise, I was able to get a high wage for my first job out of college. It was hard because it was at the time where we were having the recession in 2010, so it was very hard to find a job. But once I got a job, I was able to get a high salary. And high salary at that time for me for a, I guess, relatively kind of new designer was $45K in Dallas area. Yeah. I felt like I was going from ravioli eating every night to having a luxury apartment overnight, it felt like. It was interesting. It was a little bit of adjustment, and I don&#8217;t think I quite found the balance. Eventually I was let go from that job, and I think that was pretty devastating to experience that. But it led me to creating my own business with my former partner, romantic partner, which was a bad idea.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Was that business Braver?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
It was, yeah. It was a combination of our names, but it was also a representative of the kind of work that we wanted to do, which was a traveling philanthropic, but also providing web development solutions to small businesses in the Dallas area. So yeah, and we were able to do that. We actually started our company cash positive, so that&#8217;s always been a great accomplishment of my own. It&#8217;s not something that people know about, but it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m really proud of, that I was able to do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;re also the co-founder and the executive director of a group called Black UX austin. Tell me about that, and what did you want to sort of get out of that group?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Oh my gosh. So going back to talking about leaving a company that I was working for, that I faced some racial discrimination, a researcher that I was working with at the time, Carmen Brunes, she&#8217;s also black as well, but she saw what I was going through and she was like, &#8220;You need a release. You&#8217;re way too talented to be treated this way. And I want to provide an outlet for you to do what you do best.&#8221; Two other researchers had started Black UX Austin before I even came along and they just had never been able to get it off the ground, and so she told me that she wanted to actually take it all the way.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
She wanted to be nationally recognized and be the one stop shop for black people wanting to get into tech, specifically in the Austin area, largely because black people in tech are usually the onlies in the company. That&#8217;s the typical experience, whether you&#8217;re the only black person on your team, in your organization, in your department. And so you may experience things that if someone like you was around, they would tell you &#8220;Girl, you&#8217;re going through some shit right now. They&#8217;re treating you badly. It&#8217;s gaslighting.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
So there wasn&#8217;t that community there before we came along. I don&#8217;t think there was that kind of community in Austin specifically, and if you&#8217;ve been to Austin, you know that it&#8217;s very white. There&#8217;s not that many black people here at all. It&#8217;s funny, because one of my best friends asked, I think he was asking someone else and I think one of his other friends had visited Austin and he was like, &#8220;Did you see any black people there?&#8221; And he was like, &#8220;No.&#8221; I told him, I was just joking, but I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m the only one here. I&#8217;m right here. You&#8217;re talking to the black people or the black community in Austin.&#8221; No, just kidding. There&#8217;s more than that of course, more than me.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Yeah. We started Black UX Austin as a means for black people in tech to have a community, to have a safe space, to not feel like you are being tone policed, to just let your hair down and just be yourself. We started right before the pandemic started and as we were reforming and making it kind of formalized COVID started. And so we were like, &#8220;Oh, crap.&#8221; So by that point, we had only had one in person event. And then we had to shift everything to be all virtual. And we got so good at it that other black organizations that were in and out of tech were like, &#8220;How are you guys doing this?&#8221; Because we got really good at it that people on LinkedIn, on maybe Instagram, too, or whatever were seeing what we were doing and were wanting to support.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
And these are not just black people, but also white people, organizations where they&#8217;ve seen or witnessed black people being oppressed or mistreated in some way. They just wanted to support. So there were other black organizations or organizations in general were just asking us, &#8220;How are you guys able to grow and thrive online as you&#8217;re doing?&#8221; Part of it was that I know a lot about creating online community, having been someone who grew up needing community when I was growing up in rural Texas and being the only very sensitive black person in probably a 20-30 mile radius. So I sought online community as much and as often as I could, and so I just learned from that and I think that has warmed its way into or carried its way up to now, which is providing community or safe spaces for other black people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I feel like I&#8217;m mentioning all these aside, but as I did my research, I saw that you&#8217;re a poet and you&#8217;re an author. Tell me about that, particularly about the impetus behind your latest book. Where did the drive come from for that?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
My gosh. So first of all, I don&#8217;t call myself a poet. I do write poetry, but I don&#8217;t feel that it fits me well. I call myself a writer. Poetry is not the only writing that I will do. I want to do more memoirs and things like that, but actually I didn&#8217;t get my degree in design or web design or anything like that. I got my degree in creative writing. I had started to pursue creative writing and communication design, which if you&#8217;re not familiar, communication design, at least at UNT, it encompasses advertising and graphic design. So not web design, but it is design or the visual aspect of design. And at the time, it was the closest thing that I could get to a design degree.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
And my minor is in computer education and cognitive systems, which translation, that means a couple of courses in installing Linux systems and some Adobe Photoshop courses. So yeah, that was the closest I could get to having a web design degree at that time, which was between 2006 and 2010. But eventually I ran out of financial aid and I just stuck with the English creative writing aspect of my life. So growing up, I&#8217;ve always had, I guess, an affinity for writing. I&#8217;ve always wanted to be a songwriter, and so I started writing songs at 12, just because I had seen one of my favorite songwriters, Mariah Carey. You may laugh, but she&#8217;s a great songwriter. Obviously we know a lot of our songs. I&#8217;ve always just written lyrical poems. Yeah. There&#8217;s a floppy disk somewhere in my storage somewhere of maybe 500 lyrical poems I had written when I was a kid.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Not a floppy disc. You got to get it off the floppy disk, man.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Yeah, I know. You know what, I think at some point I did translate them to modern digital at some point, so they&#8217;re probably somewhere on a hard drive somewhere maybe. But yeah, I don&#8217;t know if I want to revisit those, to be honest. They&#8217;re probably terrible. But yeah, while I was at UNT, I got my English degree and like I mentioned before, I had started my UX product design career. Product design is kind of like a jealous mistress when it comes to my other abilities, so my writing kind of had to be pushed to the side, but eventually I was approaching 30 and I was like, &#8220;What can I do very quickly that I can be proud of my twenties for?&#8221; And that was creating or writing a book.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
And so I self-published my first title, which is called The Remaining Trouble and Other Battles. And then during the pandemic, I kind of remixed it and expanded it and republished it as So Much Trouble. And in terms of writing, it&#8217;s probably the project that I&#8217;m most proud of, because the way I was able to produce it is how I envisioned it, and the quality is great in terms of design and writing. I was just very proud of it. I think all creatives should have something that they&#8217;re just absolutely proud of that they did. I feel like that&#8217;s very rare. Even if you do great work that other people admire, this level of self deprecation that designers have, or they don&#8217;t fully love the work that they do, even if it&#8217;s great. So I think that everybody should have that one project where they&#8217;re just like, &#8220;I absolutely love the shit out of this thing.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
So yeah, the book is about, it&#8217;s a book of poetry, a collection of poetry about based on a time in my life where I had experienced relationship trauma. What I aimed to do with the book was to really just tell a story of a black kid who didn&#8217;t know how, but just really wanted to be loved and to love. And I feel it&#8217;s intense at times, but I love how it came out and anyone who&#8217;s read it has told me the same.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now when I asked you earlier about what you wanted to discuss, you had told me a few things that I kind of want to unpack a little bit. You said navigating a box-based world as an odd shape. You said unlearning harmful habits, and you said self parenting. Talk to me about it. What&#8217;s on your heart?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
It&#8217;s very woo woo, and that&#8217;s kind of where I&#8217;m at in my mid-thirties right now. This is not the case for everybody, but for a few millennials, we&#8217;ve grown up in and seen some shit. We&#8217;ve grown up in a time where our parents told us one thing and the world is actually another. So there&#8217;s a great deal of, at least when you identify as black and queer or gay, and so those are two communities that have seen a lot of shit go down and who have experienced a lot of things, a lot of terrible things we&#8217;re talking. If you&#8217;re black, you know what we&#8217;ve been through, but in terms of the queer community, AIDS, I grew up during the AIDS epidemic/pandemic and the fallout, the religious fallout of that. People who are religious saying you&#8217;re going to hell because you got aids or because you&#8217;re gay or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
And just living in fear of identifying as gay and over time, I&#8217;ve learned to unlearn all of the survival tactics that I&#8217;ve had to learn growing up in rural Texas or growing up in Texas in general. Age 35, I&#8217;m trying to just radically authentically be myself and love myself and encourage other people to do the same. Not living under any guises, any false pretenses or anything like that. Just be yourself and love in that. I&#8217;m finding that it is yielding a great improvement in your health, in your physical health and your mental health as well. It&#8217;s really important to just be yourself. So that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m at.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
And I think you mentioned self parenting, I was talking to a friend of mine who is also a black queer person and he was like, &#8220;We need somebody to speak on the unique experience of being a black queer cis male and the relationship with our mothers.&#8221; My relationship with my mother has been very rocky. When I came out to her at 19, I wasn&#8217;t under her roof. She maybe would have disowned me completely, so I&#8217;m glad that I had the wherewithal and the knowledge to just wait until I was out of her house to tell her who I actually am.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
After that, I think we were even more distant than we were already, because I think moms know, but once you say the words, then they actually know, and there&#8217;s no denying it, and so I think that created a bigger rift between you, too. And so because of that, there were things that as a, what we call in the community &#8220;baby gay,&#8221; or somebody who&#8217;s fresh to the gay community, there are some things that I experienced that I really could have benefited from having a parent there or some kind of mentor or something to kind of guide me through all this newness, and I didn&#8217;t have that necessarily.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
So I had to learn how to self parent. I had to learn how to look at the seven year old, who was scared to be himself and say, &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing wrong with you.&#8221; To just learn to love myself. And I think that plays out in every aspect of my life, even my professional career. There are times where I deal with imposter syndrome or just being in spaces where I wasn&#8217;t previously, and now I all of a sudden am because of the great shift in thinking in the industry. I&#8217;m specifically talking about summer 2020, where all of a sudden the gates that I wasn&#8217;t allowed to enter through, all of a sudden I am, but I have no understanding of how this new arena plays out or how to be or anything like that. So I deal with imposter syndrome.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
And then you know what I do? The kid who just felt very ostracized, very on the outside of everything, on the outside of blackness, on the outside of queerness, just because I didn&#8217;t have access to it, that plays out. And so what ends up happening is when that little kid comes out, the 35 year old bubbles up and says, &#8220;You&#8217;re okay, I got you.&#8221; And that is essentially self parenting, basically being your own advocate and standing up for yourself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you think you&#8217;re still trying to find yourself?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
I think if you&#8217;re living, you should be, because we&#8217;re always changing. I identify as a seeker. I think it plays out in my travel habit. I&#8217;m usually traveling by myself, and I prefer it that way, largely because traveling is not vacation for me most of the time. It&#8217;s me thinking and writing in exotic places, in dirty places or whatever, what have you. Just being here, there and everywhere, just trying to learn about myself in different environments.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Also, I feel like growth happens when you&#8217;re out of your comfort zone, and so that&#8217;s why I do that. I want to learn as much as possible about myself. And I find it to be a common thing where people don&#8217;t want to do that either it&#8217;s from fear or they&#8217;re afraid of what they might find or lack of self confidence, which I totally understand. But I don&#8217;t want to live in fear in my life, so I put on a brave face and I go into the unknown. So, that&#8217;s me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like there was a lot of subtext in that inhale just then. But black person to black person, I felt that. I felt that. If you knew that you couldn&#8217;t fail in your professional life, what would you want to do? What would you want to try to do?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Oh my gosh. That&#8217;s related to the question of if you weren&#8217;t a designer, what would you be? And I would say if I weren&#8217;t a designer, I would probably be a professional entertainer, a singer or songwriter or something. Being a designer in the tech world, it can be very technical, very heady stuff. I find I want to flex my emotional muscle more. I try to do that as a system designer. As designers, we&#8217;re empathic anyway, or we have a lot of empathy. It&#8217;s just a part of the job, but it&#8217;s in a technical space most of the time, so you can&#8217;t really go too deep with it and understand fully what your empathic abilities are. But with creative careers like music or writing or even acting, you get to explore that more and understand humanity more or better. That&#8217;s what I would be.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
But if I were to stay in this hypothetical situation, if I were to stay within the tech industry, I think I&#8217;m close to what I dream of being. This is going to sound very nerdy, but hey, we&#8217;re all nerds here. Kind of like a special agent designer in the realm of design systems where I help teams adopt the design system, where I basically do the dirty work for them of taking the existing product and essentially almost creating kind of a new version of that product with the design system and basically going &#8220;bippity boppity boo,&#8221; over amount of time, taking what was old and crusty and putting some shine on it, making it golden, saving the day in that way. I&#8217;m almost there.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
A part of it is trying to get business to understand what design systems even are, and then also getting them to understand the pain point of a feature team adopting a design system and how hard and strenuous it is. So if there was someone like me or a team that I was a part of to go in and do that hard work for them and essentially save the day, get some happy smiles in there, make the business feel like their employees are happy just because somebody came in and helped them out, then that&#8217;s what I would love to do. I&#8217;m a person who, I don&#8217;t care about promotion. I don&#8217;t care about money. It&#8217;s more about how I make people feel. I want to help people. And if I can help people with their jobs, their day to day, that makes me feel good. That makes me feel like my job is rewarding. So yeah, that&#8217;s me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What career advice would you give to somebody, they&#8217;re listening to you talk, they&#8217;re listening to your story and they see that you&#8217;ve had this very, I think non-linear career path, is probably a good way to describe it. What career advice would you give to someone who is walking that same sort of path?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
There was advice that I&#8217;d gotten from design evangelist Steven Anderson, when I was, I guess, fresh out of college and at the height of being really unhappy with my first job out of college. He gave the advice of have fun with your career. And I&#8217;m going to expound on that and say, don&#8217;t just get a job get a craft, something that you can believe in, something that makes you happy and makes you joyful. It makes you want to wake up in the morning and get to it, jump into it. I&#8217;m so glad that design systems has become a thing, because when I wake up in the morning, I&#8217;m really excited to just jump in with design system stuff. I really geek out on it to the point where people don&#8217;t understand what the heck I&#8217;m talking about, because I&#8217;m speaking a different language, I&#8217;m speaking a systems&#8217; language, and they&#8217;re usually speaking a product language.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
But yeah, that&#8217;s what my advice would be is have fun with your career. I think something that we didn&#8217;t talk about really was at a certain point, I was a career contractor, so I was kind of like a handyman and that meant I was taking on jobs three months or six months at a time in Austin, Dallas, Seattle, or if I wasn&#8217;t anchored to a city, I was traveling full time around the country, doing things. At times, I was working from Costa Rica while I was backpacking and things like that. So yeah, I&#8217;ve always wanted to just not do things the typical way, and it has always made it fun. My favorite thing is to tell people things like that and to see their face is like, &#8220;Really? What?&#8221; Just shock people. So have fun with your career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
To that end, where do you see yourself in the next five years?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
I&#8217;m going to ask a clarifying question. Do you mean professionally or do you mean in my personal life?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean any way that you wish to take it.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
I was hoping you would say one or the other, because that would make it easier. But I&#8217;m in my mid-thirties and I&#8217;m thinking a lot about my personal life. I&#8217;ve given a lot of attention to my professional life up to this point, and like I mentioned before, product design or my design career has been like a jealous mistress of anything else that I try to focus on. So I had the great ability during my seven month road trip last year to kind of do both. I think about where I want to go from here or from that point, and also foster my design career. And I see myself retiring from design. I haven&#8217;t really told anybody that. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s feasible, but I would love to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Why don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s feasible?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
I think because I&#8217;m thinking very realistically, I&#8217;m looking at my finances and I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Okay, you want to do this and this and this and this and this and this. How are you going to pay for that? Oh, right. You have to have a job, Treavor. Come on. Get real.&#8221; So I would love to get to a point where design is not my only main means of income. I&#8217;ll say it that way, where it&#8217;s not my only means of income. Maybe I&#8217;m still doing design systems in some way, but it&#8217;s not the only thing that I&#8217;m doing. I&#8217;m finding balance. That&#8217;s where I want to be in five years, is maintaining a balance where I&#8217;m loving life still, I&#8217;m loving doing design systems or helping people with design systems, but I&#8217;m also creating a family.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
I feel like with my career, I haven&#8217;t fully been able to do that. I&#8217;ve been very much a career girl. So yeah. So to be able to kind of invest more in, like I mentioned before, the emotional side of myself and have family and people. I guess just foster more relationships. It&#8217;s kind of a long-winded answer, but that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m at. I&#8217;m kind of thinking on the spot a little bit, but that&#8217;s where I want to see myself in five years, is feeling balanced, full of joy, and loving what I do in terms of work. And I&#8217;m almost there. I feel like I&#8217;m almost there, and it feels really good to be almost there, whereas before it felt like it was a long time away.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you about your work? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Yeah. So you can find out more about my writing and my design@treavorwagoner.com. My name is spelled a little weird, I have some extra letters in there, so I&#8217;ll spell it for you. It&#8217;s T-R-E-A-V-O-R W-A-G-O-N-E-R.com, and you can go to my design page and you won&#8217;t have access to my portfolio, but you&#8217;ll see all the other nerdy things that I write about there as well. You can also follow me on Twitter @TreavorWagoner. That&#8217;s it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Treavor Wagoner, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I get the sense that you are someone that is at a crossroads right now. Usually when I give these post scripts, when I&#8217;m talking to the guests, I&#8217;m saying that you&#8217;re doing great work, which is not to say that you&#8217;re not doing great work, but I really feel this sense of tension within you, like you&#8217;re at a crossroads right now. I would be interested to see if in the next five years you fulfilled that balance that you&#8217;re seeking.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ve been seeking, living that persona for years, and as a seeker, you eventually find. And so that&#8217;s probably part of the tension, is the realization, I would say, as a seeker is that you realize what you&#8217;re looking for, you have already had. And so now that I&#8217;ve kind of realized that I&#8217;ve always had it, now I get to actually discover it more, what I already have, and enjoy it. That&#8217;s where I&#8217;m at.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How profound.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
I am a writer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Treavor Wagoner, thank you so much for coming on the show, man. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Treavor Wagoner:</b><br>
Thank you for having me. I appreciate it.</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
My name is Russell Toynes, and I am the creative director and owner at Studio Dzo. I&#8217;m also a design educator. I teach portfolio design at Austin Community College. And I am a core member of AAGD, which is African American Graphic Designers. And I&#8217;m a mentor to a lot of either previous students or folks that wish they were a student of mine.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I&#8217;m also a dad and a husband, but those things, those are all day, every day. And those are some of the best things that I do. We&#8217;ll see. We should ask them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s 2022 been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
2022 has been good. We&#8217;re actually really excited. 2021 was a banner year for us, and 2022 is exactly the same. Our books are full, and the work just keeps coming in, and we have a good team. We had a little bit of an upset in 2021 where we had some folks get, what&#8217;s that bug that they caught? The great resignation?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Some of them got some of that, you know? And so that left us in a little bit of a bind. So we had two new team members start in January, and so we&#8217;re still training them. So it&#8217;s a little challenging with that, with some new team members, but 2022 is starting out great for us.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything in particular that you really want to try to accomplish this year?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Really, we have a good processes, but I always want to get right and tight, right? So I really, really am looking at how do we streamline our business? My goal&#8230; Well, with the pandemic, we&#8217;re really&#8230; Before pandemic, we had a studio on East Sixth Street and it was great. We were there for three or four years, and we just moved into a new place. We did a $10,000 build out. We moved into a new place on South Lamar on February 17th on 2020. And then March 17th, 2020, we said everybody, &#8220;Hey, so this thing&#8217;s going on. We&#8217;re going to send you home. You&#8217;re going to work from home and we&#8217;ll check in every week or two, and we&#8217;ll figure out when we&#8217;re going to come back.&#8221; We were really naive, right? We just didn&#8217;t know. And I was scared. And we have a little blog on our website.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so, I just wrote a blog of just like a cathartic, being a small business owner during a pandemic is fucking scary. And so, I wrote this blog post just talking about like my biggest thing was just thinking about, not only do I have to keep food on my table, but I got to keep food on five other people&#8217;s tables also. And so, not knowing what that was going to look like was really scary.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But what I realized was when we were in the studio, we were really locally focused. We did some state, some things outside of Austin. Lots of things outside of Austin, but lots of things in other states, Oregon, and Pennsylvania, and Arizona, and places like that. But we were really just thinking, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re Austin, we&#8217;re Texas.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
When we went remote, all of a sudden opportunities just started just coming in different directions. And now, we really see ourselves as global. We have done work in Singapore, we have done work all over the United States. We have partners all over the world. So really, thinking about&#8230; we just wrapped up a project in Canada&#8230; just thinking about what we have done in the last year, it&#8217;s amazing that when we opened our minds up to thinking beyond our local borders, what we&#8217;ve accomplished.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so, really 2022 is just about, how do we keep this momentum? How do we move forward and continue to have a global presence?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s really good to hear. I mean, the pandemic, it&#8217;s changed business for so many people. I mean, I&#8217;ve talked to several studio owners, big and small, that have all had to really adjust because they weren&#8217;t able to come together physically in an office like they did before. I mean, for the team, was it a big shift to make that change?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Yes. So, we have team members of various ages. So we have seven team members. Seven in total. So me and my wife, and then we have five other team members. And they&#8217;re all employees of ours, but we call them team members because I don&#8217;t like the idea of people being an employee.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So they&#8217;re all in different places in life. Some have families, some are single, some have partners. And so obviously, the pandemic hit everybody. So if you&#8217;re a family person and you have a spouse at home and children, they&#8217;re all affected. And so, that changed a lot for our team member in particular who has kids. It&#8217;s just, how do you work when his escape was getting in the car, driving to the studio, spending six to eight hours there and driving back, and having that decompression time and that transitional period?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And now it&#8217;s get up, feed, clothe, put them in front of whatever Zoom classes they have, then get in front of his work Zoom and do work. And then their kids, they&#8217;re various ages. And so, that was the biggest challenge. Our big thing was, we wanted to focus on their mental health. We wanted to make sure that they had the freedom to take whatever time they needed just to process what the hell was going on. Because for all of us, we just didn&#8217;t know. It was scary.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Especially in the very beginning when we just didn&#8217;t know what it was, but people were getting sick and people were dying. As time went on, the adaptations change. It went from, &#8220;Okay, let me just figure out just how to keep people, my team healthy and somewhat productive,&#8221; to this, &#8220;Okay, we can&#8217;t talk about going back. We got to talk about moving forward.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so, it was like, &#8220;What do you need to be effective? What do you need to be efficient?&#8221; So, the team came back to the studio, we gave them their desk, their sit-stand desk. Then we got everybody&#8230; Our designers have desktops. Actually, almost everybody had desktops. And so, we were like, &#8220;Look, we can&#8217;t say you work remote, but then basically chain you to a desk.&#8221; So we got everybody all new laptops, and we were like, &#8220;Look, we don&#8217;t know what this is going to look like, but you have the freedom to work from wherever you&#8217;re at. So if you want to travel somewhere, you can work from there. As long as you&#8217;re able to be productive, work however you want to.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so, for us, we really just had to figure out what was going to work now that we were in the long haul for this. So really it was just changing our work model. So changing it from in the studio to being remote. But then also from a clock in, clock out like you had in the studio where people come in and they&#8217;re expected to be in at 9:00, expect to stay till 5:00, and you had a good culture there. Where now it&#8217;s like, &#8220;We have to go to dentists, we have to get our car inspected. We have to do all the things while being at home.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So we switched to this get it done model, where it&#8217;s like, you know what you need to do. Monday, Wednesday, Friday, first thing in the morning, we talk about what we need to do and then you just go do it, however you&#8217;re going to get it done. So if you want to take out in the middle of the day to hang out with the kids, cool. You know what needs to be done when it needs to be done. I don&#8217;t need to babysit you.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so that&#8217;s worked out really, really well, both for my wife and I, Elizabeth, because sometimes we&#8217;re just not feeling like sitting in front of a desk. And so, we can sit with our laptop. And plus, we can do a lot of our work via our phone if we&#8217;re just calling or setting up meetings or reviewing work. So for us, this whole get it done model has really helped us all tackle life&#8217;s responsibilities along with work responsibilities.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, it sounds like you and the team are really able to make a agile shift pretty quickly. Do you think that was just because of your tight-knit nature of the team? What do you really attribute to that?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I was a creative&#8230; Oh sorry, I was art director at Dell for five and a half years, and I learned quite a bit of what to do and what not to do. And so, very, very quickly I knew that I wanted everything that we did to be cloud based. And so, I didn&#8217;t want the opportunity for someone to have anything on their local drive that we needed, or for a laptop to get stolen and work that I had paid for over months for them to do got lost.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So we were already very equipped to work remotely, because everything was already backed up to the cloud constantly through Google File Stream. And we had been using all the Google suites. So everything from the calendars, to email, to everything. So we were already well-equipped to just work from devices, whether that be iPads, phones, or computers, or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I think being that we&#8217;re a small team and it was seven of us, I think that allowed us to be nimble. And we&#8217;ve always prided ourselves on being nimble and being able to fail quickly. So we&#8217;ll try something. If it doesn&#8217;t work, let&#8217;s adapt. But honestly, I attribute it to having just a damn good team who really has a lot of faith in Elizabeth and I to just guide them. And they&#8217;ll follow us in whatever direction we ask them to.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And we have an open-door policy. We ask people, there&#8217;s no hierarchy other than the fact that I&#8217;m responsible for making sure they get paid and everything. Everyone has the opportunity to make a suggestion. Everybody has the opportunity to talk to me or Elizabeth and say, &#8220;Hey, this isn&#8217;t working, or this could be better, or I ain&#8217;t dealing with something.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And unfortunately, during the pandemic, things happen. People die. Maybe it&#8217;s pandemic related, maybe it&#8217;s not. And we have to be adaptive to that. And so, we can&#8217;t just sit there and go, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re running a business here, sorry.&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;No, we&#8217;ll figure it out. We&#8217;ll make it work.&#8221; And we just have a killer team that just everybody has everybody&#8217;s back. So it really has helped us move, and shift, and be nimble during this time of uncertainty.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you talked about going from being more locally focused with your client base to now having this global reach. What are the best types of clients for you to work with?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So we work with architects, interior designers, and developers, and business owners. We work with everybody, but those are the best. Our ideal client&#8230; We don&#8217;t call our clients, clients. We call them partners, because this is a partnership. We have to work together. I don&#8217;t work for anybody. And so, we are working together to meet a goal and to create an experience. And so for us, we love working with interior designers because, A, they know the budget, and they&#8217;re realistic.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
They&#8217;re not developers who have a stake in how much money the project makes. And they&#8217;re not designers who are like, &#8220;Oh, I think I know how to design a sign or an installation,&#8221; and they have no idea. So when we work with&#8230; And architects are good, but architects always hire interior designers, and interior designers love us and we love them. So, they have a vision. We bring their visions either to life, or we just&#8230; They say, &#8220;This is an area that we don&#8217;t know what to do, but that&#8217;s where we call you.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so, interior designers are great. So we work with lots of different agencies that have wonderful, talented interior designers who rely on us to do what we do well. And the crazy thing is, is maybe it&#8217;s the same in design, I don&#8217;t know, but there&#8217;s a lot of turnover. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s just like, they go to a place, they&#8217;re there for a year. And then they want to just go to somewhere else or they move or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So like pollinating, we make great relationships with one studio and then five of their interior designers over the course of a year or two go to five different other places. And then those five other places call us too. And next thing you know, we got 15, 20 interior design agencies all around the United States and whatnot that are calling us for project after project. So, I love them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I like that spread effect like that. I mean, I think you mentioned the great resignation a couple of times now. It&#8217;s interesting how because the pandemic has forced a lot of people to now work from home or work from remote locations, that a lot of companies before are just having to open themselves up to talent from a lot of other places.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so, I think that can be both good and bad. Of course, for the company, I could see the downside of it because now that they&#8217;re working with employees from other states, they&#8217;ve got to think about, &#8220;Well, can we legally hire people in this state and what does that mean?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Exactly. That&#8217;s my wife. We had a team member in Atlanta, and she jumped through so many hoops with the comptroller there in Atlanta to just get this person to where we can offer them insurance and everything else. Yeah, it&#8217;s a huge undertaking when you bring on somebody outside of your state, and it&#8217;s a new state that you haven&#8217;t been in already.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And then for the worker, it can be easy because now so many gigs that before were just landlocked to a certain city, now you can work from everywhere. I&#8217;ve been working, personally I&#8217;ve been working remotely since 2009. And like you, when I had&#8230; I had a studio for nine years, from 2009 to 2017. And we did some work locally. We did a lot of national work, some international work. But I&#8217;d say for the past two years now, on and off for the past two years, I&#8217;ve mostly been working internationally. It&#8217;s worked out that I can now take my skills and I can work in Amsterdam. I can work in Paris, which is where my current job is headquartered at.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So how do you deal with the time difference?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Not well.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I was going to say. I went to Hawaii. I went to Hawaii in January and I didn&#8217;t think that was going to mess me up. But boy, did it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Not well. I mean, so when I worked for the company in Amsterdam, I think it was a six hour time difference, five to six hour time difference. Because you know, daylight savings time eventually creeps in. But it was rough because by the time I&#8217;d start in the morning, it would be in the afternoon there. There would be some times I would have to be up at 4:00 AM for a meeting. And thank God they were not anal about having the camera on with anything. So I could just be halfway in bed on Zoom, like, &#8220;Yeah, yeah, whatever.&#8221; For the current job, it&#8217;s not that bad because we&#8217;re split. Where my time zone is, eastern time zone is sort of split between where the company is. So we&#8217;re between San Francisco and Paris.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So in the morning I work with the Europeans. My boss is in London. And then in the afternoon I&#8217;m working with more of the creative team that&#8217;s here in the US that are in California. So my day is split in that way. We do a lot, a lot of async communication just to pass the baton back and forth. But it can be brutal sometimes. Sometimes I am working a 12-hour day from 5:00 to 5:00. Sometimes. Not all the time, but sometimes it happens, and it&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
That&#8217;s our goal. That&#8217;s our goal is&#8230; My wife and I, I have a 20-year-old daughter, and so she&#8217;s very much into living her own life. That&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been trying to adjust to. But we have aspirations to basically be digital nomads. And really set up our team to where we can&#8230; We have aspirations to make either a home or a temporary home in Portugal.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so, it&#8217;s the idea of, how do we do this? What would it look like? What time would we get up? What time would we be on? What time would we be off? And really just thinking about that. And we haven&#8217;t really put it to the test. The pandemic hasn&#8217;t really given us the comfort that we want to travel. Hawaii, like I mentioned, they had a really good COVID response.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So, you have to have your vaccination, you have to have a 72-hour negative COVID test. You got to have everything right and tight or they won&#8217;t even let you on the island. And so we felt comfortable with&#8230; That was a trip we&#8217;ve been planning since 2019 for my daughter&#8217;s graduation. So, we did go to Florida during Delta. And so, we&#8217;re big Disney fans for the service and the attention to detail. And so we go to Disney World as much as possible. And we went in 2020&#8230; Or 2021, August. And that was not a vacation.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
That was like going to a neighborhood you know you don&#8217;t want to be in. It was like that. It was just, head was on a swivel. Everybody, I mean, Disney did a good job, but people do what people do. And so, people weren&#8217;t wearing their masks right. People were just being too close and all that. But it was really dead there. The crowds were nothing like they would normally be.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So, we made the best of the trip, but now we&#8217;re trying to get back to the swing of things. And we want to travel more and see what it&#8217;s like to work in foreign places and make that adjustment. So I envy you. I might have to call you up and get some tips on how to adjust with jet lag.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I do a lot of&#8230; It&#8217;s a lot of async communication. It&#8217;s a lot of scheduled emails. It&#8217;s a lot of, at least for me, and I don&#8217;t know if this is probably just like a general tactic, but I do a lot of managing up. So, I have a manager, but then I also manage someone. So for my manager, I give regular, regular updates like, &#8220;I just did this. This is what I&#8217;m working on now.&#8221; Because we may only get&#8230; Our schedules only overlap for 30 minutes a day. So we don&#8217;t have a ton of time to really get together and talk.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m always letting him know, &#8220;This is what I have to do. This is what I&#8217;m working on. This is where I have a blocker or something like that.&#8221; And so then he can work on those things when I&#8217;m not at work. And it&#8217;s kind of passing the baton. I would say also the benefit is that he and I have worked together at two other companies now, so we know how to work together well, as opposed to having to figure that out with someone new.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s exactly. That&#8217;s what you were asking, how did we make this adjustment? Our team consists of, like I said, five additional to me and my wife. And so, three of those five&#8230; So the two new ones are the newest. But three of those five have been with us for years. One of them was a previous student of mine, he&#8217;s been with us the longest. He&#8217;s been with us for five years now.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And when you work with somebody that close, there&#8217;s a trust there, but also there&#8217;s just this ability to understand what needs to be done and there&#8217;s not a lot of conversation necessary. And so, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s always hard for us when someone decides they want to leave and go to something else is just that, the onboarding time&#8217;s a headache. But there&#8217;s a lot of just energy and gaining of trust and all that that has to be built with somebody brand new that you can&#8217;t do in your typical onboarding window of 60 to 90 days or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And with this particular thing, and hopefully I&#8217;m not telling too of much my business by saying this, but he and I, we started working together in 2017 at one startup. And then he left, and then a couple, I think maybe a couple months later they eliminated our entire department at the first place we worked at.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But then he got a job at another startup and was like, &#8220;Do you want to work here?&#8221; And I didn&#8217;t have a job, so I was like, &#8220;Sure, let&#8217;s do it.&#8221; And then he left there to another startup, which is where he&#8217;s at now, and then was like, &#8220;Yeah, I need help and I want do these things. Do you want a job?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Sure.&#8221; So for him, I mean, it&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Come on with me and make these things happen.&#8221; But also has increased my salary tremendously.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
There you go. There you go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So for that I am very thankful.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
It makes dollars and sense, huh?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Exactly. Yeah. So just to switch gears a little bit, we talked a lot about Studio Dzo. But let&#8217;s focus on you, because you&#8217;re the subject, of course, of this interview. Tell me a bit about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So I grew up in Austin, Texas. I&#8217;m one of the few Austin Knights that are OOG. Not these people that came in from outside or from California. So I&#8217;ve seen Austin change tremendously over the last 38 years.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I was born in Houston and we moved here as a kid. I remember the ride here. But yeah, I&#8217;ve grown up in Austin, and South Austin in particular, and still live in South Austin. And I have a love/hate with the city, because this is my city. And I say that because I&#8217;ve spent a long time more recently just trying to retrace my roots, and you know that can be challenging for us. And so, realizing my entire family is from Austin.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
My dad was born here in Austin. My great, great, great-</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Yeah, I was born here in Austin. My great, great, great grandfather was born in Austin and crazy thing was, just recently, a random phone call came to the studio, right? This woman&#8217;s like, &#8220;I&#8217;m cleaning up my property and there&#8217;s a headstone with Toynes on it, on my property.&#8221; And she was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think anybody&#8217;s buried here but there&#8217;s headstones here.&#8221; And it&#8217;s my great grandfather&#8217;s headstone. And so, he has a headstone in Evergreen Cemetery so I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What is this about?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so, but we&#8217;ve always joked because the headstone in Evergreen cemetery&#8217;s incorrect, it makes him 150-years-old when he was dead. So whoever made that one, the numbers are wrong. But this one had the correct numbers with the wrong spelling of his first name. And so it was just all &#8230; I don&#8217;t know the story behind this but just to reiterate, my family has been here and everything about my family is Austin and East Austin, in particular. And so it&#8217;s hard for me to see East Austin different.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
It&#8217;s hard for me to see it where I don&#8217;t know what our black population is but it was 8%, I think, at its highest and it&#8217;s three maybe now. I don&#8217;t know, but it&#8217;s not what it used to be and the communities now are so transient. It&#8217;s starting to feel a little bit like New York where you just don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s going to be here for how long. So it&#8217;s been sad for me to accept what&#8217;s happening to Austin. And I think it&#8217;s also been hard for me to accept that maybe this isn&#8217;t my forever place. Even though my family has been here forever, this may not be my forever place.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I think that&#8217;s something a lot of people are realizing particularly over the past two years. Not just because of the pandemic, but because of gentrification, inflation, everything is more expensive. Atlanta is very much a transient city like that, as well. I&#8217;m originally from Alabama but I&#8217;ve been in Atlanta now for 23 years. I think I came in &#8217;99. So I&#8217;ve been here for about 23 years now and even seeing how much Atlanta has changed when I came as a teenager to now being a full grown-ass man and seeing how things have changed, even just different parts of the city.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember when I first got here, I&#8217;d say maybe I was a junior in college. My first apartment was like$600 a month in Buckhead. That&#8217;s impossible now. And then I stayed in another place in Buckhead, it was a two bedroom. One room was my office, one was my bedroom and it was right off of Peachtree Street in Buckhead proper for like $750 a month or something like that. Now those are like $2.5 million condos. It&#8217;s wild seeing how the city has changed over the years. So I totally get what you mean.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s a hard pill to swallow and then also to see who gets pushed out and who comes in, right? And it&#8217;s not like everybody&#8217;s just winning, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s hard. It&#8217;s hard.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Especially here because Atlanta, of course, has a reputation of being a city that&#8217;s really &#8230; There&#8217;s a lot of prosperous black people here. A lot of affluent black people here, which is true. I totally don&#8217;t think I would&#8217;ve been able to accomplish what I was able to accomplish entrepreneurship wise in any other city but Atlanta because I had a lot of support from the black community here. But yeah, rents are getting more and more expensive. Everything is just more expensive. It&#8217;s tough to move here now and start out fresh than you could maybe even like 10 years ago because everything is just changing.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Yeah. I love Atlanta. Me and my wife, we have friends and &#8230; We don&#8217;t have any family but we would like to think of them as family. But we have a lot of people that we know in Atlanta and we love going there and it&#8217;s just a huge, huge city. People think Austin, they think, &#8220;Oh it&#8217;s such a cool city.&#8221; It&#8217;s a small &#8230; When you talk about footprint wise, the city is small. And Atlanta, you got like seven lane highways and I don&#8217;t even know why you have a speed limit. Let&#8217;s be honest, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true. That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Everybody, even the police, man, they&#8217;re out there 80 on the highway and it says 65, 55. You&#8217;re like, you can&#8217;t even legally go this limit. Yeah, and I love what y&#8217;all have done unlike Austin, right? What y&#8217;all have done with Ponce City Market, how you took an old building and instead of tearing it down like they would do in Austin, you utilized it and I know they&#8217;re not at all affordable in any way. But they used to utilize it for housing in a development instead of just tearing it down and creating something brand new, which is Austin&#8217;s mode of operations here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, we have a couple of places like that in Atlanta. There&#8217;s Krog Street Market. There&#8217;s a couple other places probably further outside the perimeter but Atlanta is good for tearing shit down, too, and just starting anew. I tell people, because I used to work in the tourism industry here and I tell people Atlanta&#8217;s a city that every seven years tries to find a new identity. It tries to find like what&#8217;s the new thing that we can latch on to and really make our thing. Because I was working in the tourism industry from 2005 to 2007.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so during that time Hurricane Katrina happened. But when I first started in 2005, Atlanta was really trying to distinguish itself from say, Orlando or Vegas or New York because people like to come to Atlanta. But the reasons that they like to come to Atlanta were not &#8230; How can I put this? Family friendly reasons for wanting to come. Like, they&#8217;ll go to Orlando because of Disney World, they&#8217;ll go to New York City because of the culture. But there was no distinguishing thing that people would come to Atlanta for. At least not ones that you would put on a tourism pamphlet.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Other than the World of Coke and the aquarium.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look, we didn&#8217;t even have the aquarium then. This was pre the aquarium, yeah. I was at the groundbreaking for the aquarium. But this was even before then, all we had was World of Coke. We had the zoo and Turner Fields. That&#8217;s about it. There&#8217;s not a lot of places, really. People came to Atlanta back then because, one, it carried over this reputation of being a party city from the 90s but you&#8217;ve got hip-hop, you&#8217;ve got all kinds of entertainment. You&#8217;ve got clubs. That&#8217;s why people came to Atlanta to have fun, to have a good time. But none of those things &#8230; They&#8217;re not going to put strippers on a pamphlet and have that at the airport. Is that a reason people would come? Sure. But that&#8217;s not one that the Atlanta Convention and Visitor&#8217;s Bureau would get behind because they&#8217;re trying to get-</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
If Vegas can do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well. But see, they&#8217;re trying to get multi-million dollar shows to come here. And we had a huge show pull out in 2005 called, Home Builders. Something happened with like, somebody said the wrong thing to somebody and this million dollar show pulled out of Atlanta. And then there was another big show, T.D. Jakes, the evangelist, the preacher. Yeah. He used to do this big thing called, MegaFest and he would bring it to Atlanta. And it was basically like a two week, I don&#8217;t know, MegaFest. I mean it had carnival rides, it had speakers and panels and all this sort of stuff and they pulled out, as well. And so Atlanta was like, &#8220;Well, we don&#8217;t have any reason for people to come here.&#8221; Because the other thing was these conventions would all be downtown and downtown is a ghost town after five o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Yes, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
People commute downtown and then they leave and the only thing that&#8217;s really downtown at night are homeless folks. And so because of that, conventions didn&#8217;t feel like they wanted to have people down there because they were getting accosted by people on the street and they didn&#8217;t feel it was safe and everything. And so, one of the things that happened was the aquarium opened but then Hurricane Katrina happened and a lot of conventions had to relocate to Atlanta.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so we had a big boom there for a while but then that died out as New Orleans tried to rebuild and conventions went back there. So then the Georgia Tourism Department basically worked with the state to get all these tax benefits for movies and television shows and studios and stuff to shoot here. So now that&#8217;s the big thing that Atlanta is for. Atlanta is like quote, unquote, &#8220;Black Hollywood.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I love it, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Because you have so many movies and shows and things that are here that people come and shoot for. I mean it&#8217;s rare now, well it used to be rare back then, but now it&#8217;s super common to watch a movie and be like, &#8220;Oh yeah, that&#8217;s in Atlanta.&#8221; Like I&#8217;ll watch Black Panther, that scene at the museum. I used to work at that museum selling tickets.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
That&#8217;s awesome. That&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, I&#8217;d look at stuff and be like, &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s &#8230;&#8221; But even now that&#8217;s starting to die off because politics, now politicians here have certain views and then that goes against what the companies are here that are giving them &#8230; It&#8217;s a whole &#8230; Atlanta&#8217;s complicated, man. Really it&#8217;s Georgia, but Atlanta itself is a complicated blue dot in a very red state.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
That is, yeah, that is a whole message right there. Exactly. I mean, we&#8217;ve even talked about moving to Atlanta and they were like, &#8220;But it&#8217;s in Georgia,&#8221; you know? And I&#8217;m in Texas, so I can&#8217;t really say anything because both states are sitting in the same spot. But just like Atlanta, Austin is that blueberry in the tomato soup.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But unfortunately, like you said, the politics of both states have gotten a bad reputation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). I mean, if you&#8217;re in Atlanta, it&#8217;s so funny. I remember this from, oh, I know what the show is. It was, Sex and the City. And there&#8217;s this episode of, Sex and the City, where Carrie and Miranda are double dating these guys. And one of the guys says something about how he&#8217;s never left New York and Miranda&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s a weirdo if he&#8217;s never left New York.&#8221; There&#8217;s people here that have moved to Atlanta and have never left Atlanta. They&#8217;ve stayed right in the perimeter or right in inside the metropolitan area because anything outside of here is deliverance. It&#8217;s a totally different thing, if you go an hour in any direction from the center of Atlanta, like good luck.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Yeah, it is strange also. But the thing is y&#8217;all can travel for three or four hours, maybe not safely, but you can travel for three or four hours and be in a whole other state. With us, it takes eight hours to get to El Paso.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
It&#8217;s like, you want to get to the coast, that&#8217;s a three hour trip. You want to get to Dallas, that&#8217;s a three and a half hour trip with no traffic. And so, Houston, same thing, three hours. And so everything just takes a long time and you&#8217;re still in the damn state.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So being from Austin and growing up there, were you exposed to a lot of design and everything growing up?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Short answer, no. For me, designer was exclusive to jeans and fragrance. I didn&#8217;t know, no one ever told me. I think this just happens to being an 80&#8217;s kid. Having someone sit down and point to you in the library like, you see that crappy poster, somebody designed that. You see this book, someone designed it. No one ever did that, right? So you really only knew the jobs that you saw people do, you know? So my dad worked in restaurants and then basically did sales for Circuit City. That&#8217;s dating, right?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
My mom&#8217;s always been in insurance and then pretty much every single person I knew either worked for the post office or for some insurance company or had military history or just worked some random office job. So no one ever sat down with me, ever and said, you could be this. I was talking to my wife and I was like, &#8220;The first time I ever met somebody at a career fair or something,&#8221; and then that person was like, &#8220;This is what I do.&#8221; And then I said, &#8220;I want to do that.&#8221; The very first time that happened, I think I was in fourth grade and it was a lobbyist and I was like, &#8220;I want to do what they do.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I have no idea what was compelling about being a lobbyist. But I think it was the idea of convincing people, right? And so, no. No one ever told me. So design wasn&#8217;t ever presented to me. And it wasn&#8217;t until I realized when I went to school, that design is problem solving. And that&#8217;s all I have ever done as a kid, is I was that kid that woke up at five o&#8217;clock in the morning with a problem, right? With a problem that I manifested in my dreams and I had to find a solution. So I was constantly taking things apart, re-imagining things, putting things together, just making up shit for myself to do and I was always solving problems.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve always been a natural leader, too. I just managed to convince people to follow me in some direction. And thankfully I never started a cult but it probably wouldn&#8217;t been too hard for me. But I always had the knack of being a loner but having no problem getting followers, but never wanted to be a follower. So I was that kid that was cool with everybody, but really was kind of a loner in a way. Everyone knew me. I had lots of friends but I only let certain people in.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So as a natural problem solver, I just found myself into lots of things, but no one ever gave me the design word to call it. And it wasn&#8217;t until my older brother graduated from school from ACC also with a design degree and a degree in politics, that I even understood that designers had software and they did things and it just wasn&#8217;t like &#8230; I don&#8217;t know, it wasn&#8217;t a word or it wasn&#8217;t painter, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). So you went to Austin Community College and you studied design and visual communications. How was that experience?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Like a lot of black designers, I had a very unconventional journey into design. So as I mentioned, I didn&#8217;t know what design was. So my original entrepreneur efforts started when I was catching shoplifters for four years. And then my daughter was born and she needed round-the-clock care at home. So me and my wife had to decide who&#8217;s going to stay at home and take care of her and who&#8217;s going to go to work. And she had the better benefits so it was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll stay at home and take care of her.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Well, money still needs to be had and so I always had aspirations to be a film director. So I started writing little films and things like that, but that doesn&#8217;t pay but I had the knowledge and understanding to cut video. And so I started out just cutting people&#8217;s home videos, taking people&#8217;s crappy home videos and removing all this stuff where mom left it on the table recording nothing and all that and just started doing that. And that led down to a very strange path to me working with lots of people, one being Vanilla Ice and-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Yeah, random. So yeah, I did a really, really crappy music video for a friend. I did it for $6, too. That&#8217;s just how you helped your friends for back then. And so, and then a promoter for Vanilla Ice saw it &#8230; I&#8217;m embarrassed to say that. But saw it and then they called me up and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;We have a whole bunch of raw footage from a concert in &#8217;99 or 2000.&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Can you cut it and put it to DVD?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so that got things started. So that got me out of doing the home videos. And then that&#8217;s when people were like, &#8220;Oh, can you do a music video for me? Can you do that?&#8221; And I ended up working on a big project for Text Dots, a training video for them. And I saw the future of me being in this film video game but I had no education. I had no knowledge, I didn&#8217;t know anything about anything. I was just doing whatever, how it worked and it worked okay.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But then in 2006, I guess it was 2005, I was working with a rapper and they were less than honest with the people who were giving them money. And then basically, I always tried to operate with contracts. And basically he was trying to get out of the contract and made it quite dramatic. I&#8217;ll spare you the details. But let&#8217;s just say that, I had to act less than professional because he was acting less than professional, you know [crosstalk 00:39:51]-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Got it, got it. No, no, I know what you mean.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
&#8230; when you get grown. And so, I was just like, &#8220;I&#8217;m done with this shit. I&#8217;m done with this shit&#8221; And I just woke up January 1st, 2006 and I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m a designer. That&#8217;s it, that&#8217;s it.&#8221; I just put that shit out in the universe, right? And so, my older brother gave me a bootleg copy of CS2 and I just started working in Illustrator. I had already been designing DVD covers and things like that for the stuff that I had been doing, but I didn&#8217;t know anything about it. And so, but what was crazy was like I said, I have never had a problem getting people to follow me.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I just told the world I was a designer and the world just said, &#8220;Okay,&#8221; and the world just like, &#8220;so can you do this for me? Can you do this for me?&#8221; And so I had a nice little nest of construction people and concrete people who were just like, they didn&#8217;t know anything about anything but they could just pay me and they&#8217;d get their carbonless forms and business cards and mailers and their trucks with vinyl on it and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And I was doing the worst design on the planet and it was awful, but it was paying barely any of the bills I had. And I was just making it each day. But I thought I was balling, too, I got myself a little &#8230; This tells you the time, too. I got myself a little one room office on Burnett Road in central Austin for $250 a month. That&#8217;s all it cost.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So I thought I was balling. I was like, I got an office and this and this. I didn&#8217;t need no office, I could have worked from home, but this was just my excuse to give myself the tools to feel like I have arrived. And then I started mentoring young people at LBJ and I had gone to LBJ Science Academy at the time. It was called Science Academy at the time. Now it&#8217;s called Liberal Arts and Science Academy. But I started mentoring young people there and they were learning Illustrator Photoshop in design all in one semester.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And I was like, these damn kids are going to take my job. I got to get more education. So I went to ACC and I was 27-years-old. I had a five-year-old daughter at the time. I was divorced. And I just saw that I had a lot of passion, I had a lot of drive, but I had no education. And this just winging it was proving not &#8230; I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to sustain myself if I wanted to make a life for myself at all in design. So I went to school and that was the best damn decision I ever made in my life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So after you went to school and you graduated, what was your early career like? You mentioned earlier, you had worked for Dell for quite a number of years.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
You know, I still freelanced while I was in school and I very much have always been a person to take advantage of every single opportunity. And I meet somebody and I&#8217;m like, if I want to work with them, I&#8217;m going to make them work with me. I just have the ability to just manifest a lot of what I want. And so for me, I stayed very involved in design and design community and everything. And I had a great, great portfolio professor who later became a mentor, Owen Hammonds and, yeah, still is a friend of mine. I mean, I call him my mentor. He says, we&#8217;re just friends.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But I still see him as a huge, huge influence to me. I attribute almost all of my success to him and it was honored to have him in my wedding. It was an honor to have him in my life and call him a friend. And we&#8217;re both very, very busy, but whenever we get on the phone with each other or see each other, it&#8217;s just an honor. So, but yeah, he really took me under his wing. He was my portfolio professor at ACC and he just saw this hustler in me and he was like, &#8220;This dude&#8217;s going to do it.&#8221; And he just plugged me in and just stayed on me and never, never bullshitted me, never gassed me up, always pushed me to be better.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so right out of school &#8230; I&#8217;m sure you have them in Atlanta. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard of them, like various talent head hunters, right? Like Aquent or Liaison Resources or the Creative Group and all of them. So Aquent had come to one of our classes and talked about, they&#8217;d find jobs for creatives and all this stuff like that. So I just graduated, I mean, literally the day we finished class. So I hadn&#8217;t even graduated yet, just the class was done. I just was on in the car driving. I just called them up and I was like, &#8220;Hey, heard you can get me a job.&#8221; And they were like, &#8220;Send me your portfolio.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And then the next day they called me in. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s talk.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;We have these jobs.&#8221; And so I started interviewing for people and I interviewed at Dell and it took them a little bit of time to see my magic. But after four months, basically interviewing with them two or three times, I interviewed with them for lunches and all this stuff. And I was like, &#8220;You like me, I like you. Let&#8217;s do this,&#8221; right? Like dating. I got put on at Dell and I started out as a designer and worked my way up to senior designer, art director, senior art director.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And really, I tell people I got my degree in Visual Communications at ACC, but I got my Masters in the Business of Design at Dell. I had an amazing creative director, Tommy Lynn, who really, really, really taught me a lot, gave me a lot of autonomy, really trusted me. And I still see him as a friend and a mentor, even now. And we&#8217;ve both been gone from Dell for many years, but I learned the business of design. I understood how to handle clients, how to give them the level of service that brings them back. And I know it sounds weird because I&#8217;m was on the brand team, so we only answered to the brand.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
We developed the brand, we evolved the brand, but we had internal clients who used our team to create resources that promoted Dell&#8217;s brand. So it would be a corporate responsibility team. It really wasn&#8217;t marketing, we didn&#8217;t do anything about selling product. It was about selling the brand as a whole. And so having both Owen Hammonds, having the education, helped me land Dell but Dell helped me really take this entrepreneurial energy that I&#8217;ve always possessed and really, really hone it into-</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
&#8230; kind of possessed and really, really hone it into where my next step was, was, and I didn&#8217;t really realize that I wanted to go back to being an entrepreneur, but they set me up tremendously and gave me a fat paycheck to learn over the course of five and a half years. So I&#8217;m not going to complain about that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, there you go. I mean, when you had your time there working at Dell and learning about the business of design, was that the impetus for you to start your own studio?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
No, honestly, no. I saw myself like everybody else. You go from one place, you do three to five years, then you go to another place. And honestly, I didn&#8217;t see myself going back into entrepreneurship, because I had never had a nine to five salary with benefits and all that. I had basically worked an hourly job until my daughter was born, and then basically just like hustled in the worst way possible to make crumbs doing video and design and whatnot. So when somebody was like, &#8220;Here, here&#8217;s a paycheck and here&#8217;s some benefits and here&#8217;s a lifestyle you&#8217;ve never had.&#8221; I just figured this is it. I&#8217;ve just landed the jackpot. But then over five and a half years, you start to realize there is a ceiling, and it depends on who your manager is. It depends on who your executive is, and you start realizing, people start leaving and you start wondering, am I the last ship&#8230; Sorry, am I the last rat on a sinking ship?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so all my team that I had been with over the five and a half years, only one other person was with me. And so we had watched like 20 people over the course of the time come in and out that it was just like, okay, the writing&#8217;s in the wall, you either going to be a lifer here or you got to find something else. It was really my wife who said&#8230; She&#8217;s always been my greatest supporter, and I had talked about owning a business and her father had sold his business and was kind of always envious of design and wanted to do something with me. And so I said, &#8220;Look, we&#8217;ll do something, but we&#8217;ll do it on my terms.&#8221; And he was like, &#8220;Yeah, yeah, yeah.&#8221; And so after basically I tried to bluff my executive at Dell to give me more money and to give me a promotion, basically I tried to bluff and be like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to have to go find something else.&#8221; And they were like, &#8220;Look&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So I was like, &#8220;Look, I just can&#8217;t blow smoke. I got to do this.&#8221; And so I left on September 7th. And I thought I was going to take the whole month of September off. And like two weeks later, started the laying the ground work for Studio Dzo. With my father-in-law and mine to be my partner, long story short, we realized quickly we cannot work together. My wife realized that before we realized that.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And my wife was like, &#8220;Look, if&#8230; Because we were about to get married, she&#8217;s like, &#8220;If we&#8217;re going to get married. We can&#8217;t have this. I got to have a relationship with my father. I got to have a relationship with my husband. Y&#8217;all can&#8217;t be at each other&#8217;s throat.&#8221; We had very different mindsets of what this business was going to be. So we had a negotiation with him, had a conversation and we said, &#8220;It&#8217;s time for you to retire. Go and do your own thing.&#8221; And, and he&#8217;s a restless person anyway. So he had a software business. He&#8217;s now able to dedicate himself to that. And so he was with us for about the first seven months of Studio Dzo.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I mean, I guess you didn&#8217;t want it to be that much of a family business.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
He really wanted that. He only has girls. So he really wanted this family business with the son-in-law and all this stuff like that. And I think he had this idea, but in his head that he really wanted. But yeah, now it&#8217;s just me and my wife and it&#8217;s good. We have the same interests, both financially and the goal of the business. So we are in sync where if you have different people who have different lifestyles and different households, it gets complicated. It&#8217;s like, well, if you&#8217;re eating steak, I need to eat steak. Where it&#8217;s like now we got to afford two steaks, versus me and my wife having a steak kind of thing. And so, yeah, it&#8217;s really complicate when you have different households and the family business is obviously complicated, but me and my wife very much, we have professional backgrounds so we always operate very professionally, at least on camera.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What were those kind of early days like with the Studio?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Oh man. So really it was&#8230; Like I said, I got the business of design from Dell, so I knew what I wanted, but it was scary. I&#8217;m not going to lie. But I knew that I had set myself up financially thanks to Dell that if I failed, I was going to fail quickly and I was just going to go and work some at some other place. So I knew what I wanted. And so thankfully I was aware that couldn&#8217;t do it all. So I had hired a friend of mine to help me develop the brand. I had hired a student of mine to just basically be like the hands of things. I had really just put people in the right places so that way I can focus on the development of the business. Thankfully, my wife had already been doing books for her father&#8217;s business and she&#8217;s an accountant, that&#8217;s her education in accounting.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so she does all things like money side. So she&#8217;s thankfully was able to do all of that. So all I had to do was basically sell and do the work and that&#8217;s kind of what I&#8217;m really, really good at. And so it was scary at first, but we also were a smaller team. I guess we were five at the time, but I just didn&#8217;t know what it was going to be. But honestly like people have just trusted us and I hate to kind of keep hitting it over the head with it, but I&#8217;ve never had a problem with getting people to follow us. So being able to sit down with somebody and tell them what we do and why we do it and why they should choose us wasn&#8217;t difficult.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
What was difficult was disrupting design business, design industry. So we&#8217;re designers who design signage, wayfinding, and physical experiences. But the problem with the sign industry is they&#8217;re like the bastard child of construction. So what typically happens is a developer gives their general contractor a budget for signage. And so the general contractor is just trying to find somebody to stick something&#8217;s up on the walls so that way they can get their certificate of occupancy. And so no one is ever talking about brand. No one&#8217;s ever talking about experience. No one&#8217;s talking about that. These sign shops, some of them, not all of them, are just trying to basically put a piece of acrylic with ADA beads on and in whatever default typeface they can in the cheapest way possible. It&#8217;s like a race to the bottom. It&#8217;s like everyone&#8217;s trying to be the Walmart of signs.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so I knew that I did not want to do that. And after listening to my father-in-law, who owned a sign company for like 20 years and he owned Sign Tech International, which at a time was like one of the biggest manufacturers in Texas. He was like, &#8220;No, no people, that&#8217;s not how it works. We design it. We sell it. We mark up the price and that&#8217;s how we get paid.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;So what happens when you design it and then they go and take it to somebody else and they get a lower bid?&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, that just happens.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;No, it doesn&#8217;t. Not here. It&#8217;s not going to happen here.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;We&#8217;re designers. We get paid to solve problems. We need to be paid or we&#8217;re not going to do this.&#8221; And he is like, &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to get people to pay for design before they see it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And I was like, &#8220;Well, then we&#8217;re going to be out of business real quick.&#8221; That was the weird thing is going into people who are used to basically, &#8220;Well, show me something. And if I like it, I&#8217;ll buy it.&#8221; We&#8217;re going to walk through this together. We&#8217;re going to talk about your problems. We&#8217;re going to talk about opportunities. You&#8217;re going to pay me up front and then I&#8217;m going to show you what that is going to look like. And that&#8217;s like I said, me and my father-in-law butted heads quite a bit. It was over that, because he was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve been working with this person for years. We don&#8217;t need to charge him for design.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;No, you&#8217;re setting a precedent with everybody if you do that.&#8221; So we would butt heads and that&#8217;s when he was like, &#8220;Maybe this isn&#8217;t good for us to be in business together.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s when I was like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s do it my way.&#8221; My wife was already on board and we now have, that&#8217;s all we do. That&#8217;s what we do. And people know us for that is that we solve our problems with design first. And then if you like what we design, and we&#8217;re all done with the design process, we&#8217;re going to give you a quote for fabrication, installation. But because you paid for that design process, you can take those files and share them with anybody else. You&#8217;ve already paid me for my work. This is now in your hands. So if you want to go out there and get a quote from somebody else, you can. No sweat off my back. I just keep it moving and go on to the next project. But if they do go with us, then we&#8217;ll fabricate and we have partners all around the world we fabricate with. And then we have partners both locally and all around to install.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And 90% still go with us. I would say more than that. 95% stay with us to do the fabrication, installation process because we don&#8217;t cut corners. And so they know that if we spec this particular material, we spec this particular lighting temperature, whatever, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to be. It&#8217;s not going to get in the hands of somebody else that then chops it up to make more profit. And then gives them a subpar product. We don&#8217;t do that. And so we have no problem getting people to commit through the whole entire process, but we put those breaks, because some people have to get multiple bids. Some people think that they&#8217;re not getting the best deal. And we tell people, we will never be the cheapest, but we&#8217;re the best, is what I say.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
We do good work. That&#8217;s our motto. We do good work for good people with good people. And so first and foremost is that, like I said, I don&#8217;t work for anybody. I work with people. We call all of our clients partners because I pick and choose who I want to work with. If they&#8217;re not a good person, we don&#8217;t work with them. And there&#8217;s been times where I&#8217;ve had to dig in on somebody just for a second, like they call us up and want to work with us. I Google everybody, and if I find anything that doesn&#8217;t agree with our values, I just say, &#8220;Hey, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good fit.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Because we believe that everyone should be treated equitably, fairly, and that this world is unfair and we&#8217;re not going to contribute to that in any way possible. We want to support all those, especially those who are not supported. We want to support the weirdos, the people who are aren&#8217;t typically accepted. And we want to support obviously our black community, our underrepresented community. And so we do a lot to make sure that our good work extends beyond what actually earns us money, but also we do a lot of work with nonprofits and we donate a lot of hours and times to people in organizations.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I have to say one of the best things about having your own business is running it exactly how you want it. Like if it&#8217;s a bad client experience, you don&#8217;t have to work with them. You can fire the client. Or if you have a certain intake process where you know exactly the kind of people you want to work with, that&#8217;s the best part. That was the best part back when I had my studio of really picking and choosing the clients that you want to have, knowing that just because any work comes across your desk, you don&#8217;t have to take it if it doesn&#8217;t feel good.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the freedom. And that&#8217;s what I tell people is that I left Dell to have that freedom. And a lot of people think freelance comes with freedom. I say, there&#8217;s nothing free about freelancing at all. You have to decide, do I want this money or do I not want this money? And for us we&#8217;re not dollar driven. As long as we&#8217;re able to pay all of our team members and pay ourselves a salary that we have dedicated, that&#8217;s it. Anything extra&#8217;s great, and we really typically roll it into the business one way or the other, but I don&#8217;t want to have to say yes to every project and know that it&#8217;s bad work, but it&#8217;s paying the bills.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so I&#8217;m a firm believer that just like free work leads to more free work, same thing with bad work. Crap work leads to more crap work. And so if it&#8217;s not a right fit for us, the project&#8217;s not a right fit. If the timeline&#8230; That&#8217;s the biggest thing is some people just don&#8217;t understand the process and the timeline. And if they don&#8217;t want to adhere to our process and respect our process, that&#8217;s a big red flag. So exactly, being able to pick and choose who you work with is really the reward for owning the business. The rest of it&#8217;s still work. It doesn&#8217;t matter where you go, it&#8217;s work. It&#8217;s not called fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But the best thing you can do though, because you know it&#8217;s still work is at least shape your own ideal work conditions.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Exactly, exactly. And that&#8217;s the thing too like I said about what I learned about Dell is, I had a great creative director who taught us the work life balance. And I will say that Dell actually has a really good work life balance throughout the entire company. So never did I feel like I had to be&#8230; I was on the edge of burnout or anything like that. When it was weekends, no one called you. When it was holidays, no one called you. You didn&#8217;t get woken up in the middle of the night having to do this or that. So there was a really good work life balance. So I knew I did not want to take that away from myself. And I didn&#8217;t want to create an environment where my team felt that way. We offer 27 plus paid holidays to all of our team members. Doesn&#8217;t matter if they&#8217;re part-time or not. We just went through the holidays today or yesterday, they get two weeks off at the end of the year. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m paying them for two weeks?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But we want them, and that&#8217;s on top of their PTO too. They get two weeks PTO on top of the 27 holidays and for us, and then they still have the get it done model. So if they want to travel somewhere and work three days and then be off for two days, then they only use two days PTO. And so for us, we really just want them to have a reason to be with us. And that do good work motto is really what it&#8217;s all about is that we want them to do good work, but we have to do good work by them. And we have to treat them fairly. We have to give them a reasonable salary. I can&#8217;t compete with the Googles and the Apples and these people who are throwing stupid money at all these people.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I can&#8217;t compete with that. We&#8217;re a small business. But what I can say is I can give you a work life balance that&#8217;s fair, treat you like a human being. You&#8217;re going to speak with another human being who&#8217;s also a father, who&#8217;s also a husband, who&#8217;s also an educator, who&#8217;s going to understand what you&#8217;re going through, and we&#8217;re going to make a compromise. If you got to take some days off, let&#8217;s figure out what it&#8217;s going to work. If something&#8217;s got to be moved around, let&#8217;s figure out how to make it work, so that way you can be efficient and we can be efficient.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
With Studio Dzo, I mean, of course, clearly you&#8217;re doing a ton of great work, but you also do a lot of community work as well. And one organization that you work with is one that our listeners, I&#8217;m sure, know about. They&#8217;re probably members of it. And that&#8217;s AAGD, which is African American Graphic Designers. Tell me about that. How&#8217;d you get involved with them?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s funny. So [Owen Hammonds 01:00:55] had kind of twisted my arm. So I&#8217;m a designer, I&#8217;m not an artist. And I make that very, very clear. I don&#8217;t express myself through art or at least through design. I don&#8217;t. I doodle, I do some things to be creative, but I&#8217;m not an artist. But Owen kind of put me up to this challenge. They were doing a gallery thing at [St. Ed&#8217;s 01:01:16], and he kind of said, &#8220;Hey Russ, I want you to participate.&#8221; And like I said, he&#8217;s a mentor of mine, so anything he asked me to do, I&#8217;m going to say yes. So he was like, &#8220;This is a self-portrait gallery and you have to basically draw or create an image of yourself.&#8221; And it was like the worst project ever for me to have to do.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So in there, we&#8217;re presenting our work at the end and it&#8217;s a gallery opening and everything. And [Terrance Moline 01:01:42] was also part of that gallery. And so I hear him talking and he&#8217;s from New Orleans and he tells a little bit about his story and all that. I, like I said, I&#8217;m kind of a person who just says, I&#8217;m going to make this happen. I immediately looked at him and I was like, We&#8217;re going to be friends.&#8221; I&#8217;m going to make this man my friend. And so I introduced myself and he told me a little bit about AAGD, I think we followed each other on LinkedIn or on Facebook or something like that. And then we just kind of bumped into each other a little bit off and on. And I was really, really interested. And I think I pinged him a couple times about it and asked him about it.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
He had had the Facebook group for a couple years. I think 2006 is when he started it, maybe. Katrina forced him to move to Austin. So he had had it for a while, but it was just like a social thing. It was just a community based thing that was more about sharing the work. But he had visions of it being kind of a business model, but didn&#8217;t really know where it was going to go. So I guess probably 2019, he really started doubling down on it being a business model and creating more benefits for its members in exchange for a membership fee. And so pandemic hit early 2020, and I don&#8217;t know how we kicked off, but we just like, we hit the ground running. He was just like, &#8220;Hey, you&#8217;ve been really involved in AAGD like with me, I&#8217;d love for you to look over some of this stuff and just tell me what would you do?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And I had been involved in AIGA, quite a bit. I was the vice president. Owen Hammonds being the president at the time, too, when I was vice president. I had kind of understood like basically AAGD is kind of like a black AIGA. So I understood what was working for AIGA, also what wasn&#8217;t working for AIGA, and what I saw could be an opportunity for AAGD. So we just kind of like together just worked on how do we build this out to be a membership model. So another core member is [Dave McClinton 01:03:40]. And me and Dave met at that gallery too. And I looked at Dave and I was like, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to be friends,&#8221; too. So Dave got really involved. So it was just one of those things, like these two gentlemen that I met one night, and I said, &#8220;I want to be friends with them,&#8221; fast forward a couple years here we are we meet every Tuesday. We joke around. We hang out, and it&#8217;s just it&#8217;s an absolute honor to call these very, very talented, passionate creatives friends of mine.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But then meeting all the people through AAGD, that I&#8217;ve met, it&#8217;s just amazing. It started up with just the need to create community for himself because transplant from New Orleans to Austin, not finding the black community that he had New Orleans wanting to find those, he needed to find it online. Now to this international organization that the one thing that we have in common is that we&#8217;re all black in some varying degree and that we are all creatives. And the creativity spans from film, digital UX UI, all across the board. And just as a design educator and as a person with my experience, I am constantly sharing my knowledge about both the business of design and then also helping them empower them with the confidence to charge more or to get contracts or to understand this idea of freelancing sounds great, but you have to set goals or you&#8217;re just going to work yourself to death.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
You got to set a salary. You got to tell yourself this is how much money I want to make. And then divide that up by 12 and then divide that up by a day and figure out how much money you got to make every single day to make that salary. So a lot of people don&#8217;t understand that right off the bat when they&#8217;re like, &#8220;I want to be an entrepreneur.&#8221; And then unfortunately too, a lot of black creatives don&#8217;t see themselves in the work space. And so they think entrepreneurship is the only path for them, because they&#8217;ve never seen anybody like them at a major creative agency. And so, a lot of them have no understanding of the business of design, because they&#8217;ve never worked at a agency, they&#8217;ve only done it freelance, they&#8217;ve only done it their own way.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So I try to meet them where they&#8217;re at and share with them both my experience from Dell, but so my experience as a owner of Studio Dzo, and just try to tell them, if you are finding these challenges, these are some of the solutions. So AAGD has been a great endeavor of Terrance&#8217;s and I&#8217;m just honored to be trusted with some of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so kind of bring it back to education, we sort of alluded to this before we started of recording the interview, but you&#8217;ve talked about being a design educator. You also now teach at where you learned design, which was at Austin Community College, that you&#8217;ve kind of had this full circle moment. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Yeah. So really, again, I&#8217;m no stranger to anything. My whole life has just been like this one long story of, surely you&#8217;re going to be a designer, but I have always taught in some capacity. So while I was freelancing back in like 2005, I needed additional income because freelancing wasn&#8217;t doing it. And so I started working with an organization called No Kidding, Straight Talk from Teen Parents, which was funded by the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, which was a nonprofit organization that basically utilized the stories of teen parents to use a teaching tool for middle school and high school students. And so I technically didn&#8217;t fall under the category of teen parent. I was 20 years old when my daughter was born, but we had a very unique story. My daughter needed lots of medical care. And so my story was unique in the sense of as much as you thought you had everything planned, plan for the unexpected.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so I go to middle schools and high schools and give presentations and talk and that ended up putting me on national stage at the National Child Support Conference. So I&#8217;ve always had presentation and teaching opportunities. And then while I was in school to supplement my income, I used to teach defensive driving. So I tell people, if you can take a room people and for six hours and make them enjoy it, you could do anything. Because they don&#8217;t even want to be there. They bought tickets to a show they don&#8217;t even want to be at. But everything I do, I do 113%. That&#8217;s my motto. And so no matter teaching defensive driving or talking to young people, I just pour my heart into it, because I&#8217;m just kind of one of those people that just, I can&#8217;t half-ass anything.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so it was just only natural for me to see myself as a design educator, but really what it was, and I attribute this 100%, was Owen Hammonds. To see another black man teach and to be passionate and understanding at the same time, but also pull no punches and really give it to you straight and push people to be the best designer they can be. He gave me that vision of like, &#8220;I could do this.&#8221; And so I made it my goal after starting at Dell, I said, &#8220;In five years, I want to teach,&#8221; like that&#8217;s my next rung. And it only took me three years later after saying that, that I started teaching. So I started teaching in 2015, I think, 2015. I&#8217;m like, man, we&#8217;re going up on seven years now. I can&#8217;t bel-</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Man, we&#8217;re coming up on seven years now, and just I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s, yeah, 2015, I started teaching, and I started teaching Portfolio. I have been teaching Portfolio for seven years.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I started a new course because I was finding that my students had no knowledge, including myself. When I left school, when I graduated, I started at Dell, I never knew what a project manager did. I thought they were just like the pretty people who sold our designs. I didn&#8217;t know what they did.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Then when you get an amazing project manager who has your back and is that buffer between you and the client and really helps elevate your design and keeps you on track, but keeps them focused and not, &#8220;Oh, I want to see this. I want to see that.&#8221; When you have a really good project manager, it just changes your life as a designer. So at Dell, I had the whole kit and caboodle. I had great project managers, and I had terrible project managers at various times.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So I was finding that my students were getting into Portfolio, which is a capstone class. They graduate after my class with no knowledge that there were other roles other than designer and creative director. For some reason, they all know creative director, but they didn&#8217;t know like associate creative director, senior art director, art director, senior designer, junior designer, production designer. They didn&#8217;t know anything about those. Those roles didn&#8217;t even pop up in their heads.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So I had basically harassed my department chair that I&#8217;m, like, these students have no idea the various areas of design that they could find themselves in, and a lot of the project managers, the best project managers I ever worked with, all had degrees in design. They just didn&#8217;t have either the passion or the skills to hack it, but they understood design, which makes a really great project manager.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So along with Rachel Wyatt, colleague of mine, we wrote this course called Studio, Design Studio. Basically, it&#8217;s a simulation course where students come in, and they play the role of a project manager, or an art director, or senior designer or creative director, or something like that. They change roles throughout the course, but it gives them a real-life experience. Then they have three projects over the course of that semester, and all those clients are real clients so they have to deal with somebody not liking their work. It&#8217;s not about the grade. It&#8217;s about did you solve the problem? Did you meet your client&#8217;s expectations?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I remember the first time I taught that class was 2020. We wrote this course during the pandemic, and we delivered it in the fall of 2020. I had two teams. I have eight students, and I had two teams of four. One had their presentation buckled up, and it was right and tight, and they knocked their socks off. Then the other team, they just couldn&#8217;t get their shit together. They presented, and it was just falling apart and everything, and it was all over.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I meet with them, the teams, and I was like, &#8220;How are you feeling?&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Shit, this is an awful feeling.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Remember that.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Get your shit together, get it right and tight. When you&#8217;re presenting in front of a client, this is the opportunity for you to sell your design. This is everything. You&#8217;re building trust and all that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So this course is really doing what it&#8217;s designed to do is to give them that experience. That way, when they go out and get their first job at an agency or at a studio, these roles, these requirements, these things that they&#8217;re going to be asked of aren&#8217;t foreign to them that they&#8217;ve like, &#8220;Oh, I presented my work.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Because a lot of designers aren&#8217;t forced to present and sell their work. They just hand it to a project manager or to a creative director. They don&#8217;t actually get to engage with the client and be able to talk of about and articulate their design thinking. Instead, they&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Do you like it or do you not?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So I explained to my students like, &#8220;You have to be able to sell your work,&#8221; and so by the time they get to Portfolio, they&#8217;re able to talk about their work in a much better way because of that Studio class. Now we have Studio One and Studio Two, which just is kind of a repeat, but just more responsibility and more expectations.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do your students teach you?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Man, patience. But, honestly, like I tell them, I get paid to learn from them. They teach me more than I could ever teach them.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
What I&#8217;ve realized more than anything is that we often only see life through our own lenses, and you asked me how did I get started in design? Did I know about designing? I didn&#8217;t. To this day, I meet people in 2022, who they&#8217;re the first person in their family to pursue a creative career or got college degree, and so I meet so many people from so different backgrounds.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve had students as young as 19 and as old as 65, and what I&#8217;ve realized more than anything is that age, experience, life experience makes you a better designer. You can be these 30 under 30s, or these kids that are just like designing the heck out of stuff and are just killing it, and these young guns, and I think there&#8217;s like a whole young guns thing or whatever. I can appreciate that.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But if you just haven&#8217;t seen enough design solutions, if you just haven&#8217;t been around the world enough, no matter how talented you are with the software, you just can&#8217;t be a great design problem-solver without that time. You&#8217;ll get better every single day, but it&#8217;s the people who are older in that sweet spot of like their late 20s, early 30s, early 40s, new collars who are going back to school that I&#8217;m starting to find out they have just enough life experience, they&#8217;ve seen just enough shit to say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want it to be like that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But also I&#8217;ve learned quite a bit from them of just the resilience. I&#8217;ve had students who school was the only safe spot for them. When they went home, they had to deal with outside real-world problems, whether it be addiction, whether it be homelessness, whether it be a number of things and school was a place for them.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So it really taught me to kind of understand that we are all coming from different places, but we all have the same goal, and that is to be financially independent, hopefully, but to pursue a career in a very scary, scary realm where I tell my students, &#8220;You have the greatest job in the world. We get to create something that never existed, and we get to solve problems.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s scary to pick a career where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to do something where every single day I&#8217;m going to be judged, judged by people who have no education in this, judged by the masses.&#8221; That&#8217;s scary as hell, especially if you&#8217;re an artist who&#8217;s trying to pursue design.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I tell them what makes me feel comfortable as a designer and not an artist is that I can objectively defend all of my work and all of my design decisions. That&#8217;s kind of my security blanket is that as long as I know why we did this, as long as I know the problems that we&#8217;re solving, I can defend that all day long, but it&#8217;s the subjective. It&#8217;s the stuff that just because I like it, because it feels good, because it&#8217;s me, because of this stuff, that&#8217;s the stuff that&#8217;s hard because it&#8217;s just judgment, and you have to accept that somebody just doesn&#8217;t like it.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So I try to help them kind of create a bigger gap between those things and I said, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t want people judging your art, don&#8217;t put your art into your design.&#8221; Leave that for the special people that you choose to share that with, but use your design as a tool and do your problem-solving objectively. Then if you want to add a bit of your spice on it, do that, but understand that they may not like it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a word. That&#8217;s a word right there, that last part. I hope people caught that about if you don&#8217;t want to be judged for your&#8230; What&#8217;d you say? Say that again?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Judged for your art, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I mean, I think that&#8217;s the thing. I mean, I don&#8217;t know about you, but a lot of people get into design because someone told them that you&#8217;ll never make a career out of being an artist, and so they hear the word design and they think that. So I got a lot of artists in front of me every semester, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Separate your art from your design.&#8221; So that way you can be a better designer, and you don&#8217;t have to worry about changing who you are as an artist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Something that I think I realized kind of early on with my studio was that a lot of designers design for other designers. Like, they&#8217;re not necessarily designing for the client. They&#8217;re designing because they want to be featured on Brand New, or Under Consideration, or something. Like, they&#8217;re designing for awards. They&#8217;re designing for accolades for their peers when the client may hate it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like, I&#8217;ve seen, oh, God, I remember, especially in like the late 2000s, there was so much design that was just the client hated it, but I did blank doing these kind of wild out-of-the-box stuff. And yeah, if it&#8217;s not in service of the client and that&#8217;s what the actual thing was for, like, yeah, it is arts that you&#8217;re kind of trying to put out there and then you&#8217;re putting this design sheen over it in that sort of way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But that&#8217;s a word right there. When that clicked for me, that&#8217;s when like, honestly, the business and the work just became so much easier because it&#8217;s like just design for what the client is looking for. It may not look the best, but then that client is going to keep hiring you, and you&#8217;re going to keep getting paid, and your studio is going to stay in business so you kind of have to like&#8230; It&#8217;s a compromise in a way. I mean, I think once you get that relationship working, you can then sort of add a little something here and there, but it&#8217;s tricky. But that&#8217;s a real word right there about judging.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I mean, you hit it on the head. Designers, especially in school, start designing for the approval of their peers, and they want to get these awards. They want to get recognized in design community, and at what cost? At the cost of, like you said, the clients or the vision?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Sometimes if you&#8217;ve ever had to do something like wedding invitations, doing your own wedding invitations is the hardest damned thing. I went through like a whole existential mental breakdown designing my own wedding invitations because I started designing them, thinking about all my design friends that were going to be at the wedding, and what are they going to say when they get this in the mail, and you start really questioning yourself. I had to stop for a moment and just realize, &#8220;You&#8217;re designing it for you and your wife on this moment and this day. This is what you&#8217;re capturing. You&#8217;re not trying to get the approval of somebody else.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But you&#8217;re exactly right, and the problem with that is, is that if you forget who&#8217;s paying you. It&#8217;s not in that way of like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to do bad work because this person&#8217;s writing me a check,&#8221; is &#8220;Are you solving their problems?&#8221; If you&#8217;re not going to bat for them and you&#8217;re only going to bat for yourself, then it&#8217;s art, and you&#8217;re doing it only for you. It&#8217;s selfish, and you&#8217;re asking them to pay you to do something that makes you feel good at a disservice to them.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So, first and foremost, you have to serve. Like I tell people all the time, design is a service. Just like waiting tables, just like anything, we have a duty to serve them with the best solution possible, and sometimes it&#8217;s telling them that they shouldn&#8217;t have something.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I give the analogy, forgive me for the crude analogy, but it just works, I tell people if you owned a restaurant and someone came to you and said, &#8220;I want a shit sandwich,&#8221; you wouldn&#8217;t serve them a shit sandwich. Not because you don&#8217;t make shit sandwiches. It&#8217;s because that if they ate a shit sandwich and you know it&#8217;s going to taste bad, they&#8217;re going to tell all their friends that you served them a shit sandwich and what people won&#8217;t know is that they asked for that.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So the same thing goes with design is that if your client ask you for something that you know isn&#8217;t going to solve the problem, but you just give it to them, they&#8217;re going to blame you for when that problem still is there, and you just took their money. Where if you sit down with them and you say, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s go back real quick. Are you hungry?&#8221; And they go, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; &#8220;Well, we serve a lot of other things. Have you tried this?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So I try to always reiterate to my students and my team and to anybody that we, as designers, have a duty to serve our clients, first and foremost, and to solve their problems. Sometimes that means pushing back on them and some of the design decisions that they want, and then sometimes it&#8217;s swallowing our own pride and realizing maybe this isn&#8217;t what we want it to be, but it still does solve the problem and in a different way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look at where you&#8217;re at now in life with the studio and everything, is this how you imagine your life would look like when you were a kid?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
No, it&#8217;s way better. I am making 13, 14, 15-year-old Russell just, I mean, I&#8217;m just killing it. Like, 13-year-old Russell is like, &#8220;Dude, who are you? Who are you?&#8221; And I never would&#8217;ve saw this life for myself because I never saw it, to be honest. We grew up in a middle class-ish household, played with financial illiteracy and a lot of things that unfortunate that I never saw anybody doing the things that I do, living the life that I live so I couldn&#8217;t even have imagined it.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So to look at where I&#8217;m at now&#8230; My nephew, today is his 13th birthday.I called him up and I said, &#8220;You remember what I told you when you were little, I said what happens when you turn 13?&#8221; And he goes, &#8220;I get to go to Disney World?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;You remember that?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yeah. You think I was just bullshitting?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;You know what I mean when you can talk about it, you can be about it.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yeah. It&#8217;s still pandemic right now so we got to figure out a date when we all feel comfortable.&#8221; I said, &#8220;But, yeah, you&#8217;re going to Disney World.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
The fact that I can do that for my nephew and the fact that I can take my daughter and my wife and&#8230; We just went to Hawaii, and I took my whole family, 10 of us to Hawaii, and me and my wife, we were very appreciative of all the work that we have done and all the support of our family to be able to do this for them. The life that I live now and the team that I have and the work that I&#8217;ve done and the amazing people that I&#8217;ve met and the opportunity to teach and the opportunity to get up every day and create something new, I could have never imagined it, and I am so very thankful.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I honestly attribute it all to design. Design, literally, saved my life and made my life. Like I said in the very beginning, going to school at ACC, literally, was the best decision I ever made. It set the trajectory of my life and set so many things in motion that, had I&#8217;d never gone to ACC, had I&#8217;ve not had the people in front of me and had the mentors and the educators in front of me, I would&#8217;ve never gotten to where I&#8217;m at now. So yes, in short, no, I would&#8217;ve never been able to imagine this life and, yes, design, I give all of it to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing either through the studio, or personally, or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I mean, I don&#8217;t want to work, but I have plans and, hopefully&#8230; I love teaching. I really do. I think that I&#8217;m a natural educator and a sharer of information and experience, and so I hope to continue teaching on a wider scale.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I mentor a few people now, and I&#8217;ve toyed around with the idea of professionally mentoring and offering those services on a regular basis. Right now, my mentees, I feel weird taking money from them so they just pay for my coffee. So I&#8217;m like, now it&#8217;s pandemic so they just send me&#8230; they&#8217;ve been owing me money for coffee.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But I think that I have a lot to share with young professionals and budding entrepreneurs. I mean, designers, I think that through a longer relationship, a mentor relationship that I can help really guide people who might feel like they haven&#8217;t received the education and knowledge of the business of design and where to go and how to capitalize on opportunities.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Then with the studio, as we were kind of talking about this kind of international work model, me and my wife have goals of finding a place that&#8217;s a little less tumultuous for people of color. Where that place is on earth, I&#8217;m not quite sure. I don&#8217;t think we found Wakanda yet, but we don&#8217;t know if the United States is necessarily our forever home. But our goal would be to really take our business global, honestly, so wherever we end up being, creating a team there, a local team there that would continue to do the work that we are doing and then have our current Studio Dzo team basically lead that team.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So that would be less of a requirement of me and Elizabeth on our day-to-day, and then take this very seasoned team that has been with us for five years and turn them into leaders to guide maybe this international team to create the good work that we&#8217;ve been known to do. So that&#8217;s where I hope to see ourselves in five years is where I have five or six other people somewhere else in the world who Zoom in with my team here, and we&#8217;re just cranking out the same good work, both night and day. One team&#8217;s working while the other one&#8217;s sleeping.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about the studio, about your work? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Well, you can always find us at studiodzo.com. That&#8217;s studio, D as in dog, Z as in zebra, O as in Oscar, the D is silent, and you can find us on Instagram, studiodzo.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
You can follow me on Instagram, Russell Toynes, that&#8217;s Russell, two SSs and two Ls, never trust a one L Russell, and you can follow me on LinkedIn.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Please, please, please check out aagd.co and see all the good work that we&#8217;re doing for our community there.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Check out Austin Community College also. I know community colleges get a bad rap, but I have personally hired more designers from ACC than any other school from UT, from Texas State, from St. Ed&#8217;s. ACC, hands down, has a better design program and the designers come out stronger. So if you&#8217;re curious about that, if you&#8217;re looking to change careers, ACC might be an opportunity for anybody who&#8217;s local to the Austin area.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Yeah, Russell Toynes, T-O-Y-N-E-S. There&#8217;s only a few of us out there. So if you just Google that last name, you&#8217;ll be sure to find me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Well, Russell Toynes, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I mean, I&#8217;ve heard of you for years. I probably didn&#8217;t mention that before we started recording, but I&#8217;ve heard about you for years, just like you were saying, my name has been kind of bandied about in the design community. I&#8217;ve heard about you for years. I was really excited to do this interview and really just kind of hearing your story, hearing your passion for design, and really even just your passion for just giving back to the community that has given so much to you is just super inspiring.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I hope people, when they listen to this, they really can kind of feel where your passion comes from with this, and also see how they can maybe pay it forward in their own communities as well. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate it, Maurice.</p>

<p>February is our anniversary month, and we&#8217;re kicking things off with an interview with design educator and researcher Omari Souza. Longtime listeners of the show may remember Omari&#8217;s first appearance on Revision Path back in 2017, and let me tell you, a lot has changed in four years!</p>
<p>We start off talking about Omari&#8217;s latest venture, the <a href="https://www.txstate.edu/blackdesign/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">State of Black Design</a> conference, and he went into the ins and outs of organizing it, and even gave a sneak peek on what to expect from this year&#8217;s event. He also spoke about teaching at Texas State University, his latest research focus, and the state of design education and how he&#8217;s grown as a designer. Revision Path is proud to work with State of Black Design, so you can definitely expect to see more of Omari&#8217;s contributions in the future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Hey everybody. My name is Omari Souza. I am a professor of design and design research at Texas State University. And I also organized the State of Black Design conference.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve been on the show before the first time you came on the show was back in 2017. How&#8217;s the year been going for you so far? This is 2022.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Man. To be completely honest with you with being in the middle of COVID these past three years all feel like one extended year. So it doesn&#8217;t even feel like I&#8217;ve started a new year yet. It just feels like I&#8217;m still ending 2019.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I guess it all has blurred together. I was online earlier today and I saw where people were making these comparisons, like January 2020 to January 2022, like how people were first starting to talk about the coronavirus and all that sort of stuff. But it does feel that way. I know a lot of folks now that are just trying to get their bearings so far. At the beginning of the year.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s exactly what it feels like. It&#8217;s just being up and down, well, being up and down in terms of figuring out how you&#8217;re maneuvering through COVID and educating and working. Whether you&#8217;re at home whether you&#8217;re allowed to wear a mask or not wear a mask based off of how the population is doing with COVID at the moment, it&#8217;s all pretty tough.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And granted, I say that living in Texas, I know in some other cities and states that have taken it far more serious in the state that I&#8217;m in, things have been a bit more constant in terms of mask wearing and some of those other things, but it&#8217;s been a lot to adapt to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And I know you&#8217;ve got a lot on your plate now because you&#8217;re also organizing an event while you&#8217;re doing all of this. You&#8217;re organizing this year&#8217;s State of Black Design, which begins next month. Tell me about how this event started and where you got the idea for it from.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
It started in a lot of places in all honesty. I normally tell people that it started as a response to the George Floyd murder. There was a lot of civil unrest at the time and a lot of people wanted to have these conversations about race and the intersectionality of race with practice, regardless of what that practice was.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
But also at that same time period and before there were a lot of designers in the BIPOC community that felt that they weren&#8217;t being represented at the majority of design related conferences. Whether it be HOW, or HOW Conference or several others, you would look at entire like 20, 30 person lineups, and maybe not see any person of color in that lineup, or maybe one or two, when in reality there was so much talent out there doing so much amazing things.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So this moment after George Floyd&#8217;s murder ended up being this huge boiling pot of emotion, a lot of the designers feeling like they didn&#8217;t have a space to be heard or to be seen, or that their contributions to the industry and to the field weren&#8217;t being recognized or appreciated. And there being this overall desire to learn more about how race is impacting these different pockets of society. So initial, I took that as an opportunity to hold something on my campus.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So what I thought was going to be on my campus, I created an Eventbrite page, hired a student to do some of the marketing material for us and anticipated we may only get a 100, 200 students that attended our program. Low and behold, we ended up getting roughly 4,000 people who registered for the event. And we&#8217;ve just been continuing since after realizing that there was a demand and really a need to have some of these conversations that weren&#8217;t happening prior.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s interesting about&#8230; Well, one, I guess the timing of all this came about in an interesting way, because one, it did, as you said happen, because you were hearing from so many people that there&#8217;s a lack of events around Black designers. And then of course the summer of 2020 was this big racial reckoning, so to speak, which I guess for a lot of people activated them into doing something and for you, this was one of those things.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah. And it really felt nerve wracking but gratifying is actually put together. You were one of the folks that actually came out and spoke with the initial one. And wanted to make sure I take my time to thank you for that, because I know that you&#8217;re super busy and you sacrificed your time to speak at the events. But one thing that we all spoke about afterwards was the response that we got on Twitter from it.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
There were studios that tuned in live and actually created visual graphics of what was being discussed. There were people that tweeted and sent personal messages about how they never felt so seen or heard in the field itself. There was just such heartwarming messages that were coming in response to this at a time period where there was so much anger and anguish. So it felt really good to put that together.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I remember seeing, I know Webflow was one company that did these sketch notes right along with it. And for those that are interested the 2020 event, I think it&#8217;s on YouTube, right?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s on YouTube.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And it was myself, it was Renee Reed, a couple other folks who had been on the Revision Path Podcast, but that was a really great event. It was just this one day thing that we all came together and spoke and it was a lot of fun. And I&#8217;m glad to see that you got that kind of feedback from it.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah. I needed that as well. Timothy Brad Levis who&#8217;s also been on the show, spoke with me before programming, before I began planning the second event and he said to me planning a conference you typically do it in four stages. The first stage is, oh my God, I&#8217;m so excited. I can&#8217;t wait to do this second stage. Oh man, this is so much harder than I thought it was going to be.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
The third stage is I can&#8217;t believe I agreed to do this. I&#8217;m never doing this again. What was I thinking? Then the fourth stage, once you start getting the response says, &#8220;You know what? It wasn&#8217;t that bad. I can do that again.&#8221; All the positive messages that I got at the time period, put the battery in my back to be able to do it again, the following year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So given the popularity of the 2020 event, what can we expect from state of State of Black Design this year? Because you&#8217;re putting it on again.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So there are a couple of things that I am trying to do differently that I think people can be really excited about. The initial event was really my attempt to give people a space and a platform and not necessarily do so in a manner that felt control or contrived. I really wanted everyone to be able to speak their truth and talk in a way that other conferences haven&#8217;t allowed them to.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And I think that was a part of the success of the initial event. The sheer rawness of some of the discussions, the second event was really making an attempt to continue that on. But part of the response that I was getting was really from companies that were trying to figure out how do we then create this pipeline for designers of color, into industry that we are struggling to fund. So I used this event as a mechanism to create this pipeline.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I was going to use donations and sponsorships to keep the cost of the event free to students, but then leverage that money to pay our speakers as well as make attempts, to offer scholarships to students that are studying design as well. So for this event, the conversation that I had with a number of the sponsors and stakeholders was really along the lines of what are some of the areas that our participants can be best served going forward.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And one of the things we talked about is it&#8217;s great to have these avenues open up where they can interview then IBM, if they&#8217;d like to, or an Argodesign or materials or PayPal, Adobe, and everyone else that sponsored the event. However, especially considering that a lot of these participants are coming from programs that may not have the funding to give the same level of education within design and some other institutions or some folks are participating that are self-taught, it would be amazing to give some professional development opportunities.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So this year I&#8217;ve been speaking to a lot of folks about hosting workshops in order to teach the people that are tuning in some new skill sets that they can use to improve their portfolios or to add new weapons to their utility belt. When not to make a comic book fund to improve their skill sets on a day to day basis, something else that they can pull on to solve complex problems. Additionally, we&#8217;re speaking about hosting projects that can be worked on with particular employers to gain exposure to what particular assignments are like.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So not only can you interview, let&#8217;s say for example, with an NBC Universal, whom will also be a sponsor of the events, but they will also be giving competitions where you can design a movie poster for a film that doesn&#8217;t exist, but it then becomes an opportunity for you to engage with art directors in this particular industry and talk about potential internships or ways that you can improve that work. We&#8217;re also making steps to expand our target base.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And we&#8217;re beginning to invite and have additional programming for high school juniors and seniors. So if you are getting ready to go into a college and your visual creative in your high school, K through 12 education, which you don&#8217;t know what a career will look like as a designer. How to begin it, how to start searching for a community on campus or even the right campus or program to go to. We&#8217;re beginning this process of attempting to educate some of those students as well, to try to set folks up for the success that they&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it sounds like this expanding almost into this career fair. I mean, of course there&#8217;s going to be the different talks and stuff, but you&#8217;re doing also a lot around making sure students are set up with interviews and other opportunities to network with companies.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah. I really want&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m backtracking. After the initial event, there were a lot of companies that, as I mentioned prior that were looking to find ways to diversify their workforce. And if that&#8217;s a discussion that they&#8217;re having, I want to be able to bring people to them, especially when a lot of the participants of these events are also saying that they would love to work for some of these fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
However, I also want to make sure that I&#8217;m providing an avenue by which they can continue to improve the skillsets that they have in between this, the attending our conferences and in between their potential interviews for one position to the other. So, my hope is if a student who begins to attend from their junior year of high school takes advantage of some of the workshops that are there.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
If they continues to attend these workshops and listen to these panels and interview with these companies that have been sponsoring their exposure and the connections that they would&#8217;ve made by the time they&#8217;ve graduated would put them further ahead than it would have if they&#8217;ve never attended and never worked on anything outside of what was in their classroom.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the speakers for this year?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Man, we have a ton of great speakers this year. This year, we will be headlined by Nikki Giovanni, which I&#8217;m super excited about. We will also have Jelani Cobb who will be speaking. We will also have Anne Barry fellow Kent alum. That will be there. We will have Regina Gilbert, Lacey Jordan will be there.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Theresa Moses, Silus Monroe, Maryam Moma, Mike Nichols, Kalina Sales, Roberta Sampson, Raja Shaa, Trey Seals will be giving a workshop on type design. We will have Jennifer White Johnson. That&#8217;ll be hosting a panel on disability design. Kelly Waters will be there. Shelby Zinc from Microsoft will also be there as well, and this is just to name a few. The list is really extensive this year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was going to say, that&#8217;s a lot already.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s an amazing list of people. And I I&#8217;m really fortunate that they have all been willing to participate in this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting, we talked about 2020 just earlier. One thing among many things that stuck out for me that year was just seeing how many Black designers found community online that year. I think because of events like State of Black Design and so many others that started that year. Black designers came around these events and really formed this sense of community. Have you felt that since the State of Black Design?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I feel like the year of the State of Black Design, there were so many things happening within the community and people attempting to build their own table. That I think that year in general, when the first State of Black Design happened, we also had Where Are The Black Designers hosted by Mitzi. Black Ignite, which was hosted just a couple months after that, by Heather Lee. Hughe also had their events as well as myself, which I believe was the last event of the year.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
We were all in communication with one another, especially after our initial events happened. And we&#8217;ve all leveraged one another in order to keep everyone going. We each serve a different role, but have each come together as a family, just to keep things going. So for the second events, I know we had Jasmine Kent from HOW, Heather Lee from Black Ignite and Mitzi all sit on a panel together.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve consulted with Mitzi and Heather Lee on a number of things that I was doing for Black Ignite Heather Lee brought me on to give a keynote. And I say all of this to say, there&#8217;s not only been a community in terms of the following, but the folks that have been attempting to lead these separate initiatives have also been coming together to assist one another. So it&#8217;s a fight and champion for the things that they view as important.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And I feel like that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s been extremely beautiful and powerful when considering three, four years ago, a lot of these spaces weren&#8217;t available. There was no State of Black Design or Black Ignite or Where Are The Black Designers and the followings for each have been extremely impressive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. They really have. I mean, of course, for folks that have been following Revision Path around that time, I talked all about Where Are The Black Designers had Mitzi on the show and everything, but yeah, it is interesting seeing how all of that has&#8230; And I mean, I have to say it has come together very quickly. Even from my somewhat limited perspective of looking at the landscape of the design industry from 2013 to now and seeing how few events and things there were around black designers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Even just media, like when I started Revision Path there was not any other podcast that were talking to Black designers about the work that they&#8217;ve done. And now of course, nine years later, there&#8217;s several others besides myself. But just to see how things have grown in such a very short period of time, I&#8217;m curious to know, why do you think these other events just don&#8217;t get it?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Because what I find interesting aside from the speed of all of this is how I don&#8217;t want to say how limited the resources have been, but y&#8217;all really pulled all this together from nothing. You put out a webpage or you put out a call on Instagram or something and you have thousands of people flocking to you registering, signing up for your event, spreading the word fostering community. And you see a larger slash other design competitions or events and things like that don&#8217;t even come close to that. Why do you think that&#8217;s the case?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s a number of reasons. Going back to my thesis research that I know we talked about in the initial interview, they&#8217;re a large percentage of Black college students that end up going to these. So they end up going to social serving programs because based off of the research I did in my graduate year of college, there are a lot of students that when choosing a major will choose majors that help them either contextualize things they&#8217;ve experienced or choose majors that help them advocate for others. And I think that advocacy piece for a lot of people comes off as being politic. I think with design, while it can be a tool that&#8217;s used for advocacy, it&#8217;s often communicated solely as a tool of luxury.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So even in terms of how conferences typically communicate themselves. So if you go to, not picking at any conference in particular, but if you visit Hughes site, it&#8217;s really all about how to learn the latest and greatest in designing for a fortune 500 company or a major firm that&#8217;s dealing with a fortune 500 company, but it&#8217;s never articulated.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
It&#8217;s never really given any attention to areas that maybe of concern for people of color. And the reason being is that design always wants to come off as being apolitical. In my thesis research, I voted Melissa Harris Perry in her book Citizen.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
She had the segment where she talks about whenever people think of politics. They&#8217;re often thinking about Democrats or Republicans when in reality, the art or of being political is really attempting to pull one person&#8217;s attention from one thing to something else. So if I&#8217;m trying to get you to look somewhere that you&#8217;re not currently looking, that happens to be political.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And then she then makes the argument that being Black in America is really a political act within itself because you&#8217;re consistently attempting to get people to recognize your humanity, so the discussions that we have at a lot of these events are not just about being a better designer or what you can do in the workspace, but it&#8217;s really these difficult discussions around the nuances of being marginalized.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
How do you exist in a space being a Black person where you might be microagressed or the racism that you experience may not be as subtle all the time. It can be subtle, and sometimes it can be very direct, what can you do to protect yourself mentally, emotionally, and physically? What are the courses? How can other people be there for you to support you through these types of things? And in many cases, these are conversations that aren&#8217;t really had in your traditional conferences, but their topics of discussion.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And there there&#8217;re things that Black signers are speaking about whether or not these conferences are including them and not to mention traditional design programs typically tend to keep things very Eurocentric, and they don&#8217;t typically provide much room for cultural relativity or exploration into the cultures that a lot of people of they come from.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So if you now have workshops that are being done. So for example, Trace Seals will be giving his workshop. A lot of his work is predicated on designing typefaces of marginalized audiences. That&#8217;s not something that would traditionally be taught at a design school currently, but if it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s being provided at a workshop, it now becomes something that deals in that nuance and becomes interesting to people that have been marginalized.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
That want to know more about that history but also how do I leverage that history and culture into my professional practice. Black Ignite, HOW Design, Where Are The Black Designers and the State of Black Design each give you an opportunity to have that conversation safely, and also learn to explore visually things that you may not see traditionally in the classroom.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I will say each of those events also are very different. Like State of Black Design is this conference slash career fair Hughe is like a family reunion kind of feel almost Ignite, at least from what I&#8217;ve seen from Ignite is just a bunch of straight up short talks, almost like a, I forget the name of it. What&#8217;s it called PechaKucha. I might be mispronouncing that I&#8217;m&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s sort of a series of short talks and things like that. And then you may have a conference that&#8217;s got more longer, more didactic talks or something. But no, I like that each of these events also has their own flavor. They all feed on each other. They work in concert, at least from what I see with other Black design events that are out there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like, of course the four that you mentioned, which are fairly new, that doesn&#8217;t preclude also the existence of Black In Design, which takes place at Harvard University or Creative Control Fest, which takes place in Columbus or it doesn&#8217;t shy away from those events. Or try to pit one against the other, it&#8217;s all one community, or at least it&#8217;s all one shared community. I should say. If you&#8217;re a black designer now this is probably the best time in history for you to attend events that specifically speak to you as a Black designer, like it hasn&#8217;t ever been, I think this good in terms of variety.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah. At least not that I can recall. And yeah, I feel that wholeheartedly. It&#8217;s really interesting, the entire idea of these separate organizations that really are in support of one another. And aren&#8217;t looking to pit anyone against anybody.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Like no, one&#8217;s asking attendees of one, not to go to the other. And in fact, we&#8217;re usually co-promoting whenever Where Are The Black Designers, HOW or Black Ignite has something if they send it to me, I&#8217;m always promoting and pushing people to attend. And they&#8217;ve done the same thing for me. And it&#8217;s really been appreciated.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;re juggling State of Black Design, of course, with teaching. You&#8217;re a design educator. You&#8217;re an assistant professor at Texas State University in Austin. When you were back on the show, the first time you were teaching at Laroche College, which is in Pittsburgh, what is it like teaching at Texas State? Tell me about your classes, your students, how is it?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Texas state is a really interesting place. It&#8217;s about 30, 40 minutes South of Austin, and also about 30, 40 minutes in north of San Antonio. So it&#8217;s sandwiched between these two major cities and in terms of diversity, it&#8217;s probably the most diverse institution in terms of student base that I&#8217;ve ever taught at.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s really beautiful to see in terms of things that I I&#8217;ve taught there. I typically teach a few design research classes, both at the graduate and undergraduate level, and I&#8217;ve also taught foundations and typography, but I consider myself more to be a design researcher. So I&#8217;m always happier teaching the former than the latter courses.<br>
<b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now, do you have a specific focus of your design research while you&#8217;re at Texas State?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I would say yes and no. So at the graduate level, in the past, I&#8217;ve taught a class called communication seminar, which is an introduction to design research methods that students can use for their thesis. So I begin educating students on research methodologies, like quantitative research methods, literature reviews, so forth and so forth. How do you build your design direction, map out plans, constructing logic models, so forth and so forth. Identifying stakeholders, yada yada yada.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I teach a class called design for experience as well, where I typically tend to leverage some of my own graduate based research around using design not only to using design classroom, not only is a space to develop new skill sets, but also expand considerations on what things could be applicable for. So I&#8217;ll teach design research methods and some UX techniques, but rather than using them for digital artifact, I ask students to expand their thought process on what an interface is.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
It doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be strictly digital, but it&#8217;s anything that anybody interacts with. So if we&#8217;re designing for behavior purposes, how could we use these research methodologies in order to bring about a particular behavioral change versus doing it strictly for additional clicks or site visits or things of that nature? Sometimes we will work in collaboration with other organizations. One summer, I saw the course, we worked in collaboration with Kyahokas Municipality Housing Authority. They were applying for 50 million grant to improve the quality of life for residents in a lower income community.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And we asked to be a part of the project. So we jumped in while they were performing the research and began asking questions to identify certain things that were happening in the community that design could be used to leverage as a solution to improve quality of life. One of the problems that we ended up finding was given the conditions that folks are living in.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
One thing that they definitely were missing was adequate opportunities to build community with one another and communicate with one another while also bottlenecks around communicating with the leasing office and people that managed the property.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So we proposed a number of solutions that had nothing to do with digital components, but were more so interfaces that we can build on the community grounds themselves to improve that person to person and person to business interaction on these grounds in order to change some of the cultural issues that were happening within that particular space.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
This year, there were a few projects that we&#8217;re going to be working on as well, that are all about community engagement, interacting with a group of people, but then attempting to solve a problem for behavioral change while using design as the so, and for me, I find this a lot more interesting than working along the lines of an arbitrary design brief, because I feel like the strictly giving students a brief, doesn&#8217;t give them an opportunity to meet people and expand their thought processes.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And if, as designers we&#8217;re supposed to be this empathetic group, but we never get an opportunity to meet or engage with the people that we&#8217;re designing for. We&#8217;re strictly designing within our own locked in biases. And that can also be very dangerous for marginalized audiences.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So putting them in a position where they have to get out of the classroom and interact with an audience, puts them in a space where they&#8217;re challenging their own perceptions and what a problem is. And if they&#8217;re designing with this audience and as they&#8217;re working, as they&#8217;re meeting them, as they&#8217;re engaging them, it puts them in a, in a process of thinking, my best results or realizing that my best results can come at hand when I&#8217;m working directly with the person who the solution is for versus working behind a desk without ever having to engage with them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious, you&#8217;ve been there now for about three years. How would you say things have changed since when you first started there? Because it sounds like what you are doing right now is something you maybe have to work up to getting to.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I&#8217;m still at a point where I&#8217;m attempting to recommend changes and then get buy-in around those changes, which isn&#8217;t a slight against Texas State. I think the reality is I&#8217;m an extremely young professor. I&#8217;m only 35 years old. And many of the professors around me have been teaching for just as long as I&#8217;ve been living in some cases.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So for me to be this young and come and make attempts to challenge the way that certain things are being done, even if I&#8217;m citing that in new research or things of that nature for any program would be a lot to take in because that whether directly indirectly illuminates that for potential changes to come they&#8217;ll need structural pedagogical changes as well to make room for some of these changes. So I think, for myself there&#8217;s still this need to get buy in or to prove the benefit of particular things that other folks may not be too familiar with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you say you&#8217;ve grown as an educator since you first started teaching?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I think there&#8217;s a number of different things. I think naivete is something that I&#8217;ve shed a lot. Have you ever seen the&#8230; There was a documentary on charter schools? It was called Waiting On Superman.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I saw that.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ve watched it again recently. There&#8217;s a section of the documentary. One of the educators who started a charter school in Harlem was talking about how he went to get his degree at Howard and he&#8217;d learnt so much and felt like as soon as he got out, he&#8217;d be able to change and improve the entire education system within two years, three years, if he was being lazy, but he had all the information necessary and he was going to get in there and make all those changes. I think that&#8217;s where I was when I first started teaching, I was really enthusiastic about the education that I got.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I felt super empowered about it, and I immediately felt like I&#8217;m going to jump in and make all of these changes. The longer I&#8217;ve been teaching, the more I&#8217;ve realized that it&#8217;s never an immediate change. You can never change the flow of the river that you&#8217;re in, but you can disrupt the water.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And if you make these minor disruptions over time, you can make an immediate impact. Well, not immediate, but you can make this impact for that immediate space, but you might not be able to change the flow of the water that you&#8217;re currently in. And I think that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve had to sit with and I guess be more strategic about what impact can I have and what impact will I be okay with having, if I can&#8217;t change the entire flow of the rigor itself?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you think about this state of design education now as it relates to diversity? Because I&#8217;d imagine with the years that you&#8217;ve put on this conference now and even changing to different schools that maybe you have gathered a bit of a reputation, a good reputation, I mean, but from your perspective, how do you see design education?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I think design education is at this really interesting spot. I think there are topics about decolonizing design practice and there are a lot of people that are doing a lot of work on plural versatile approaches professors such as Leslie and Noel that continue to do amazing things and encourage me in a lot of the stuff that I do.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I think there are a lot of folks like Cheryl Miller and her collaborations with designers off of the continent of America and working with Afro based designers and attempting to bring their aesthetic and their design language onto the forefront, I think is also something that&#8217;s really interesting from an institution standpoint and a university standpoint. I think a lot of the difficulty ends up being in people being threatened by that change or being uncertain, how to handle the new wave of demands that are coming for design institutions and programs, especially as the student populist becomes browner from one generation to the next.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I think in a lot of ways, it&#8217;s an exciting time to be a student. And it&#8217;s an exciting time to be a professor and see universities make room for these things to happen. I would imagine a difficult time for those that have no idea what steps to take next. Like if I&#8217;ve never had to consider anything other than Swiss design or anything other than the Bowhouse.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And now you&#8217;re saying that there are all of these other visual languages or aesthetical approaches or cultures that I should include in my curriculum and give equal amounts of respect to this one thing that I&#8217;ve made my bread and butter over the last 30 to 40 years. I can imagine that there&#8217;s a lot of anxiety, but still it&#8217;s necessary. And anxiety is never a reason to be paralyzed by anything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you encountered any of that? Like from other educators?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah. All the time. It&#8217;s usually not as direct as this makes me feel nervous or I don&#8217;t necessarily know how I can stack up to attempting to do this, but a lot of times it may come off in passive aggressive terms of we&#8217;ve done it this way for so long. And maybe you should just learn how to do it the way that we&#8217;ve been doing it before you make re for changes.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah. I don&#8217;t think people ever come out and say that, &#8220;Hey, this makes me feel uncomfortable or insecure about approaching this particular subject matter. Can I work with you on this?&#8221; It&#8217;s usually this attempt to stopping the clock or slowing down change. And that&#8217;s not necessarily me saying a Texas State thing. I think that&#8217;s something that that&#8217;s happening in a lot of places within the industry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ve had a few other design educators on the show particularly last year that spoke to that as well. And also speaking to how, I guess students are looking for more from their design curriculum. They&#8217;re looking for more from their design educators in terms of how they see the world now and the work that they&#8217;re doing, they want to know how can they be more, I guess, involved in different causes and stuff like that. From your perspective, have you seen a similar kind of change over the years from your students?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. So my graduate research, when I was at Kent State University, there were a few interviews that I did where I asked students how they ended up choosing their majors. And there were a number of students that ended up choosing a major just because some of the course material was interesting to them. So there was one student in particular, the group in a predominantly white neighborhood, but that a student was Black.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So that student felt that there wasn&#8217;t enough access that he had to finding out more information about people that looked like him within the city and neighborhood he lived in. So he ended up taking a few African American history courses, and then that ended up becoming his major because he fell in love with the subject matter. I feel like there are a number of visual students that I&#8217;ve taught that have been a part of design programs, both at Texas State and Laroche.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And Tri-C when I taught there. And also at Kent State when I was a graduate assistant and there&#8217;s this interest in exploring visual languages that relate to them culturally, that they can see themselves in. And I think it&#8217;s really amazing for them when they find that, but it does create a space of pedagogical opportunities for professors. If we&#8217;re willing to bravely lean into it. One conversation I had with a few of my cohorts recently, especially considering that Texas and the university is within the Southwest of the nation.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I mentioned, I think it would be a really good idea to start doing research and creating coursework and materials around the influence of San Marcos has a huge Mexican population as is Texas in general, but trying to do this course on the influence of Mexican and Southern American aesthetics on the design language of the Southwest, I feel like you teach a course like that to some of our students that are looking for something different than Swiss and Bowhouse design or your ecentric perspectives on things.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s also another opportunity where you can then teach something that allows a student to have a greater appreciation for a culture outside of themselves. Or give a student an opportunity to further contextualize their own identity and have a greater appreciation for some of the things that they were exposed to without having full knowledge of what the richness of these things were</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, along with those kinds of opportunities. You&#8217;ve also managed to network with and meet a lot of other Black design educators. Tell me how that&#8217;s been.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been amazing to be completely honest with you. I&#8217;ve been able since the first State of Black Design to meet a number of people and try to find ways to collaborate and or talk about new pedagogical approaches or projects that are being offered in classrooms. I&#8217;ve met consistently with Kalina Sales, Dr. Perry sweeper and Dr. Oji in our biweekly DFA meetings and some of the stuff that they&#8217;re working on.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
And some of the insights that they share with me are super invaluable in terms of my growth as a professor, I meet consistently with Teresa Moses, she and I are curating a State of Black Design book. And of course, during these meetings where we&#8217;re talking about the book assignments, they&#8217;re consistent topics or the discussion points around what&#8217;s being done in our classroom, Dr. Leslie Noel and I are working on a book called Restorative Design.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I&#8217;m learning a lot about her practice, not just through writing with her, but even some of the experiences she shares and what we&#8217;ve been writing, all of which enriches me in a lot of ways that I may not say to them consistently, but it&#8217;s been an amazing opportunity to see and hear other people that look like me that are dealing with students similar to who I&#8217;m dealing with, give me some of their master tips, or even seeing some of them just blow up and shine in their own career. Professors like Jennifer White Johnson, every time I look up, she&#8217;s doing something else amazing. And the community that she advocates for and the work that she&#8217;s been getting has been amazing to sit back and watch.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you want to see this year? Is there anything you want to accomplish outside of course, of State of Black Design, but what do you want to see this year?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I think the thing that I want to see this year, that I&#8217;m hoping that I can pull off is really this professional development. Well, not really professional development. I&#8217;m hoping that these tables that we build, whether it be Where Are The Black Designers, Black Ignite, [HUE] and the State of Black Design, that we find a way to continue to pouring into our collective audiences, outside our annual conferences.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I know where the black designers has a really good community. They keep in touch via Slack, but trying to find a way to continue growing people in their own personal endeavors, not just through professional development methods, but also just through personal artistic explorations.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
I think having a space where we allow other creatives to learn more about what it is that they want to do, but make it give room for people to explore new avenues and develop aesthetics and techniques in their own visual approaches would be something that I would love. And I think it&#8217;s something that we need currently as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And also you teased this book idea a little bit earlier. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yeah. So after the first State of Black Design, we did a CFP called proposal for essays, from anybody who was interested in contributing. We&#8217;ve gotten the number so far and a commitment to print from Intellect Publishing. So currently Theresa and I are reading through it and making attempts to decide what changes need to be made if there are essays that need to be lengthened and things of that nature, but we&#8217;re hoping that&#8217;ll be published by next year.<br>
<b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Congratulations on that.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Thank you kindly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So overall, and this may be a tall order from where you&#8217;re at now, but aside from this year where do you see yourself in the future five years from now? What sort of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Five years from now. I&#8217;m hoping I have tenure, but the work I&#8217;d like to do, I think it&#8217;s similar to what I was hoping to do in my initial interview. I would to begin a design for social good innovation practice that I do alongside my teaching. I&#8217;m hoping that the traditional classes that I&#8217;m allowed to teach that over time, I&#8217;m given room to change them slightly.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s not just commercial focus, but we&#8217;re giving them techniques and tools that they can use for commercial entities if they choose to, but also allowing them to advocate or contextualize their own experiences through these methodologies as well. I&#8217;m hoping that I can continue to write these books. I&#8217;m hoping that yeah, five years down line, all of these books that I&#8217;m working on currently are published, that I can continue to evolve the State of Black Design to meet the needs of its audience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you, about State of Black Design, about everything you&#8217;re working on? Where can they find that information?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
You guys can find me on LinkedIn. I&#8217;m pretty active there. I do have a site omarisouza.com, and finally, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m pretty active on Instagram, which is just Omari.Souza.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And the event?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
The event is stateofblackdesign.com.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. And by the time this comes out, tickets will be available so people can register to sign up, correct?</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
Yes, sir. Please register. We&#8217;d love to see you guys there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Omari Souza, I want to thank you so much for coming back on show. We&#8217;ve kept in touch since we have done that interview back in 2017. So it&#8217;s been amazing to just see your growth as an educator, as a researcher, and really getting more involved in doing community work with what you&#8217;re doing with State of Black Design. So I&#8217;m excited to see what is going to come next for you in the future. And of course, I&#8217;ll definitely be tuned in for this year&#8217;s event. Hopefully, People that are listen will tune in as well. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Omari Souza:</b><br>
No problem at all. I appreciate you as well for having me and all the advice that you&#8217;ve given me as well since 2017.</p>
