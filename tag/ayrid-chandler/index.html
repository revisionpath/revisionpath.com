Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>We&#8217;re off to the Caribbean this week to talk with the incredibly talented Ayr&iuml;d Chandler. Ayr&iuml;d is the head of her own studio, <a href="https://ayridbydesign.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Ayr&iuml;d by Design</a>, where she offers graphic design services with a focus on brand and identity design. She also teaches at the University of the West Indies in St. Augustine, where she&#8217;s helping to educate and inspire Trinidad and Tobago&#8217;s next generation of designers.</p>
<p>Ayr&iuml;d starts off talking about her goals for the year, and from there we get into the differences between being a designer in Trinidad vs. being a designer in America. She also spoke about what draws her to brand and identity design, and talked about entering Savannah College of Art and Design, moving back home, and how she&#8217;s making a name for herself there. Ayr&iuml;d&#8217;s path really shows us that as Black designers, we share a similar sense of community no matter where we are, so you&#8217;re never alone. Huge thanks to Rebecca Brooker of <a href="https://queerdesign.club/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Queer Design Club</a> for the introduction!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
My name is Ayr√Ød Chandler. I am technically an officially a graphic designer. I run my own business firm studio, one-woman show called Ayr√Ød by Design here in Trinidad and Tobago. I primarily work on branding identity projects. Apart from that, I am a part-time lecturer for design at the University of West Indies St. Augustine, which is here in Trinidad. There might be other things I&#8217;m [inaudible 00:03:15] that I do, but we can get to that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. How has the year been treating you so far?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Whew, it&#8217;s been interesting. I feel like 2022 has started kind of with a bang in a different way. I mean, things are changing with the pandemic, but then World War III question mark. I feel like a lot of stuff is just happening globally. I don&#8217;t know about you, but as a creative, all of those things kind of impacts me a little bit. I feel like because of the weight or the toll that can take on mentally consuming all of the information all the time. It kind of puts it own on things.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
But apart from those obvious things, the year started actually with me doing a lot more than I planned on doing. I ended up being a creative director at the local agency here, working on ruling out some digital products. And then that got pause due to pause and investments. There was a lot of shifting happening, where I went from working on external products to focusing more on Ayr√Ød by Design, instead of juggling the two. Feel like that was a mouthful of your very simple question, but that&#8217;s all the year has been going for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting about as you kind of alluded to about World War III and I promise for folks listening, this is not a political podcast, but I&#8217;ve been kind of keeping my eye, just I watch the news every now and then just to kind of get a sense of what&#8217;s happening. I mean, as we&#8217;re recording, this conflict has been going on now for roughly about six or seven weeks.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It doesn&#8217;t show any sign of abatements. It&#8217;s tough to kind of see, of course, all the devastation that&#8217;s happening and the general pleas from the President Zelensky. Yet, I know people that are actively traveling to that part of the world without a care in the world, and I don&#8217;t get it. I don&#8217;t get it. I&#8217;m like, look, I know you&#8217;re a few countries away and maybe that distance means something, but like, I don&#8217;t know if my American self wants to be in a war torn part of the world right now, but that&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah, no, I mean, I have friends and family in Europe and London and Germany and life is normal. Life is like every day, no big deal. Then I have a friend who is actually Russian, but she lives on this part of the world and she&#8217;s just like painting a picture for me of what that means and life, I mean, the war is really from what I understand only happening in, I mean, certain parts, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
It&#8217;s not even affecting the country as a whole. It&#8217;s like say, and there&#8217;s a war in the US, but it&#8217;s really just happening in Washington. The rest of the US won&#8217;t really be in war. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s a very similar kind of situation where we just think, well, the whole of this thing is being affected when it&#8217;s really just a portion. But I think it&#8217;s just the fact that we are getting all of the imagery, we&#8217;re getting all of the information live. Like it&#8217;s not like before in the previous war, there was no social media. There was no, you know what I mean? It took a while to get news update. We&#8217;re getting everything instantly. I think that is what&#8217;s making this so different, at least for me. I mean, I haven&#8217;t existed in a war before, overtime.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
It&#8217;s just new.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s also different to be completely honest that it&#8217;s happening to Europeans.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When this is what&#8217;s happening to Syrians and Palestinians, and there were news about these sorts of things happening, there certainly wasn&#8217;t this level of focus on it.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Nope.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Geopolitics aside, is there anything in particular that you want to achieve this year?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yes, I do, actually. I would like to achieve financial independence and stability. That is the main goal for me this year. And what I mean by that is actually having the profit that the business makes then stuck up to a point where the business kind of can run on its own and it&#8217;s more sustainable. Right now, I think we&#8217;re still very much in those early stages of, I won&#8217;t say paycheck to paycheck, but month to month, certain projects will definitely make a difference, that kind of thing. And so, being able to kind of get that stability within a personal business that one might have, they had a day job, I think that&#8217;s kind of the goal that I&#8217;m aspiring to for this. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk more about your firm Ayr√Ød by Design, what made you want to start your own firm?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I came back home in 2012 after I graduated from college. I haven&#8217;t realized that I&#8217;m one of those people that didn&#8217;t go the traditional route of started off with a day job and then decided to leave and do my own thing. I kind of always worked on my own. I went straight from college, well, not straight, like mainly from college to freelance to registering my business. Honestly, I was freelancing for six years and I discovered all of the different things of how business worked in Trinidad and basically, my banker was like, &#8220;You&#8217;re commingling your funds, right?&#8221; I was like, what does that mean? She was like, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re passing business funds into your personal bank account.&#8221; I was like, what do you mean business funds like money that I&#8217;m earning? She was like, &#8220;Yeah, you&#8217;re supposed to have a business account for those things.&#8221; I was like, oh, I did not learn this from school. I never heard this before.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know anything. And so, that kind of took me down a trajectory of the researching things and finding things out and talking to different people and that kind of thing. And also, it came at a point in my life when I really wanted to ground myself a bit and set roots on structure and stability. It was a kind of a natural make sense progression of, okay, no, you need to make things official. You need to go and register your business name. You need to be a legal, registered entity. You open your business banking accounts. I got an accountant. Like I did all of the things correct to make sure that I was set up properly and that led to so many different opportunities, which was great, so yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, it&#8217;s interesting, you mentioned that about it, not you being taught in school. I know that there are some schools that do have some kind of entrepreneurial program, but even for folks that want to just strike out on their own like, I know so many people have done over the past year or so because of the great resignation, like that kind of information isn&#8217;t super, I don&#8217;t want to say it&#8217;s not super available, but it&#8217;s certainly not something that is I think talked about a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, when I started my first business, I had the same issue. I was co-mingling personal funds and business funds before kind of getting my taxes back and getting audited and then realizing, you know what? I should probably separate these funds, which makes more sense. It just makes more sense.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But that&#8217;s a lesson I had to learn the hard way.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
For sure. For sure. Also, to your points of like information being readily available, I mean, I&#8217;ve a 100% agree from being in the US system, at least for my college and my education, that information is way more readily available for you guys. But in the Caribbean, information is still kind of pretty hard to get in terms of the structures of things. And so, you have to do a way more research. You have to actually speak to another human being. It&#8217;s not as easy as go look it up somewhere because our websites are still&#8230; We&#8217;re very much kind of a little bit behind. I&#8217;d say we are a decade behind in terms of that sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, but decade is a lot though, I mean.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m glad that you mentioned that it is different like that in other countries, because certainly I think what&#8217;s shown here in the US is about sort of being a digital nomad and you can work from anywhere if you work remotely and this kind of thing, and I mean there&#8217;s limitations.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
It was blessing for us&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What did you say?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
&#8230; in a weird way. The pandemic was a blessing for us in a weird way because it forced us to get things like online banking, which we did not have before.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Really?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah. Things like apps on being able to pay someone who banks somewhere else in Trinidad was a challenge, which set up a challenge usually for business. At least to me as someone who, I mean, I learned banking with like Chase and Wells Fargo when I was in college. I was accustomed, getting paid by the company that I worked on in Atlanta taking out my iPad at the time, scanning it on the app and having the money in my account. Then I came back to Trinidad and someone would pay me with a check and I&#8217;d have to go sign in a bank line, deposits that check and then wait four to five business days to access the check. It&#8217;s very different realities and that affects business as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Walk me through like a typical day for you.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Sure. I always like to say no day is typical and every day is very different, but to paint a kind of a picture. I would start the day, usually catching up on emails. I have an assistant who I work with and she helps me establish what my to-do list is and what are the priorities in terms of clients, et cetera. I usually would have a meeting or two and these will all be online. It&#8217;s usually me chat, checking in with a new client, having a conversation about what their project is like, that kind of thing. Then it&#8217;s usually like four hours, especially if I&#8217;m working on a new branding project of just computer one on one time with zero disturbances. Well, I try for it to be with zero disturbances, but I have a dog that likes a lot of attention.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I usually just go into this whole work where the world does not exist and I&#8217;m in my creation mode. Then after that, it&#8217;s kind of, I do whatever I want in terms of relaxation, et cetera, and prep for the next day. The reason why I say it&#8217;s like there&#8217;s no typical for me is because that might be like a Monday, whereas if you were to ask me about a Wednesday, what tomorrow, it starts with me teaching my students, because I teach on Wednesdays from 9:00 to 12:00. And so, a Wednesday would start with me teaching and then most likely doing, having no other meetings for the day, just to kind of clear my head and focusing on getting tasks off my to-do list kind of knocked off. But I would say like if it was to broaden it a bit and talk about a week and a general week, it would be typically a little bit of teaching, many meetings, lots of discussion with my assistant as well as someone that I recently started working with who was kind of helping me structure systems and processes within my business.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Like set it up for a more sustainable model. A lot of just talking things through, talking steps through, talking like, okay, what is the process from the time I engage with a client to the final stage where they receive the final artwork, like what are the steps? When do they fill out the creative brief form? When do we meet? When do they make their first payments? When do they make their second payments? So stuff like that is kind of, what&#8217;s been happening a lot lately. Of course, well, the actual design work within those probable period.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are the best types of clients for you to work with? Do you kind of work along clients in the particular industry?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
No, I would say I work across multiple industries, both within the creative sector as well as corporate, as well as I think anything in between, best clients would be a paying client.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hello?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Those are always great. No, but the ideal client for me is someone who&#8217;s a little bit open and clients who trust me, I think is what I am leaning towards noting is so important in the creative process. I work a lot with, I mean, well, as an identity designer, someone who&#8217;s there at the beginning kind of creating the logo for your new business, your new baby, your new idea, your new project or whatever. That&#8217;s kind of, I would say like 75% of the work that I do. I&#8217;m there at the beginning, right? I&#8217;m there with this person and they&#8217;re like, well, this is this thing that I&#8217;ve always wanted to do. And finally, getting started and I want to open a bakery or I want to create a new product. Those are kind of the SME as we call them that come to me and who I work with. And so, those are, I would guess the ideals right now, because they&#8217;re fun to work with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is it about identity design in particular that appeals to you?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
That&#8217;s an excellent question and I&#8217;m now like I have my hands down and I&#8217;m thinking deeply to answer your question. I think I&#8217;m good at it and I know that sounds kind of weird and conceited a little bit. I don&#8217;t mean it in that way. It&#8217;s just that it feels kind of second nature to me. It feels like the thing that I am meant to be doing and I&#8217;m able to do well. Even when I was studying design in college, like that was the thing, that was the part that made my brain tingle.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I guess when we did a different courses, maybe someone more into web, their brain might have tingled when we were doing that. But for me, being able to tell someone&#8217;s story visually is really, really appealing to me. And so getting into this, the background of why you&#8217;re doing this and how you want your customers to feel and what is the best way to put all of those things together to kind of become the new face or look of your business, your project, your company, whatever. It just it&#8217;s really exciting for me. Like I love it, so yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When a company or an individual contacts you about a new project, like talk to me about that, what does your process look like?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Sure. It&#8217;s changed recently, so I now know it officially. Usually, an email comes in and it will go straight to my assistant and she would kind of be their first point of contact. They&#8217;d be like, hey, I&#8217;m interested in finding out more about blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Most of the times, people want a quote. That&#8217;s usually where the first thing they want to know is like, if they can afford you or how much it&#8217;s going to cost and that kind of thing, at least here. What I do is we send a form that I&#8217;ve created that helps get information from the client to create a creative brief, because the typical client wouldn&#8217;t know what a creative brief is outside of certain industries. It&#8217;s just not common knowledge.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I created this form that allows them to answer certain questions that ultimately creates a creative brief for me. But it also does things like ask, what&#8217;s your budget, et cetera, et cetera. What are the actual deliverables that you&#8217;re looking for? It kind of lays all of that out for me. Then from that point, we send a quote and it includes things like the timeline, how long the project will take, and it also lays out the kind of rules of engagement. Like, when you&#8217;d get your first invoice, when you&#8217;d get your second invoice, who has ownership, who&#8217;s rights and credits, all of those things are kind of I include my, what you would call like a contract within the quote process. From there, the client either says yes or no, and usually it&#8217;s yes, thankfully.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Sometimes, we need to meet and chat a little bit more about the project, sometimes we don&#8217;t. There&#8217;s some clients who I literally have never had a meeting with because they&#8217;ll just so very clear and they&#8217;re answering the form as well in their emails. And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;yeah, no, I don&#8217;t need to meet you, it&#8217;s fine.&#8221; But most of the times, there are instances where we&#8217;ll meet and just talk about a project a little bit so I can get a better sense of what it is that they&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Then, I begin and head to phase one, which is usually sending, creating a document to send options for them, whether it&#8217;s one option based on their budget is on what they sent, whether it&#8217;s two options, whether it&#8217;s three options and I go through this process of research based on the industry. The great thing about what I do is that I get to learn about all of these different fields and lives and businesses that I would never have otherwise been exposed to. One day, I&#8217;m looking up all of the information about NFTs, the next day, I&#8217;m looking up real estate and how that works in Trinidad.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I just go like a deep dive into whatever the industry is so that I can understand it. I can see trends. The great thing about this, that I get to go this deep dive into different industries, what people are doing, and so I research the trends within the industry. I research things like what colors do people use? What are the font styles? I&#8217;m really good at observing patterns for some reason. I feel like that&#8217;s like little secret thing that I have. And maybe not, maybe that&#8217;s what all designers do and I just am giving myself more importance than necessary. I tend to like just pay attention to all the trends, pay attention to all the details and then go back to the original notes that the clients gave me of what they want, what they want to achieve and marry it all together to achieve this perfect for them outcome.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I send that off, then comes the pain taken part of waiting for client feedback, which I think is always like, it&#8217;s like the best and worst part of the project for me, at least because it can go either way. It can go, I hate this and you&#8217;ve not understood anything that I said, or it can go, oh, I love this, and this is what we want to move forward with. From that point on, it&#8217;s just back and forth with the client, whether it&#8217;s edits, whether it&#8217;s tweaks, changes, colors, fonts, et cetera. Then we get to the end when they finally made their final decision, I package all the wonderful files for them and I hand it off and I say, here&#8217;s your child. Goodbye, good luck. That&#8217;s kind of how I do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, your process sounds pretty thorough from start to finish.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah. I try to get as much information from clients as possible because that ideally is what helps me create. I think I&#8217;ve kind of figured out a way to eliminate as much as possible that back and forth period. Whereas in the early, when I first began, the back and forth was long and tedious and I didn&#8217;t ask as many question upfront as I do now. I wasn&#8217;t really designing for them. I wasn&#8217;t solving their problem. I was designing for the thing in general. I was designing for like, say someone wanted a logo for real estate. I was designing a generic real estate something. I wasn&#8217;t designing real estate but based off of what they wanted to achieve.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
And so, I think when I finally figured out that I needed to be more in tune with the clients as well and asking them the right questions so that they would know, like not necessarily asking them what they want, because that&#8217;s not really what I want them to tell me, but more so what are their goals? What do they want to achieve? Why are they doing this? All of those questions help me then make sure that they have what it is that they need. I have noticed in the past couple of projects that I&#8217;ve wrapped up, that the back and forth period is way shorter as a result of that because of those questions upfront.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s usually really good to get as many qualifying questions as you can, because one thing it does also like you&#8217;ll quickly find out whether or not this is a project you even want to do. If it&#8217;s something you want to take on, if this is a client you even want to work with and certainly like, as you do more projects and as you mature in your business, you get a lot quicker at getting to the root of it.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s good that you kind of have that thorough process.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;re originally from Trinidad and Tobago, tell me about what it was like growing up there?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been amazing. I enjoy being part of the Caribbean and I think growing up here was fun, I guess, would be the word I would choose. I am a carnival baby and what that means is that a huge part of Trinidad&#8217;s culture. And I say part of, or not the only thing that is Trinidad, because we have so much more to offer, but a huge part of it is our annual, I guess, street parade is what would be the best way to describe it. But it&#8217;s really a season that kind of begins right after Christmas, straight until the February or March, depending on the year, because it usually lines up with whenever Ash Wednesday is. It&#8217;s usually Monday and Tuesday before, so similar to Rio, I think also similar to New Orleans, all of our carnivals kind of line up around the same time, but I grew up playing kiddies carnival, which happened before the main Monday on Tuesday parade, trust that ability to express this freedom and creativity and this open way always really, really fascinated me.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
And so, when I say I&#8217;m a carnival baby it&#8217;s because like from the time I was five years old, I was engrossed in this culture and I was playing these things. We say playing carnival, we say playing mask, that&#8217;s kind of how we refer to it. It was great. Like I was ready like the first time my mom told me, like the first time she took me, she was like, testing me out to see if it was something I&#8217;d be interested in. When I realized that it was only one day, because I thought I was going back like the next day, like how you go back to school every day.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
And she was like, no, you have to wait until next day. And I was like, what? No, tomorrow. So yeah, I would say growing up is very unique. I would say, I mean, I don&#8217;t know how many foodies there are out there listening, but if you&#8217;re a foodie, Trinidad is definitely a place to enjoy all of the flavors. I mean, moving to Atlanta directly from Trinidad for college was an awakening because I didn&#8217;t realize how much I loved our food until I left Trinidad, so that&#8217;s always really interesting. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You didn&#8217;t run into any good like Trini spots here in Atlanta?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yes, it took me a while, because I mean this was 2008 to 2012 was when I was there. I didn&#8217;t have as much information and that first year was just me getting used to the fact that I am no longer home and dealing with the culture shock, which I didn&#8217;t think I would have. Because I was like, well its people where speaking English, there&#8217;s no language barrier, but learning, appreciate you or appreciate it, it meant thank you. That was like [inaudible 00:27:43] I guess. I was like, what do you say? Appreciate it, man. I&#8217;m like, what? There was a lot of back and forth with that in that first year for sure. And getting used to cafeteria food was also very interesting, lots of tilapia. It was weird time. It was very weird time, but I know I did eventually find some Trini spots there and I also started cooking for everyone and so it worked out, eventually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh nice.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
But yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Atlanta has a pretty big like overall Caribbean population, especially for students. I went to Morehouse. In the whole AUC area, especially when I first got to Morehouse, that was first time encountering anyone from the Caribbean outside of a bad impression that I might have saw in a movie or a television show.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
[Inaudible 00:28:34].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m from Alabama originally so it&#8217;s just like one state over.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I remember getting to Morehouse and meeting Jamaicans and Trinidadians and Saint Lucians and at first thinking like everyone just sounded the same because I could kind of understand it, but I couldn&#8217;t understand it. But then also learning just the differences in everyone&#8217;s culture and the food, that&#8217;s where I introduced to roti and doubles and everything. Yeah, I know what you mean by the culture shock. I think Atlanta, I think for a lot of people when they first come to Atlanta from anywhere, it&#8217;s a bit of a culture shock.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah, for sure. Also, I mean, I don&#8217;t want to sound like a little bit of an alcoholic or anything, but we drink at 18 in Trinidad, when you guys drink at 21.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Legally.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Legally, but like going to the club for me and being told that this was before you all changed the law. This was back when like at midnight on Sunday, the bar closed because y&#8217;all didn&#8217;t serve on [inaudible 00:29:42]&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
&#8230; on Sundays. That was huge for me. And not realizing that I couldn&#8217;t like walk along the street and drink a beer because that&#8217;s just a thing that we do here, Savannah was kind of like a safe haven for me because you can kind of do a lot down by the river.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
And so, I was always kind of running away to Savannah just to get a bit of what I learned for you a little bit just like a little bit of home, but yeah, all of those things that you like you don&#8217;t think about that are things until you experience it and you&#8217;re like, oh, this is something that I have never experienced before. Interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, now your dad worked in advertising, was that kind of your first introduction to the world of design in a way?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I feel like it could be, possibly. I grew up watching commercials and critiquing them with my dad. That&#8217;s just kind of a thing that happened in the household and never did I put the two and two together and be like, oh this is a Korean, this is a thing that I would then be doing in the future. It was never that direct or that straightforward. I would be&#8230; And my dad works at [inaudible 00:30:51] in Trinidad for many years and after school, that&#8217;s just where I ended up. And we would be the office until eight, nine every night because advertising, at least here, I know globally, it&#8217;s intense but here is many late hours and long hours of just making sure that clients are happy. I don&#8217;t know that I ever made the connection with this is like a profession or a thing that I can do or wanted to do.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I knew like very early on that I wasn&#8217;t never going to work in advertising because of the demand and the hours that it puts on someone. I think everyone was really surprised when I was like, oh yeah, I want to do graphic design because it was not a, well, I&#8217;m following in my dad&#8217;s footsteps or I&#8217;ve been exposed to this thing, to this long and this is what makes sense. After did languages in school afternoon, even do art and well, what we call secondary school that you guys would call high school. It really wasn&#8217;t like a very clear cut sort of thing that happened at all.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
It kind of became a, well, what do you enjoy doing and what are you doing naturally? I was a person that was like creating event programs in school for our masses. I went to like Catholic girl school and we&#8217;d always have weekly masses and I was doing the program for those kind of things. I was there and illustrate [inaudible 00:32:13] in on my dad&#8217;s computer, that kind of stuff. It came that way, as opposed to like me watching this person that I&#8217;ve lived with my entire life kind of doing this thing and following him, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, that makes sense. I mean like, I mean, I grew up, my mom was a biologist and I never wanted to really go into science I think because I was always around it, and I was not to say that I didn&#8217;t have a passion for it or a proclivity for it. It&#8217;s just because it&#8217;s around, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean, oh, this is the thing that I want to do. Like, she was like super surprised when she saw that I was really into writing. Then when I went to college that I majored in math. She&#8217;s like, what? She didn&#8217;t really understand where that was all coming from because she thought I would either do&#8230; She thought I would either do biology or like pre-med or something like that, and I had no interest in it whatsoever.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What was it like SCAD for you? I mean, you mentioned that first year kind of being a bit of a culture shock, but how was it overall?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
It was great. I mean, I was finally happy to be doing something that I enjoyed in a school structure because prior to school, like just to be completely transparent here. When I graduated from secondary school, high school, I had a 1.96 GPA.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I got into SCAD with a 1.96 GPA, let&#8217;s just put that there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
This system here just didn&#8217;t appeal to me at all. Like I was doing it because I had to and not because of&#8230; And I wasn&#8217;t interested, I wasn&#8217;t engaged, it wasn&#8217;t anything like that. When I got to SCAD, it was like, oh my gosh. Like all of a sudden, I&#8217;m getting to do subjects, I&#8217;m choosing. All of a sudden, I&#8217;m getting to participate in this thing that I have actively decided like I&#8217;m interested in. It was the first time of me enjoying an academic setting at all, and it was great. I think we had some really great professors in the graphic design field. They made a huge difference for sure. Definitely, finding community and bonding with different people in different walks of life, from different parts of the world was really fun as well.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I was also really active in student life. So I was like an RA. I was the youngest RA at the time because usually you&#8217;re only allowed to be an RA once you get into your second year. But by the end of my first year, I was an RA and then I became CA and I also was one of the loud ones who probably administration did not like, but I got the food to improve in the cafeteria. Well, what we call the hub in Atlanta and I met with like the manager of the food, situation was like, how can we improve this? And can we change up the menus? Can the recipes can change? Like you&#8217;ve been cooking the same thing for the past two years, what&#8217;s going on? And so yeah, there was like a huge shift that happened literally my final quarter was when the results started to show. The food that they serve now is amazing in comparison to what we got. I still take small credits every now and then I&#8217;m like, you&#8217;re welcome guys, you&#8217;re welcome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You paved the way.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
But yeah, no, it was great. It was really, really nice to just be in a setting that foster learning a thing that you already figured out that, that&#8217;s what you want to learn. You know what I mean? Like it was fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. After you graduated, like tell me about what your early career was like? Because I&#8217;m kind of curious about this period right after you graduated and you were in Atlanta before moving back to Trinidad, because you kind of alluded to that a bit earlier.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Sure. [inaudible 00:36:16], well, for graphic design, we used to have this event called Out to Launch and basically it&#8217;s a reverse kind of portfolio review session where we set up booths. We, being the students, set up kind of a little booth about ourselves and our work. And then SCAD invites perspective employers and businesses and companies within our field to come and meet us. And so, we kind of sell ourselves at this kind of trade show kind of set up. It&#8217;s called Out to Launch and it&#8217;s for the graphic designers. It was meant to then introduce us to folks who we would then get jobs with after graduating. It&#8217;s in that final quarter and everyone, the pressure was on from that point in terms of, we were very much an interview stage and I was calling everyone and having interviews with folks, et cetera.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I had the option for OPT for a year, which allows non US citizens to stay and work in the US for up to a year after they graduate, legally. I guess the hopes is that a company loves you so much that they would then sponsor you so that you can get a work visa and stay on permanently. I interview with many folks and for some reason did not get through with many opportunities. Eventually, I connected with a company called Atleisure. I don&#8217;t think they exist anymore, but at the time, they were an outdoor furniture design company. They were based near Grant Park area, and they were looking for an in-house graphic designer to work with them, for things like instruction manuals and labels for their product. When I say outdoor furniture company, I&#8217;m talking things like patio furniture, umbrellas, that sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
That was my first job. For three months, I was there, it was an internship. I was the in-house graphic designer. They would provide things to like Target and QVC. Those were like where they were selling these things. They had the furniture designers in-house who were creating their designs and then sending it off to China. Then I was like on the phone with China folks to get the instruction manuals and then design it with the established brand that they had. I had to tweak the brand a little bit because the brand was really rough when I joined. I was like, no guys, this is nuts, and I tried to tweak it a little bit, but there was only so much I could do because it was already registered and that kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
It was a really, really interesting time. I mean, looking back now, I see how that job helps me for a lot of the things that I&#8217;ve since done in a lot of the projects that I&#8217;ve since worked on. In the moment though, I will admit that I was very sad because in comparison, I had classmates who were interning at Nike and who interning at Apple and who were interning at Coca-Cola. Then there&#8217;s me like just interning at this furniture design company. I&#8217;m like, what gives guys?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
There was definitely that internal sort of am I good enough? What&#8217;s going on? What am I doing with my life kind of thing. But I also was that person who even when I left to go to college, knew that I didn&#8217;t want to stay and work in the US. I knew I eventually wanted to come back home. I think maybe that&#8217;s what folks saw as well in my interviewing process, even though I wouldn&#8217;t have said that out right. I think maybe seeing that I was not as dedicated or connected to staying in the US, so work permanently because they would&#8217;ve been looking for folks who they could then hone and then have a staff afterwards, so maybe that was a thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I wonder for young designers particularly here in Atlanta and this is something that I have, I&#8217;ve discussed it with business folks here with studio owners and things like that. For design graduates that are just coming out of school right now, Atlanta is a tough city to break into for your design career just overall for a number of reasons. One is, I mean, I would say the business culture here particularly, but it&#8217;s not like New York. It&#8217;s not like Silicon Valley. It&#8217;s not a city where you can sort of start out at maybe a more design forward or design focused company in that way. Like even some of the big names, like Twitter or Square or things like that. They may have offices here, but then they don&#8217;t really have a design department. They&#8217;ve got sales here or engineering or something like that. It can be tough to get in on the start like on the ground floor and then agencies are hard because agencies want you to have agency experience and you can&#8217;t get agency experience without working at an agency.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
For sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s like that kind of rough go of getting in and so I know a lot of folks, particularly at&#8230; It depends on the school like I worked at AT&#038;T for two years, this was way back in like 2006, from 2006 to 2008.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I worked at AT&#038;T and there was a direct pipeline from the Art Institute of Atlanta directly to AT&#038;T like a direct pipeline. People graduated from there, they got referred by someone that they knew and so they start in house at somewhere. Then from there, they would either go on to the CDC or they&#8217;d go on to Northrop Grumman and they&#8217;d live just kind of this mid tier designer life so to speak, nothing fancy, nothing great, but it&#8217;s a paycheck, that kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think the design community in Atlanta and I&#8217;m firing shots here. It&#8217;s just not that&#8230; I think for a designer just starting out, if they really want to sort of make an impact, it&#8217;s really hard to find a company here where you can do exciting work. If you end up at a good studio or something, maybe.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s tough. And so, I know that a lot of graduates end up leaving, you left, but a lot of graduates end up leaving to go somewhere to a more exciting locale with better prospects.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
For sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Better career prospects in general, not just entry level stuff.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah. Most of my class left, I would say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I would say when they like maybe two or three folks stayed in Atlanta and they got through it like Coca-Cola. For the most part, people yeah, for sure. I think New York and LA was where folks ended up. That&#8217;s a huge relation to SCAD and just kind of the grip that they do and making sure that you get an opportunity somewhere&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
&#8230; once you&#8217;ve graduated.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Because the school itself is a, I mean, it looks great on the resume anywhere you go, they say, oh, you went to Savannah College of Art and Design. That&#8217;s going to at least get you an interview, so that&#8217;s great. But here in the city, it&#8217;s tough. And I mean, I&#8217;ve heard this from art students that went to art school. I&#8217;ve heard this particularly from HBCU students. I&#8217;ve even heard this from people that have went to Georgia Tech or Emory or Georgia State. It&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s Atlanta is a tough design city in that aspect. I will argue it until the cows come home. It&#8217;s just tough. I mean, I had to start my own business to really further my career in design.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I graduated in &#8217;03 with a math degree. Of course, I didn&#8217;t want to go into teaching so I did customer service jobs. That &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; sold tickets at the symphony. I was a telemarketer for Atlanta Opera. Like I did boring stuff. Then I got my first design gig, believe it or not from answering a classified ad in the back of Creative Loafing.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I answered it on a whim. That was my first design gig for the&#8230; It was for the state of Georgia. I did that for about a year and a half. Then from there, I went to AT&#038;T, quit AT&#038;T and then started my own studio. The reason I quit AT&#038;T is because I could see my career hitting a glass ceiling already and I had only been a working designer for roughly about three or four years. I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m not going to get any further here. I was registered at A Queens and I was like putting my resume out there and no one wanted to even interview me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m just like, I was going to move. I was trying very hard in like the last, like 2008 or so, I was trying very hard to move to New York. I had friends that were up there that were like, well, we know a broker, we can connect you with because I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m not going to further my design career staying in this city.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It didn&#8217;t change until I broke out and started my own thing, which is very similar to what you did. You left, you started your own studio.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah. How does one with a math degree then do design? Walk me through that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I tell people that math really teaches you how to think and so what helped me, particularly when I started my studio with being a math major, and this is going to probably sound a bit weird, but you write a lot of proofs in math. Math is all about proving things once you get like past a certain level, like you leave the numbers behind. It&#8217;s all letters and symbols moving forward. And so, you&#8217;re proving things like why is zero less than one? Why does one plus one equal two? And you would think like, oh, because it does. But then you have to prove it through all these weird theories and all this kind of stuff. Going through all those logical steps taught me how to put together a brief for a client, taught me how to put together a proposal, taught me to look at a problem and find more than one solution.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like being able to abstract that out into a way that made sense is how I&#8217;ve done that. I would say everything from that has been just honestly just self-taught. I read a lot of books. I watch a lot of courses. Oh my God, when I worked at AT&#038;T, for example, there was a Barnes and Noble that was nearby my apartment and I would go to that Barnes and Noble on a Saturday and get some of those Photoshop&#8217;s tips and tricks books. And I have my little point and shoot digital camera and just sit and just take picture.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Because I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t have $40 to buy this book so I&#8217;m just going to take pictures and I&#8217;m going to go back home and I&#8217;m going to look at the pictures and try to recreate it in my cracked version of Photoshop that I downloaded from some sketchy place that hopefully won&#8217;t give my computer a virus and just did a lot of practicing. There was a time where I went through and tried to figure out what every tool in Photoshop did, every single one.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m going to figure out what each one of these things does. And then that helped me out once I actually got into a production environment, because then I knew these kind of things that Photoshop could do, that other people didn&#8217;t because they only knew maybe layers or something like that. And I&#8217;m like, oh, well actually you can make an art board and do this, this, this and this. And folks were like, how do you know that? That kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It was a lot. I taught myself a lot about design. I&#8217;ve not taken a single formal design course.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I always envy folks who can be self-taught. I&#8217;ve tried to like try to learn things on my own and my brain, I don&#8217;t know what it is. I&#8217;m one of those people that needs to be in this formal setting and someone else is showing me the ropes in order to learn. I hate that about myself, honestly, because I&#8217;m so envious of folks who can just have that self discipline to learn a thing. I find it so fascinating and amazing, and I envy you right now, just a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I&#8217;ll tell you, it doesn&#8217;t help when you have to go and apply for a job because you can put all that self taught knowledge on there and the first thing they&#8217;re going to look at and see is like, oh, you sold tickets at the symphony?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s what I did.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Or they see that A, you don&#8217;t have the education and B, you don&#8217;t have the work experience. Whether I knew it or not, it didn&#8217;t matter once it got into that sort of setting like. Certainly, for my first design job, I really had to prove myself by creating a portfolio overnight for the job that I ended up getting. Then even for AT&#038;T, I remember they gave me a take home test. They were like, we want you to make a three page website and there&#8217;s two types of businesses you can choose from, a bridal boutique or a motocross event. I said, you know what? I&#8217;m going to take the bridal boutique, the person, the interviewer was a woman. She&#8217;s like, what? You don&#8217;t want the motocross. I&#8217;m like, well, first of all, I&#8217;m feeling some sexism here, but I&#8217;m going to take the bridal boutique and I&#8217;m going to work with that and I made a little bridal boutique shop and they were impressed and I got the job.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I just feel like that&#8217;s the easier option as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Like motocross, what do you even do with that?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know, dirt background.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not [inaudible 00:49:39].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Tire treads, rough stencil type. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I just feel like bridal boutique is a better way to show off your design skill.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I have to do, but yeah, I did a lot of, oh my God, just so much playing around in Photoshop, just trying to figure out what stuff did, but eventually once I had design experience under my belt, when I started my studio, for example.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That was when I said my design career took off because clients don&#8217;t care where you went to school.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They don&#8217;t care where you went to school. They just to know if you can do the job that they&#8217;re paying you for. And so, I did that for roughly nine years and then I closed my studio down and got back into the working world. But it is what it is.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
What made you close? Sorry, I feel like I&#8217;m interviewing you now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, it&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s fine. The market changed. I mean, when I started, I started my studio in like 2009, late 2008, early 2009. And back then, WordPress was really started to take off and so I had gotten good at making WordPress themes.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That was something that really kind of let my career take off. I had gotten together with someone who was running for mayor for Atlanta. And wait, you were probably here during that time. What years were you in Atlanta?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I was there 2008 to 2012.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Lisa Borders had run for mayor in 2009 and I was on her campaign. I was her director of new media.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I made her website, her Twitter profile, her MySpace page to&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:51:16] how long ago that was, and she didn&#8217;t win. She came in third place. But one, that experience really like connected me to so many other people, influential business people and donors and things like that. By the time the campaign disbanded, I had a Rolodex full of leads that I could then call on and be like, &#8220;Yeah, I can do this job. I can do that job. I can do that job.&#8221; But I&#8217;d say by the time 2017 really rolled around, the market had changed. WordPress was still a big thing but then you started having the rise of a lot of site builders. You had Wix, you had Squarespace, and then for clients, it suddenly didn&#8217;t make sense to have a $5,000 bespoke website from WordPress when they could just pay Squarespace $8 a month and throw something together themselves. It became harder and harder of a sell to make that happen.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Eventually I just kind of wound it down and got back into the working world.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Interesting. Interesting. Thank you for entertaining my question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no problem. I mean, the thing is when you&#8217;re working for yourself, you always kind of have to keep an eye on just what&#8217;s happening in the environment like.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
For sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I picked up different services. I stopped doing different services for a while, I&#8217;d say, right around the mid 2010s, I started doing diversity consulting. I had no business doing diversity consulting. What they saw was like a black person in design and this was around, I guess, maybe year two or three of doing Revision Path. And they saw me doing this podcast and companies were like, &#8220;Yeah, we&#8217;ll write you a check to come and tell us what we need to do to bring in more black people. I got to do work for Netflix and I did work for Vox Media. Now, I would say in hindsight, that was purely situational.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Not to say, I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing, but I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing. In hindsight, I would say that, because the money is spent now, but in hindsight I was like, &#8220;Yeah, you know what you need to do, change that job listing language.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, yeah, that&#8217;s a good idea.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing here.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
It did. You definitely did, because that sounds like good advice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But it helped though. It helped though.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s obvious for us, but it&#8217;s not obvious necessarily. Like if you don&#8217;t live it and if that&#8217;s not, like if you&#8217;re not aware of the mistake you&#8217;re making, it&#8217;s very easy for us to&#8230; It&#8217;s your design training, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
It&#8217;s very easy for you to&#8230; It&#8217;s your math training. You&#8217;re seeing what the problem is and you&#8217;re calling it out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
It&#8217;s very simple.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s one company. I can say the company it&#8217;s Vox Media, but I remember I was doing consulting for their product team and they were saying that, well, we don&#8217;t know, like we&#8217;re trying to get a sense of how many people of color on our team and we just don&#8217;t know how to find that out. I was like, &#8220;Well, did you do a survey? Did you count?&#8221; They were like, &#8220;No, we haven&#8217;t.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh my God, how do you not count?&#8221; That&#8217;s like the&#8230; But they didn&#8217;t know that so they put out a survey and they got numbers behind it because this was at a time when a lot of tech companies were starting to first report, like the percentage of black people as part of their creative workforce.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so, they&#8217;re like, well, we want to try to get behind it and figure out the number and see what we can do to improve it and everything. I was like, &#8220;You should do a survey.&#8221; That&#8217;s a great idea. Here&#8217;s $5,000. That&#8217;s a great idea. Okay. Look, I&#8217;ll take it. If that&#8217;s all you need to hear, pay me 5,000 more, I&#8217;ll tell you something else. But in hindsight, I would say very situational that it sort of occurred in that way, but in general, yeah. I just wound it down because the market itself was changing. It was harder to do the kind of business that I had did before. And while I was changing, my business was changing with the times, also the podcast was taken off.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There was a point where the pod&#8230; I was bringing in more money with the podcast than I was with the studio and I really had to look and be like, well, what am I doing here? I could just focus on the show.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And not have to chase down checks from clients.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
That&#8217;s amazing. Congrats.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, it&#8217;s something where every year you kind of just have to like take stock and see what you&#8217;re doing, see what you can change and improve.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
For sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If you can go where the market goes.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
For sure. I feel like, so my thing is like, I&#8217;m always, like I have a foot in terms of observation of the market in the US. Then I have the very real reality check of the market in Trinidad, which is completely different. I think this year as well, I&#8217;ve been trying to stop comparing the two. I&#8217;ve been trying to stop kind of beating myself up a little bit about, well, if you&#8217;d stayed in America, maybe you would&#8217;ve had this much and blah, blah, blah. And kind of just dealing with the reality of what it is to run a design firm in Trinidad. It&#8217;s definitely a challenge for sure, a 100%. No one&#8217;s going to pay me 5,000 US to tell them the things that I tell them all the time. That&#8217;s just not the reality of our situation here. It&#8217;s kind of sad on one end.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
It&#8217;s kind of like, oh, I wish you people would just get with the program. Then on the other end, it&#8217;s like a nice challenge because it&#8217;s like, you get to be at this start of hopefully something different, something new, helping make a difference, helping improve a culture of what design could be in Trinidad. I mean, when I graduated from college, when I came back in 2012, at the end of 2012, there were no graphic designer jobs, like people don&#8217;t know what graphic design was. That wasn&#8217;t a thing. And the fact that now, like when I look through job listings, there&#8217;s graphic design of those, there&#8217;s graphic design of that, et cetera. To me, like that shows like, okay, in 10 years there&#8217;s been change. At least, I can say things are improving. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Now, we just need to get them to pay graphic designers what we&#8217;re actually worth and stop trying to get a graphic designer, who&#8217;s also an animator and a copywriter all in one, which is a huge thing here, locally. No, we want one person to do all the things and pay them a quarter of the price. That&#8217;s like the realities and I guess it answers one of your first questions as well of like, how come I would&#8217;ve started my own thing is because you could make more money doing your own thing than you could working somewhere, which is wild. That&#8217;s wild to me. Like the fact that there&#8217;s more stability as a designer, like freelancing and working on your own and trying to figure things out than having that stability of well a paycheck.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s absolutely how it was when I started my studio, I felt like I could make more money, but also, like I said, I had just hit a plateau in my career. I don&#8217;t know where I would be now if I would&#8217;ve stayed at AT&#038;T and didn&#8217;t break out and do my own thing. Because aside from just the freedom of entrepreneurship, it gave me a lot of confidence just in my skills overall, because&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
For sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; at AT&#038;T and T I was like part of a team. The way that they had a structure was they really pitted you against your coworkers. Like it was really more of a competition than a team kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
That&#8217;s terrible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Once I left, I really felt like I&#8217;ve got a couple years of design knowledge under my bill. I know what I&#8217;m doing. I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing, but I could at least figure it out and come to terms with the kind of work I want to do and the kind of teams I want to be on and stuff like that. Because I was calling the shots myself, it made just a lot easier in terms of me being more confident, because at the end of the day, you know this, you have to hunt what you kill, I guess is how you put it. Like, no one&#8217;s going to be responsible for bringing the work in, but you.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Unless you happen to have a salesperson, but other than that, you have to be the one that&#8217;s the face of the company, especially if your name is part of the company, like you got to be out there&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; selling it all the time.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
For sure. Definitely. I definitely learned that very quickly. It kind of happened naturally though, similar to how you kind of leap off points would&#8217;ve been working with that mayor. Well, going up the mayor person, I guess my equivalent project would&#8217;ve been working with our local film festival. That was one of the first design jobs that I got. And back when I moved back home, it was really just an internship, but I got to work alongside an art director, Melanie Atro, who is pretty awesome.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
It was a really strong brand that it was already created. Every year, we just kind of roll out all of the different elements for the festival, whether that&#8217;s signage, whether it&#8217;s the poster, but what that allowed me to do similarly to you was network in a country when networking is not as&#8230; It doesn&#8217;t happen as organically, or as officially as when I was in Atlanta, I&#8217;m going to AIG, AIG buzz events and that sort of thing, like that was what I was accustomed to. I was like, oh, I&#8217;m going to go to this networking event and meet these people and talk and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
And then I got back to Trinidad and I&#8217;m like, where are the networking? And everybody&#8217;s looking at me like, what are you talking about? All of a sudden, I&#8217;m in this festival with all of these different creatives, doing all of these different things and I&#8217;m meeting this sponsor. I&#8217;m meeting banks and all of these different folks who are part of this community that I would have been completely removed from for four years while I was in college.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
And that definitely led to all of the connections, like some of the friendships that I even have to this day are from that moment and that time. Definitely, would not change it. I don&#8217;t know where I would be now, similarly to what you&#8217;re saying, I don&#8217;t know where I would be now if I was still working on Atleisure, for example, or right after Atleisure, when I came back home, I would say, my equivalent of your AT&#038;T job might have been like this bank take that I took where they advertised it as a desktop publisher.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
And this is a time when I have my graphic design degree and I&#8217;m not seeing any jobs with graphic design on it. I find this thing, I&#8217;m like, what is a desktop publisher? I&#8217;ll look it up. It was like, it said something like someone that designs long documents or brochures and annual reports and that side of things. I was like, oh, okay, well, I can do that for a bank.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Day one, I had no computer. Day two, they gave me no&#8230; Like I was sitting at the desk, no desktop on it for me to do any desktop publishing. It turns out they just wanted someone to design PowerPoint presentations for their managers to do a transitionary, blah, blah, blah so I didn&#8217;t last, I didn&#8217;t last a month, I don&#8217;t think. I was like, no, this is [inaudible 01:02:31] I didn&#8217;t have to open PowerPoint any time in my four years at SCAD. And right after that was when I found out about the festival looking for a graphic design intern, I was like, oh my gosh, someone wants a graphic design or specifically in Trinidad right now on that, and the rest was history. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, aside from your design firm, you&#8217;re also a writer, talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I was [inaudible 01:02:59] an aspiring writer. I&#8217;m not a writer. I won&#8217;t put myself just yet, but what I do is in my downtime or my free time, I go to a lot of writing workshops because like I told you, I&#8217;m not a self-taught person. We have this other festival here called Bocas Lit Fest, which is our literary festival. They put on different events and workshops all the time and I&#8217;ve been to a couple of them. I mean, I&#8217;ve been writing since I was a teenager. I&#8217;m like one of those people, I was always writing cheesy poems. I kind of over the years, just put a little bit more energy towards writing every now and then but this year, I put the most energy, I would say towards it, because I entered emerging writer&#8217;s thing. I entered Bocas Emerging Writers like competition, scenario, fellowship, sorry is the term.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I was actually shortlisted in [inaudible 01:04:01] and I was like, okay, you really need to start putting a little bit more energy into this writing thing and stop seeing you&#8217;re an aspiring writer and just be the writer that you want to be kind of thing. But yeah, really, I use writing as way to get out of my head a little bit. I find as a designer and as someone that works primarily alone and not necessarily on a bigger team, that it&#8217;s a lot of thoughts just floating around in there always, like the brain is constantly flowing and writing allows me to take all of those thoughts and kind of put it somewhere, which I really, really enjoy. So yeah, and I write about me or about experiences that I&#8217;ve experienced. Yeah, I like it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you think you&#8217;ll ever kind of branch out and write about design?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I would love to. So I have a blog. I do write about design on there, sometimes, but usually it&#8217;s in a critiquing manner or it&#8217;s in a, this is how, this could have been better. It&#8217;s more like me critiquing the design society in Trinidad rather than me writing about design formats or structures kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
But I see myself doing both because it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been wanting to do simply because we don&#8217;t have it, one. Actually, technically I did write about design. I actually co-wrote a book called How to Get Paid for designers here locally in Trinidad and like talking about what the pricing is like and how to get those things done? Why you should I have a contract, stuff like that, but I guess that&#8217;s more business of design than design specifically.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
But I also had this feature on my social media page on Instagram called Just A Tip, and I used to give design tips on Tuesdays and I wanted to turn that into something that I do on my blog or maybe a newsletter that continues and it&#8217;s a little bit more direct in terms of suggestions and that sort of thing. There&#8217;s room for it to answer your question, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You could be the voice of Trinidad design.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Some people would say that I kind of am and I run away from that a lot. Like that terrifies me the idea of being the person for anything that&#8217;s&#8230; I feel very badly about speaking on behalf of other people. I just want&#8230; Let me, I&#8217;m speaking for me, myself, Ayr√Ød Chandler. I&#8217;m not speaking for Trinidad or Trinidad graphic designers or anything like that. That&#8217;s a lot of responsibility.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, I mean, I think a lot of writers are like that. They have their own quirks and stuff, but I think as long as you&#8217;re talking about your work and your process and even just writing about yourself, like you mentioned, that&#8217;s a good thing. Writing is one of those things it&#8217;s called a practice for a reason. You kind of have to keep doing it.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yep.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Aside from writing, you also teach, you&#8217;re doing a lot.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;re running your business, you&#8217;re writing, tell me about your teaching at University of West Indies St. Augustine.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
A couple years ago, I was hanging, I was on a rooftop event and met a fellow designer who was one of the folks that I first worked with here and kind of guided me and did local design scene. And he was like, I just started teaching and they&#8217;re looking for more lecturers, are you interested? And I was like, I don&#8217;t know. I was like, I&#8217;ve never given teaching a thought, like I am I qualified? They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, you just need to be a practice and designer and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Hey, sure, let me try.&#8221; And literally within 15 minutes, he had messaged the person and the person messaged me and I had a meeting the next day to talk about lecturing to university and my mind was blown and they were like, &#8220;Oh yes, we were looking at your work and we think that you&#8217;d be great for this blah, blah, blah.&#8221; I was like, okay.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Before you knew it, I was teaching year two students about design basics and going from practicing design and to applying all of the things that I tried to search up all of my SCAD syllabi to get some kind of inspiration. Then before you knew it, I was putting together my own syllabus and the rest is what it is. And so, I started, this year was my third year teaching this course. I&#8217;m a part-time lecturer. It&#8217;s only during the first half of the, well, first quarter, third of the year, I guess, for the second semester that starts in January. And yeah, I get to talk about design and teach design and kind of help shape what other folks are doing that process and cut in conjunction with working with interns at my business, kind of inspired me to then start teaching courses as part of my business.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Because I realized one that I actually really liked teaching, which really, really surprised me more than anything else. I was really, really shocked and I&#8217;m not sure why I was that shocked. I guess I just never thought of myself as someone who would have the patience to teach, because I feel like it&#8217;s very much like a devotion on one of those things where it requires you to remove yourself from yourself a little bit and kind of very much make sure that what you&#8217;re seeing is resonating with someone and helping them. Teaching is basically helping another person. And I guess design is also helping another person and they&#8217;re both kind of the service industry thing.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
And so maybe it does make sense that I enjoyed doing both, but I also noticed, and working with the interns that I worked with, they were coming from another local school and a lot of things were like lacking. They didn&#8217;t know some basic design things that I felt like they should know. We also have a huge self sort community in Trinidad. And so I thought, okay, cool, let me put together some design foundation basics, at least, that folks can reference. I&#8217;m talking about things like knowing the difference in a JPEG and a PNG and a PDF, like basic. And that also really went really well and so I&#8217;m actually preparing now to do the next, which would be my third offering of courses so far, but yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, you&#8217;re writing, you&#8217;re teaching, you&#8217;re running your own business. Like what&#8217;s the best thing about all this work that you&#8217;re doing?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
What do you mean the best thing?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I mean I could ask what&#8217;s the worst thing. I mean, I would imagine that you have some enjoyment out of this, Ayr√Ød?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. Honestly, I am one of those people that likes connecting with other human beings. I never thought I would&#8217;ve like, if you asked me this 10 years ago, that would not have been what I said. I very much am one of those people that enjoyed my alone time. I&#8217;m an only child. I like doing stuff on my own, solo traveler here, like all of that stuff. But I quickly realized over the past couple of years that I enjoy connections, I enjoy connecting with other human beings. I enjoy that experience. All of the things that I&#8217;m doing, I&#8217;ve realized that is the one common sort of thing that&#8217;s happening. I am able to step out of myself a little bit, step out of my world and connect with someone else in their world. That&#8217;s great. Like I enjoy that so much and it kind of makes life a little bit easier to live, at least, for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you feel creatively satisfied?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
For sure. Like right in this very moment in time, I would say I need a little bit more and I think maybe that&#8217;s what writing does for me in terms of satisfying that creativity. I think, yes. Sorry, I feel like I am creatively satisfied, especially when I wrap up a branding project and the client is happy with it. I was like, I know I did the right thing and I know I hit the mark on what it is that they were looking for and also, what it is that they needed?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
When they say things like, oh my gosh, I wasn&#8217;t expecting this, or like I get a lot of those kinds of reactions, which is pretty wild and fun and interesting. I think that does kind of satisfy that creativity, but I am also at that point where I&#8217;m at that 10 year mark. Because I moved here 10 years since I graduated from SCAD. I am feeling that itch of like, what now? What more? Where else? What can I do differently? Like what is the next step for me? You know what I mean? Like where do I go now? Do I pivot as we&#8217;ve been talking about so much on these past two years? Do I learn a new skill? What&#8217;s the next step in terms of that creativity and that flow and what I want?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Where do you see yourself for the next five years? What do you want this next chapter of your life to be?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
I definitely want to teach more. I would love to be able to get to a place where I can go from being a part-time lecturer to maybe a full-time lecturer. I think that would be really awesome. I kind of really see myself becoming, I want to step more into that brand identity designer shoe out of that whole graphic designer shoe, where I still kind of float around, meaning I still do anything under the hat of graphic design.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Even though, I focus a lot on branding, I kind of want to like be like, I am a brand identity designer and I am the person that you come to for that specifically and that alone. I kind of I want to eliminate as much options and kind of zone in and be more specific and intentional with what I&#8217;m doing. In five years, I&#8217;d like to be able to impart that knowledge more, more talking workshop opportunities. Hey, if I can give a TEDx talk in five years, that would be awesome. You know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
That&#8217;s kind of where I see things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your firm, about your work? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Ooh, I make it very, very easy. So I have my website. I technically have two, but for my business Ayr√Ød by Design, A-Y-R-I-D bydesign.com. That&#8217;s my website. I&#8217;m also the same thing Ayr√Ød by Design on Instagram, I have a very kind of unique name. I think I&#8217;m the only Ayr√Ød Chandler of there. So from a time you type that in, I think most of my stuff comes up, but those two places are kind of where you can start. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Ayr√Ød Chandler, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. Thank you really for just sharing, not just your story, but also I think giving us kind of a behind the scenes of what it&#8217;s like to run a business, particularly running it from another country and showing people out there, as you said, kind of right before we started recording, you said you wanted to let folks know that they&#8217;re not alone and that there&#8217;s a sense of community. And so, I hope that people will listen to this and they&#8217;ll sort of get exactly what you&#8217;re talking about. Like a lot of the experiences you shared are universal experiences to a lot of designers, to a lot of entrepreneurs. And so, even as you do your work with writing and teaching and everything, you&#8217;re not alone out there.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Ayr√Ød Chandler:</b><br>
Thank you for having me. I enjoyed this.</p>
