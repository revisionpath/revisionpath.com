Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>We have all had to change things up in one way or other over the past few years. But if you&#8217;re like this week&#8217;s return guest, Nakita M. Pope, there&#8217;s power in pivoting! (You might remember her from <a href="/jordan-taylor/" data-wpel-link="internal">my recent talk with Jordan Taylor</a>, or from <a href="/nakita-m-pope-2016/" data-wpel-link="internal">our 2016 interview</a>.)</p>
<p>Our conversation started with catching up on what&#8217;s happened over the past few years, and Nakita spoke about some of her recent projects, including launching a business course and a subscription box turned online community &#8212; <a href="https://bellabossbox.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Bella Boss</a>! We also talked about her work as a design educator, the recent closing of The Creative Circus, being awarded as an AIGA Fellow, and she shared how her passion projects have impacted her career. Nakita&#8217;s love for community and giving back really shines, and I think you&#8217;ll get really inspired by this interview!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Hi, I&#8217;m Nakita Pope. I am a designer, creative director, studio owner, and professor. I&#8217;m the chief chick at Branding Chicks, which is a boutique branding agency here in Atlanta, Georgia. And I specialize in brand strategy and brand development for women owned businesses and femme focused brands.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s the year been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, man, the year has been a little bit of a whirlwind. I was just talking to someone the other day and telling them that during the pandemic, everybody, well, a lot of people kind of slowed down. Everything got a little bit slower. The pace wasn&#8217;t as rigorous. For me, everything sped up a little bit. It was super busy. And so I feel like 2022 has been about wrapping up that kind of frenzied level of work and of coming back to center a little bit. So it&#8217;s been some ups and downs, but it&#8217;s been a good year. I can&#8217;t complain. It&#8217;s been a great year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything in particular that you want to try to accomplish this year, before the end of the year?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, man, get some rest. That is my goal by the end of this year. I am wrapping up some things right now, and that&#8217;s my goal is to take this last quarter of the year, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;ll be the whole quarter, but I definitely want to take some time at the end of this year to just sort of recenter myself and get some rest.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m always doing so many things at once. I kind of like it that way, as a creative, it keeps me from being bored. But I&#8217;m starting to realize that it&#8217;s been a very long time since I stopped everything. And so I&#8217;m looking forward to taking some space to do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Good. Definitely, take that space now before, say, oh, I guess before the winter really starts. But it kind of feels like any time between Thanksgiving and New Years is sort of a down period for everybody. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; hopefully, you&#8217;ll get a chance to get some of that rest. I think we all probably need that.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah, indeed. Indeed, more than we think.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Let&#8217;s talk about Branding Chicks. Now, you&#8217;ve been in business now for what, over 12 years, now, right?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s been a while. It went by so fast. That sounds crazy, 12 years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has your business changed since we last talked? That was back in 2016. How has your business changed?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
It&#8217;s changed quite a bit. A lot of it has stayed the same, but so much of it has changed. I think part of what has changed&#8230; Well, I&#8217;ll start with something that&#8217;s stayed the same. So one of the things that stayed the same is I kind of always worked remotely, because I have sort of a niche sort of brand. I feel like I end up working with people all over. And so it&#8217;s not specific to Atlanta, necessarily. And so that was always kind of how I worked. But now since the pandemic and all that stuff, I find that it&#8217;s expanding even more, because other people are now looking outside of their geographic locations even more.</p>
<p>And understanding that they can do really robust and deep work with people, even if they&#8217;re not necessarily in the same place or able to meet face to face. So I feel like that has both stayed the same and also changed. I feel that I&#8217;ve also been able to work with some amazing organizations that are doing really great work that I feel really strongly about, personally. I&#8217;ve been able to do some deeper dives with some brands, and do some larger projects with some of those brands. And to me that&#8217;s growth, to allow me to do more of what I want to be doing, and more of where I feel that I can have the best impact. That&#8217;s how I measure success. So in that space, I&#8217;m really happy with the direction that things are going in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you seen a change in the market with respect to the things clients are looking for? Have things shifted or changed during the pandemic?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. I think some of it, from a brand strategy standpoint, I&#8217;m noticing more and more that organizations and companies are starting to understand that even if they were already committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion, they are looking to build that and bake that into their brands a bit more. Which I love to see, because that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m passionate about as well. And I know that in some cases we see companies doing that, and we&#8217;re not sure if it&#8217;s going to stick.</p>
<p>But from my perspective, when I see companies that come to me for that and they are looking at the foundational parts of their brand and their brand personality and their core values and things like that, if they&#8217;re baking it into those things, then I find that they are more deeply passionate about it and more committed to it. So I see a lot of that happening on my end, which, like I said, I&#8217;m really happy to see. And it allows me to work in some of those spaces that I work in outside of my business, also, in my business. So it gives me a chance to bring some of that knowledge in, and also, help people build brands that they feel like really represents them in every way. So I see a lot of that shifting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When did you first see that shift? I&#8217;m curious.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I think 2020. I think when George Floyd happened, and so much of the conversation got so much louder. A lot of us have been talking about this for a long time, working in this space for a long time, both at the front lines and behind the scenes trying to make some of these things happen. But I think overarchingly after the nationwide, worldwide conversation got so much louder, I think that some of these companies are realizing that they need to change their ways. And/or if they were already committed to it, then they need to be even more vocal about their commitment. So I feel like that was the catalyst for a lot of it, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does a typical day look like for you now?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, man, it&#8217;s all over the place. Most days I am working on client work. Two days a week, I&#8217;m usually teaching as a professor. But other than that, some days I&#8217;m also consulting or I might have a public speaking engagement or doing things like this, doing a podcast interview. So it really varies quite a bit from day-to-day. But I kind of like that, it keeps me from being bored, and it gives me a chance to dive deeper into the things that I care about and the spaces that I work in a lot of different ways. It&#8217;s all connected. It doesn&#8217;t feel disjointed to me. It&#8217;s all connected in some way, but it gives me a chance to touch it in different ways.</p>
<p>And they all feed each other. So all the things that I learned with my client engagements brings me into the consulting with other clients. All of those experiences I can bring to my students, and give them a more robust education about how we work with clients and things that I&#8217;m working on, and what the industry looks like and all that stuff. And when I&#8217;m doing industry stuff, then I learn some other things and then bring it back to some of those other things. So I feel like it&#8217;s all connected, but it does allow me to have a different day, every day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious, has the pandemic changed business for you in any way? I know we talked about sort of have you seen a change in the market, but since the pandemic has started, has that shifted how you do business?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Not particularly, to be honest. I think just in terms of my processes and my creative process and stuff, that hasn&#8217;t changed very much. Like I said, I think more people are willing to work remotely. So that&#8217;s changed a little bit of the opportunities that I&#8217;ve been getting and people that are reaching out to work with me. I think from a logistical standpoint, I think more people want to be on video these days.</p>
<p>Like I said, I&#8217;ve worked with people all over the country for a while now, and most times people were completely fine with just a phone call. But now that everybody&#8217;s kind of been forced to work remotely, I think that video calls are now the go-to instead of the phone call. So from a logistical standpoint, that is something that I&#8217;ve seen that&#8217;s changed. Which I don&#8217;t mind most times, but it is definitely interesting to see a shift in that. But then I saw the uptick in it and then I saw the fatigue that came from it.</p>
<p>So now I&#8217;ve gone back to giving people a choice, &#8220;Listen, you don&#8217;t have to be on video if you don&#8217;t want to. Let me know what works best for you. I don&#8217;t want to make it more uncomfortable for you or make it more of a heavy lift to have this meeting.&#8221; So I try to be respectful of that too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I say that also when I have meetings, I actually have two separate booking links, one is for phone, one is for Zoom. And I&#8217;ll only give the Zoom to people that I like. People that I want to see, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You can get the Zoom call.&#8221; If you just hit me up out the blue and want something, a phone call is fine. It&#8217;s the same information. So I get what you&#8217;re saying though about having that option though. Because even I think with the fact that everybody&#8217;s getting on video, folks still have not really gotten used to it. We&#8217;re-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; what, two something years in and people are still like, &#8220;Oh, sorry about the background,&#8221; or the lighting is bad or whatever. And I&#8217;m not expecting studio quality video here-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
No, right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; even though we are very much in the future. I&#8217;m not expecting that. But I don&#8217;t know, sometimes it&#8217;s different. Plus, there&#8217;s all these different video platforms. There&#8217;s Zoom, there&#8217;s Google Meet, there&#8217;s WebEx. What else do I have installed? I have BlueJeans. I have Teams. I&#8217;m like, Just pick up the phone.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
It&#8217;s too much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right, just pick up the phone. It&#8217;s the same information. It&#8217;s the same information.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I&#8217;m going to have to steal that one. I might have two separate links too, now. Because mine was already set up, just the default was phone. And then I realized that all the instructions said, &#8220;I will give you a call at that time,&#8221; after they book. But I still get emails, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t ever see a link to a video call.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;That&#8217;s because it wasn&#8217;t really supposed to be one.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see a link.&#8221; Or sometimes what&#8217;ll happen with people is they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Oh, well I&#8217;m in the car going somewhere and I&#8217;m not going to be&#8230;&#8221; Just call me. Just call me.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
It really is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The phone still works. It did not go away in the pandemic. It still works. I see that one thing that you&#8217;re offering now is a course. You&#8217;re offering a course called Building a Business Brand. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
That was something that I did in collaboration with Small Business Invoicing Company. And they were looking to just build a library of resources for their small business audience. And so I was able to do that with them and it was really great. It was a series. I think there were three modules. But we just talked about the benefits and the value of being able to build a brand for your business. Whether you&#8217;re creative or not, regardless of what type of business you have, I think most of us start a business because we&#8217;re really passionate about what it is that we do. We&#8217;re passionate about whatever that skill set is, whatever product or service that we are putting out there in the world. And so that tends to be for most people where your area of expertise is.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re necessarily an expert at being able to brand yourself or market yourself. Even creatives that are in these spaces every day struggle with that, because it&#8217;s hard to figure out what your personal brand is or your business brand is. Sometimes it takes having some help from outside. But we just talked about the fundamentals of that, and how much of a difference it can make to distinguish you in your category.</p>
<p>I hear all the time where some people are getting ready to start new businesses or they come to me and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;I&#8217;m starting a business that&#8217;s this, fill in the blank. And people are telling me that I shouldn&#8217;t start a business in this, because it&#8217;s oversaturated and there&#8217;s already so many people doing that thing.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s really where branding comes in. The fact that you can establish a personality or some value-add or some way of talking about your product or service that&#8217;s different from everybody else is what&#8217;s going to stand out.&#8221; So it was really kind of built around that and it was super fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you thought about expanding into doing other courses?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, for sure. I&#8217;ve done lots of workshops here and there before, both under the umbrella of other organizations, and some independent ones on my own. And I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;m going to tackle this, because like I said, I&#8217;m trying to take a little bit of a break, but I&#8217;m looking at, one of the things that I see is that, for me, I really care so much about what it is that I do. And teaching is something that&#8217;s really close to my heart.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m always looking like, what do people need? What is it that people are struggling with? Or where can I have the most impact? And one of the things I see, especially for designers is that, and not just designers, actually people that are in marketing, for instance, some people who have design backgrounds or even people that are in coming from sales, often I hear people, &#8220;I want to talk about brand strategy. I want to get into that, but I have no idea how to make that transition.&#8221;</p>
<p>And for designers, especially going from strictly the visual identity and the creative side of things to talking heavily about strategy sometimes is a challenge. And it&#8217;s not because they&#8217;re not already doing it. Because that was my situation, in retrospect, I realized that I was always a strategic designer. That was always a big part of my process. But I didn&#8217;t necessarily put it out there. I didn&#8217;t explain all of my process to my clients necessarily. I didn&#8217;t build it into my proposals. It just wasn&#8217;t at the forefront. But it was there underneath all the time. Before I designed anything, I did all the research. I looked at their competitors, I did all these things. But I realized that for most designers, it&#8217;s hard to make that transition, because they don&#8217;t know how to reposition themselves in the market in that way.</p>
<p>And they don&#8217;t know what they don&#8217;t know. They don&#8217;t know what they need to know to be able to take those parts that they may already be doing, and be able to go deeper with that and really make it a big part of their practice. And because that&#8217;s part of the process that I really love, I&#8217;ve always been looking at how can I do more of this? And then of course at some point I had that fork in the road, where I had to decide, am I going to position myself in this way? Or am I just going to make this a bigger part of my design process?</p>
<p>And so when I started Branding Chicks, that was the pivot for me to decide that I was going to make brand strategies the thing that I led with. And I still do a lot of design for my clients, but I also am now in a place where, probably, about half of my clients, I&#8217;m only doing strategy for, I&#8217;m not necessarily creating any deliverables on the design side. So it&#8217;s kind of the best of both worlds.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I feel like we&#8217;ve started to see designers probably over the past maybe four or five years, start to lean more into that strategy. Because it&#8217;s been pushed a lot to say-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; &#8220;Yes, you can know how to do design, you can know the programs and the tools and the methods, but until you&#8217;re able to apply that in a business sense, then that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ll become truly effective.&#8221; Douglas Davis, who we both know, has a whole book about it. So it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re starting to see a lot of designers try to go into. The thing with the courses, though, I&#8217;m really interested about, because I feel like courses are something that, and I&#8217;m dating myself here, I&#8217;m thinking way back to 2010, probably, even a little bit earlier than that, but do you remember CreativeLive? Does that sound familiar to you?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yes, I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
CreativeLive used to do these multi-day courses with entrepreneurs would come in and they would teach. And I mean for the time it was pretty novel. I actually don&#8217;t even know what CreativeLive is doing now. But I know that something that is pushed on a lot of entrepreneurs, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, take the knowledge that put it into a course, and then sell the course.&#8221; Which is always an option, but are your clients going to be the same people that you want to sell your course to? It feels like it opens up a separate revenue stream, potentially. But then unless you&#8217;re just not a great salesman, that&#8217;s skills you have to tap into.</p>
<p>I tried to do courses when I had my studio, and even though I&#8217;ve taught before, I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to sell the course.&#8221; It didn&#8217;t feel right for me to sell the course. And I know that people do, this was actually a little bit before Skillshare, but people would do Skillshare and things like that. I taught at Mediabistro and I sort of did my courses that way. And it was easy because it was just like you had a PowerPoint, you had a microphone, you spoke all through the lessons and stuff like that.<br>
And it works, but it did add on, for me at least, it just added on this extra dimension of sales that I have to do. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;It&#8217;s not worth it. For the money that I&#8217;m getting from it, it&#8217;s not worth it for me trying to hustle on these courses. I&#8217;ll just get some more clients.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah, I totally get that. And I agree with you. I don&#8217;t think that any of the courses that I&#8217;ve done previously or the one that I&#8217;m going to be doing about brand strategy isn&#8217;t really targeted towards clients. It&#8217;s much more targeted to other creative professionals more than anything else. So I look at it as a form of professional development, I mean, because I did the one that you&#8217;re talking about in partnership with someone else, that was meant to be an evergreen course, so it was fully recorded and all that kind of stuff. And so they&#8217;ll have it for a while and their audiences can access it whenever.</p>
<p>The way that I&#8217;m approaching my brand strategy course is I&#8217;m looking at it as sort of a masterclass. I want it to be hands-on and I want it to be small and I want it to be in real time, because I enjoy that part of teaching. And I feel like there&#8217;s so much so to learn, there&#8217;s so much to share, and there&#8217;s so many questions that people always have that this is born out of my day-to-day, and people that ask me these questions or they send me emails and those kind of things. So I&#8217;m looking at how can I help them in real time? I want to answer your question, not a general question like yours. I want to answer your question.</p>
<p>So I feel like, for me, I&#8217;m looking at sort of a masterclass kind of thing more than an evergreen, pre-recorded course. I think there&#8217;s a lot of value in those as well, but I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s what I really want to do. I just like the hands-on so much more, so that&#8217;s the way that I&#8217;m looking at it. Yeah,</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I gotcha. So while we&#8217;re talking about teaching, I have to ask you about The Creative Circus. The Creative Circus is where you&#8217;ve taught for, how long have you been teaching there?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I think this is my 13th year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
13 years. It&#8217;s closing its doors. Jordan Taylor, who I had on a couple of episodes ago, we talked about that. How do you feel about it?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a set of mixed in motions. It really is. Other than some workshops here and there and some guest lectures and things like that, this has been my most continuous experience with teaching and it&#8217;s something that I truly love. So it&#8217;s always going to be something I truly love. I&#8217;ve seen so many talented people come through those doors, and it&#8217;s such an amazing alumni network. And so many people, I&#8217;m still connected to both that are still in the building, people that are graduates, former instructors, and things like that. So it&#8217;s a mixed set of emotions.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited about what my next chapter looks like. I know that frees up some mental and emotional space, and also some time to do some other things. So in some ways I&#8217;m excited about that, but I&#8217;m going to miss that place. I&#8217;m going to miss my students. So it&#8217;s definitely been some emotional times, up and down, over the last six months or so.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at that time, because you not only were there as a teacher, but you were advising, especially along DEI and stuff like that, what feelings in particular come to mind? Are there any sort of memories that you have specifically about your time there?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, so many. I think the things that stand out most to me is, as a teacher, the thing that you want the most is to watch someone&#8217;s light bulb go off. And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, man, I get it now.&#8221; And I&#8217;ve seen that happen over the years in multiple ways. Sometimes it&#8217;s about a course that I&#8217;m teaching, sometimes it&#8217;s about the DEI training that I might be doing, or it might just be those life conversations that I have with my students. I just love connecting with the students more than anything else.</p>
<p>So many of those moments are the ones that I hold close where they trusted me to tell me something about their lives or to ask for advice. I was able to help them with something that really made a difference for them in their professional careers or their academic careers. Those are the things that I&#8217;m going to keep close to my heart, because those are the things that let me know that I was having impact and made it all worth it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you step back and just look at, I guess, Atlanta as, I don&#8217;t know, I guess you could say a design education city, I feel like over, I&#8217;d say maybe the past 20 or so years, I mean, we had Atlanta College of Art, and then that went away. Now, there&#8217;s The Creative Circus that&#8217;s going away. I&#8217;ve heard there&#8217;s been some changes at The Portfolio center, which I think it&#8217;s now just called Miami Ad School, I believe.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Mm-hmm. It is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you feel about just the state of design education in the city? I mean, I feel like we&#8217;ve had these specialized colleges for a while that taught them, and then over the years they&#8217;ve sort of changed and went away in some way.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah, lots of changes over the years. I think some of it&#8230; Well, one of the things, like you said, this is definitely a design education city. When I was on the board with AIGA, I was running the education committee, and we have seven design programs in metro Atlanta. That is unheard of for even most other metropolitan cities. So even the more niche schools that you&#8217;re talking about, there&#8217;s still, Georgia State has design programs, Georgia Tech has design programs, University of Georgia, which we kind of still count. There&#8217;s other schools as well that have designed programs even outside of The Portfolio School, and more specialized schools and things like that.</p>
<p>So it was just such a breadth of education in that space. I think that some of the changes are good. I think some of them are going to have some ripple effects. I think one of the things that has always been a struggle, and I think with the changes in the programs it&#8217;s going to add to it, is that even though so many people have been educated in design here in the city or around the city, they tend to not stay in the community for their professional pursuits.</p>
<p>They get their education in this space and then they move to another place. Which nothing is wrong with that, but that has been part of the challenge is trying to retain that talent here. Because I think sometimes, especially for those students who might move into the city specifically to go to school, they don&#8217;t necessarily always have time while they&#8217;re in school to dive into the creative communities here in a real way. So they only see the little bubble that&#8217;s created for them by their programs. So they don&#8217;t necessarily get a chance to see all that&#8217;s available and what the real Atlanta creative community looks like. So when it&#8217;s time for them to look for a job, they don&#8217;t always consider staying.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like there&#8217;s an ongoing trend in Atlanta about not being able to retain, or I would say appreciate creative talent.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Nope.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Not just in design, I&#8217;m thinking specifically about music, but music, art, design, I feel like that&#8217;s an ongoing thing, where, and I mean we&#8217;re speaking of the city as it&#8217;s a person, but I don&#8217;t know if the city appreciates what it has and what it cultivates here to the point where people would want to stay here. There&#8217;s been several musicians that have blown up elsewhere, but when they were here in Atlanta, nobody would give them a chance. I&#8217;ve certainly had folks on the show who were from Atlanta, and they may have gotten their education here, but they had to go elsewhere to find opportunities or to do big things.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had other Atlanta folks that are, I would say, other educators and other business folks to ask, like, &#8220;Why do you think that&#8217;s the case? What is it about Atlanta that&#8217;s not making these people want to stay? Is it the workforce?&#8221; I would imagine there are other factors, just cost of living and traffic and stuff like that. But I even think about when I was in my 20s, I definitely, at one point. Wanted to leave. I was like, &#8220;I feel like I&#8217;ve hit a ceiling.&#8221; This is well before I started Revision Path. But I was like, &#8220;I feel like I&#8217;ve hit a ceiling in my career. I don&#8217;t know where else I can go from here, unless I move away.&#8221; Maybe that&#8217;s what plays into it. I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I think there&#8217;s a lot of factors. I think some of them, you&#8217;ve already tapped into. The other side of it, my experience is a little different from yours. I came here for grad school. I came here to go to Portfolio Center, which is now Miami Ad School. And I was going to finish my two years and I was going to just leave it open. Where do I end up? I don&#8217;t know. But everything is wide open for me. And so by the time I graduated, I was actually looking at moving to Seattle, but I graduated in the middle of a recession. So I shot my book all over the country, and people are like, &#8220;We love your work, but we&#8217;re on a hiring freeze. We&#8217;re not hiring anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>So that meant that I ended up staying here. I mean, it took me a little longer to find a job and all those things. So I was like, &#8220;Well, I guess I&#8217;ll just stay here for a while.&#8221; And so I ended up getting my first design job here. And I think, honestly, that&#8217;s the best thing that could have happened for me. The other thing I&#8217;m aware of is that my situation also isn&#8217;t everybody else&#8217;s, is that because I&#8217;m independent and I&#8217;ve been independent for so long, I never really went through the process of trying to move up in a creative agency completely.</p>
<p>I worked in agencies. I worked in in-house. I&#8217;ve done a lot of those things, but on the short term, or I did them for a little while. And so I did a lot of that moving around in the beginning. But for the last 12 years, I&#8217;ve worked for myself. And so for all of the things that come along with being an independent creative, and there are many, both positive and negative, I think one of the biggest positives, and I can say this in hindsight now, is that there is no ceiling when you&#8217;re on your own. When you&#8217;re on your own, you create your own path, for better or for worse. You might make some mistakes. Whatever those things look like, you&#8217;re on your own. So I feel like, for me, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d have been able to do all of the things that are available to me now had I stayed in a traditional agency environment for my entire career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
And I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the truth for everyone else. I know other people have taken that path and it&#8217;s worked out extremely well for them. I don&#8217;t know if it would&#8217;ve for me, and it&#8217;s hard for me to know, because I don&#8217;t have the opportunity to do both. I did some in the beginning, and now I&#8217;m here, and I think everybody&#8217;s path is their own.</p>
<p>But I do think about that often. What would that have looked like? And would I have gotten to a place where I was like, okay, like you said, I have to move away if I&#8217;m going to move up, or I have to go do this if I&#8217;m going to move up or whatever those things look like? So I think it&#8217;s different for everybody, but the landscape of what it looks like for different people and what your personal commitments are, and what kind of lifestyle you want to live and all those things really play into whether this is a good fit for you or not.</p>
<p>But on the flip side, I do think that Atlanta is a lot of creatives here. And I do feel like it&#8217;s a very supportive, creative community. So I don&#8217;t know, like you said, if the city itself does everything that it can, but I feel like once you find your people here, I feel like that network is amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I agree. I agree 100%. Once you get into that niche and you find those folks, you find your tribe, your people, whatever you want to call it, there&#8217;s no limit to the things that you can even work on. And to speak to what you said earlier, I did have to leave. I had to leave where I was AT&#038;T, strike out on my own, and then that&#8217;s when I started to really&#8230; Well, first of all, I could never have pictured staying AT&#038;T. There are people who I used to work with back then in 2008 that are still there. God bless them, because it couldn&#8217;t be me, could not be me. I say that to say, though, I mean, everyone has their path, for some folks staying in that very comfortable, crucible of being a production designer, if that&#8217;s what they want to do, that&#8217;s what they want to do.</p>
<p>I just knew that I could do better than where I was at. And this is not a slight on the people that are still there, but I could do better. And I just didn&#8217;t know, when I think about Atlanta in 2008, I mean this is pre SCAD. This is pre a lot of larger tech companies setting up offices in such here.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
True.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
This is pre Uber and Lyft. I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a car. Where am I going to find a good job? I got to catch MARTA somewhere, it&#8217;s wild.&#8221; So now I think the city is definitely different in that aspect. We do attract a lot of people that want to come here for, I think, just creative art stuff in general, not just for maybe design. But over the past 10 years, we&#8217;ve really blown up with television and entertainment.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And that opens up a lot of roles in the creative space. So the environment here has just gotten a lot more rich since then.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Agree. Agree, wholeheartedly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now speaking of the sort of Atlanta community, you mentioned AIGA. I just want to congratulate you on your recent AIGA Fellow Award.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Such a great honor. AIGA, for those of you out there that don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s sort of the national body of professional organization for designers. And so we&#8217;ve got chapters all over the country. The Atlanta chapter has been active for a really long time. And each chapter has the opportunity to award fellow awards to people in their community that they feel have really moved forward the area of design or made impact on the local, regional, and national level.</p>
<p>And I think our chapter has honored 32 people, possibly. No, 16 people. It&#8217;s a very short list, so I was honored for 2021. We just had the celebration a couple months ago, because of the pandemic and everything. But I was given the honor in 2021. So that was a magical moment for me. It gave me an opportunity to really celebrate my community and celebrate all the things that I&#8217;ve been able to do and touch, and people that I&#8217;ve been able to meet in this community. So it was really a great night.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I&#8217;m glad that the community has come around you to recognize all of the great work that you&#8217;ve been doing, and to have their support for you. So that&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah, it was a great honor. It was a great honor.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now speaking of other projects, I see that you have this project called the Bella Boss Box. How did you come up with the idea for doing a subscription box?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
So we talked about having your people. I feel like, I don&#8217;t know about you, but my friends are the ones that always get me into stuff, especially my creative friends. They&#8217;re the ones that call you with a bright idea and be like, &#8220;So this is what I&#8217;m thinking.&#8221; So it was kind of similar to that. One of my good friends, Nekeidra Taylor, and actually we met through a client. A client of mine introduced me to her because she was like, &#8220;I think you guys should meet.&#8221; And so this was years ago. And so we&#8217;ve been friends and professional colleagues for a while.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s in public relations. And so during the pandemic, we hadn&#8217;t done our normal check-ins or have coffee here and there, kind of thing. And so we finally had a check-in call, and we were just catching up and talking. And we just ended up talking about our journeys as entrepreneurs and what the pandemic had been like and our support systems and things like that. And the fact that without those support systems, we wouldn&#8217;t have been able to do half of the things that we&#8217;ve been able to do.</p>
<p>And so from that conversation, we started thinking about what must it be like for people, especially women, who are starting businesses or running businesses who don&#8217;t have that support system. I think that I&#8217;ve been lucky, personally, because of my network and people who&#8217;ve introduced me to other people or just friends of mine who I&#8217;ve been friends with for a long time, but who are now also business owners as well. And even if your friends and your family support you in what you&#8217;re doing, and sometimes they won&#8217;t, sometimes they just won&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>But even if they do, if they&#8217;ve never done it before, they still don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s actually like. And so sometimes it helps to have someone that you can pick up the phone and call and ask a question, and feel like it&#8217;s a safe space to ask a question. Or to just vent and be like, &#8220;Look, I&#8217;m about to go work at Popeye&#8217;s.&#8221; That used to be mine when I was really frustrated with being an entrepreneur. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yep, I&#8217;ll just go and work at Popeye&#8217;s. I like chicken. It&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>And you need those people that you can call and say that, and they totally get it. You don&#8217;t have to explain it, you don&#8217;t have to do anything. They&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s that day, huh? Mm-hmm. So what happened?&#8221; And so that&#8217;s kind of how it was born. We talked about it and she&#8217;s like, &#8220;No, I think you should do&#8230;&#8221; We talked about a subscription box. How could we build a community of women that would be able to connect with each other in that way? So we came up with the idea for a subscription box, and I was like, That would be really cool.&#8221; And she&#8217;s like, &#8220;You should definitely do it.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, I should do it. Why, I got to do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>And so she&#8217;s like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time to do it.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not doing it if you&#8217;re not doing it.&#8221; And then next thing I know, we&#8217;re setting up an actual call to talk about it. And that was October 2020. And so we planned this whole thing and launched the whole thing during the pandemic. We launched in April 2021. We hadn&#8217;t seen each other in person until March 2021. So this was all done on Zoom, during the pandemic. Even though she lives here, we were still kind of staying away from everybody and stuff. So it was kind of crazy.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s been awesome. I feel like we&#8217;ve connected with some really amazing women all over the country who have a multitude of different types of businesses and things like that. And then just this summer we decided that we were going to pivot a little bit. The subscription box was going really well. As a designer, it was awesome. It gave me an opportunity to create things specifically for that community. We had a zine. I was designing products for the boxes, and I did all the branding for the boxes themselves, and all that stuff. And she&#8217;s in PR. She did a lot of the writing and things like that. So we really were a good fit to compliment each other.</p>
<p>But this summer we looked at everything and kind of like we tried to have those moments where we stop everything and start working on the business instead of in it. And okay, where are we? And where do we want to be? And we felt like the community part of it wasn&#8217;t getting as much shine as we really wanted. That was why we built this thing in the first place, so we decided to take a break and regroup and relaunch just the community.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re still kind of working on that. We&#8217;re taking a break. She&#8217;s busy. I&#8217;m busy. We both have separate businesses on top of this one. So we&#8217;ve decided to just take a break for a little while, really get grounded in what we want, and then relaunch again. Preferably, we want to do an online community so that we have a chance to provide deeper relationships for the women that are our subscribers. So that&#8217;s what we really want to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So you&#8217;re pivoting from the subscription box to an online community. So just sort taking that notion and deepening it, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yes, exactly. Exactly. Because I think what we heard from our subscribers was that they love the items in the box, and they love so much of that stuff and the magazine and all those things, but they really love the idea of being exposed to other women who were doing amazing things and hearing about people&#8217;s businesses. And we would do this series called Respect on Our Name. So we would do interviews with black women entrepreneurs on Instagram. So people really responded to those kind of things a little bit more than the items in the box. And so much of the stuff in the box was also about providing resources and information. So we felt like we could wrap that all up and also bring the community to a higher level if we pivoted a little bit. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re looking at doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you interviewed me back in 2018 for Design Observer, and during that interview you had asked me how passion projects have impacted my career. Now I want to flip the script and ask you that question. How have your passion projects impacted your career?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Lots of different ways. I think Bella Boss is definitely one of those passion projects. I probably would&#8217;ve done that even if it wasn&#8217;t a business. That&#8217;s just something I&#8217;m passionate about. I&#8217;m passionate about seeing Black women shine and succeed and women in general. And I think running a business has been such an adventure for me in so many ways. And I think that I know what it&#8217;s like even when you have support. I can&#8217;t imagine what it&#8217;s like when you don&#8217;t have support. So I always try to be that support or give people resources wherever I can. So I think Bella Boss is definitely something I would consider to be a passion project.</p>
<p>Mentoring is another passion of mine. Almost everything that I&#8217;ve done has come from something that holds a special place in my heart. Teaching is just more of mentorship for me. So mentorship and teaching are very much tied together. I&#8217;ve done a lot of public speaking, and I used to be terrified of public speaking. But the thing that shifted public speaking for me was looking at it as a bigger classroom. And because I love teaching so much, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, you just get a chance to share knowledge with more people.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I feel like those aspects of my career have come out of the passion of wanting to share with other people. Branding is so much about being creative and solving problems and all those kinds of things. And I think all of those things are core to my personality and core to the things that I care about.</p>
<p>One of the stories that I love the most about when I was a kid is that my mom told me that I used to love puzzles. And so she would buy me all these different puzzles. So because I had so many, I got to a point where I would literally dump all the pieces out in the middle of the floor and solve them all at one time. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s pretty much what I do every day. Mm-hmm. That&#8217;s pretty much the life that I&#8217;ve built for myself.&#8221; So when I think about things like that, I feel like all the things that I care about or that&#8217;s fun for me, or that&#8217;s interesting for me has been the foundation of every single thing that I do every day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How have you built your confidence over the years as a creative professional? I mean, you&#8217;ve been doing this for a very long time. That longevity obviously has to come from somewhere. What fuels you as a creative professional?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I try not to stop learning. As a teacher, I feel like you have to learn all the time. But even outside of that, I think I&#8217;ve always been naturally curious. And so for me, I want to ask more questions. I want to learn more. I want to talk to all the people that know the things that I don&#8217;t know. I want that, that&#8217;s what feeds me. And so I feel like confidence for me comes from knowledge and it comes from experience. And sometimes you have one without the other or vice versa, and then sometimes you have both. And I think over the years, I&#8217;ve just tried to learn as much as I possibly can on a day-to-day basis. And because of the years behind me, now I have the experience as well. But in the beginning, I didn&#8217;t have all the experience. I just had the knowledge and I had the willingness to learn.</p>
<p>And I think, if nothing else, I feel like those are the two things that has allowed me to grow the most and to be willing to take a chance. I can&#8217;t stress that enough. So many of the things that I&#8217;ve been able to do or that I&#8217;ve done that I can look back and be the most proud of are the things that terrified me in the beginning. If it doesn&#8217;t make me want to vomit a little bit when I say yes to it, then it is probably not going to make me grow. And so going back to our previous conversation just about being an independent and how that looks so different for me, I think the flexibility to try a bunch of new things and different things and to take on new challenges, I&#8217;ve had the flexibility to do that for the last 12 years, and I&#8217;ve taken full advantage of that.</p>
<p>If someone comes to me and says, &#8220;Hey, I really think you should do this thing.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never done that thing before. I don&#8217;t know much about that thing. Let me go learn some more about that thing and then decide.&#8221; And then if I decide, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s going to be a challenge, but I&#8217;m going to do it anyway.&#8221; I feel like that&#8217;s where all the growth comes from. And those are the things that have allowed me to be more confident. Not just because of what I already know, but because of the fact that I&#8217;m willing to take a chance and willing to take on the challenge.</p>
<p>I know that I&#8217;ve done that before and I didn&#8217;t die. And I made some mistakes, but most of the time it went pretty well. I&#8217;m like, that just gives me more confidence to do it again to something that&#8217;s unknown that I&#8217;ve never done before. I was just like, &#8220;Okay, I did that. Everything was fine. Okay, let&#8217;s try it again.&#8221; So I think so much of that is just taking chances too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Whose work are you inspired by right now?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, quite a few people. Some of them are visual, of course, and then some of them are just community-based kind of things. I love what Kenny Thacker is doing with a 100 Roses from Concrete in the advertising industry. I think the programming that they&#8217;re putting together and the resources that they&#8217;re providing for young Black people are just amazing.</p>
<p>Visually, I am a big fan of Bisa Butler and her work, and right now I just can&#8217;t get enough of it. My best friend bought me one of her coffee table books for Christmas, and it&#8217;s like one of my prize possessions right now. But I get inspiration from so many different places and I&#8217;m like discovering new people every day, truly every day. That&#8217;s why I tell my students all the time that I use social media as a curation tool.</p>
<p>So I usually don&#8217;t care how many people follow me, but on any of my platforms, if you go look at them, I probably follow three times more people than follow me, because I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Ooh, I want to see what this person is doing.&#8221; &#8220;Ooh, what is this person doing?&#8221; Ooh, I didn&#8217;t know about this artist. Let me follow them.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Ooh, that agency&#8217;s doing that. Let me follow them.&#8221; So I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;I just want all that good stuff coming in my feed when I log it on.&#8221; So I find new stuff and new people and new agencies and organizations and artists all the time. And that&#8217;s part of what feeds my creative process too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What haven&#8217;t you done yet that you want to do?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I want to travel the world. I do travel. I don&#8217;t travel as much as I would like to, but I would like to hit the majority of the countries before I leave this Earth, so that&#8217;s one thing. Another is I need to finish my book. I think the last time I was on with you, I might have talked about my book and it has been sitting in a dark closet for a long time. I did the first draft of it, and then I just kind of let it go. In retrospect, I think I might&#8217;ve just gotten scared and was like, &#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t do this.&#8221; But I definitely want to revisit it. I&#8217;m going to pick it up again. I still feel like the subject matter is important. I think it&#8217;s still relevant and I still want to do it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a book about branding, and I just feel like there&#8217;s not enough resources out there that make it plain what branding really is. And I think especially for entrepreneurs who are trying to build a brand and don&#8217;t know what that means, or even for individuals who are trying to build a brand for themselves and don&#8217;t know how to do that, I think that there&#8217;s a lot of insight, hopefully, that I can provide. So I definitely want to tackle that and get it back up and running. I just hate that I didn&#8217;t finish it, so it&#8217;s got to get finished.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I think if you go back and take a look at it, especially with all the knowledge you&#8217;ve gained now, you&#8217;ll probably see some things in there that you can update, that you can maybe add to-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
For sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; or something. So take your-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Definite change.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; time with it. Take your time with it. I mean, the thing with books, I mean, I&#8217;m finding this out myself as I&#8217;m working on a book, which I guess is a sort a scoop. I mean by the time this comes out, people will know that I&#8217;m working on a book about Revision Path. But-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Ooh, I&#8217;m excited.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve been working on a book about Revision Path and it has been a journey. Because at first I was like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, I&#8217;m going to do it about the show or whatever.&#8221; And I was talking to my editor and he is like, &#8220;No, you have to go deeper.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;There&#8217;s not really that much to it. I wanted to do the show, and I did the show.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;No, you have to go, go back further. Where did the seed start?&#8221; And it&#8217;s taken me all the way back to my childhood. It&#8217;s like a therapy session-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I love it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; trying to get through this book. I mean, I don&#8217;t know when it&#8217;s going to come out because I&#8217;m still working on&#8230; Well, one, I&#8217;m working on the proposal, but then just even all of the thought to go into how I&#8217;m going to approach the story and talk about it and everything, it&#8217;ll be good when it comes out. It&#8217;ll be sort of parts autobiography part about the show, but-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, man. That sounds awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; it&#8217;s a lot. It&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yes, it is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
It is a lot. And I think it is a major undertaking. So I feel like even when I started it several years ago, I told myself that even being willing to take on a project that big, is a victory, period.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Full stop.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; absolutely. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Regardless of what happens after that, that is a victory.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want the next chapter of your legacy to be?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
To be honest, I&#8217;m kind of leaving it up to the universe a little bit. I think part of this break that I&#8217;m taking is just about getting some rest and giving myself a chance to take a break and be able to hear my own voice about what I want next. The benefit of all the work and the thing, the people that I&#8217;ve been connected to and done stuff with and collaborated with, it&#8217;s such a blessing that I have several opportunities to do things next, but I want to make sure that I make the right move. I want to make sure that what I&#8217;m doing next is going to be fulfilling, that it&#8217;s going to allow me to grow, because that&#8217;s always something that I want. I never want to stop growing. So I&#8217;m really taking a break just so that I can hear my own voice and decide what&#8217;s next.</p>
<p>But also I&#8217;m taking my hands off of it a little bit and sort of letting things unfold the way that they should unfold. I think sometimes, and I&#8217;ve had to learn this the hard way, because sometimes I just want to plan everything, but so often when we try to make plans, the plans that we make are coming from our perspective. You can&#8217;t plan something that you don&#8217;t know about to some degree. But I think that sometimes you need to let there be some divine intervention, some universe to step in, because sometimes the things that we think we want next isn&#8217;t big enough, because we can&#8217;t see it yet.</p>
<p>And so I feel like I don&#8217;t know what it is, but in my heart, I feel like that&#8217;s where I am. I&#8217;m at that kind of space where it&#8217;s time for something big, but I don&#8217;t know what that thing is, yet. So I&#8217;m just going to center myself and take some time and figure out what that is. Branding Chicks, of course, will still be part of the equation, at least for now, but I feel like there&#8217;s so much more to do and so many more people to have fun with and create with. So I&#8217;m excited about whatever it ends up being, to be honest. I just don&#8217;t know all of what it is yet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I think that&#8217;s a good place to be though. To know that you have this possibility or all these possibilities ahead of you and just be excited for what that could be. That&#8217;s a great place to be, because a lot of folks are stuck if they don&#8217;t know what or whatever they think might be coming next is just more of the same thing. So to have that, I guess, opportunity to dream in that way, that&#8217;s priceless. That&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
You have to believe it first. That&#8217;s what believing really is, right? If it was already concrete and set in stone, then you don&#8217;t have to believe in it. It&#8217;s just there. So sometimes you have to just believe that it&#8217;s going to be great and that it&#8217;s coming and that it&#8217;s yours, and that you&#8217;re going to have what you&#8217;re supposed to have, period. I believe that. So I don&#8217;t know all of what that&#8217;s going to look like. I don&#8217;t know all the details, but I do believe that I&#8217;m going to have what I&#8217;m supposed to have and I think it&#8217;s going to be good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
You can check us out at brandingchicks.com. That&#8217;s where you can find all of my work there. And Bella Boss is bellabossbox.com. The site is on hiatus right now while we pivot, but you can still find us there. And also on social media, you can check out Branding Chicks, both on Instagram and Facebook, and for Bella Boss Box, also on Instagram, Facebook, and I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re on Twitter, no, but Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, Sounds good. Well, Nakita Pope, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I feel like every time that I see you, and I know that you and I haven&#8217;t seen each other in a while, because of-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; the pandemic, but every time I see you, you are such a just bright light of just like energy and positivity. And I know that the Atlanta community, of course, knows this, that&#8217;s why you have that AIGA Fellow Award. But when I think of somebody that is always such a positive, just, influence in the design community locally and otherwise, I think of you. So I&#8217;m just-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Thank you very much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; so glad that you&#8217;re still doing your thing. I&#8217;m excited to see what you come up with next. And thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you so much for that. And thank you for always supporting me. And I love these conversations, whether they happen on the podcast or not, where we&#8217;re just catching up. So thank you so much. I appreciate it.</p>
