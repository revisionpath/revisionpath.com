Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>It&#8217;s no secret that stories from comic books and graphic novels have dominated the pop culture landscape since the early 2000s. However, the heroes in those stories that you see often don&#8217;t represent the true diversity out there in the real world. That&#8217;s where Manuel Godoy comes in. As the CEO of <a href="https://www.blacksandsentertainment.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Black Sands Entertainment</a>, he is the engine behind one of the most exciting and barrier-braking publishing houses in the nation. And with over 5,000 investors and over 200,000 books sold, it&#8217;s easy to see why!</p>
<p>We started our conversation fresh off of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKPnD6ajTig" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Manuel&#8217;s recent Shark Tank appearance</a>, and he talked about how his company stands apart from other indie publishers, and how he&#8217;s leveraged social media to build a massive base of supporters and investors. Manuel also spoke about his time in the military, how he&#8217;s scaled Black Sands Entertainment over the years, and where he wants to take the company in the future. Hollywood, watch out &#8212; Manuel has created a movement that has no signs of stopping!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
My name is Manuel Godoy, the CEO of Black Sands Entertainment. I am a writer, I am a publisher, and I also run an animation studio, so I have a lot of things going on. But my goal is to make black history before slavery a relevant thing, and we&#8217;ve been doing that pretty well over the last five years. So I&#8217;m thankful for you having me today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. How has this year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been going pretty good. I mean, we started the year off with a Shark Tank episode so momentum is definitely on our back right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to just go ahead and just jump right into Black Sands Entertainment. I spent a lot of time yesterday and actually over the past few days just checking out the app, checking out the titles and everything. For those of who are listening who may not be familiar, can you give an introduction to what Black Sands Entertainment is and what it&#8217;s about?</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Yes. Black Sands Entertainment is a comic book publisher who also does different mediums. So we also have digital content on BSE comics. We have animations and stuff like that. But our bread and butter is comic books, and most of our comic books are about black history before slavery. We have plenty of titles about that. We expanded significantly last year from three or four different titles to about 16 now. And we&#8217;re just on the move, like constantly moving forward, trying to tell the story about our people that&#8217;s not always negative. I felt like there&#8217;s too much negative content out there for black Americans to consume and that we need to have something more on a positive side, some kind of legacy that we could live up to. So even if you have very humble beginnings, you can still see a great path forward in your life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love, love, love that whole message of doing that. And I mean, in a way that&#8217;s kind of what&#8217;s&#8230; I mean, I don&#8217;t want to say that what we&#8217;re doing is the same, but I think in terms of trying to make sure to uncover the history that people may not know about, I totally completely vibe with that idea. What does a typical day look like for you? I mean, it sounds like you&#8217;re juggling a lot of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Oh, it&#8217;s chaotic. There&#8217;s no typical day. That&#8217;s why I need to hire some staff, right? I&#8217;m currently looking for an editor-in-chief. Well, not an editor-in-chief, but a lead editor for our company so they could take that side of the publishing side of my life off my hands. But yeah, we&#8217;re definitely looking for ways to break up my days, because my days are purely chaotic. I think I spend maybe 10% of my time actually making content because I&#8217;m in charge of so many things. So I would love to get that to 40% if possible. But my typical days are purely chaotic. We have a lot of press, we have a lot of scouting and recruiting and negotiating. Of course, I have to be very relevant on social media, so that&#8217;s also a big factor in my life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I see you are super active on TikTok. I watched probably most of the videos that you&#8217;ve got up. How has social media helped you as you build Black Sands Entertainment?</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Well, it just gives me independence. One thing is it&#8217;s a new age nowadays, that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t really knock companies like Milestone Media, right? It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m not a fan of their business model, how they originally started, but I don&#8217;t knock them for it because there was limited options in the 90s. It&#8217;s not like they had much of a choice, right? But to work with the industry. Social media nowadays allows us to completely circumvent the traditional gatekeepers of this space. And so we can make our own customer bases, we can get our own investors without having to basically go through the&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Also, big shout out to Barack Obama for allowing Regulation CF to even exist in the first place, because prior to that, you had to be basically rich and white to invest in any small company. You weren&#8217;t going to get investments from people unless you had significant connections already. And now with Regulation CF, companies like ours and even other businesses, black-owned, can actually go out to the community and raise capital through unaccredited investors, right? So that&#8217;s a huge thing that happened recently. So I think the technology, the ability to go directly to your consumers, gives people with the drive to really scale and grow and make a difference without having to basically change their fundamental beliefs in order to be successful. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And just for folks that are listening, Regulation CF is Regulation Crowdfunding. And one of the rules for that is that you can raise, I think it&#8217;s like a maximum of $5 million through crowdfunding over a 12-month period. I know that&#8217;s one of the rules of it, right?</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s for unaccredited investors. So after that you go into Regulation A and then you have to do only accredited investors, right? That&#8217;s a lot of money for most people. Companies that are raising $5 million rounds, they tend to be ready to go at that point. They&#8217;re not struggling anymore. Now they&#8217;re in market and they know what they&#8217;re doing and they&#8217;re trying to scale. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean the advent of crowdfunding overall I think has really helped a lot of independent creators to get their ideas out there in the market. I remember&#8230; And I mean, this didn&#8217;t start with Kickstarter, but I know Kickstarter was probably one of the more prominent platforms that was really trying to build on this sort of&#8230; I guess, build on this idea that creatives can fund their own ideas through their fans and Patreons and stuff like that. But I remember when it came around 2009, 2010, it was hard to get people on board with even the idea of crowdfunding. And now it&#8217;s pretty common to use Kickstarter or use similar platforms to be able to raise money like that.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
It&#8217;s definitely something that just gives us freedom. So I think that&#8217;s what was the downfall of Milestone Media. I think they had great IP. They probably had great numbers: sales, but it wasn&#8217;t to the liking of DC and Diamond, so they killed them, right? DC and Diamond said, &#8220;Die.&#8221; And they had no choice, they had to die because they had signed deals with them, right? And now they&#8217;re trying to revive them because of the Black Lives Matter movement, right? So they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Hey, this is a great time to have a black imprint,&#8221; right? But at the end of the day, they let them go away for 30 years. So why should you believe them now and their generosity, I mean and their genuineness for the revival of Milestone?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I just heard recently, Milestone was supposed to have like a black history comic that came out during Black History Month and now they pushed it back until June. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s not Black History Month, but whatever.&#8221; But yeah, when you&#8217;re beholden to like these larger corporate interests, it does stifle innovation in that way.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Absolutely. Yeah. So we&#8217;re lucky that we never have to deal with that. And as a result we&#8217;re pretty much not only successful, but now we know our customers. So the big part about it is with social media is you know your customers, right? It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s some, &#8220;Oh man, I wonder what kind of customer I have?&#8221; That&#8217;s something you have when you go to someone like Diamond Distribution or go to comic book shops, you still don&#8217;t know who the heck your customer really is. But with social, you know exactly who your customer is, so you can refine your acquisition over time. You know how to sell, you know who to sell it to, right? You know how to message. It&#8217;s all powerful just because you&#8217;re doing the right distribution.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, this feeds into my next question which I feel like you may have just sort of answered, but how are you ensuring that Black Sands really distinguishes itself from other indie publishers out there?</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Well, one thing is I don&#8217;t feel like we&#8217;re in the indie publishing space anymore to be considered another indie publisher at this point. Last year we did 1.2 million in sales, sold 120,000 books, right? And we&#8217;re just bringing online a whole bunch of new titles from our creators. So it&#8217;s going to be a huge year for us. Our main niche is history before slavery. We don&#8217;t do superheroes much at all.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Really.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
That&#8217;s not our thing at all. I think we have like one superhero title and that&#8217;s it. Only because the creator has a sizable audience already, so we gave him a shot. We were like, &#8220;Hey, you a got a sizable audience. Let&#8217;s see if we can make your comic into a reality. And see if your audience will tap in.&#8221; And they really have been tapped in, so that&#8217;s a good one.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
But for the most part, we wouldn&#8217;t try to do superheroes because that market is closed with Marvel and DC. It&#8217;s just closed. There&#8217;s no point even trying to compete with them. That&#8217;s them. They own that genre. I wanted to go for a genre that was 100% ours to own, and that is history before slavery. So mythology, fantasy, history, drama, all that stuff in an ancient setting or an ancient location or something like that is what we do. It&#8217;s not just Egypt, we have stories about Madagascar, the Mali empire, Moorish Spain, the Inca, right? The Malaysians, right? We just got a whole bunch of anticolonial rhetoric. That&#8217;s our power. That&#8217;s where we make our content, and that&#8217;s why everybody buys our stuff because it&#8217;s more of the good stuff, right? When they buy our books, they know it&#8217;s not going to be different or a different kind of vibe. It&#8217;s more of the stuff they want to have. More exposure to indigenous people, to people from diaspora and their actual culture, as opposed to the indoctrination of European powers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, I really like that. Years and years ago&#8230; God, I&#8217;m trying to remember when that was. Maybe 2015, 2016, we had an African comic creator from Cameroon who was making a&#8230; He had, I think it was a line of comic books, as well as a video game that was around African traditions and African mythology and stuff like that. And I remember him giving a similar reason as you just had in terms of like, it&#8217;s a lot more relevant to the audience that they&#8217;re trying to serve to talk about it in terms of history or to talk about history, than to create some superhero kind of aesthetic, which I think at the time he was saying was really more rooted in the west. Again, this is coming from an African perspective, but yeah.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, that&#8217;s the one thing about it. It&#8217;s I know for a fact that it&#8217;s a good thing for us to have this stuff, right? Without nobody messing up our power. We got to have our power and people really underestimate how much it matters for us to own the narrative and stuff like that. I mean, there&#8217;s too much crap they add to our stories just to go and control the narrative. One of the biggest examples I have is the recent movie that&#8217;s probably going to be played all across America. In every single school in America there&#8217;s probably going to be Harriet coming on. They&#8217;re going to be like, &#8220;Hey kids, let&#8217;s watch Harriet. It&#8217;s so great.&#8221; Talk about Harriet Tubman, right? They&#8217;re not going to use any other content for Harriet Tubman. They&#8217;re going to use the movie Harriet as the example, and that one is 100% fictional.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
They had a black man who was the main villain of the story, a bounty hunter armed to the teeth in the South, because I guess they didn&#8217;t just Lynch black people who had guns in the South, right? Who&#8217;s the mythical villain that&#8217;s the main threat to Harriet Tubman. That&#8217;s some wild&#8230; They get 1,000 pitches a year for Harriet Tubman films, and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;You know what? The one that we&#8217;re going to spend $10 million to produce is this one,&#8221; right? And you just got to be like, &#8220;Wow, this is probably the only one that had that situation in it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I remember there being a big criticism of that movie. For folks that are listening, it&#8217;s the Harriet movie with, I think Cynthia Erivo plays Harriet Tubman. I heard that was a big criticism of it, that the part you just mentioned about having a black antagonist as well.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Yeah, and it&#8217;s not even real. He&#8217;s not real.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, they manufactured him for the movie.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s like what is that? That&#8217;s them sabotaging a very&#8230; Like to me, even my fans, right? And a lot of people, there&#8217;s a reason why Yasuke flopped on Netflix, right? It&#8217;s like, all you had to do is tell the story of Yasuke. You didn&#8217;t have to make it about mecha robots and supernatural aliens. You didn&#8217;t have to do all that. Just tell the story of Yasuke, it would&#8217;ve been great. You know what I&#8217;m saying? You know what I&#8217;m saying? It&#8217;s like they go so far over like we just can&#8217;t have history connected to black folks, right? In a positive light. We got to make it different. We got to make it more marketable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, there were&#8230;. That&#8217;s funny because I remember when that came out and a lot of people were like, &#8220;Oh man, this is so good.&#8221; And I remember watching and being like, &#8220;Really? It&#8217;s not good.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
That was media hype, right? But once you actually got people who actually watched, they were like, &#8220;Why are we doing this?&#8221; They were like, &#8220;He&#8217;s not even the main character.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He&#8217;s the main character there. There is like you said all these weird supernatural elements to it. And then I also think it was just too short. They tried to put too much into six episodes and it just&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t think it was good at all.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
And the littlest part was the actual historical parts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Where there was flashbacks of his time with Nobunaga. It was like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s amazing.&#8221; And then all of a sudden it&#8217;s back to, &#8220;Okay, trash story.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I would imagine probably one benefit of you using these historical stories and mythology and stuff like that is it takes out that comparison element. If you&#8217;re doing superheroes, for example, people might look at this and be like, &#8220;Oh, well this is just like, blah, blah, blah from Marvel.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
You can&#8217;t do that. And that&#8217;s a huge power to us. They can&#8217;t compare us, right? So the critics have to actually make a well-informed decision. They can&#8217;t just say, &#8220;Oh, this is just like this except you&#8230;&#8221; Or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ll tell you a story. I think I told this story on the show before maybe like, I don&#8217;t know, hundreds of episodes ago. But when I was younger, when I was a teenager, I really was into&#8230; I mean, I&#8217;m still into comic books now, and maybe not in the same fervor, but I was really into comic books and was like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m going to make my own comic books.&#8221; And I was in rural Alabama just drawing stuff up or whatever. And this is back when Yahoo had these user groups online, like Yahoo groups. And they had one that was dedicated to black comic books. I think it was called Black Comix with an X, like B-L-A-C-K C-O-M-I-X. And I remember going in there and I was showing off my stuff like that. And one of the people who had responded, one of the people who responded was the Dwayne McDuffie, had responded back to it and trashed it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But he trashed it, I mean, not in a good way, but certainly trashed it in the way of like, &#8220;Oh, this is just like, blah, blah, blah from Marvel.&#8221; It was that sort of comparison, which honestly I was literally basing it off of that. I was looking at Marvel comic books and trying to make the Black Cyclops or whatever. You know what I&#8217;m saying? He trashed it. I was like, &#8220;Oh, shit. I can&#8217;t believe I was trying to do that.&#8221; And then I didn&#8217;t really know who Dwayne McDuffie was then. Of course people know who he is now in terms of his contributions. But yeah, I can see how not going that superhero route is a definite unique selling proposition and advantage for you in the market.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Yeah. You definitely don&#8217;t want to get caught in that bubble where you end up basically doomed from the start.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
It&#8217;s like you can&#8217;t get market cap because it&#8217;s already taken up. And what we&#8217;re trying to do is the exact opposite. We&#8217;re trying to basically develop a market from the ground up and then dominate that to the point where if you make anything they&#8217;re going to be like, &#8220;Oh, like Black Sands or like this title from Black Sands Entertainment.&#8221; And it starts being like we&#8217;re the gatekeepers, right? So they&#8217;ve been avoiding this topic for 50 years, so nobody better complain at all when we dominate this space and then gate keep. &#8220;Oh, man, listen&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;Nah, bro. Y&#8217;all had 50 years to do this. Y&#8217;all ain&#8217;t never did it, so we got to gate keep.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true. That&#8217;s true. Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit. I know we&#8217;ve talked a good bit about Black Sands, and we&#8217;ll talk more about it later, but I want to know about your origin story since we&#8217;re in the vein of comics here. Tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
I was born and raised in New York, right? Queens specifically. And also some time in Alabama as well. Pretty cool. At the end of the day, New York is a different kind of place, man. You got to really embrace new ideas. Everything changes in freaking two years in New York, nothing stays the same, right? So that was always a huge thing for us was that times change a lot faster in New York than anywhere else. I was also in the military for a while. So I spent about six years in the military army. Just been a pretty crazy ride. Not really knowing what the heck you were trying to do in life, so I went to the military early, like right after high school.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
And it was good for me. I probably would&#8217;ve stayed in the military if my knees didn&#8217;t blow out. But at the end of the day, destiny calls. Things changed. I did some high, big brain stuff outside the military. I was a freaking, oh yeah, a telecommunication engineer. So it was a really big brain job, very lucrative. And then it got all outsourced to India, right? This was the Great Outsourcing in 2010. Everything started getting outsourced. That field just disappeared off the face of the earth. I moved around to San Diego to get a degree. Finished it up in New York, Queens College as a economics major. And in about 2016, I finally got my first comic done: Kids 2 Kings and that&#8217;s when the actual business started happening.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Let&#8217;s bring it back to, again, those early days, when you said growing up in New York and you spent some time in Alabama. Were you so rounded by a lot of comics and comic books growing up?</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
No, no, no. I was a big anime guy. So me and all my friends and stuff were anime dudes. So we were the old Toonami peeps watching Dragon Ball and Yu Yu Hakusho and all the other stuff. That was my vibe. Also, video game fanatics. We were huge video game fanatics back then. That was our thing though. I wasn&#8217;t really a comic guy at all. Still ain&#8217;t to this day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So back then, were you thinking, did you want to start your own anime series or anything like that back then, because you were around it all the time?</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
I wanted to make a video game series, a video game franchise based off Black Sands.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
That was always my goal over time. In fact, I tried to do that first, get a degree in video game design. Didn&#8217;t work out for me, but that&#8217;s what I wanted at first, right? And that&#8217;s what the original idea was made for. And then I realized it was so expensive to make a video game and pivoted toward comics.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now when you say you wanted to go into that, was this when you were looking to go to San Diego State?</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Yeah, because I was going to the Arts Institute in San Diego first.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
That was the first place I went and that was for video game programming or something like that. I think it was video game programming or design or something. And it wasn&#8217;t for me. It wasn&#8217;t for me, so I switched up, went into creative writing at San Diego&#8230; Yeah, San Diego State. And then eventually ended up in economics. I did the smart thing. I didn&#8217;t do all the writing classes up front. I went to all my general studies so I could transfer over. So I didn&#8217;t waste too much time when it came to changing my degrees and stuff.</p>

Well, it sounds like you were at least building that foundation, and then I think even that trial and error part with first studying games or going into game development and realizing this wasn&#8217;t what you wanted to do and then going into something else. I mean, college is the time where you can figure those things out, where you can decide what the path is that you want to take. Even if it may not suit the goal then, you&#8217;re still building that foundation, at least from what we can see now in hindsight is to where you are now.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Yeah, for sure. Definitely was. But probably the biggest important thing was the economics, right? It&#8217;s like I can&#8217;t build a freaking chart or graph to save my life nowadays, right? Because I haven&#8217;t used it in so long, right? But the fundamentals of economics is what led me to the success I am today, right? Because I always think of things from a supply and demand perspective. I was never trying to do things in oversaturated markets. I knew how to get my proper price points, right? To figure out&#8230; Because the thing about it is I mean, the logic doesn&#8217;t even make sense of how I do business. I avoid comic bookshops as a comic book publisher, right? I avoid them like the plague. Don&#8217;t market to them. Nothing I care about that.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
That right there is a conundrum unless I have some kind of evidence behind it, right? It makes no sense if I&#8217;m doing that from an outside perspective, but that&#8217;s what I do. I have the most expensive books in the black community. My books are just straight up more expensive than everybody else&#8217;s by far, yet I sell 10 times more than the next person up. So I sell more units than everybody else while also having the most expensive books. And these are all decisions that I&#8217;ve come to based on the actual field. For me, from the economics perspective of this community is that black people have no problem supporting things that matter to them. So that part of it is people think that black people are all poor, and it&#8217;s not true at all. There&#8217;s a whole bunch of wealth in our community and they buy very expensive things for their families. When they do it, it&#8217;s to make sure that their kids have a great upbringing, right? That they have a legacy built for them and everything else.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
So what we&#8217;re providing for them is really high luxury products that they can be proud of, both the parents and the kids, and we could price it out to match that and they have no problem with that. And it kind of reminds me of I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve had time in New York, but there&#8217;s a restaurant in Jamaica, Queens called Margaritas Pizza. Their cheese slice is like $3.50 for a slice of cheese. Everyone around them in the entire area has dollar slices. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Hey, these poor black people, they can&#8217;t buy anything. This is a poor community.&#8221; Whatever, right? The one place that always has a line out the door with all the black people is the one that sells for 3.50 and everybody else won&#8217;t listen to the evidence. They won&#8217;t see the evidence saying, &#8220;Just make a superior product, that people will support you.&#8221; They don&#8217;t see that. All they simply do is just focus on their preconceived notions of what is the proper thing for the market.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s an interesting word that you used as you were describing that, that I&#8217;d like you to maybe talk about a little bit more, just in terms of how you&#8217;re viewing your product in the market. You said luxury, which I don&#8217;t think when people hear about comics or really anything like of this sort of caliber in this realm, they don&#8217;t really think about luxury.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I&#8217;m just curious. Talk about that a little bit more.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
I&#8217;ll expand on that. I&#8217;m sorry. I just saw something from my wife.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Basically, what I mean by luxury is at the end of the day, we do hard cover. We do hard cover anthologies of our books. They are library-bound. So in other words, you can&#8217;t break them apart if you wanted. It&#8217;s really tough to damage to them permanently, which is great, right? Especially if you give it to younger kids. They&#8217;re so easy to destroy things. The paper quality is very thick, so it&#8217;s very hard to crease. Even if you&#8217;re turning the pages like a crazy man, you won&#8217;t crease the pages. The art style is absolutely phenomenal, and that&#8217;s across the board in our entire company. You look at all the titles and you&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Wow, these are all super high level professional stuff,&#8221; right? Basically we&#8217;re like Sh≈çnen Jump. Sh≈çnen Jump is basically the elites of Japanese Manga, right? If you&#8217;re in Sh≈çnen Jump, you&#8217;re not going to be a bum. You&#8217;re not going to have basic stuff. You&#8217;re going to have the best content in the entire Japanese market. And that&#8217;s basically what we&#8217;re doing with our brand. And we price ourselves as such. We&#8217;re the best.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
So people, they price what they think they should be at. I see people making comics for $5. $5 to sell a book for $5, because that&#8217;s what the comic bookshop does. But I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Our customers don&#8217;t shop at comic shops.&#8221; The overwhelming majority black consumers don&#8217;t shop at comic bookshops. They start at Target or whatever. $10 book is normal to them. $20 hard cover is normal to them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know you just said earlier, you were like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t go to comic shops.&#8221; You avoid comic shops. And I would imagine part of that reason is because of what you just said, that&#8217;s not where your target market is going to be. But then also I would imagine talking to those comic shops, that&#8217;s probably what some other publishers would do just in terms of just trying to get their books on the shelves.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Absolutely. That&#8217;s their only way of knowing how to sell, right? That&#8217;s the thing, they just don&#8217;t know how to sell any other way. So they use the traditional means to sell. And the thing about it is you got to deal with pricing and stuff, right? Why should they buy Black Sands for $10 when they could buy Black Panther for four? And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Because Black Panther is not about history, how about that?&#8221; But they still&#8230; There&#8217;s that preconceived notion of what the market is. Why should you worry about a middle man when you could do it yourself? Just cut the middle man out because they&#8217;re already out of touch.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did your time in the army help influence you when it came to just the idea of building Black Sands Entertainment?</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Mostly the management side. So I&#8217;m a big believer in having subject matter experts, people who actually know what they&#8217;re doing and can handle operations without my guidance. So over time I&#8217;ve gotten employees or officers that really knew how to take things on without my help while I just do minimal amount of information to get the product done. And that has significantly helped us to scale compared to other people.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
We&#8217;re very hands off in productions, and the people who are in charge, they know what they&#8217;re doing. They have a lot of skin in the game, and as a result, they really know what they&#8217;re doing. They learn the principles of management through me. And I might help in the initial recruitment of their team, but once that&#8217;s it, all I got to do is cut some checks and comics come out. I don&#8217;t want to have to think about what they&#8217;re doing. As long as our standards are up-to-date, right? But I&#8217;m not trying to figure out their story. If the fans like it, good. That&#8217;s all I care about, right? I&#8217;m not here like, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t think this story should go this way.&#8221; That is not my responsibility. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I think also like you said with the number of titles that you have and that they focus even on different cultures and stuff, and forgive me for this reference, but you can&#8217;t Tyler Perry it where you&#8217;re like, your name is over the whole thing and you&#8217;re overseeing and micromanaging every part of the production.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Yeah, you can&#8217;t do that. You got to let people do what they want. Just as long as they&#8217;re in the ballpark, you&#8217;re good to go. Because at the end of the day, this field is completely open, so it&#8217;s not like you have to be super freaking precise, right? You just make good stories. For instance, I&#8217;ll give you some examples. Grenada&#8217;s Shadow, that&#8217;s our Moorish title that&#8217;s coming out very soon in the next month or so. It&#8217;s already done. And that one is about an assassin who&#8217;s a Moor, who&#8217;s basically trying to undermine the Crusaders. When Spain was basically&#8230; When basically European powers and the Pope specifically was trying to take back Spain from Moorish occupation, which has gone on for 400 years. So this guy who got killed by&#8230; His whole village and stuff got killed by Crusaders is now an assassin taking out really high level leaders of the Crusaders. It&#8217;s dope. It&#8217;s a dope story, and it&#8217;s very different from what you would normally expect when people make these titles, right? No superhero powers, nothing, just straight up Assassins Creed type joint.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
We have Lion&#8217;s Game: Masters of Mali, where it&#8217;s a martial arts tournament in ancient Mali. We have all these fighters from all across Africa coming together to fight in the capital. And one of the fighters is somebody who was the great grandson of a previous Mansa who was basically assassinated and usurped. So he has a legacy he&#8217;s trying to reclaim in secret, so he joins this martial arts tournament. And it&#8217;s crazy, it&#8217;s like one of those&#8230; It&#8217;s just like Baki or something like that. It&#8217;s really freaking hardcore, hyper masculine, martial arts tournament type stuff. And it&#8217;s a different vibe, but it&#8217;s still the same thing. We&#8217;re showing culture. We&#8217;re putting stories that will be dope in modern day settings and just putting it in an ancient culture. So you can always have a good connection to great ancient civilizations prior to slavery. That idea that Rome wasn&#8217;t built in a day. Everybody in America says that Rome wasn&#8217;t built in a day. Whenever we have any type of adversity. &#8220;Well, Rome wasn&#8217;t built in a day.&#8221; Where&#8217;s our Rome?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Of the titles that you have now, is there one that really stands out to you as a favorite?</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Out of the ones that are not made by me, right? I would say Lion&#8217;s Game is probably my favorite just because the story is crazy, first of all. You&#8217;re going to have a lot of martial artists from all across Africa, with their own cultures, their own martial art style that&#8217;s real. And a lot of characters that people may have never known before, but actually were real people in the old times. It&#8217;s just culturally fun. I mean, it&#8217;s just culturally amazing and while still being a hit for the parent, for the fathers specifically. This is not a title for the kids. They&#8217;ll probably watch it. The teens will probably watch it anyway, but the parents, specifically the dads, them 30 to 40 year old dads are going to be like, &#8220;This is the best comic I&#8217;ve ever read in my life.&#8221; It&#8217;s going to have that vibe.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Super hyper masculine, forget your feelings. This is raw. And we haven&#8217;t done any titles like that at Black Sands, but this is one that I felt like it would definitely work. And even though it&#8217;s written by Kevin Brown, it was originally my idea because what I do is I do competitions in my Patreon community and I have like a topic. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;This kind of topic would really sell well to my fans.&#8221; I automatically know what kind of topic it is. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Who&#8217;s going to give the best possible pitch for this story?&#8221; And then I judge them and I say, &#8220;The one that does the best, who has the best possible pitch, they&#8217;re given an opportunity to get published by us, and we do everything,&#8221; right? We mentor them. We get them the artists. We pay for their production. We give them royalties on the book sales.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
They&#8217;re starting their career on the Black Sands all because they won a competition. But the competition has 100, 200 applicants. So it&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re just a random guy with an idea. They had to beat out a whole bunch of other people who had the same marching orders. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
So this story was heavily curated before it ever got a chance to start being written and this guy killed it. So I was like, &#8220;Yeah, this one right here has super longevity. This one is probably going to get to screen very fast in the future after comic books come out. I think this one&#8217;s going to be very quickly picked up as a, either a live action or a show of some sort, because it&#8217;s never been done. It&#8217;s perfect for the time we&#8217;re in now. The Bakis, the Syngins and all these other martial arts tournament type shows are very in right now. So this is going to fit perfectly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me some more about this Patreon community. How did that come about?</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s always been something that we&#8217;ve always had. A large community. Our community wasn&#8217;t that big, maybe two years ago, but once we started raising capital, it ballooned out of control like really big. The way we give back to the community, besides the comic books that we make and stuff like that is we give them opportunities. Opportunities is what we do. So voice acting opportunities, publishing deals through competitions. They do a competition, they get in there. Early access to investment rounds, so when we do our investment rounds. Patreons and the previous investors always get two weeks or more of the exclusivity where they get to buy up as much stock as they want before we open it up to the public. And that can make a huge difference in the world when we have early bird specials.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Most of our Patreons are actually investors already, so they have stock. They get a 10% discount on their stock. So if you were investing $5,000, you got $500 worth of stock for free. So it makes a huge difference if you&#8217;re on the higher side of investors. If you&#8217;re investing $100, it ain&#8217;t going to matter much if you get early access or not. But when you&#8217;re investing thousands, it matters a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
And so that&#8217;s been the huge reason why people join us. The future opportunities that we give them is like the call. And usually what happens is when we&#8217;re raising capital, we have a downtick, so we lose a lot of Patreons over time when we&#8217;re at raising capital. And then when we&#8217;re no longer raising capital, and now we&#8217;re preparing for the next round, we drastically increase in Patreons. So it&#8217;s like a huge ebb and flow. Everybody&#8217;s basically flowing into the investment round, the one that wants that&#8217;s done. Everybody who didn&#8217;t make it into that investment round is like, &#8220;Dang, I can&#8217;t miss the next one.&#8221; So they start flowing back into the Patreon, right? It&#8217;s like it&#8217;s just the way the ebb and flow of the Patreon community is now.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
So right now we&#8217;re about 1,500 members in and we have over 20,000 a month in donations. So it&#8217;s pretty big. It&#8217;s a pretty big community, much bigger than other people for the same amount of Patreons. If you go on the website, Grafion, you&#8217;ll see that in our category, most people&#8217;s average pledge is 2.50, something like that. $2.50. Our average pledge is about $14. While we might have much less subscribers than some people on the list, we still collect way more than them, even though they&#8217;re higher on the list, just because our community is in. They&#8217;re like super in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Okay, so you built this on Patreon. Okay, I was trying to&#8230; As you were sort of mentioning that, I was like, &#8220;What platform are you using?&#8221; But you&#8217;re using Patreon. Okay. All right. Yeah, Patreon has been, I think really for a lot of artists and creators, Patreon has been a pretty good platform for them to be able to at least have those kinds of different tiers and things like that. But if you&#8217;re bringing in that much per pledge, that&#8217;s great. That&#8217;s great. I had Revision Path on Patreon for years and it was not that good. We ended up getting off of there, but &#8211;</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
The main thing about growth of Patreons is it&#8217;s not a monthly thing. I think the whole preconception of Patreon is bad because it messes up the way people should be strategizing growing Patreon communities, right? It&#8217;s all about opportunities. So in other words, let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re a video game&#8230; Video game companies do great on Patreon. One, here&#8217;s why. They get betas. Betas all the time, right? Beta access. &#8220;Hey, this is what we developed this week. Download it.&#8221; Boom. But two, &#8220;Oh, you want to be a side character. You want to write a line for certain characters who&#8217;s a side character in the story. You want to write a paragraph, right? Submit your stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
People are getting opportunities to be a part of the production all the time, which is why those communities grow so fast, because they&#8217;re saying, &#8220;Hey, next week we&#8217;re going to be getting some designs. We&#8217;re going to put some Patreons in the community into the game. If you&#8217;re active at this date, you&#8217;ll be able to apply.&#8221; And then people flood in, right? Because they want their opportunity to shine. Or, &#8220;We&#8217;re about to have voice acting for our thing. We&#8217;re about to do some casting. It&#8217;s going to start on January 1st. So if you&#8217;re a Patreon on January 1st, you&#8217;ll be able to apply,&#8221; right? Don&#8217;t even do no open casting, just straight up only Patreon casting. Boom, hundreds of people sign up.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
This is the way to get&#8230; Converting people to sign up on Patreon is super freaking hard. So you got to give them a very high incentive to do the first month. They&#8217;ll stick around. About 60% of all the people who sign up for some kind of special event even if they don&#8217;t make it. About 60% will stay long term. So 40% will die off pretty quickly when they don&#8217;t get the job or whatever the heck opportunity is happening. But about 60% will stay because they see that there&#8217;s always a new opportunity is coming eventually.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the idea. Pump and&#8230; It&#8217;s not pump and dump. It&#8217;s pump and freaking like pump and hold. There you go. Pump and hold, right? It&#8217;s like you try to hold on to as many people as you can after you pump it. And then the next pump, you got to get another push. It&#8217;s never monthly. Some months I&#8217;ll just lose 50 Patreons and I won&#8217;t gain a single Patreon that month. It&#8217;ll be a net negative 50. So I&#8217;ll gain Patreons, but it&#8217;s not at the rate to replenish the people that left. So I&#8217;ll have negative 50 on that month. And then some months I&#8217;ll have 400 new Patreons.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s a nice, I mean, for folks that are listening, hell, for me too, that&#8217;s a nice lesson on how to man manage doing some sort of like a Patreon type of a community like that, if you&#8217;re using Patreon. But no, that&#8217;s good information to know. I mean, I think certainly, you mentioned having this background in economics, that&#8217;s probably something a lot of independent creators don&#8217;t have when it comes to approaching the mechanics of how you build equity and build money for the company in order to do the kind of things you want to do.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Yeah. I just don&#8217;t think people understand that. I mean, they don&#8217;t even take the examples that are clearly in their face. Netflix doesn&#8217;t get subscribers by having a whole bunch of shows they can watch. Netflix gets subscribers because Squid Game is the number one talked about series in the country and it just came out. Because Bird Box is the number one story in the country right now and people want to see it and they can only see it through Netflix, so they sign up and that&#8217;s the first time they ever sign up and then they might stick around. You understand? But they got to have some big win to get people to sign up because people aren&#8217;t just signing up. They aren&#8217;t signing up because they have a service, right? They&#8217;re signing up because of a specific thing they absolutely have to see. And then they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Eh, might as well stick around.&#8221; You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
So, but people don&#8217;t look at that and say, &#8220;That&#8217;s the business model for subscriptions.&#8221; It&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to get people to sign up? World of Warcraft spends $100 million on just expansions because they have to get those people who might have lapsed, those people who are not subscribing to resubscribe or become a new subscriber. They got to have some big, giant ridiculous event. They can&#8217;t just be, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re the number one freaking MMO in the world.&#8221; That&#8217;s not good enough to get new subscribers. It&#8217;s good enough to keep them, but it&#8217;s not good enough to get them. You know what I&#8217;m saying? So you got to have big, over the top things in order to get people to be motivated to subscribe, because subscription is the most difficult purchase in the world. They&#8217;re in a contract. So it&#8217;s not like, &#8220;Hey, I just bought some food, right? People have no problem giving you a $100, right? But if you said, &#8220;Hey, just give me $15 a month, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Ooh, wait. Whoa.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That is the truth. That is the truth. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Wait a minute, a month? Can&#8217;t I just give you a $100?&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, but it&#8217;s going to take you seven months, eight months to&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;Yeah, but 15 a month though, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about Shark Tank because you did mention at the top of the show, starting off the year with the Shark Tank appearance. Please, I want to know how did it come about? What was it like facing Kevin Hart? Tell me all about it.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
He&#8217;s brutal, man. He&#8217;s brutal. He&#8217;s a lot taller in real life, and I don&#8217;t mean height. He&#8217;s a very dominant dude. And that fight went on a lot longer than what y&#8217;all saw. People were like, &#8220;Man, you should have countered for this.&#8221; I did. I did. I did. There was other offers on the table. But at the end of the day, Kevin Hart knew he had veto power. He just knew it, right? It&#8217;s one thing about you got to know who you are and what you&#8217;re worth. So he knew he had veto power, right? And even the other Sharks admitted it too during the debate.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Like for instance, Kevin O&#8217;Leary, he accepted my counter. He said 10% and a 25 cent royalty on books. He was like, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take that deal for 500,000.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take that deal.&#8221; But he understood that the more we talk is like Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart. He&#8217;s saying he&#8217;s going to make this show. If he&#8217;s saying he&#8217;s going to give you this, that and the other, that&#8217;s not a normal resource that you&#8217;ll ever get. That&#8217;s like you&#8217;re saying this and he said&#8230; That&#8217;s a lot different from what&#8230; That 30% you&#8217;re paying, you&#8217;re not giving up 25% equity for $500,000. That&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re doing. You&#8217;re not giving up more, 25% more equity than you came in for, right? For the money. The money doesn&#8217;t matter at all. In fact, you didn&#8217;t even need the money. The reality was you were doing that for Kevin Hart&#8217;s specific direct involvement in all of your productions from now until the end of time, and that&#8217;s a very strong person. Plus mark Cuban, right?</p>

Plus mark Cuban and his resources. But specifically Kevin Hart, who&#8217;s like a top five paid actor in the world, like independent productions and businesses that he&#8217;s just straight up done himself who understands the idea of owning as opposed to, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s give this to Hollywood and have them make a show.&#8221; He&#8217;s like he doesn&#8217;t believe that. He believes in owning. He&#8217;s already done all that. It&#8217;s time for him to own it himself. So this is huge when it comes to what it means on the deal side. So a lot of people look at it, they just think 25%, you got robbed. And you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Do you know how much it costs for Kevin Hart to endorse your company?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right?</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
&#8220;The real dollar implications of that endorsement.&#8221; He said, and then Chase&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, check out the new card,&#8221; right? When Kevin Hart does the commercial, that&#8217;s $3 million minimum. That&#8217;s $3 million minimum for, to use a commercial with Kevin Hart doing it. That super bowl commercial probably cost them $10 million minimum. It was like a 30 second commercial, right? It is like that is the reality of just the endorsement side. Not even his actual real like work. His real actual involvement in productions. So the implications is way more than 25% is what I bought.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. How have things changed since the Shark Tank appearance?</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Well, one, we&#8217;re getting a lot more publicity. We&#8217;re getting our verifications and stuff like that. We&#8217;re starting to get that. Sales has jumped. We still haven&#8217;t gone public with the deal yet just because we&#8217;re still negotiating. But we&#8217;re about done. We&#8217;re very close to making announcements on our actual go-to-market strategy. But once that happens, that&#8217;s when the stuff will really hit the fan. We have a huge amount of major press things happening right now, so that&#8217;s going to be coming out for the next two weeks. We&#8217;re going to have stuff like that happening. So it&#8217;s going to be huge rolling success. The idea is don&#8217;t lose your 15 minutes of fame. He is like, &#8220;Get on it and keep getting the press. Keep getting the things. Keep staying in front of the camera as much as you can in order to stay relevant. Be the top story.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing. We&#8217;re lucky that we&#8217;re still capable of doing that even though a lot of other Shark Tank companies don&#8217;t have this kind of follow up, right? They don&#8217;t get on the big major shows or anything like that. So the fact that we are is freaking huge for us. We&#8217;re doing that before Kevin Hart says, &#8220;Man, Black Sands is like the best thing ever. We&#8217;re about to make billions,&#8221; right? Once he starts saying that publicly, that&#8217;s when it really will start becoming like an unstoppable force. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Because you&#8217;ll have that endorsement and then coming from him like that, a lot of other people are just going to check it out from there.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Yeah. Not just an endorsement, but big money people will start gravitating towards you. Not everything has to be made by us. Black Sands is clearly going to be made by us. We want to control it and we want to own everything of it, right? But there&#8217;s some titles that we just don&#8217;t have the manpower for, but we don&#8217;t want to stop these creators who are under our brand from having their own shows. So we might have more traditional deals out there for some other IPs in our company, which makes like three, four, five, six different shows all being under direct development at the same time, all because of Kevin Hart&#8217;s HartBeat Productions and everything else. So that&#8217;s the crazy thing about it, right? Is this is about to be a black Renaissance when it comes to content and ownership because I have investors, regular small investors.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
And this is the thing I always tell people too, if we get to a billion dollar valuation in say five years, which isn&#8217;t impossible, it&#8217;s not impossible at all. Two seasons of Black Sands would&#8217;ve already came out. Licensing and merchandising deals with Walmart and everything else would&#8217;ve already probably happened by then. And these are like really big licensing deals.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
So if this is already happening within five years and we get to a billion dollar market cap, right? And go IPO. Somebody who invested $5,000 at my $5 million valuation back in 2020, they&#8217;ve maxed out, that was the max that the government said they could do, because they&#8217;re unaccredited. So they $5,000, the max you can give. And they gave 5,000 because they just were hardcore believing in Black Sands. They&#8217;ll be able to flip that 5,000 for a million dollars, 200 times return because that&#8217;s the valuation we&#8217;re at now. We&#8217;re at a million dollar market&#8230; I mean a billion dollar market cap, and they invested at five million, they basically are getting 200X roughly around there if they sell their shares. That&#8217;s huge, that&#8217;s real generational wealth. And there&#8217;s a lot of people who did it. There&#8217;s a lot of people who invested at the max in the first round.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say has been the toughest thing that you&#8217;ve had to deal with since starting all of this?</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Fighting my own personal frustrations not blowing up. I mean, online, they see my bravado, right? And my toughness, but I hold a lot back. I hold a lot of my hating back. I&#8217;m a huge hater, right? I just don&#8217;t let problem go. But I believe if you&#8217;re not a hater, you ain&#8217;t really&#8230; You don&#8217;t really care about life. You got to be mad when somebody else gets an achievement that you didn&#8217;t get, especially if you&#8217;ve done more than them. So I&#8217;m a huge freaking hater. Holding that energy back, not to disparaging other colleagues, even though I know that their claim is completely bogus or their achievements should have been my achievements, I should have been on certain list or whatever. That was the thing that I felt was the hardest thing to do over this entire time. Because you can really make yourself as this super negative force in this space if you wear your emotions on your chest. And I try to, even though people see me all the time bashing Hollywood. Hollywood&#8217;s not a person, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
I used to always articulate things to not make it personal, not try to burn any specific bridge. So if you still were hurt by what I was saying, the main thing was you probably were somebody that I didn&#8217;t want to be in colleagues&#8230; I mean ever work with in the first place because you&#8217;re one of those people. So that was the hardest thing, controlling that, because like I said, we&#8217;ve probably been the best independent publisher for three years now, yet we were never on a top 10 indie black mangas or indie black comics you need to read, right? We never got any kind of accolades or something like that, regardless of what the numbers said. They just didn&#8217;t care. They didn&#8217;t like any research. You Google black comic books, you&#8217;d find us. So how the hell did you avoid us?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ll tell you because I&#8217;ve been doing this now with Revision Path for nine years, and I share that frustration that you&#8217;re talking about with you put in all this work and you don&#8217;t feel like sometimes everyone sort of recognizes that or gives you the credit that you feel you deserve for it. That&#8217;s just, I mean, unfortunately that&#8217;s just the media. The media&#8217;s always going to glam on to whatever the newest thing is, whether you&#8217;ve been in&#8230; Especially like if you&#8217;ve been doing this for a while and you have longevity, they really only care about the new stuff. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;What&#8217;s the new thing that&#8217;s coming out? What is it that is keeping you motivated to continue? I feel like I might know the answer to this question, but I&#8217;d love to hear you sort of. Where does this drive come from?</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
I just want to see Rome burn. Like that&#8217;s it. I just want to see Rome burn to the ground. I&#8217;m Hannibal at the gates. I always think of that whenever I think of what my mission is. I&#8217;m not here to be successful. I&#8217;m not here to tell my great story. People always trying to make it so indifferent. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m just trying to tell a great story. I just want to be a creative person. I love this and I&#8217;m so humble.&#8221; No, I want to see Rome burn to the ground and that means we have to have absolute veto power and control over our own stories. It&#8217;s the only way we&#8217;ll ever be able to stop Hollywood from dictating what is acceptable black history, because we don&#8217;t need 10 new black slave and civil rights stories a year. I don&#8217;t need to see the new ways of lynching people like, &#8220;Oh man, I just need to see that. I need to see a new way.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re about do a Emmett Till documentary.&#8221; &#8220;Yeah, I definitely want to see Emmett Till die again. That would be great.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, you know what? You know what? This black history we&#8217;re deciding we&#8217;re going to talk about the Black Wall Street Massacre. Yeah, we&#8217;re going to do a whole series on the Black Wall Street Massacre.&#8221; I said, &#8220;How about do a series on Black Wall Street before the massacre? How about that?&#8221; It was like but we don&#8217;t control the budget. We don&#8217;t control the means. We don&#8217;t control any of it. So if we don&#8217;t take that control and show that we can actually do numbers with that control, then they will always be able to dictate what is acceptable and what isn&#8217;t acceptable for black people to consume. And I&#8217;m tired of it. I want to see that entire infrastructure burn to the ground. And the only way that&#8217;s possible is if we dominate this space and be complete tyrants once we get there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the people that influence you?</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
There&#8217;s three, right? And I said this in a previous interview. There&#8217;s three that influenced me. You&#8217;d be surprised, one of them was Kevin Hart, which was kind of ironic. Tyler Perry and George Lucas. Those three people. What I respect is not success. I don&#8217;t care about success, because you can be successful and a complete tool at the same time. Your whole career can be canceled out. Everything could happen overnight because you are still a product of the system. So boldness is the stuff that I respect more than anything. People who&#8217;ve risked a lot in order to be successful.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
For George Lucas, it was holding onto his IP rights, making moves to make sure that he never lost them. Over decades of freaking negotiating with Hollywood elites and stuff like that, he was like, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m not giving up these rights no matter how much y&#8217;all pay me.&#8221; And that made him the only billionaire who wrote a story. There is no other billionaire who wrote a story in the world. Period. Everybody who&#8217;s written a story don&#8217;t even have $100 million to their name. The creator of Naruto, Kishimoto, he&#8217;s worth $40 million today. If you believe the highest estimates of his net worth. But the man&#8217;s IP: Naruto, has brought in $15 billion, so he is not even worth 1% of his brand. Stan Lee died with less than 1% of Marvel&#8217;s brand.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
This is the reality of all these people. They simply they&#8217;re considered successes by the world&#8217;s standards, but at the end of the day, they got robbed. They made everything. They worked nonstop for their entire lives and they didn&#8217;t even have 1% of the thing that they created. And only George Lucas was the one that ran the table. He basically kept 50% of everything Star Wars ever made. And that&#8217;s power.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Tyler Perry, everybody hates him in the industry because he&#8217;s going to make his stories whether you like it or not. You can say, &#8220;Am I a fan of Tyler Perry&#8217;s movies?&#8221; Eh, sometimes. For the most part it doesn&#8217;t really matter what I think. All I know is if Tyler Perry feels like making a movie, he&#8217;s going to do it. You can invest. If you don&#8217;t, he&#8217;s going to make it anyway and release it right on your freaking network whether you like it or not. He&#8217;s going to do whatever the heck he feels like. He&#8217;s going to cast whoever he feels like. He&#8217;s going to buy whatever he feels like, and you can&#8217;t stop him. And the reason why you can&#8217;t stop him is because he did all this. He was rich before you ever met him. Before Hollywood ever gave him a chance, his shows were already generating millions of dollars locally through the fans.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Build the infrastructure, and then these people in Hollywood can&#8217;t dictate nothing to you. When they were like, &#8220;We want to buy Madea.&#8221; They were like, &#8220;No. You can fund some of it, but you ain&#8217;t owning Madea whether you like it&#8230; I&#8217;m just not giving it to you. I don&#8217;t care what you offer me. I already make millions of dollars.&#8221; That&#8217;s the grind. And Kevin Hart, he said, &#8220;Why the hell am I going to get less than 5% of a tour or 3% of a tour or 3% of a tour&#8217;s proceeds if I&#8217;m the fucking main attraction. If the tickets are being sold because of me, why do I get only 3% of the total amount of money? Everybody else is making money off of me. So how about I pay for everything? I hire everyone. I get the venues. I do the marketing. And then if I sell out, I keep freaking 80% of everything made.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
He went into massive millions and millions of dollars up front. You can&#8217;t do that stuff after the show is already done. You got to book tours half a year in advance. So he had to go real deep into the red before his first show. So that&#8217;s power to me to make plays like that and just trust it. Say, I trust myself to make this happen. I believe my fans truly believe in what I&#8217;m doing. And I&#8217;m going to finally flip this industry. I&#8217;m not going to be an actor for the rest of my life. I&#8217;m not going to let people dictate my career and if they feel slightly offended by what I did, they can cancel out my entire career. You can&#8217;t cancel them now. You can&#8217;t cancel Tyler Perry. You damn sure can&#8217;t cancel George Lucas. You can&#8217;t cancel them no matter how much you care, you can&#8217;t do nothing to stop them. And that&#8217;s the people that I really respect, people who have done enough, built enough of their own fan base that they cannot be stopped by conventional means. You can&#8217;t stop them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? Where do you want Black Sands Entertainment to be? Where do you want to be personally as a business owner? Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Well, I just want to be in the top 10 animes in the world, period. So top 10 animes in the world for Black Sands, maybe some video games down under our belt as well. But the idea is if that happens, we&#8217;re basically going to dominate the entire space, right? Because we&#8217;re independent and that&#8217;s never happened before. It&#8217;s never happened before. An independent production get into the top 10 in the world and do massive licensing and merchandising. It&#8217;s never happened. And when I prove that model, it proves that black consumers are no longer something that can be measured by Hollywood, because they&#8217;ve never seen it before. They&#8217;ve never seen somebody just do it without any of the metrics they normally would use. And that is where I would like to be. I would like to just be a king maker in this space, I decide what&#8217;s hot, what&#8217;s not.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
And because of that, they all have to work with us. Not just me, but all the other creators under my umbrella and give us the best possible deals or they don&#8217;t work with us, period. Because we&#8217;re just automatically the king makers in this space. If you want to do anything in this space, you have to come through us, right? So that&#8217;s the idea of what I want the company&#8217;s position to be in, right? That&#8217;s the idea of where I want Black Sands, the anime to be in, right? And for me, I&#8217;d like to relax a little bit in five years. Probably can&#8217;t but it&#8217;s very intense right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds intense. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Yeah. But for me, I&#8217;m in my Thanos mode right now, right? I&#8217;m trying to get the stones. I&#8217;m trying to get the stones and I don&#8217;t care who I got to crush to do it, right? I just can&#8217;t wait for the day when I finally rest. &#8220;He&#8217;s done what he was supposed to do. It&#8217;s now broken. The system is broken.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about Black Sands Entertainment and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
Yeah. So follow us on all platforms: black Sands Entertainment. Manuel Godoy on LinkedIn if you want to work with me. Blacksands.com is my store, right? So you want to buy some books, go ahead and get them from there. BSP Comics is my app. So you can download a whole bunch of freaking black comic books there. You don&#8217;t actually have to download it. It&#8217;s server side. So it&#8217;s about 70 megabytes for the app. So you don&#8217;t have to worry about that. It&#8217;s 45 different titles from all types of creators. Really cool stuff. And lastly, if you want to be an investor. Investor round is over. We just raised a million dollars for BSP Comics. Our next investment round is for the Black Sands Anime. In order to participate, it&#8217;s probably best that you just sign up for Patreon at patreon.com/blacksands, because they&#8217;re going to be the first investors. And that investment round should happen in the summer. So there you go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Manuel Godoy, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I mean your passion and your drive behind what you&#8217;re doing with Black Sands Entertainment is super infectious. I&#8217;m hyped up just listening to you talk about this. This just felt like a masterclass in how to build an empire. So I hope for people that are listening, they definitely will check it out and will get behind you. I mean, it sounds like you already have a very strong community behind what you&#8217;re doing, and I hope that with what we&#8217;re doing here with Revision Path by having you tell your story, we can get this out to even more people. So thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Manuel Godoy:</b><br>
