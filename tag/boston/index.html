Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>I love that Manny Ikomi has adopted a philosophy of &#8220;lift as you climb&#8221; as it relates to his career. Manny works as a UX design consultant for IBM iX, but he&#8217;s also a design educator and even streams some of his personal web development and UX projects on Twitch. It was great chatting it up and learning about how he balances his work with community outreach.</p>
<p>We started off diving into Manny&#8217;s journey from discovering interactive design and UX, to hitting a career ceiling and pursuing further education. Manny also spoke about teaching at his alma mater, his aspirations on working for public sector institutions, and his podcast <a href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/ggtpod" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Gay, Geeky + Tired</a>. Hopefully Manny&#8217;s story will inspire you to make a positive impact in the world!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>So my name is Manny Ikomi. I&#8217;m a UX designer at IBM currently, and also recently, I am adjunct faculty teaching an interactive design course at Bunker Hill Community College.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Nice. How&#8217;s your year been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>So far, it&#8217;s been a bit of a whirlwind. I think there&#8217;s definitely been some really good ups and some really low downs. But at the end of the day, I think the net ending of that is still growing and succeeding in the things that I want to do so far. And there&#8217;s still more to come, I guess. So, still with a lot of optimism, it&#8217;s been going well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>How would you say you&#8217;ve grown and improved over the past year? Have you noticed anything in particular?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>So I started at IBM in June of last year of 2022. That first year was like a little trial by fire because of the project that I was working on. But I also had access to a lot of really great mentors; people in my network, both inside and outside of the company. And so professionally, I think there was just such an immense growth in that stretch zone, that I like to call it, within my first year. And so now that I&#8217;m a little bit over a year in, as of June of this year, I&#8217;ve kind of, like, leveled out. The honeymoon phase is a bit over, and I&#8217;m kind of just like doing the thing now. Things that I thought maybe I wasn&#8217;t capable of, like a year ago. I guess I&#8217;m capable of now &#8212; teaching being one of them.</p>
<p>I think probably most recent, a little bit of recency bias. But teaching has been something that has been on my mind to do for a little while, ever since a professor of mine kind of planted the seeds, like when I graduated from the college that I&#8217;m teaching at now, which is another story. But it&#8217;s been a really great experience so far, like, teaching IBM only like four weeks into my class. It&#8217;s my first time teaching ever, and for the most part, it&#8217;s also been going really well on top of just working at IBM and doing other things. And interestingly enough, there&#8217;s also a lot of overlap between some of the work that I&#8217;m doing now and some of the things I&#8217;m doing for my course this year has been definitely a year of growth and stretching and learning and teaching. So sometimes teaching also is a really great way to learn. So it&#8217;s been really great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Nice. Let&#8217;s talk about your work at IBM, specifically IBM iX, where you work, like you said, as a UX designer. Tell me more about that.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>So yeah. IBM iX. So IBM, for those of you who maybe don&#8217;t know, because they&#8217;re not as recognized, I guess, of a brand anymore, especially for younger folks, it stands for International Business Machines. It&#8217;s a very old company. There&#8217;s lots of history. They hold a lot of patents for things interestingly that I learned about. Most notably, I think, like the magnetic stripe on credit cards is something that I never realized that they had essentially invented. And so they&#8217;ve been a very large technology company for a very long time.</p>
<p>And over the years, I think they evolved from more like hardware and stuff. And then now they do mostly software and consulting, so they have their own cloud offerings. And then I&#8217;m in the Consulting part of the business. And then iX, which stands for Interactive Experience, is a smaller bubble within IBM Consulting. And what I do there as a UX designer, I guess, like all of us will say, it depends. It depends on the project, it depends on the client. Because ultimately I&#8217;m considered a consultant as opposed to an in house designer. So I don&#8217;t necessarily work on IBM&#8217;s cloud services and software and products.</p>
<p>I actually work on clients of IBM who come to the company and say, &#8220;hey, we need UX designers for this&#8221;, or &#8220;we need design services for some sort of initiative&#8221;. And through that, I&#8217;ve really gotten to do a whole bunch of stuff, particularly within my first year, I could be doing anything from contextual inquiry and design research, traveling to clients on site doing observational research, typical, like user interface prototyping, working in Figma, doing demos and things like that. Usability testing, enterprise design thinking, which is kind of like their methodology around design thinking and how we deliver design services. Yeah, I&#8217;ve pretty much done, I think, the whole gamut of user experience, design and really just design in general. I&#8217;ve really expanded my view, I think, kind of going back to the other question about how I&#8217;ve grown. My view of what design is and how it works and what I do has definitely been a lot more expansive beyond just the tangible artifacts and things that we make.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, it sounds like your day to day work is pretty varied then. Like you said, you&#8217;re either researching, you&#8217;re doing site visits, et cetera. It sounds like there&#8217;s a lot of variety in the work that you&#8217;re able to do.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, there definitely is. And some of that is for better or for worse, I guess, because it turns you into a little bit of a generalist, which some people have opinions about. But I think at least at this point in my career, because it&#8217;s a little bit more earlier on, it&#8217;s good for me to have that kind of exposure and growth opportunities to try and do different things, especially when the risk is low for me personally. Right? Yeah, I mean, I get to work on a whole bunch of stuff. Most recently, the project that I&#8217;ve been working on is a little bit more on the strategic end and getting a local state government to actually adopt some of IBM&#8217;s design thinking methodology, which really kind of lines up to what I was talking about earlier, about teaching people about design now as like an adjunct faculty instructor. So there&#8217;s also been some really interesting overlap and ways in which I&#8217;m now delivering design that I never really considered possible up until recently. So that&#8217;s been interesting. But yeah, it&#8217;s been a really great growth and learning experience so far.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I kind of want to talk a little bit about that generalist part that you just mentioned there. I know there&#8217;s this book by David Epstein called &#8220;Range&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard about it.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>You know what, it sounds familiar now that you say that. I think I might have saved a sample to my Kindle at one point and never ended up buying it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>But it&#8217;s called &#8220;Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World&#8221;. And it does sort of make the case for why generalists are&#8230;they&#8217;re really sort of sought after in a way. I&#8217;m curious though, because you do so much, are you finding there&#8217;s a particular part of UX that you prefer over others?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been kind of thinking about a little bit lately ,and I guess due to the fact of my generalist nature, it kind of goes beyond just design and also into web development too. And so this area that I&#8217;ve been kind of occupying, at least not necessarily within IBM, but just in general as I upskill and just learn different things. I&#8217;m also like a self taught front-end web developer and so I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about the intersections of experience, design and web development and the opportunities there for people who have that kind of hybrid skill set and can really, I guess, specialize in there. Despite considering myself a generalist in some ways, I specialize in others. So the areas that I think I&#8217;m really liking the most is research. </p>
<p>There are things that I&#8217;ve learned about design research and psychology and humans and their behaviors just from watching them interact with designs that I&#8217;ve made or others that I just find so fascinating that just kind of lends itself to my own just like innate sense of curiosity and wanting to learn. But then there&#8217;s also, interestingly enough, the complete flip side of that, which is like the more logistical, I guess, x and y&#8217;s ones and zeros codes and things like actually developing and building the things that I design in some tool and actually making it a real thing, because that&#8217;s kind of where I started. And that&#8217;s how I really transitioned into the work that I do now, is I started as a graphic designer and then I became interested in web design and then I would create these web designs, but I couldn&#8217;t actually put it on the Internet and have it be a website.</p>
<p>And all kind of roads, basically, no matter how hard I tried to avoid coding, were just like, basically &#8220;if you want to do it, you got to do it yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>So I learned coding through that and then now it&#8217;s just kind of been a skill that&#8217;s really stuck with me, I guess, along the way. It&#8217;s not a skill that I get to use or a muscle that I get to flex all the time, but it does surface in some other interesting ways, especially when it comes to collaborating with other developers and just thinking a little bit more logically about the designs that I&#8217;m creating and their ability to be feasibly implemented. So I would say between the design engineering part&#8230;so that kind of hybrid of making a design and actually being able to build it, but also some of the user research aspects of it and strategy, which I guess is kind of everything, but also specifically at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, I think it&#8217;s good to have that sort of generalist, I think, sort of mindset as well as skill set. I mean, back in the day when the Web was really just first starting to become something, everyone sort of had to become a generalist in some way. Like you designed it, you had to code it, you had to slice it up, et cetera, and put it on the Web. Of course, now it&#8217;s so interesting with companies because it seems like companies want specialists and yet when you look at their job descriptions, what they really want is a generalist that has a specialization. So they kind of want that&#8230;what do they call it? </p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>T-shaped. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, like the T-shaped designer or whatever where you&#8217;ve got this broad set of skills. Like, I saw something for this company; they wanted like a social media manager, but then they also needed them to be a graphic designer and they also needed to know motion design. And I was like, those are entirely different things. What you want is a designer. It sounds like you want a designer that has social media experience, but they were like, no, we want a social media manager, but then you want this person doing motion design. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s also just a byproduct of how messed up the job market is right now, but I&#8217;ve seen a lot of that.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Definitely, I&#8217;ve seen a lot of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What are some of the projects that you&#8217;ve worked on that you can talk about?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>For a lot of reasons, obviously, I can&#8217;t talk about a lot of details. Probably the level to what I can say is the first project that I worked on while I was at IBM was basically in the realm of safety. And so the idea was that people who were working in a manufacturing facility could record and take pictures of safety violations or safety issues that they might find and then be able to report that through a system that we developed. So the application of actually reporting and observing safety issues, and then like a whole process and chain of people involved essentially like a service design around people on the front end actually recording issues, and then all the way in the back end, actually analyzing issues and doing some predictive analytics and things like that. And then the most recent project that I&#8217;m on right now with a local state government is basically helping them adopt human-centered design thinking processes and methods and frameworks. And the way that IBM does that is through their enterprise design thinking framework, which I&#8217;ve come to really like and appreciate. It was one of those things that I wish I had known about as a student and definitely kind of opened my world to the possibilities of what design can be and how it can manifest itself, I think. And then ever since then, it&#8217;s kind of just become this thing where I&#8217;m like, &#8220;wow, it&#8217;s more than just the artifacts that we make.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also the way that we think and how we convey our ideas to others, how people interpret our ideas. And it&#8217;s really just kind of expanded my view, I guess, of what it is. But yeah, those are probably the highest level I can get with those two specific projects. The first one I was on for just under a year, and that was pretty much the majority of my entry level experience, getting hired into IBM as an entry level professional hire. And that first project was really great. I had a great team that I worked with. I got to travel a little bit as part of it, and it was a really great experience. There were parts of it that were challenging, definitely, as with any project or design engagement. But ultimately I&#8217;m really thankful for that first project and the people that I got to work with and I&#8217;m hoping to reach out to them again the end of this year to just kind of check in and see where the work has gone since I&#8217;ve left the project. </p>
<p>And then this more recent project that I was talking about in terms of design adoption, that one just recently kicked off like a few weeks ago. So we&#8217;re still in the early stages, but the team is also looking really great to work with and so far it&#8217;s been great. So the work has just been very varied and interesting and every time I just feel like I&#8217;m learning something new or learning something different about design than I thought was ever possible, like maybe like two or three years ago. So it&#8217;s just fascinating.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, you talked just a little bit there about one of the projects having predictive analytics, which of course makes me think about sort of this current era that we&#8217;re in of artificial intelligence and machine learning. And there&#8217;s a number of different sort of cutting edge technologies now that have clearly bled into the mainstream that I think have been going on for a while, like AR, VR, et cetera, but now they&#8217;re becoming mainstream sort of things.</p>
<p>How do you see UX evolving with these new technologies?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t put too much thought into this. I think, obviously you know, obviously the glaring kind of observation here is with generative AI, right? And like ChatGPT and OpenAI and all this stuff that&#8217;s come out recently. I think ultimately, at least in the specific realm of generative AI, it kind of offers an opportunity to actually augment the work that we do as designers. And in some places, I guess, yeah, it will replace some jobs, but I think ultimately it will also kind of augment the way that we do work. And there are products now that are out that kind of help user researchers find patterns in their interviews and the transcripts using AI and things like that that are just really interesting. So there are areas where AI is kind of like enhancing the work that we do and allows us to kind of augment the work and be more productive. Things like AR and VR. I actually haven&#8217;t had too many experiences with, not really even in college. However, the Apple Vision Pro device that was announced by Apple earlier this year, I thought that was really interesting and had a bit of a rabbit hole of thoughts around that in terms of experience, design, and how.</p>
<p>For the longest time, a lot of our designs for user interfaces have kind of been at least for digital user interfaces have been kind of confined to these rectangles that you&#8217;re probably looking at right now in these screens. And so with AR and VR experiences and mixed reality with products like the Apple Vision Pro, it&#8217;s kind of like it allows us to step outside of those bounds, really, of that rectangle screen that we&#8217;re so used to designer for. And it really opens up a lot more possibilities for a lot more intuitive and natural interfaces for us that maybe we just have not developed even usability patterns for yet, or rules of thumb for. And so I find that like a very interesting area that&#8217;s kind of opening up. I imagine there are much more qualified people than me to talk about that, but it is something that I&#8217;ve been thinking about, especially since technology, it&#8217;s kind of hard to stop progress in that sense. And so as experience designers, I guess we&#8217;re also kind of well positioned in the sense that almost everything is an experience and almost everything is designed in one shape or another. I think we&#8217;ll end up having a hand in it and potentially not only just consuming the technology, but also producing ways for people to interact with it too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, I think, as you mentioned, the way that the technology is rapidly advancing, I mean, I feel like this time last year, companies were just starting to kind of test the waters a little bit to see what they could do. And now I think within that past year, every major tech company has made some sort of announcement about how they&#8217;re using AI or they&#8217;re using like a ChatGPT or some sort of generative type of new technology in the work that they&#8217;re doing, almost kind of shoehorning it in in some mean. Let&#8217;s just talk about the obvious &#8212; Google Search. Google Search now will bring up AI stuff right along with these SEO-optimized results that will come up in your regular search engine results page, and it&#8217;s a little difficult, I think sometimes to be able to discern what is good with that and what&#8217;s bad with that. Like, I think everyone&#8217;s trying to sort of race to find how they can use technology, how they can make it work without really stopping to think, is it necessary? Do we have to do this?</p>
<p>Is it just a competition thing? Like business competition? Maybe it is, maybe it isn&#8217;t. I mean, I feel like after a while we&#8217;ll start seeing appliances that have AI. We already have stuff like smart fridges and smart toasters and stuff, but I don&#8217;t need my toaster to have ChatGPT or whatever, just toast the bread. I mean, that&#8217;s an extreme case, but you know what I mean.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>I totally get what you mean. I think that&#8217;s where I have the negative sort of perspective on AI particularly, is really with any sort of emerging technology, especially for these really larger tech companies, like IBM included. it&#8217;s kind of like the rat race to figure out who&#8217;s going to be able to monetize it and make the most revenue with the technology and kind of have their moat. So to speak. In that case, that&#8217;s where we end up with like, oh, let&#8217;s just slap AI on everything and see what happens. Without really, to your point, stopping to think about the impact, whether it&#8217;s positive or negative, to the people that AI is being deployed on, in the same way that it can be a really immense help and benefit to society in some case, it can also be very dangerous. And I don&#8217;t think companies are really incentivized right now to really think about it in that more ethical or social impact lens because that&#8217;s just not going to make the money. And that&#8217;s the way the world turns, essentially, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So there&#8217;s this startup, I&#8217;ll say it now, I was thinking about if I should even mention this, but I&#8217;ll go ahead and say it. There&#8217;s a startup based out of Seattle that does like AI text to speech. Essentially they cloned one of the host voices of Planet Money for NPR and did like a whole episode with this person&#8217;s voice and it sounds pretty mean. You know, I think there are still going to be certain eccentricities in the human voice that humans will be able to discern, but of course the models are getting better for it and things like that. But they&#8217;re one of the few companies, the company is called WellSaid Labs. They&#8217;re one of the few companies I&#8217;ve seen that actually has like a code of ethics behind the work that they do because it could be so easy for someone to use their service that they offer use that technology for extremely nefarious purposes.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>But they actually have a code of ethics behind about what customers do with that technology and how they even plan on implementing and using it, which I would like to see more companies if they&#8217;re going to be implementing. These features I would like to also have them talk about, like we said before, those ramifications of what it means to include all of this. And who is it really serving? And this is something that we saw with, like, Bitcoin and with Web three and all this sort of stuff, where the use of all this generative AI also uses a lot of natural resources, which is something that I don&#8217;t think we regularly would think about because computers have been such an ever present just an ever present sort of thing. But I remember I was reading something I want to say, I don&#8217;t know, a couple of days ago about how Microsoft&#8217;s water usage or something has increased by 30% because of the fact that they&#8217;re like using AI within oh wait, I&#8217;m looking at it now. AI usage fuel spike in Microsoft&#8217;s water consumption, it spiked 34% because they&#8217;re using it in all these other types of programs and stuff, which you would think water, why water? But it takes more servers, space and power to do all this AI stuff, which means it has to be cooled in some way with air conditioning. It&#8217;s all tied in, so it&#8217;s not really happening in a vacuum. I would just like to see more companies talk about the ethics behind why they&#8217;re doing what they&#8217;re doing instead of just rolling out innovation after innovation that I guess we&#8217;re supposed to OOH and awe over in some fancy presentation.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. My perspective is obviously kind of biased because I work for IBM. But recently, with the whole Watson X announcement thing that you may or may not have heard of, I think part of it, and IBM does, I think. Have pretty decent programming and ethics and training around the use of AI, because that&#8217;s kind of like, one of our strategic areas that we&#8217;re trying to be leaders in. And so the whole rollout for Watson X was kind of centered around three different areas. There was Watson X AI data and then governance. And governance, I think, is really that part of it that kind of talks about making sure that it&#8217;s responsible and transparent and explainable. And then we also have even like an enterprise design thinking course where the methodology for design thinking is tailored around.</p>
<p>Like if you want to implement AI and you&#8217;re using a design thinking framework or initiative to do that, there&#8217;s also training that&#8217;s kind of specific to that as well. That kind of goes into some of the what is the ideal outcome or impact that we want to have, and is AI really even necessary for that in the first place? Right, so it wants you to think about those things. Now, in my personal experience, have know deployed AI in some way with IBM? Not really. So I haven&#8217;t actually gotten the chance to user these learning materials, but I think at the very least, they&#8217;re there as a resource for us employees to use. And it is in IBM&#8217;s interest for us to be very smart about the user of AI because in some ways we are kind of seen as leaders or innovators in that space. There is definitely an aspect of companies need to have more ethics and intent around how they&#8217;re using AI, where it gets deployed, what the impact is, who&#8217;s using it, who&#8217;s being affected by it. I think I would like to see more from that from every company, IBM included. But from what I&#8217;ve seen so far, I think at least at a programming and learning level, IBM seems to be very aware of that.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s also from a risk and compliance perspective because we&#8217;re mostly operate as a B2B or enterprise to enterprise business. Privacy, security and compliance are things that really large businesses that IBM really care about because it kind of is what amounts to their risk and being litigated against. Right. And so when we deploy AI for a client that uses IBM&#8217;s technology, we do have to have a certain amount of ownership over what the technology does and who it impacts because we&#8217;re. Like, the designers and deployers of those things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, we all have to, I just think, be a bit more cognizant of the usage of these tools and what they mean and what the greater sort of impact of it is. But I think we&#8217;ve nerded out enough about that. So let&#8217;s kind of shift the focus here and talk more about you. Let&#8217;s learn more about Manny. Tell me about where you&#8217;re from.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m mostly from the Boston area. I grew up mostly in towns called Saugas and Malden, and a little bit in Revere. And that&#8217;s kind of like, known as, like, the North Shore area of Boston, I guess you could say. But I&#8217;ve pretty much lived like, within 20 to 15 minutes outside of Boston for my entire life. And I&#8217;ve worked around the same area pretty much my entire life. I went to school around the area pretty much throughout my entire life, too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, growing up, were you always kind of interested in technology? Was it something that your parents kind of tried to get you into?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>I would say I&#8217;ve always been interested in it. I think what led me to becoming a designer and my interest in it was that combination of being able to merge my creative interests and creative outputs and curiosity with more technical implementations and things like that. I remember in high school, I went to a vocational high school for context. So we had kind of like vocational programs as part of the regular high school programming.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>And so that&#8217;s kind of where I got my first taste of, like, I can be creative and make something and have it be like a physical, tangible thing. And I just thought that was so cool because, one, I was really bad at drawing, even though I was trying to be creative. But I did find that I had an affinity for things like the software and tooling that was available in the computer labs that we have. The shop was called Graphic Communications, by the way. So that&#8217;s kind of what led into my whole six years at a printing company and things like that. But that&#8217;s really where I started to develop that interest for the combination of creativity and technology. Although at the time the technology was printing, not as we would think about it, I guess today from a UX standpoint.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk more about Bunker Hill. Of course, you mentioned earlier that you are a teacher there, which we&#8217;ll get into, but that&#8217;s where you started off in college. You went to Bunker Hill Community College, majored in graphic arts and visual communications. Tell me, what was your time like there? Do you feel like it really kind of prepared you?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Bunker Hill was kind of interesting because I was kind of facing some, I guess, conflicting realities. That was actually a very huge period of growth for me, I think, relatively to where I&#8217;m at now. If I really reflect on it so with Bunker Hill, I think the programming that they had there at the time was pretty good. I think from a design perspective, it was definitely skewed more towards those kind of typical graphic design programs where your first year is kind of like your foundation year, you&#8217;re required to do a whole bunch of drawing and painting and kind of like more artsy stuff. And then in your, I guess, second year of the Associates program, that&#8217;s where you start getting into more specific studio level courses around typography, which is where I think my trajectory in design kind of started to skyrocket when I finally recognized the importance of it and my ability to influence that as a designer. Now that&#8217;s always the one thing I tell people if they learn nothing about design is Typography is like 90 or 80% of the stuff that you need to know if you want to become a designer or at least design something well if you&#8217;re not formally trained as one from there. I spent quite a few years there because I was a part time student and then I was working full time at the Print Shop, and that was mostly because I couldn&#8217;t afford to go to a full four year institution. I didn&#8217;t really feel comfortable with the idea of taking out a whole bunch of student loans.</p>
<p>And although I had pretty decent support from my parents, it wasn&#8217;t something that I also felt like, I guess I didn&#8217;t want them to be fiscally responsible. I don&#8217;t really think we were in a position to do that, especially at the time that I was doing community college classes. So it was really just kind of me like, finding my way, figuring it out. When I first started there, I tried to take twelve credits worth of courses and work full time at the print shop, which lasted maybe all of like four to six weeks before I was, this is definitely not going to work because that was just a lot. And then finally I found like a good balance between two classes a semester, which ultimately ended up requiring me to go twice as long to finish my associate&#8217;s degree. So it actually took me four years as opposed to two, but for the most part I was able to go through community college without any loans whatsoever, which was extremely helpful to me. Now I&#8217;m thanking myself much later in the future for being smart enough to think about that during that time because I had to be so, I guess, independent in that sense and really think about myself and my needs and ultimately my own personal finances. That&#8217;s kind of where I started to really think about my personal finance money, what success meant to me, becoming more financially literate in the decisions that I was making and the impact that it might have on me later.</p>
<p>Learning about debt and compound interest and investing and all those things. And luckily I made a lot of really smart choices during that time to the point where now, financially, I&#8217;m doing things less so out of fear, which was kind of like the original motivation for me to do that because I didn&#8217;t want to be broke. And I had some minorly traumatic experience around involving money and things like that when I was growing up. So it kind of started from that place of fear. And then now that I&#8217;m finally in a place where I feel much more well established, much more secure, not only in my professional life, but also my personal life and just who I am, those things are more so. They&#8217;re not top of mind for me and I don&#8217;t have to obsess about them, but I have enough of a foundation to think about it more as an opportunity rather than a risk, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>No, that makes a lot of sense. I mean, college is a transitory time for a lot of people for a lot of different reasons. And for you, you were going to college and working at the same time. Tell me about how you sort of balance that.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>I was not very good at it. I guess work-life balance, I guess, is something that I&#8217;ve always kind of struggled with a little bit. It originally stemmed from like, I always need to have something to do. I always need to be busy, I always need to be productive. And that was kind of a very unhealthy way of thinking about it because I was kind of motivated by that fear of not having money or opportunity. But the way that I balanced it was thankfully the company that I was working with at the time, they were actually pretty supportive of me going to college and doing what I needed to do. So there were some days where I had class during the middle of the day and they had no problem with me leaving the office to I was working in the office five days a week for that job. They had no problem with me leaving work to go to class for like four hours and then do what I needed to do to get my degree at Bunker Hill. And so that was really helpful because it gave me a lot of autonomy and really, as long as I got my work done, it really wasn&#8217;t a big deal for them.</p>
<p>So that was like a huge help. And I know a lot of people just don&#8217;t have that sort of opportunity or luxury. That being said, they definitely did not subsidize, nor were they in a position to help me subsidize my education, but it definitely gave me, I think, the flexibility I needed. And then it was really up to me to just be very good about time management, make sure I was keeping up with my assignments, making sure my work obligations were taken care of. Sometimes that required really long nights. Other times it required really early mornings. I wasn&#8217;t as much of a social butterfly, or I didn&#8217;t really get to do all of the social things that are part of a college experience that people might want or be accustomed to. I didn&#8217;t really have a dormitory experience.</p>
<p>There were sacrifices in that, but I think ultimately I came out better for it, and I would definitely do it again if I had to. I just might be a little bit more forgiving with myself in terms of working myself too hard, I guess you could say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Trust me, you missed nothing about the dorm experience. There&#8217;s nothing about that you have missed. I don&#8217;t know if you have siblings or not, but you&#8217;ve missed nothing. Consider yourself lucky.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. It ended up working out, I think, a little bit, because once I transferred to Lesley and finished my bachelor&#8217;s degree there, although I didn&#8217;t get the full know experience there either, I did end up, you know, slowly making friends throughout the entire college experience who did have the dorm life. And we did go over each other&#8217;s places and play video games and hang out and do homework together. And not all of them were from the same college. But Boston is&#8230;there&#8217;s a lot of college-level institutions here, so I got to do some of that. But I guess you&#8217;re right. I didn&#8217;t really miss much, either.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I feel like Boston is a pretty extremely diverse college mean. Of course, you have the well known colleges like MIT, Harvard, et cetera, but then you&#8217;ve got, like you said, Lesley, you got Bunker Hill. There&#8217;s other universities in and around the sort of Boston metro area, so it makes sense that there would be a lot of commingling like that. Yeah, I mean, Atlanta, in a way is sort of like that, too. I mean, I went to Morehouse and there were opportunities where you would, of course, hang out with students from Georgia Tech, from Georgia State. Spelman is right across the street, Clark-Atlanta is right across the street. So you&#8217;re just all kind of commingling together. I mean, Atlanta really is a big college town. I don&#8217;t know if a lot of folks realize that it&#8217;s a pretty unique college town because the number of HBCUs we have, but it&#8217;s really a big college town, so you have all these opportunities to meet people doing all sorts of things at all sorts of different places.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I never really thought of ATL like that, to be honest. I think one person who I met was from the Savannah College of Art and Design, which I think is in Georgia, if correctly based out of Savannah, Georgia. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>We have a campus here in Atlanta, too, right? Yeah. And you mentioned this kind of before we started recording, but one of your professors at Lesley was actually a recent guest on Revision Path.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yes. So, yeah, shout out to Shanae Chapman. Ever since you reached out to me and I discovered the podcast, I&#8217;ve definitely gone in and done my due diligence. And I just think what you&#8217;re doing is really cool again. And it&#8217;s really kind of surreal, actually, I think, to kind of be part of this in the same way that they were, knowing that some of those people I either looked up to or I learned from or had some sort of influence in my life, personally or professionally. And we&#8217;ve also had some other IBM designers on the podcast as, like, I listened to a couple episodes way back with Oen Hammonds and Shani Sandy, who are both, like, design executives at IBM still. Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of a very small, interesting world, I guess, as we were speaking earlier. But, yeah, it was a really full circle moment.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t talked to Shanae in a little while, but recently we did kind of have a bit of a go back and forth because she was interested in the talk that I had done earlier this year. But, yeah, I just think it&#8217;s really cool and it&#8217;s honestly kind of an honor to be doing this right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m kind of&#8230;I have a question about sort of&#8230;I just kind of want to go back to your college experience for a bit because, like we said before, you were working and you were going to college at the same time. What made you want to continue your studies in design? Because it sounds like you already had &#8212; if I&#8217;m wrong here, please correct me &#8212; but it sounds like you had a nice kind of set up because the company was very flexible about you going to class and still working for them. It sounded like they really supported you. What made you want to continue your educational career?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, so that was a combination of quite a few things. I think, for context, the company that I worked at for six years, it was a small, family-owned business. We weren&#8217;t like some large&#8230;we weren&#8217;t like a Vistaprint or anything like that. And although it was a really great experience, I think I hit my ceiling there in terms of growth and opportunity relatively quickly, probably in hindsight, within the first three years. But the reason I stayed was, like you said, because of that flexibility that I really liked, and also the pay was decent enough to get me through college, do the things that I needed to do, have a little fun on the side. It was good for what it was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>And then I think as I started to become more interested in things like interactive design and user experience and things like that, that I really didn&#8217;t even know existed as career paths, really, I kind of stumbled upon them by virtue of learning how to code and kind of self teaching myself that stuff on the side. Hill I was working there. I just basically hit a ceiling there. And then when COVID happened. I graduated Bunker Hill in the fall of 2019, and I had applied to Lesley. I had got my transfer papers, and thankfully they had a matriculation agreement, which made it really easy for me that they just take your associate&#8217;s degree, no questions asked, that the credits all get applied where they should, and you start as a junior in their bachelor&#8217;s program. And at the time, I was reluctant about doing it because it was going to require that I took out student loans, but I did get a really great scholarship. And the fact that they took all of my credits was really huge, because when I did the math, financially speaking, it actually made it lower cost for me to go there and do the program that I wanted than, say, to transfer and go to a state school like Salem State or Mass Art were probably the other alternatives that I looked into.</p>
<p>So even though the sticker price of Lesley was a lot higher, it was actually going to be net cheaper because of the scholarship that I got. And they took all of my credits, which some of the other colleges may not have been willing to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And so from there, that kind of made the decision really easy for me. And then when COVID happened, the world blew up in the spring of 2020. I actually decided to take a gap for like a semester and then start in the fall of 2020. Of course, when I had planned to do that, I didn&#8217;t know COVID was going to blow up the entire world, but thus it did. And so in some ways, I actually kind of avoided that initial shock to my education experience, because, like everywhere else in the world, everyone was trying to figure out how to do virtual class instruction if they&#8217;ve never done that before. There was a whole bunch of new challenges that happened as a result of that. And so I kind of skid by those for the most part.</p>
<p>And then when I started in fall of 2020, I was still working at the print shop. But because I was working at the print shop remotely now, because it just wasn&#8217;t safe for us to be in the office, still, I was able to do Lesley full time and work remotely for the print shop.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>And then in 2021, in January, because my hours and income from the print shop was drastically reduced just because business was slow and it was really tough time for everyone. And so, thankfully, I had prepared for some of this. Because going back to financial literacy stuff, I had prepared an emergency fund and kind of knew, worst case scenario, I would be able to make it through college for the most part, even if I wasn&#8217;t working a full time gig. And I could just find maybe some freelance work and stuff on the side. So in 2021, I decided to leave. I put in my notice. I left on really great terms with them overall. Actually, recently, I ended up asking them to do some print work for me for a side thing with IBM.</p>
<p>But, yeah, from there it was just like full steam ahead with Lesley. I was like, I just want to get my education done. Out of the way. I know interactive design is the area that IBM interested in. I know it will somehow bring me to some interesting path with coding in some way. And at the time, I didn&#8217;t really know what user experience was until a particular studio course that I had, which just so happened to be with two IBM distinguished designers who were my faculty and they were the ones who ended up asking me to apply, like, a year later when I was a senior into the role that I&#8217;m in now, essentially.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, nice. I was going to ask how you sort of came across IBM with the work that you were doing, but it sounds like you already had this kind of support system in.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I think it really started kind of like, way back in vocational school because I had a pretty good technical understanding of the tooling and the software and some of the processes for design in terms of the tactical aspects and visual design, working in hind design, all that stuff. And so for me, the real value that I got out of college was the networking, the mentorship, the one on one time. And a lot of the theory and history behind design was most valuable to me, so I could really focus on that rather than trying to struggle with some of the tooling and learning new methods that I was already familiar with. And so when it came time to really work on projects, the technical aspects of doing the design work and making the artifacts and deliverables was actually relatively easy for me. What I was most challenged by was, like, the strategic parts of it and kind of training myself to think like a designer, not just make pretty designs.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I hear you. Okay. And now, let&#8217;s talk about what you sort of mentioned before about teaching at Bunker Hill. I feel like that might be an interesting experience to go back to your alma mater years later and now teach. What made you decide to go that route?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s definitely been a full circle moment that I&#8217;m still kind of, I guess, pinching myself for a long time ago. So when I had graduated from Bunker Hill in 2019, a professor of mine who I developed, like, a really great relationship with while I was there for four years, she asked me when I graduated. She said, when you finish your bachelor&#8217;s degree, I would love for you to come back and teach the college. And when she said that to me, I was kind of like, what? Because I was like, I just never really considered that as a possibility before. And then ever since she said that, I have kind of noticed getting really positive signals from people that I might be good at doing that. And so over, like, I guess it was kind of like a self-fulfilling prophecy in a way, where if I found it interesting and I thought it was nice, maybe it would happen. I maintained a relationship with that professor for quite a while, and even while I was going through Lesley and doing things, I would always go back to the college and even before I got the role there, do design crits with some of their students and provide networking and opportunities and portfolio reviews, things like that, to kind of give back.</p>
<p>And earlier this year, I had went to a design conference. It was like the first in-person design conference I got to go to since COVID kind of unleashed everything she had just so happened to be there. The professor ended up asking me to teach, and we were just kind of, like, catching up a little bit because we hadn&#8217;t talked in a little while, but we email back and forth every once in a while, and she had told me, like, hey, we have adjunct positions opening. We&#8217;re looking for people to teach certain courses. I want you to apply, basically. And even still, I was kind of like, well, I&#8217;m still just barely my first year into this role at IBM. Am I really even qualified or ready to do this? I was hoping, I think, realistically, to get another maybe four years or five years or so in the industry and doing more practice as a practitioner. But I kind of just kind of said to myself, self, take your own advice.</p>
<p>Like, if the opportunity presents itself, just apply and see what happens, just like I did with IBM. And so, long story short, it was like the worst that they can say is no. Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>So I applied. I did the interview, I did the teaching demo, and then, yeah, now here I am. So I&#8217;m only teaching one class. It&#8217;s Wednesday evenings, which works really well with my schedule, considering I also tend to go into the office on Wednesdays, and it&#8217;s right down the street from my office pretty much too. And the topic that I&#8217;m teaching is interactive design, which is kind of right up my alley since that&#8217;s what I studied in college, and now that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing for my job, pretty much. So the stars aligned, I guess you could say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>How&#8217;s the teaching experience been so far?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>So far it&#8217;s been, I think, a net positive. I think the teaching aspects of it, working with students, kind of like digging back in some of my own archives and coming up with my own content and assignments. I also spent a lot of time reaching out to some of my own professors and also students that I went to Bunker Hill with and at Lesley as well and kind of doing my own design research. I kind of just approached it as like, well, if I was to design a student experience, I just kind of treated it like any other experience design project, except my users are now students. So approaching it with that mindset kind of really helped me. And from there, I think the parts of it that I like are really going well as far as in class instruction, working with the students, providing feedback on their work. I think it&#8217;s probably one of the most valuable things I got out of my design education is like, getting critiques and feedback from other people and getting that other perspective on your work that you might not otherwise get if you&#8217;re trying to learn by yourself. And then the parts of it that I don&#8217;t like so much really are kind of like the more logistics and administrative stuff around it.</p>
<p>I really struggled with grading in the first two weeks to kind of figure out, like, I probably need a rubric. And then also the learning management system that we use isn&#8217;t the most user friendly thing either, which is kind of meta hilarious in a sense because I&#8217;m trying to teach my students how to design interactive systems like that. There are parts of it that are bad that come with the good, but I&#8217;d say overall it&#8217;s been going well. And despite currently maybe potentially having to fail one student if they don&#8217;t show up next week, it&#8217;s been going overwhelmingly good, I think. But ideally I would like to make it to the end of semester without failing anyone. I definitely did not set out to do that when I started teaching, so it&#8217;s kind of unfortunate that they&#8217;re just not participating or engaging. And I certainly don&#8217;t want to make any assumptions as to why they&#8217;re not doing it or assuming that they&#8217;re a delinquent of some kind because they may have things going on as a student that I just don&#8217;t know about and probably never will. But I did try to make an effort to reach out to that person and be as supportive as possible, as opposed to being punitive and penalizing, despite having to uphold the rules of my syllabus in the classroom and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I was an adjunct for two years. I think I taught for two years. It&#8217;s 2012 through 2014, I think. I taught a web development course to business majors, and it was a BIS course, like business information systems. And I get that struggle that you&#8217;re talking about, like, you go into it. Well, for me, I think the Virgo in me wanted to be like, &#8220;hey, this is all wrong.&#8221; Like, the way that you&#8217;re teaching. I remember going to the dean, like, the first week saying, &#8220;we are setting these students up to fail if this is what we&#8217;re teaching them, because this is not what we use out in the real world.&#8221; Like, if this is what you&#8217;re teaching business students, they&#8217;re going to go to a company and get laughed at, or they&#8217;re going to try to apply for a job and no one&#8217;s going to hire them.</p>
<p>And I offered to redo the whole rubric. I&#8217;m talking about the grading, the tests, the lessons. I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;ll redo it and make this into my course that I think they should have.&#8221; And they were like, &#8220;okay, it&#8217;s fine. We don&#8217;t care.&#8221; And also in that same vein, yeah, you go into it not wanting to fail anyone, and it&#8217;s going to happen. It&#8217;s going to happen. It&#8217;s one of those sad eventualities, and it&#8217;s because, oh, how could I put this and I don&#8217;t mean this in a derisive way, but students will always try to get one over on their professor. They always will. It doesn&#8217;t matter how old they are or anything. They will always try to get one over on their professor. They will give you all kinds of excuses just out of everywhere as to why something did get done, why something didn&#8217;t get done. In this case, the syllabus is your friend. The syllabus is the contract between the professor and the student to say, if you&#8217;re in this class, these are the things that you have to do in order to succeed in the class. And we had office hours. Students would come to office hours and would wonder why. And it&#8217;s not that office hours were included in their grade, but then they would come at the last minute, like, &#8220;oh, well, can we meet on this day?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;well, that&#8217;s not my office hours. &#8220;My office hours are on the syllabus because I&#8217;m also a working designer, so I can&#8217;t go out of my way.&#8221; You want to help the students because you&#8217;re their teacher, so I get that.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s going to be an inevitability that you&#8217;re going to have to fail someone. Students are going to go cry bloody murder to the dean or to whatever, because you&#8217;re not fair. You&#8217;re a bad teacher. They&#8217;re going to leave bad reviews. It&#8217;s going to happen. It&#8217;s going to happen.</p>
<p>The best thing that you can do is to follow your syllabus, teach the students that are receptive, because there&#8217;s just going to be some people you&#8217;re just not going to reach. Because I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;re doing this in person. Yes, there&#8217;s just going to be people that you&#8217;re just not going to reach. I think ours was a mix of in person and online, and the online students were the worst. I mean, copying straight from Wikipedia. I&#8217;d run it through TurnItIn and get 99% plagiarized. I&#8217;m just like, oh my God. And they would swear to you up and down that they wrote it. And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;I can look at the quality of your written posts in the forum and tell that you didn&#8217;t write this. Don&#8217;t lie to me.&#8221; But it&#8217;s one of those things, unfortunately, that&#8217;s just going to happen.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting that you say that because one of the things that I had done that I had conversations with some people about when I was developing all the content, because the college basically kind of they didn&#8217;t really direct me on. Basically, it was like, here&#8217;s the course description. Here&#8217;s a sample of a syllabus that&#8217;s been used previously. Make it your own. So I had a lot of academic freedom, I guess, in that sense of being able to develop the materials the way I wanted to do it. Because, like you were kind of saying when I took this very same course when I was a student, it was not very good. One of the courses I actually took ended up being so bad that I actually went to the dean as a student, complained about the course, got a refund and then still got the credits for the course.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>But I was also a fairly advanced student because I had already had prior experience. I had already kind of known some of the things that were out there that were happening. I also spent a lot of time investing in my learning and education outside of the classroom. So I was very aware of where the college was doing well and not doing so well at the time. And so now coming back into it, I kind of had the same mindset of like, there is no way I&#8217;m doing it this way, I&#8217;m going to do it my way. Which ultimately creates a lot of work for me in terms of having to come up with all the content and things like that. But it&#8217;s also just been kind of like an interesting way to think about my design skills in a different light in terms of designing for instruction and learning as opposed to making profit off of people, I guess. Yeah, so that&#8217;s been kind of interesting.</p>
<p>And then on the topic of plagiarism, one of the areas that I talked to people about is, like, using generative AI. I kind of went into it with a mindset of, like, I would rather students use it and use it liberally and experiment with it and not be afraid of it. But come to me with questions because I think ultimately, if I was to put in my syllabus, there&#8217;s no use of generative AI allowed one. It&#8217;s really hard to detect whether someone&#8217;s using it or not, unless, to your point, you&#8217;ve kind of gotten to know them a few weeks in. You can kind of see where people are at and kind of what they&#8217;re capable of to a certain extent. Right. But for me, it was kind of just like, I know. And I told them on the first day, I was like, when we were going over key parts of the syllabus, I was like, I know that you are going to use generative AI probably whether I allow you to or not.</p>
<p>So just use it, but be conscious of how you&#8217;re using it. Cite your usage of it when you do, and provide documentation to me so that I can see how you&#8217;re using it. Because there may be parts like kind of we were talking about where it could be harmful or misleading or maybe it&#8217;s not giving them the right information that they need and things like that. So that&#8217;s been kind of an interesting thing to also navigate. There are a few students who I suspect of using generative AI without disclosing it according to the rules of our syllabus. But for now, I&#8217;m kind of letting it slide, mostly because I just haven&#8217;t gotten that sense of familiarity with where they&#8217;re at and being able to tell one way or another. And I also have seen the negative effects of accusing students of plagiarizing their work or doing something that they are capable of that you just don&#8217;t believe. And that can leave a really lasting and poor impression on students because I remember experiencing that once a little bit where because I was working at the printing company, I had access to all kinds of printing equipment, tools, materials, and quality paper, quality design.</p>
<p>I also did a lot of prepress. And so I knew what it took to design something and actually have it be printed in a way that is high quality. And for one of my first projects I did that, I tried to pull out all the stops, like my work let me use what was available. And when I brought in my project, I remember they didn&#8217;t believe the work that I did was really mine and that I actually bound the book, printed the book, designed it, and did all of that. And although it wasn&#8217;t as relevant to the conversation on generative AI, I still remember that to this day and feeling like, well, if I&#8217;m in a student in this scenario who&#8217;s really excelling at their projects and doing to the point where you don&#8217;t even believe the work is mine, then why am I here, right? You know what I mean? So I try to be very careful about who I accuse or not of using it. And I think ultimately at the end, if they are going to use generative AI to essentially cheat their way through my course, they&#8217;re not going to get the return on the educator investment that they&#8217;re putting in. So I think ultimately it all ends up in my favor anyway, but the initial impact of that may work in their favor in the short term.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t teach in the age of AI. I&#8217;m so glad because I can only imagine now that it&#8217;s and I mean, that was sort of a thing that came up a lot as sort of a stopping point for educators. Like, I think maybe about a year or so ago when Chad GPT really started to become used more commonly was in educational spaces. Professors really being like, prohibiting it, of course, but then also curious about it because the work is sometimes actually kind of good.</p>
<p>And yeah, it&#8217;s like if a student is going to mortgage their future away by using generative AI, why are you in school? Why are you even doing it? I mean, I taught business students, so these weren&#8217;t even design students. So maybe I came into it with a little bit of a bias because they really were just like, &#8220;look, this is an elective. I just need to take this so I can get my business degree and go get my MBA or whatever.&#8221; They didn&#8217;t really care about design. And not to say that I wanted to make them care about design, but I also didn&#8217;t want them to think this was going to just be a cakewalk for them.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Not to say I made it hard on well, I might have made it a little hard on purpose. I would kind of change the course as things went along because like I said, I came in and I really wanted to change things up. I would edit it from like, semester to semester. I would change some things up. And I remember this one student who I failed three times. Not on purpose. I didn&#8217;t fail them on purpose. What I&#8217;m trying to say but they failed the course three times, and it was because I would change the course slightly, like change certain things, and they would keep using the same homework and materials from the first time that they failed the course.</p>
<p>I would change the nature of the assignment, and they would just turn in the same thing. I&#8217;m like, did you not read what the assignment was? Why would you turn in something that&#8217;s completely different? Just&#8230;students. </p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Oh, my God, that&#8217;s so funny. I hope a year or two from now, when I&#8217;ve hopefully taught this class again, more in the future, that I don&#8217;t have students like that because I am a very patient and lenient person, and I often see the big picture of these things, I think, more than my students do. But I really hope I don&#8217;t get to that point because that&#8217;s when it&#8217;ll really start. Like, the shade will start coming out and&#8230;are you for real for real? You&#8217;re just gonna submit the whole same thing? I really hope I don&#8217;t get to that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll get to that point. Again, you&#8217;re teaching design students, so they want to be there for that for the most part. I think you&#8217;ll be fine.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it is a requirement. And one of the things that I did on our first day was do, like, a little intro survey to kind of understand where they&#8217;re at in terms of their interest in the topic of the course, but also how many hours they&#8217;re working outside of the college versus how many credits they&#8217;re taking. Mostly to make sure I&#8217;m saving students from the mistakes that I made when I started college, because I had no idea what I was doing. But it&#8217;s also just good contextually for me to know a little bit about each individual student because that may be one reason or another why they aren&#8217;t participating as much or miss a few deadlines here and there and things like that. So it&#8217;s good for me to have that kind of in mind here and there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Nice. Now along with teaching, along with your work at IBM, you not only stream on Twitch, which I really want to get into, but you have a podcast also. What made you decide to kind of branch out into these other forms of media?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>The way that I describe it to people is&#8230;I just like making shit and putting it on the internet. Oh, sorry, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m allowed to swear, but&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, you&#8217;re fine, you can curse. It&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>So that&#8217;s really kind of the mindset that I guess I kind of approached it with is just, I just want to make stuff and put it out there. Well, I guess I&#8217;ll start with, I don&#8217;t know, should I start with streaming or the podcast? Which one do you want?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about streaming first.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Okay, so for streaming, the way that it kind of happened is during the pandemic, like at the height of lockdown and quarantines and things like that, we were all stuck inside for the most part. And originally I had started as a viewer on Twitch like most people do, and I would primarily watch people play video games and they were mostly within the queer community. I am a gay man for context. I don&#8217;t know if I talked about that yet, but yeah, I&#8217;m queer as fuck. And I just started watching queer streamers on Twitch who play games and I started playing with them and then I forget what it was that really kind of crossed me over in terms of the boundary of going from Twitch to entertainment, but now as a way to learn more about web development and design, because there are a few of us that stream about design on Twitch, myself included. And then there&#8217;s also quite a few and quite a bit more people who stream web development and software engineering within the software and game development category, which is typically where I stream as well. And probably like a year into being a viewer, that&#8217;s when I started to think about, well, I&#8217;m stuck at home, I&#8217;m doing some freelance and consulting work here and there, I&#8217;m doing my own thing. Let me just start like a co-working stream and see what happens and just share my work. </p>
<p>And then, because I had been so embedded in the Twitch community and the streamers that I had watched some of which who were still very much my good Judys, as I like to say to this day, even outside of streaming. One of them actually, coincidentally ended up living down the street from me during parts of the COVID quarantine, which is also hilariously coincidental. But those people from the queer gaming community really gave me the viewership that I needed and that initial push of support to become a Twitch affiliate. So that&#8217;s basically at the point where you can monetize your stream a little bit, you can have subscribers make emotes and do things like that. That happened within the first two weeks of me streaming and everyone was just so extremely supportive despite having little to no idea what my content was or what I was actually streaming because I was streaming my design work and some of my process. And then one thing led to another and probably now I&#8217;m a little bit more removed from that kind of like queer gaming part, but I still do participate in some of the communities and lurk in some streams here that I like to support here and there.</p>
<p>But then I started to really find more of the software and game development community and all of the streamers, and now some of them are also like my friends. I met some of them at TwitchCon last year for the first time, which was really great, and actually this year, later this month or in October, I&#8217;m going to TwitchCon again and we&#8217;re actually going to do a panel about programming on Twitch. And so I don&#8217;t have a significantly huge viewership around my stream or anything like that, but the people who do come and who hang out and who stay, whether it&#8217;s other streamer or viewers that I&#8217;ve had for years now, some of them have been subscribed to me for over, like, three years. And I&#8217;m like, oh, wow, this is crazy. Thank you so much for your support. And some of those people still to this day have no idea what I do, but they just support me and who I am and what I like to share and put out there. And so it&#8217;s been a really interesting and net positive way of putting myself out there. Kind of like how you&#8217;re talking about in terms of building my personal brand, I guess you could say.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of taken on, I guess its own thing, I guess. I definitely don&#8217;t do it as much as I used to just because now that I work full time and IBM doing my own course, it&#8217;s really hard for me to stream on a regular basis as much as I used to. And so as a result, my viewership and other metrics have kind of gone down since the kind of height of my streaming career, if you want to call it that. But I still do it for funsies and I always did it for fun and I never really cared about the metrics anyway because all I really just wanted to do was just make stuff and put it on the Internet. And so streaming just happened to be the lowest barrier to entry, coincidentally enough for me to do that because when you&#8217;re live, you&#8217;re live. It&#8217;s not like a recording like this where maybe we could potentially edit out some things or something like that. For me, it&#8217;s like what you see is what you get. And also, at the same token, I don&#8217;t have to worry about editing, I don&#8217;t have to worry about scripting or being like a perfectionist on it, which kind of can take away the fun because sometimes I do have that nature about my work.</p>
<p>And so for me, it&#8217;s a fun way to put myself out there to share what I know. And also it&#8217;s part of the reason why I think I&#8217;ve become a bit of a better public speaker, why IBM more willing to engage with public speaking opportunities, do things like this. And also people have learned things from my stream, which kind of goes back to the whole you might be a good teacher someday. And so people on my stream have literally told me like, oh, I&#8217;ve learned so much from you, or thank you so much for your feedback on my work, or something like that. And it&#8217;s just become a really positive outlet, I think, for me whenever I get to do it, just not as frequently as I used to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Is there like a big web development community on Twitch? I mean, like you said before, there&#8217;s obviously gamers and such, but it sounds like there might be a pretty big community there for web development.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I would say so. We&#8217;re relatively unknown, I would say, in terms of the grand scheme of Twitch, but there are some people who have an upwards of an average of 200 viewers and there are some people who have upwards of 1500 viewers when they&#8217;re live.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>And they could be doing anything from coding in Rust or building a silly website with animations and things like that. One of my really good friends, mewtru, I think she&#8217;s like the perfect example of how you can be a streamer and a content creator and have fun and just like, she&#8217;s just really awesome. And I met her through streaming and we&#8217;ve kind of become good friends since then. And we&#8217;ve always been supportive of one another despite not really even knowing or meeting each other up until Twitch last year. And so, yeah, it&#8217;s just interactions like that with people, whether they&#8217;re fellow streamers or viewers, it creates a community around what we&#8217;re doing. And even though I&#8217;m a designer mostly by trade, I still kind of, I guess, hold my own in terms of programming and web development. And my stream is kind of unique in the sense where I add a design lens to things from that. Again, how are you talking about the design, engineering and hybrid perspective that I think a lot of people in the category may not have except for a very small handful of us.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Twitch sounds like one of the rare places online now, like in 2023, one of the rare places where you can really carve out a niche for yourself. Because with things like Instagram and Twitter and things like that, a lot of stuff is very algorithmically driven. And it feels like, at least from what you&#8217;re telling me, Twitch is really more community based in that way.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&#8217;s actually perfect because that was going to be like my next soapbox to get on. When it comes to creating content on Twitch is&#8230;the way that I frame it to people is Twitch is kind of unique as its own brand of social media, like you were kind of thinking about earlier, because it has kind of its own unique culture, to be quite honest around it with emotes and chat and how people interact with the streamer while they&#8217;re live. There&#8217;s also the kind of aspects like you were talking about around community where people who are creating content on TikTok and YouTube and podcasts and even blog articles, any form of media that you put out there. A lot of it is a one way interaction and a lot of people do it with the goal of building an audience that then they can later monetize. But with streaming on Twitch specifically, what I found is that what you&#8217;re really doing is building a community because discovery and algorithms and search on Twitch kind of suck, to be quite honest. That&#8217;s why a lot of people don&#8217;t really know there&#8217;s a whole community of us out there. But for the ones that do know and for the ones that discover us, they tend to stick around and they tend to support what we do, even if they may not like all of the content that we stream.</p>
<p>When I first started streaming one day out of the week, on Sundays, I would just stream League of Legends, which is a game that I like to play for fun with some of my friends. It had nothing to do with the content that I streamed two days a week during the day when I was coworking and things like that. But for the people who wanted that, they came and they stuck around and then when I was streaming other stuff, sometimes they would still come and hang out anyway. And so it really builds on that two-way interaction that I think a lot of people don&#8217;t get from other social media platforms that Twitch is really good at enabling. And in hindsight, it also kind of really aligns with, I guess, desire, you could say, to have a two way interaction with people and not feel like it&#8217;s just a transaction of like this post or subscribe to my newsletter and things like that. It really is a two-way interaction and I&#8217;ve created some really great friends out of it, some of which have helped me with the course that I&#8217;m doing right now, some of which I&#8217;ve helped with their content and vice versa. And it&#8217;s really created a nice little community around what I do, even if my particular streamer and viewership isn&#8217;t as strong as it used to be, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Interesting. There was a time when I was thinking of doing a live show via Twitch for Revision Path. Like I was thinking of doing Revision Path Live like one day a week. This was before the pandemic. If we manage to get the resources to be able to do it, I would love to try to branch into doing something like that because like you mentioned, it&#8217;s a totally different sort of dimension in terms of reaching people and then also in terms of communicating. </p>
<p>Like this conversation that you and I are having will be edited. If it was live, it could be a totally different thing in terms of where the conversation goes and what we talk about or anything like that. So I&#8217;ve been thinking about it, I&#8217;ve really been putting a little bit of thought into it, if we are able to do it. I&#8217;m kind of working on some things behind the scenes just in terms of securing funding for the show and stuff. So I would love to do a live thing maybe like once a week or something as sort of a supplement to the podcast because the podcast has been such a constant thing over the past ten years and we&#8217;ve had blog articles here and there. We did a literary anthology for a couple of years and I would love to sort of add a different sort of component to Revision Path. But yeah, Twitch sounds like it could be it.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s great. And honestly, it may not even have to be Twitch. It could be another live platform. I mean, obviously if you want help with that, definitely feel free to reach out to me. I could probably help you in some way or another. One of the things that just in hindsight that I caution people about is there are some people who maybe come from other platforms and they&#8217;re trying to diversify their viewership, their audience and things like that. And one of the mistakes that I&#8217;ve seen and that people make, what they tend to do, especially if they come from YouTube, is they still treat Twitch like an audience and not a two-way interaction.</p>
<p>And so what you get is people streaming their content and talking into the void, but they&#8217;re not interacting with chat, they&#8217;re not engaging with the people that are there. And that&#8217;s where I think a lot of people tend to maybe fail, I guess you could say, or not get the results or outcomes that they want out of streaming. And mostly it stems from, I feel from my very limited anecdotal evidence and observations that the reason is because a lot of them just aren&#8217;t used to that mindset shift, whereas for me it just kind of happened naturally because I started my content creator journey on Twitch. And so now when people come from other platforms, it may not, I mean people in general tend not to convert between one platform for another. So if you have a really strong audience in one type of media or platform, like the podcast for example, it&#8217;s going to be really hard to get people to move over to something else and that&#8217;s universally regardless of which type of social media or interaction you have with your audience. But it is challenging and it&#8217;s especially challenging for people to go into live streaming on Twitch for that reason I believe too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>No, that&#8217;s good to know. I mean, like I said, if I did it, it would be a supplement to the show and also honestly for scheduling it would be so much easier. I think it will be so much easier but in the future we&#8217;ll see. But since we&#8217;re talking about podcasting, you also have a podcast that you said you started kind of during the pandemic.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. So that kind of ended up just starting as kind of like an inside joke between me and a really close friend of mine, Kevin, who&#8217;s my co-host on our podcast Gay + Geeky and Tired. Hashtag ad. And we started, you know, during the height of the pandemic amongst all the other content creation things I was doing for fun. A lot of times the way I would socialize with my friends during the pandemic was through discord and with my friend Kevin in particular, we would have a group of us, some of us, I met my friend Kevin while I was in college, which was part of Know ancillary college experience. And so a lot of our friends would just joke with me and him about how we should make our own podcast and how we talk about so many things around current events and pop culture and queer culture and society and things like that. And so particularly music and gaming are like two kind of key areas that we tend to talk about a lot. And at one point I think we were kind of just like &#8220;should we do it? Should we do this? Is this for real? Should we really make a podcast?&#8221; And then long story short, we did. We ended up releasing the first episode, I think on my birthday in June of 2021.</p>
<p>It started as Gay + Graphic and Tired because initially, well, we&#8217;re kind of both in the design trade but he more approaches it from like an architecture perspective where I&#8217;m more user experience and so we thought that would be a cute title and then we ended up changing it to what it is now. But we talk about all kinds of stuff. I just explain it to people. It&#8217;s like we just talk about gay shit. We do it very casually. It&#8217;s very unscripted, unfiltered. We come prepared with some topics; we tend to rant a lot. It&#8217;s a little all over the place and you probably won&#8217;t like it, but for the people that do, and some of them have come from my twitch audience as well, they listen to it whenever we release an episode because it is something we do for fun and something we don&#8217;t really monetize.</p>
<p>We have had some spurts and lack of consistently or consistency around posting, especially recently now because of my adjunct role and the kind of demands that both of our jobs now require of us. But we are looking into getting back into it and for the most part we&#8217;ve been putting out episodes pretty consistently now since then. So we don&#8217;t really have a posting schedule or anything at the scale that you&#8217;re doing with Revision Path. But again, it just kind of started as one of those things that we wanted to do for fun and we still do it for fun and probably will until we don&#8217;t want to anymore. That&#8217;s what it is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now have you found that that sort of helped you out in a similar way that Twitch streaming has in terms of communication?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>I think so. I would say Twitch definitely moreso because there is kind of like you&#8217;re talking about that multisensory experience of like you&#8217;re visually there talking to people and then they can obviously hear you because it&#8217;s a video format. I would say, with a podcast, because we have the luxury of being able to edit it and because they can&#8217;t see us. There&#8217;s aspects of it that outside of the technical parts of learning what it takes to produce a podcast a little bit and some tips and tricks here to edit audio and understanding what that process looks like. I&#8217;m not, like, an audio engineer or anything, and I&#8217;m sure your editor could probably do way better than I can at editing our pod, but it&#8217;s just one of those little technical skills that I&#8217;ve always just been able to pick up really quickly just to do something and get it out there. And nobody really complains about our audio, so I think it&#8217;s okay. And outside of that, I would say I&#8217;ve definitely gotten more personal growth and value out of streaming. But for the podcaster thing, I think it&#8217;s also just half of it is just an excuse for me and my friend to get together on Discord and just talk a bunch of crap.</p>
<p>So it has had value but in less, I guess, tangible monetary ways.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s more like it&#8217;s a personal thing. It&#8217;s cathartic. I got you. Okay, what does success look like to you at this point in your career?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>When I was listening to some of the episodes with some other people, I figured this one was coming and of course I did not prepare a very well-worded response. I think success is a really tricky word and the way that I tend to think about it and the way that I frame it to people is that success is different for everyone. And for me, it&#8217;s not necessarily tied to a monetary amount of money or becoming a millionaire or doing anything like that. I think ultimately my idea of success is being able to have a positive impact on the world and the people around me, whether that&#8217;s in small ways or big ways, whether I become some notable designer, Lord, someday or something, I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t care. But just being able to have a positive impact with people, preferably through my profession and personally, and being able to do that sustainably, I think. So although money is not like a motivating factor for me, it is just a reality of the world that we live in. And there are certain ways, like when it comes to the lifestyle that I want and the flexibility that I want and the security and things like that, to where money does play a role in it. But it&#8217;s not necessarily my sole motivator, I guess, like kind of going back to the key takeaway that we were talking about, it&#8217;s really lifting as I climb.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s just been something that especially ever since I got my job at IBM, it&#8217;s something that I take maybe a little too seriously. Because I recognize that there is an immense amount for someone like me who is a queer black person who may not have had the most affluent upbringing, but somehow managed to have this beautiful story of overcoming adversity and all that stuff. There are elements that I still recognize are due to elements of privilege in some way because it&#8217;s on a spectrum. And so there are privileges that I&#8217;ve had, there are opportunities that I&#8217;ve had because of that. But there are also ways that I may have been disenfranchised or oppressed, whether internalized myself or externally.</p>
<p>And so lifting as I climb is kind of a way that I like to give back and uplift people in ways that I can, where I have the power and privilege to do so. Like, one of the ways that I try to do that is, right before coming on the podcast, someone who I&#8217;d went to college with at Bunker Hill actually reached out to me and said, like, &#8220;hey, I saw you posted about consulting opportunities at IBM. I want to learn more about your role and what you do and how to apply and things like that.&#8221; And although I&#8217;m not in a position to hire them outright, I can at least meet with them, give them feedback on their portfolio, give them some advice, insight into what it&#8217;s like, and really just mentoring people. And that brings me joy, that brings me satisfaction. I feel like I&#8217;m helping people. I think that&#8217;s why I also like teaching so much. It&#8217;s a way to just be successful, but also make others successful with me as I go. I guess. Does that make sense?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>If it makes sense to you, it makes sense. It makes sense. It makes sense. I&#8217;m not messing with you. If you didn&#8217;t get into UX, what do you think you&#8217;d be doing?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Oh boy. To be honest, if it had started the other way around, I probably would have been a web developer. It&#8217;s probably the closest alternative, I guess. And then maybe my roads would have crossed elsewhere into UX design later on. Probably, like, out of the wild the answer would be maybe working somewhere in a nonprofit or in healthcare or in the public market somewhere like either, again, teaching &#8212; maybe not teaching design &#8212; but teaching in some form or fashion design. And it&#8217;s just something that&#8217;s been with me that I known I&#8217;ve wanted to do in some fashion or another ever since my vocational training in 9th grade. And that kind of hyper fixation and just knowing what I want to do that early has really propelled me to go really far, at least relatively to people in my age group, I guess you could say.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;d never really considered alternatives outside of maybe becoming a web developer and leaving design or potentially becoming a teacher. But all of those things still include design, I guess, in some way, now that I&#8217;m doing both of those things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Where do you see yourself in the next five years? Like what kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>One of the things that I&#8217;ve been thinking about recently, aside from my craft and that intersection of design and engineering is just putting my design skills and knowledge to work in places where I feel like it aligns with my values. And so I&#8217;m trying to move towards, at least within the short term in some way, moving towards doing more consulting projects and gigs with public sector institutions, so education institutions, colleges, local and state governments, healthcare providers, things like that. And I want to do that because as close as I can get to, I guess, public service, while still very much maintaining what I do as a designer and being able to bring value there in terms of inclusive design where I can add intersectionality and a lot of those things, like socially, that some people don&#8217;t always get the opportunity to bring to their work or maybe just aren&#8217;t to because they don&#8217;t represent or have the identities that intersect in the way for the people that they&#8217;re designing for, I guess. So I guess it would be being a design consultant in some shape or form, working with local and state governments, educational institutions or healthcare.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, your work, your streaming, your podcaster? Where can they find that information?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Online I basically compiled if you want to know where I am on the Internet, basically just go to mannyikomi.com/links. It&#8217;s kind of like my own IBM a web developer, so I&#8217;m going to make it myself version of Linktree essentially. And that just lists all of my links to places where I show up online, including my blog, my stream, my podcaster, my portfolio is also there on my website if it&#8217;s even vaguely up to date. Yeah, I would say mannyikomi.com/links will take you to anywhere I am on the internet that you may also be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Sounds good.</p>
<p>Well, Manny Ikomi, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. </p>
<p>I think one for talking about your story, talking know, just sort of what you&#8217;re working on and even what you&#8217;re teaching and everything. I feel like you&#8217;re kind of at this point in your career where it&#8217;s all going to start to come together for you like in the next few years. I feel like it&#8217;s all going to gel. I&#8217;m listening to what you&#8217;re doing now and that it sounds like kind of what I was doing back in the day. Like I was trying to do all these different things and creating stuff and putting it online. I feel like you&#8217;re at that point where it&#8217;s really going to start to come together and gel in a really positive way and I&#8217;ll be really excited to see what you come up with when that happens.</p>
<p>So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me. This was fantastic. I&#8217;m just so obsessed with what you&#8217;re doing. I think this is great and maybe hopefully one day I&#8217;ll have the kind of impact that you&#8217;re having right now on the community. I think it&#8217;s really cool what you&#8217;re doing. So thank you so much for having me. This is really an honor to be here.</p>

<p>Civic design focuses on the common good, and no one quite sums up just how vital that is to our local communities than this week&#8217;s guest, Sabrina Dorsainvil. As the director of civic design for the Mayor&#8217;s Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston, MA, she uses her skills as a designer and illustrator to develop strategic, human-centered designs that address some of the city&#8217;s most complex issues.</p>
<p>Of course, I was fascinated to learn more about this, so Sabrina described what civic design is about, how she approaches new projects, and the challenges she faces creating solutions that inform and serve hundreds of thousands of people. She also gave some great advice for designers and creatives who want to get more involved in their local communities, and even talked about her work as a design advisor for NY-based design studio designing the WE. Sabrina attributes trusting her passion as her main motivator for success, and I think you&#8217;ll get inspired from hearing more about her story and her work!</p>

(<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BOLJmu8A7rc" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">You might have also seen him rocking some of our merch too!</a>) Paul&#8217;s curiosity for tech and design, along with his extensive project work, definitely grabbed my attention. Having him come on the show was a no-brainer!</p>
<p>We started off our conversation talking about how Paul first got into design, and from there we talked about his process for coming up with new ideas and creating new projects. And if you&#8217;re up for a little 80&#8217;s nostalgia, we go there as well. Paul feels like anything is possible on the web, so I hope this interview inspires you to feel the same way!</p>

<p>Happy New Year! 2017 is here, and we&#8217;re back with a new roster of great interviews for January. First up: Boston-based architect and designer Aisha Densmore-Bey. </p>
<p>Architecture is sometimes left out of conversations about design, so Aisha and I spend some time unpacking that notion. She also shared what she&#8217;d like to see more of from the design community, gave her thoughts on the controversial #NotMyAIA campaign, and spoke about the work she does with getting kids interested in design careers through her seminar program <a href="http://www.aishadb.com/Future-Prep-101-1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Future Prep 101</a>. Aisha doesn&#8217;t limit herself, and I hope you get inspired by what she&#8217;s doing so you can let go of limits in 2017!</p>

<p>When Douglass Turner contacted me via Twitter and said he had a story to tell, I was intrigued. But it wasn&#8217;t until we sat down and started recording that I <em>really</em> see what he meant. From growing up in NYC surrounded by poets and writers to working at Apple in the 80s and 90s to spending years in Reykjavik, Iceland&#8230;Douglass Turner has <em>lived</em>.</p>
<p>Our discussion covered all of this and a lot more, including his thoughts on the ubiquity of software in today&#8217;s world, the work he&#8217;s doing now with his company Elastic Image Software, and his thoughts on diversity in technology. It&#8217;s a pretty fascinating conversation from a very fascinating person!</p>
