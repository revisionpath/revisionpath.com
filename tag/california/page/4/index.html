Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>Summer is over, y&#8217;all. As we head into a new season, it&#8217;s a perfect time to pause and reflect, gain some clarity, and reassure yourself about your purpose. That&#8217;s exactly what this week&#8217;s guest Janessa Robinson is doing, particularly now that she&#8217;s at the beginning of a new adventure &#8212; moving to Los Angeles!</p>
<p>Our conversation began with Janessa talking about the recent move, and she spoke a bit about her day job as a content creator. We also dived into the backstory behind her company Artistry Land, and Janessa discussed how she works as a creative with Asperger&#8217;s, and how she cleverly uses design thinking as a way to manifest success in her life.

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I am Janessa Robinson and I&#8217;m an artist and an entertainer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So how are things going for you right now? What&#8217;s on your mind?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Oh, well, things are going great. I just moved to Los Angeles a month ago, actually drove down here from San Francisco.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It was an interesting experience. That&#8217;s the first road trip that I&#8217;ve taken by myself before. It was amazing because as I pulled into Los Angeles, it really hit me that I live here, that I&#8217;m moving here as a resident. Each other time that I came to LA, it was to visit. I stayed with a cousin once who lived in east LA, she&#8217;s a screenwriter. Every time before that, it was like I came through LAX Airport on my way somewhere else. So I just wanted to stay. I&#8217;m very happy that I&#8217;m here. It&#8217;s a very significant change for me because I spent three years living in San Francisco. And ever since I was a small child, I&#8217;ve always wanted to live here, and not just live here, but be a leader in the community here to contribute something. I just saw that my life is here. So it&#8217;s an amazing experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. It sounds like you&#8217;ve had a pretty transformative year then, especially with this move.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I would say COVID is interesting. There&#8217;s a lot of change for everyone. For me, I went from, oh gosh, spending four hours in traffic, just commuting between San Francisco and Santa Clara to staying at home. And me being like, okay, great. Well, now I can spend all the time I want on my art because we were essentially confined to our homes in the beginning. I decided that I would start dancing every day. I was recording myself and posting these videos on Instagram. I actually made a very intentional decision that I would turn my Instagram page into like a television channel. It&#8217;s like a show. It&#8217;s like an entertainment show. I called it Variety Nessa. [inaudible 00:06:08] dancing and rapping and singing and just shooting really interesting content in ways that would engage people since we were at home. I was like, &#8220;Hey, check this out.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
That led me into doing music actually. I was producing, writing, singing, taking singing and song arrangement lessons, piano lessons, mixing and mastering my own music. I used an algorithm actually to master my music. Yeah, it was really interesting. And sharing it on Bandcamp. My first project, I actually worked with a producing partner where he did the mixes and masters. So I just spent the last year growing tremendously, artistically, getting in FTs and graphic design, just blossoming, just honestly blossoming. It&#8217;s an amazing, amazing year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now you&#8217;re also breaking a bin into Hollywood too, right?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yes. Yeah. I actually literally live in Hollywood. That&#8217;s my community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
That&#8217;s where my home is located, which is really cool. Yeah, I am training at two Hollywood acting studios right now. One is Shari Shaw Studio, which is physically located in Hollywood, although I haven&#8217;t gone there yet because of COVID. And then the other is Leslie Kahn &#038; Co. Both of these studios are very special to me. The instructors there, my classmates, the energy and the way that we all invest into each other, it&#8217;s just very special to me. Then I&#8217;m very happy because for me, Hollywood, physically, and more metaphorically, the Hollywood community, which is spread out across the world. There&#8217;s Hollywood the location, and then there&#8217;s Hollywood the industry, which is just, it&#8217;s a bunch of us who are very, very fond of entertaining and see a lot of value in it.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
For me, something that over the last year I was really reminded of is my family history in Hollywood. I have a great, great grandmother named Eva Wheatley Jones who danced with Josephine Baker. She&#8217;s one of the first &#8220;tan girls.&#8221; Meaning that she&#8217;s light-skin, brown, but not dark-skin brown, but at that time it was considered progress, I suppose.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I guess they all just call it colored back then, right?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. I think that didn&#8217;t even come on mind. Yeah. She&#8217;s one of the first tan girls to dance with Josephine Baker. She is married to a comedian and he was a part of a comedy dance duo, same as Butter Beans. Then I have a great uncle, Arthur, who played in a jazz band for Al Capone at the Copacabana in Chicago. There&#8217;s just a lot of people in my family that have really contributed to make the Hollywood entertainment industry what it is today. The inclinations that I have for all of these different forms of art, I just love art, I just love design. For me, it&#8217;s about the process and the experience. Whatever the tools are, I&#8217;ll just use them to just make something magnificent. I don&#8217;t really care what the tools are. I want to do cool stuff.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It occurred to me when my mom was sharing all this information with me, that was shared with me in my childhood, but this is now, I&#8217;m in my adulthood, and now it resonates more to understand, oh, I see. These are the giftings that my family, that my ancestors, recent and much further back, that they&#8217;ve bestowed on me. So I feel very, very blessed and very grateful and appreciative to be in the position, to know that, to see that, and to activate on what it is that they have deposited into me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. It sounds like it&#8217;s literally in your blood to be an entertainer. You come from that lineage. That&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah. It is. It&#8217;s in my blood. That&#8217;s what my mom says. She goes, &#8220;This is who you are. This is in your DNA. These are your genes.&#8221; That&#8217;s what she tells me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So let&#8217;s talk about one of the things that you&#8217;re currently doing. You&#8217;re a content creator for a company called News Break. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting. So, News Break is a news publication that is available as a website, newsbreak.com, and as a downloadable mobile application. So people can go visit their App Stores or Google Play Store and download News Break. It is interesting because it solves a problem. It solves the problem of gathering local news over, gosh, I don&#8217;t know, the last, you could say 20, 30, 40 years. It depends on how far you want to go back. But we know that for some time, there&#8217;s been a trend of investment into local news dwindling. News Break prioritizes local news on the app and the website based on the geolocation of the user. It also pulls in national news. But the thing is that national news, it&#8217;s pretty repetitive. [crosstalk 00:11:37] the news wires. So it&#8217;s the same story over and over. It just has a slightly different, it depends if. It&#8217;s a news wire, it&#8217;s just going to be the exact same thing.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
But in most cases, it might be a slightly different tone based on the writer&#8217;s style or it just has a different mass head that it&#8217;s under. But national news, now that we have Twitter and YouTube and all these things that help us communicate one story to billions of people instantaneously, it&#8217;s just pretty repetitive. So local news is pretty cool because it&#8217;s specific to what&#8217;s happening in your community, in your neighborhood. Like what&#8217;s going on. I first started writing for News Break just as I was leaving San Francisco. I was writing stories there, and then as I moved here, I switched to writing local stories about Los Angeles. Honestly, I like to report on really interesting people, local businesses. I love reporting on food. I&#8217;m a pescatarian and I&#8217;m allergic to dairy. So I like to go out and see, well, where are the best seafood tacos? Because I love seafood food tacos. Where can I get a really good salmon sandwich? Just write about that. Also, I like to eat those things.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I like to be in that moment and just allow my palette to be dazzled and then take all of that energy in and write about that so that I can recommend to people where to go. I&#8217;ll say that LA is LA. There&#8217;s no place like Los Angeles. Reporting here has been very interesting. I just did a story on a luxury experience service company called the [inaudible 00:13:27]. I hope that people do not, the French people do not criticize French accent, but I do speak a bit of French. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s mostly accurate, but yeah, I got to report on this luxury experience company and meet the owner who&#8217;s a very private person. So I&#8217;ll respect his privacy.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s the fact that I&#8217;m talking about luxury experience company that we will, if I say, Hey, I wanna fly to Monaco for a private shopping trip tomorrow, they&#8217;ll put that together right now. They&#8217;ll have a driver come pick me up. They&#8217;ll have a private jet waiting for me. There&#8217;ll be food, snacks that are on the way, all these things. It&#8217;s just this amazing company that in comparison to my time in San Francisco, it&#8217;s not to say that that doesn&#8217;t exist there, it&#8217;s just maybe not as ingrained into the culture like in San Francisco. It&#8217;s more like, where&#8217;s the best vegan place to eat or what&#8217;s a really good mountain to climb, is what draws people there more so than LA, which is how fabulous can I live?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds very LA, something like that.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
LA was the last city that I visited before all this pandemic stuff. We did a live show there back in Jan&#8230; Well, it was January or February. It was February. Yeah, it was February of 2020. We did a live show down in Leimert Park. That was pretty good. I didn&#8217;t get to see a ton of LA. I just remember LA being so big. I stayed in Koreatown and the event that we did was in Leimert Park. Then I was in another part of town, not too far from Koreatown. Because I was also there for a work conference. People that were there were like, &#8220;Oh, you should go to the beach.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, but it&#8217;s going to take about an hour to get there.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, that doesn&#8217;t really sound like something I want to do if it&#8217;s going to take that long to get there.&#8221; It&#8217;s still in the city, I guess I didn&#8217;t realize the enormity of Los Angeles until I actually got there and was like, this place is huge, really spread out.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It is, it is very large, honestly. First of all, I hope that you come, that you return to LA and do another live show so that I can be on it. What I was going to say is that before I moved here, the last time I visited was just before the pandemic. I don&#8217;t know if it was around the same time that you were here, but it was just before the pandemic, where the Los Angeles Clippers flew me out here for an interview. I was interviewing for a job there and they flew me down from San Francisco. And oh my gosh, when I got to LAX, I had about, I think like maybe 45 minutes or an hour between landing and the time of my interview. I was like, oh, that&#8217;s plenty of time [inaudible 00:16:27]. I was like, oh my God, am I going to make it? What is going on?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It was just so stressful and I almost missed my flight on the way back. Because I was in those interviews all day and then I was like, I don&#8217;t think they know what time my flight [inaudible 00:16:47]. No one&#8217;s paying attention. So apparently I have to tell them, &#8220;Hey, I have to go catch this flight.&#8221; I almost missed it. When I was in the process of traveling back to San Francisco, I was like, wow. Yeah, it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve lived in a city that&#8217;s really large. I&#8217;m from Chicago. I lived in New York for a bit. Then I started to wonder, I was like, a city with eight million people? LA, do I want to do that? I don&#8217;t know. But then I do. I was like, I don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;ll deal with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right, right.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
So now it&#8217;s like, sure, it&#8217;ll take an hour to get to Santa Monica. That&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;ll just listen to some good music and chill in the car. It&#8217;s no big deal.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was surprised by how much traffic there was. I live in Atlanta, which is notorious for traffic, but Los Angeles has Atlanta beat it hands down. The traffic that I would see, or that actually was stuck in on the one on one was hellish. It was ridiculous.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s tough. I&#8217;ll say, I don&#8217;t have my only comparison points for being in traffic or me being a passenger because this is the first time in my life that I&#8217;ve ever driven regularly. This is the first car that I&#8217;ve ever owned. [inaudible 00:18:03]. I don&#8217;t know. When I was growing up, everyone drove me around for the most part. Even when I got a license, that was still the case. And then when I graduated high school, I went to undergrad. I studied at St. John&#8217;s University in New York, where very few people drove regularly around there.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Then by the time, I transferred and graduated from Tulane University in New Orleans, so by the time I did that, Uber was a thing. It was not yet an app, it&#8217;s text-based, but you could just text this number and a black car would pull up. I thought it was sketchy at first. I was like, [inaudible 00:18:47] kidnap me. Who&#8217;s in the car? But yeah, so then I just Ubered around for almost eight years. Now I own a car and I&#8217;m like, oh, traffic, this is what it&#8217;s like to drive in traffic. So yeah, it&#8217;s interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I missed those early days of Uber when they just had the black cars. But for what I remember, I would take them in different cities, but the one thing that I remember is how much the drivers hated it. Because for them, they&#8217;re used to, I guess if you&#8217;re a black car driver, like a Lincolnton car or something like that, there&#8217;s a certain, I think, clientele that you&#8217;re used to in terms of decorum and all that stuff. Now they&#8217;re picking up drunk kids at the bar and driving them three blocks and then having to clean up vomit from the back seat.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember talking to, I did it for an article, this was back in the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Jesus, maybe 10 years ago, I think. God, wow, [inaudible 00:19:48] services have been around that long. But I remember talking to some drivers and them being like, &#8220;Yeah, I hate it. I don&#8217;t know what this Uber thing is, but it&#8217;s some extra money. But I don&#8217;t like the fact that we have to pick up these folks and they give us attitude. And it&#8217;s just a different thing.&#8221; Now of course, ride sharing is a pretty, I think, common thing because now folks can even use their own cars. But I remember in the beginning though, just taking those black cars and it just felt so official. Like, oh, this is nice. I felt wealthy.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah, it is. I would agree. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re used to a very specific persona for clientele. I remember when I was in D.C., I was out with some friends and we ordered, this is when Uber was an app, but I think we got Uber black, because it was so many of us and we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get a SUV or whatever.&#8221; I had this friend who was giving the Uber driver directions, which is already like, I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re doing this, he has a map, what are you doing? He tells the driver, he was like, &#8220;Yeah, bang a right right here.&#8221; And the driver drove straight through the intersection.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Whoa.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
He doesn&#8217;t know what bang a right means. He was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what that is.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;Bang a right, what is this?&#8221; And just kept going straight. I think also, he maybe didn&#8217;t like that this guy was leaning over the seat, giving him directions. But yeah, there was some clear maybe mismatch of energy there. So, those funny.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to talk to you about this term, content creator, because it&#8217;s certainly one that I think has popped up, I don&#8217;t know, maybe with over the past two years or so. We&#8217;ve been seeing this generalization of people that maybe before have done specialized stuff, like they&#8217;ve been writers or illustrators or whatever. Now it&#8217;s just this generic term, content creator. When I hear it, I feel like it&#8217;s mostly associated with video. But I&#8217;m curious, when you hear that phrase, content creator, what does that mean to you?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Honestly, I don&#8217;t know what&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. It could be in a lot of things. I have Asperger&#8217;s. One of the characteristics of that is a person might see a word or a phrase and their mind starts to run through the multiple meanings or ways that it could be used, the etymology, at least for me because I&#8217;m a linguist. Honestly for me, it&#8217;s like a placeholder, just some words, just some letters, some syllables that go there to describe the way that someone moves through the world. It&#8217;s used in a lot of ways, I agree. Like sometimes it&#8217;s used for writers, sometimes it&#8217;s used for people who run podcasts, sometimes it&#8217;s for video people. I think in the context of News Break, it&#8217;s [inaudible 00:22:45]. I think it&#8217;s because they use content creator because in a lot of cases, they&#8217;re looking for someone who&#8217;s more than a writer.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Being a writer is great. It&#8217;s an excellent skill. But in the digital space, when you&#8217;re developing articles, unless you have a full editorial staff where you have photographers and art directors and video producers that are their own individual team, then the writer, the journalist becomes the person who wears all those hats. So I&#8217;m that person. I do interview people. I develop sources and relationships, I interview them. I shoot photography, I edit photography, I shoot video, I edit video and I polish it all up and I drop there. So for me, I guess that&#8217;s what I associate with now, is if I&#8217;m a content creator, I&#8217;m someone who I create any kind of content.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s like the same thing where I&#8217;m like, yeah, I can make my own music from end to end. Whatever the content is, it&#8217;s something I can create. It&#8217;s [inaudible 00:23:48] the way that I see it, but I don&#8217;t know. I think it can be one, is that now going to be the expectation. Our specialties no longer going to be as prized being a really excellent writer. I think for some people that might be maybe all they want or maybe they only want to do photography. I don&#8217;t know. I feel good about it because I can do all those things and I like doing all those things, but what about someone who doesn&#8217;t want to do all those things? But if they have a very strong interest in one area, I hope there&#8217;s still space for those people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It sounds like it&#8217;s a new way of looking at Jack of all trades. That&#8217;s how, I guess, it used to be called, where you did a lot of different things. You just brought a lot of different skills to the table. I had a friend that, actually, he really explained it to me in a way that made sense. It&#8217;s like, he says, &#8220;Content these days is water and whatever the medium is or the platform is the container that content can fill.&#8221; So for example, let&#8217;s say, oh, so there&#8217;s this guy, he&#8217;s a chef. His name is chef John Kung. He was mostly doing stuff on TikTok, I think. But the concept is him cooking, which can be extrapolated to any number of different platforms because he&#8217;s using video.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So in that video format, yes, it could go on TikTok, but it could also go on Instagram. It could also go on YouTube, but you could see how these different platforms would have different audiences, different levels of engagement, et cetera. But someone could also take that and take the video out, and now you just have the audio and that could be a podcast. Or someone could transcribe that audio, and now that&#8217;s an article. Or someone can take that article and make images of it, and now it&#8217;s an infographic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So content ends up being this, it&#8217;s the idea and then whatever that medium or platform is, is how it can trickle down and filter down. But yeah, that&#8217;s if you want to do all of that stuff. For example, I consider myself a podcaster, but I have had people call me a content creator because I can do video dah, dah, dah, dah. I mostly just do podcasting because that&#8217;s what form this particular idea is in. But yeah, Revision Path could be video and articles and all this stuff. I choose for it not to be, but it could be. I hear that term, content creator, and it&#8217;s like, I was bristle at it a little bit because I&#8217;m like, be specific. But then maybe that&#8217;s just me being older thinking it has to be in one of these finite categories or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
That&#8217;s interesting. I think I like it because it is flexible and broad. For me, today I might want to write articles, tomorrow I might want to shoot a film. I don&#8217;t like figuring out the way to label myself in regards to the way that I contribute artistically. I don&#8217;t know. I end up with a lot of words. If you go to my website right on Janessarobinson.com or artistryland.space, there&#8217;s an area in both places to read my bio. And it says Janessa Robinson is a publish journalist, a writer, an actor, a photographer, a this, a that. There&#8217;s so many, what would I call this? I was like, I don&#8217;t know what to&#8230; I like when there&#8217;s something that&#8217;s flexible or broad enough. The word artist, I love it because you could be a performance artist, you could be a singer, you could be a poet.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s flexible enough in a way where someone who creates art at this point is not just a singer or not just a poet. If you&#8217;re an artist, it means that you have a particular artistic vision, artistic gaze and artistic process and you apply that to whatever medium. The medium at that point isn&#8217;t as relevant as it is to maybe whatever the message is that you want to communicate. The question that becomes, is this the best medium or is this the proper medium or the best way to reach people? What&#8217;s the goal? So with content creator, I like it because otherwise, it&#8217;s like, well, am I a writer, video producer or this? And it&#8217;s like, it becomes this long list. In Hollywood when someone is multi talented that way, we used to call it a triple threat. Like Jamie Foxx, he&#8217;ll sing, he&#8217;ll act, he&#8217;ll produce like comedy, whatever. You call this person a triple threat. Today, we call it a multi hyphenate because triple is not true.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
At that point, it&#8217;s less about the specific activities, like what it is that someone&#8217;s doing and more about who they are and what they bring to whatever they touch. That&#8217;s how I identify. It&#8217;s like if you give me a camera, I&#8217;m going to start shooting things. If you give me a microphone, I&#8217;m going to start singing. It&#8217;s more this artistic energy. So with content creation, I feel very similar. Whereas my content creation might be NFTs and graphic design today. It might be videos and editing, cutting together audio the next day. I like that.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
When I formed my company, Artistry Land, you have to fill out this business paperwork and articulate, well, what are the products of the services? One of the things that I put is digital and physical content. Then I put some examples. I said, including but not limited to, because it&#8217;s Artistry Land, it&#8217;s a land of art. It&#8217;s just going to be whatever I need it to be. I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m figuring that out every day. I love that exploration. I think that&#8217;s amazing. I get to learn a lot and connect with people in ways that are relevant and timely to the present.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about Artistry Land. This is a company that you started a few years ago. Tell me more about it. What are some of the projects and things that you&#8217;ve done through Artistry Land?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah. I was already operating as an entrepreneur since maybe 2014. I began freelance writing and I was gaining all of these opportunities to be published in really great sources and publications like Huffington Post and Salon and Ebony and WAC, [inaudible 00:30:21], The Crisis Magazine and The Guardian. I just thought that was a cool thing to do on the side. And then maybe two years ago, I think, it was occurring to me that I could formalize this business. I could formalize this business into something that grows beyond just freelance writing. My father is an entrepreneur. He&#8217;s been an entrepreneur for a long, long time. He actually is a former professional basketball player. He was drafted to the Utah Jazz and then he went to play in Europe for about eight years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah. Then when he came back, he did some sales stuff while he still had entrepreneurial things going on, and then I just grew up with watching him build businesses. So I thought to myself, well, you know what I really like about my dad&#8217;s entrepreneurship, that it allows him to live, to be fully human, to not be tied to someone else&#8217;s schedule, to make his own decisions about where he needs to be, and when particularly as it relates to him living his purpose. So with Artistry Land, I did these brainstorm exercises and I was like, well, what is my business? What does it do? Who does it serve? Before I came to a name, by the time I went through my research, I was like, okay, well, who&#8217;s Janessa? Janessa does love to write, but Janessa is so much more than that. Here I was dancing on Instagram and I was like, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
At this point I had also had a short film. It&#8217;s a 30 second film featured in Time Magazine and Ava DuVernay&#8217;s Optimist issue, [inaudible 00:32:10] Optimist issue video project. I was like, I do love film. I studied cinema and I grew up in theater and I did do some acting classes in college. I was like, here I am, I want to do music. I was like, well, what is this company? So I just formalized it into Artistry Land as I developed my own artistry. I operate a blog at artistryland.space, where I do produce content. It&#8217;s mostly written, something I started doing. But this year, I think in the summer, was just highlighting artists because Artistry Land is really focused on the intersection of art and wellness. I see these things as so intrinsically tied together. I don&#8217;t know a single artist whose mental health or physical or otherwise holistic health isn&#8217;t impacted by their art or their ability to produce their art or the reception of it.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Every artist I know has some health related experience to practicing their art. And for many of us, I&#8217;ll speak for myself, art is healing. I love the idea of artists who are doing well and living well. And that&#8217;s exploring what that means, what it means to do well for yourself and to do good in the world and to live well. What are the practices that you do that cultivate that experience? I&#8217;ve begun interviewing artists who do good in the world and they live well. I ask them questions about what artistic projects are most meaningful to them, what art they practice?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I interviewed a friend of mine who&#8217;s an opera singer. She lives Japan. She&#8217;s a black woman. She&#8217;s an opera singer. It&#8217;s the year 2021 and she lives in Japan. She&#8217;s a rarity by definition. She talks about her time studying Buddhism, particularly while living in Japan. For just discussing how important it is for her to be a black woman, opera singer in this very old, traditional art form, I get to learn a lot. I think it&#8217;s really important that artists continue to learn from each other. There&#8217;s a lot of folks who talk about the need for artists to support each other, which I agree 100%. I just find that it is maybe more motivating if it&#8217;s clear in terms of what we&#8217;re learning from each other. If I&#8217;m learning something, I&#8217;m going to show up. If you just go, &#8220;Hey man, you should support me.&#8221; I&#8217;m going to be like, &#8220;I would like to, but this is like you&#8217;re asking me to hug a porcupine right now. You&#8217;re not being super endearing about this.&#8221; So if you go, Hey, this is what we&#8217;re learning together, then I&#8217;m very motivated to show up.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
That&#8217;s my approach with Artistry Land, is to say, well, I want to learn from you. I hope that people, by reading your interview and being introduced to your art, by following you on Instagram or Twitter, or checking out your website, that they learn from you as well. I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s really important. Something else that I&#8217;ve done with Artistry Land is I&#8217;m developing relationships with clients. I do design work under Artistry Land. Graphic design, brand strategy, brand design work. So I have some business to business clients. One of them is called, Where is My Meeting, which is a digital video production company. I think most recently they ran a press conference for Muriel Bowser in D.C. about COVID and vaccinations. But they also did, I partner with them on this, it&#8217;s like a virtual talent show in February, which feels like a really long time ago. I was like, is that last year? It was definitely [inaudible 00:36:07]. It is called Celebrate Black Voices Talent Show. Where is My Meeting did the video production for, and we gathered all of these black artists to spotlight. So there&#8217;s poetry and there&#8217;s rap.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I shot and edited my own music video and aired it in that talent show, which is really cool. Then I also, I&#8217;ve just been searching for organizations to partner with and invest in. One of them is, oh, you probably know this, it&#8217;s the Queer BiPAP Design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. [inaudible 00:36:47].</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Exactly. I saw what they&#8217;re doing in terms of promoting design, thinking, empowering queer BiPAP people with resources to be designers professionally. And I said, &#8220;Oh, I would love to contribute.&#8221; So I decided to donate after our call that I had with Steve to just learn more about who they&#8217;re serving, how they&#8217;re serving people, what the offerings are. And then another organization that I decided to donate to is one that I used to, it&#8217;s a theater that I used to train at when I was in Chicago, it was called the Chicago Beverly Arts Center.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
When I was in high school at Morgan Park High School, I participated in an off-campus drama program at the Sphere. Because every Thursday, I was done with classes, maybe like, I think halfway through the day. Then I would go to the theater and we&#8217;d be in class all afternoon to the evening. It was me and a small group of students. The staff at the Beverly Arts Center trained us one theater. They took us into the theater onto the stage, which is not the first time I&#8217;d been on stage because I did do stage plays in elementary school. But they go, &#8220;This is downstage. This is upstage. This is what happens behind the curtains.&#8221; And then we went and we started to replays and then they had us write our own play, produce it. Do costume design, then we get to act in it.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It was the most amazing experience ever. I called the Beverly Arts Center a few weeks ago and I said, &#8220;Hey, do you still have this partnership with Morgan Park High School?&#8221; The artistic director at the time said, &#8220;Yeah, I actually need to write a grant for scholarships.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; So I donated some money for that purpose so that students there would have a scholarship to help cover their classes at the Beverly Arts Center, because it now dawns on me that someone did that for me at some point. I didn&#8217;t know. I just was there having fun, but I didn&#8217;t know that someone paid for it. Now something that I&#8217;m exploring with the Beverly Arts Center is as someone who has Asperger&#8217;s and has learned in my adult life in the last maybe year and a half, two years about it.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
When I look back, I see how much growing up in theater camp and drama class really helped me understand social settings, social norms and expectations and experiences. Because when you&#8217;re reading a play, whether it&#8217;s a table reading or you&#8217;re performing, you could be off book, whatever, you have this concept of setting and characters and relationship and subtexts under the dialogue and action. It just broke down things to me that were somewhat confusing. So I thought, Hey, maybe I can talk to the Beverly Arts Center and see if they&#8217;re interested in doing something that focuses on empowering people on the autism spectrum through this particular medium, through theater and acting.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s something we&#8217;re having a conversation about. It&#8217;s something we&#8217;re exploring. I hope that we&#8217;re able to come up with something because I just know the impact of that on my life. People have all these conceptions about, if they&#8217;re aware of autism or Asperger&#8217;s to begin with, then they might have conceptions about the way that it presents itself or what the person looks like. Generally speaking, people seem to think that I don&#8217;t &#8220;look like someone with Asperger&#8217;s,&#8221; which is like, whatever. [crosstalk 00:40:32]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, what does that mean?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know. I cringe, but then I&#8217;m like, I just listen. Thanks for sharing that. Thanks for being open and honest, but I agree. There&#8217;s not a look. And then the second thing they&#8217;ll say is, well, also I can&#8217;t tell. You don&#8217;t seem awkward or whatever. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s interesting. Because, one, I studied communication. I work in that field. So I was like, this is a very intentional set of choices of media. And two, I&#8217;ve spent my life in acting and theater and speech class and all these things that I guess at this point, people, they have no idea. But when I was a child, I remember being sent home a lot because I would go play with friends and then something would happen.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t really know what it is, but they would send me home and be like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, sometimes she&#8217;s not getting along with the children. She won&#8217;t apologize.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What would I be apologizing for?&#8221; I just didn&#8217;t understand. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Are you sorry?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;You&#8217;re supposed to say you&#8217;re sorry.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Why would I say something I don&#8217;t mean?&#8221; It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t have a problem with remorse or regret. I&#8217;m a human. It&#8217;s just that whatever the social norm or expectation that I broke, I didn&#8217;t understand the concept of it. I was like, what is it that you&#8217;re expecting? Because you haven&#8217;t stated it directly to me. And if you haven&#8217;t expressed it verbally to me or in writing, that&#8217;s preferable. If you put it in writing, then I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on. I was like, I just don&#8217;t&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Simple things like&#8230; A friend was mentioning to me the other day, he knew a child on the spectrum and he sat down as a child on the sofa and started talking to him and the kid was just locked gazed on the television and wouldn&#8217;t look my friend in the eye. And I was like, even that, I don&#8217;t get that. If you came over to sit down next to me and I&#8217;m watching television, you&#8217;re now disrupting me. I was like, [inaudible 00:42:38]. I don&#8217;t understand. So anyway, I like Artistry Land because it gets to explore these different aspects of art in the way that it shows up in people&#8217;s lives. It&#8217;s typically connected to someone&#8217;s early childhood experience or some transformative life change that they&#8217;ve made in their adulthood, but people that I talk to feel drawn to it.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I see Artistry Land as a publication by an artists for artists and also this house, this art house of content that I am developing as I grow my business. At some point I want to hire people. I&#8217;m just trying to figure out how to go about that. The whole thing about being a business owner with employees, that seems intimidating, but it&#8217;s really important because I want to employ artists. So I&#8217;m figuring it out along the way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I think LA certainly is going to be a great city for that. To me, I always see it as this destination location for people that are trying to strike out on their own. I think that&#8217;s just part of the, how am I going to say part of the American story of moving out west, manifest destiny, going into parts unknown and that sort of thing? But LA in particular, when it comes to creativity, it&#8217;s one of the few cities people really look to make a name for themselves. They&#8217;ll do that in LA or they&#8217;ll do it in New York. It&#8217;s one of those two places.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I agree, 100% agree. So funny you say that because what led me out here at this point in my life is a series of very mystical metaphysical experiences that drew me to say, I was working in policy in Washington, D.C. at the time, which is if you work in DC, you pretty much work in policy. What else are you going to do there? Yeah, I enjoyed the work in that it&#8217;s so impactful. I worked with an environmentalist organization, human rights organization. I met community leaders and organizers from Guatemala, from Brazil. People were literally fighting for their land rights, for their homes, for their access to food and water. Yet as an artist, I was not being fed. I don&#8217;t know what the bounds are of this podcast, but I&#8217;ll just mention that I did [shrooms 00:44:59].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Okay. It was a very, very interesting experience that led me to being reconnected with these aspects of myself that weren&#8217;t being fed. So art and being an artist is one of those things. I had all of these moments in meditation, where I saw myself living in Los Angeles as an artist and doing so in a way that&#8217;s incredibly meaningful. Because I had built up all of this awareness about politics and the intersection of race, gender class. And these are all things that I was writing about. Yet we were looking at Hollywood at that time like, why is it not getting what&#8217;s going on in the world? Why does Hollywood not understand that some of these pictures are not going to do well or that some of these narratives are no longer acceptable?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Basically, it just came to me that I&#8217;m going to be moving here and I&#8217;ll be someone to contribute something of significance in the area of progress. It all happened very quickly. I found myself quitting my job. I was in a relationship, breaking up with my boyfriend, breaking my lease and just all in two weeks, everything changed. I actually traveled around the country for a bit at that time. I visited LA, where I stayed with my cousin in east LA and I spent time walking around. I visited Vegas and Arizona and I went to concerts and then I spent all my money and I had to go back to Chicago.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I had to go back to Chicago. I actually went to take care of my grandfather because he was in his late age at the time. And then I worked at my father&#8217;s basketball program called In the Paint Basketball. I had to go back to Chicago, not just because I ran out of money, because I had $70,000 in student loan debt at the time. So I needed a lot of money, and that&#8217;s where I rebuilt myself. I spent about eight hours in meditation per day just getting to understand what most fulfills me and allowing my subconscious to open itself up to my super conscious mind so that it became very clear to me about what to do and how to do it. So I went through the process of job seeking. I did some temp work for a little bit and I was interviewing.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Then I landed a job at Greater Good Studio in Logan Square on the north side of Chicago. It was a really amazing experience because when I got there, I was introduced to design thinking. I had been curious about it, heard about it, but when I got there and I learned about design thinking, I learned that there are some elements of it that I had already been using, which helped me find that job, like this idea of developing product features. So sometimes designers will write whatever product is or what it&#8217;s meant to do at the top of a page or they&#8217;ll use a board and use post-its or whatever. And then they&#8217;ll write down its features. Like what does the product do? How it does it feel like physically? What color is it? If it makes sounds, what are the sounds it makes, what do those sounds indicate? Where&#8217;s the product use?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
You have to think about designing this. And it could be a physical product or it could be software, it could be artistic project. But I was stunned because I had already written down on a sheet of, excuse me. I had already written down on a sheet of paper, &#8220;Janessa&#8217;s ideal work environment and Janessa&#8217;s ideal job.&#8221; Then I wrote down all these characteristics, which as a writer, is the word that [inaudible 00:48:55]. Like these are the characteristics that make up this experience. As a designer, you go, these are the features. I wrote down that it has to have sunlight and people were really kind. I wanted something that had an industrial feel and it was open air and I needed it to be near places I could eat at. So when I showed up for my interview at Greater Good Studio, I was like, this open air office with exposed brick had these huge windows and across the street is this vegan place. I was like, &#8220;Oh my God, this is the place. This is so cool.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I got to work with people that were very artistically and creatively inclined, as well as people that are very research driven. I worked on a project where our client was the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. And the name of the project is called Raising Places. It&#8217;s basically a community design project where we went to communities across the United States, those six communities from the west coast to the east coast, and we taught them the process of design. So we had workshops and design sprints and research fronts. We just helped them map their community challenges. Some of the challenges that came up were street lighting and safety, safety for bikers on the streets, like people who are bicycling across the road and they want to feel that there&#8217;s enough space for them, food security.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I spent time on a native American reservation, it&#8217;s Crow Nation, reservation in Montana, and they have one grocery store on the reservation and it didn&#8217;t carry very many fresh foods and vegetables. And there are so many systemic reasons about what created those conditions. We could look at policy, we could look at legislation, we could look at the land grabs from native Americans, colonization overall. These were very, very heavy, serious conversations. Yet there was a lot of fun because the people are, they&#8217;re just families, they&#8217;re just people.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
We got to get to know people and share a bit about ourselves and do as best as we can to empower them through that process. It was a very good experience. It was a lot of traveling, is what I&#8217;ll say. I did 18 trips in six months across the country. Some of those flights were from Jersey to LAX or [inaudible 00:51:35]. And it was like, when I got on the plane, I was eating dinner. When I got off the plane, I was like, should I eat breakfast? Because I don&#8217;t know if my food is digested. It was very confusing. It was just [inaudible 00:51:49], but it was an amazing experience. I hope that there is some lasting impact overall that really improves the conditions that people experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a post that you had up on Artistry Land, where you wrote about using design thinking to help manifest. I&#8217;m curious, how has that practice helped you as a creative? Because I&#8217;m pretty sure our listeners might be able to learn about how they can do that themselves.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting. Some of that gets into the example I gave with Greater Good Studio, where I was as a writer, writing down characteristics. I was like, oh, Janessa really loves politics and photography and writing and she loves traveling. I was just writing down all of these lists of things about myself. I was doing that as a manifestation tool. So I meditate in a space that&#8217;s very open and honest and vulnerable. That might be physically, it could be anywhere. I just mostly sat on the bed or laid on my bed or sat on a yoga mat. But when I closed my eyes and began to breathe very intently, I did so with the intention of being vulnerable and being honest and being true to myself. Because previously living in Washington, D.C., I ended up there because I basically decided not to go to law school.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I&#8217;d spend all this time applying to law school again and got in to Loyola in Chicago, decided not to go and move to DC. Wasn&#8217;t really happy with my life there, and it&#8217;s because I wasn&#8217;t being honest with myself. I didn&#8217;t really want to go to law school either. I wasn&#8217;t being honest with myself. So I had to sit down and go, what do I want? And find this intersection of what do I want with what is very meaningful to contribute to the world? Because the thing about manifestation is sure, people can manifest objects or experiences. However, I believe that the point at least for me, is to do so in a way that is contributing to my purpose. So I&#8217;ve come here with a life assignment. So I would just visualize what is most meaningful to me. I have allowed these visions to pour into me.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Sometimes they&#8217;re very sharp and clear and sometimes it was like a little bit of light in a room full of darkness. And in any case, I&#8217;ll be come out of meditation and then go and write those things down on a sheet of paper. Then as I was job searching or apartment hunting or meeting strangers, I just found that the things that I have written down on a sheet of paper with a pen, it&#8217;s not like, no one can see this, just me, just me in the universe. Those things manifested before me. It just happened. So there&#8217;s a particular frequency that I was operating on that is beyond myself though. I think that&#8217;s really important to say that the intention for me was to move beyond my own ego. Because if it was just ego, it would have been like, I probably would have gone to law school because lawyers make a lot of money. [inaudible 00:55:01].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Pay up those student loans. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah, done. But that would have made me happy. I think the issue with that is that it not making me happy means that my contribution to the world wouldn&#8217;t have been from a place of love. So even as an attorney, I may have thought that I would have been helping people, but how much would I have been helping people if I wasn&#8217;t operating from a place of love and compassion because I wasn&#8217;t being loving and compassionate to myself? So finding some balance between, this makes Janessa happy and this is what Janessa contributes that also makes people happy and is compassionate. So it decreases their suffering. There has to be balance there. So yeah, the design studio, I became more trained in design and I&#8217;ve since worked in Silicon Valley and completed a product design bootcamp in addition to that. Now I use design thinking and manifestation. I don&#8217;t know, they&#8217;re the same thing to me at this point.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
What I do is I&#8217;ll write at the top of a page the year, like 2021, and then I&#8217;ll sketch things that come to me. At one point I sketched a studio, and in the studio there&#8217;s a microphone and a camera and a whole desk set up. Then maybe nine months later, I realized that I was living in a place that I sketched on that book. And I didn&#8217;t even [inaudible 00:56:30]. I didn&#8217;t go out and say, oh, let me match this sketch. It was just, it happened. So I think that when it comes to design thinking, design thinking is about understanding a problem and you apply these phases of design thinking to the process. So there&#8217;s a point where you&#8217;re only focused on the problem. And for me, that was, well, I just blew my life up. I was like, I really need to understand what&#8217;s going on here.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
So I spent months just focusing on that. It doesn&#8217;t have to be months, but you do have to focus on the problem so that you can be clear about what solutions you can develop. My solutions were, it&#8217;s pretty simple, what area of my life do I want to focus on? Personal life, family relationships, intimate relationships, career, home. I can find solutions in these three areas. And those solutions would be, well, what is that balance between Janessa&#8217;s happiness and increasing happiness in the world? Going to work in a design studio is one of those things. Because I knew I&#8217;d learn a lot of things that I could use in other aspects. Moving to Los Angeles, moving to California in general, it&#8217;s very sunny and there&#8217;s a lot of nature and I&#8217;m surrounded by people who also value those things.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Then also, it is important to me to have economic security and to develop wealth because in order to do the things that I see myself doing, where I see myself contributing, I have to have some resources. So for me to say, Hey, I want to donate to the Beverley Arts Center because that place helped make me who I am, I have to have money to do that. I can donate my time too, that&#8217;s a thing. But I was specifically wanted to donate money because that&#8217;s what got me the time to be there in the first place when I was in high school. Well, someone somewhere got a grant or developed a relationship with a funder, and that pulled me to the Beverly Arts Center. So for me, it is really important to look at the intention behind whatever is desired to manifest and to be very clear and honorable in that intention.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Once there&#8217;s clarity about that intention, I use design thinking as a way to align my physical reality with my metaphysical reality. I think sometimes with manifestation, I&#8217;ve learned that someone might be seeking to manifest something and they&#8217;ve created, say a vision board. Maybe they stop there. So they&#8217;ve gone to the metaphysical reality by using intention and finding things that represent these experiences or objects they desire. And in the physical world, they&#8217;ve gathered magazines or cut them out. But then they stopped. Where I think it&#8217;s important to look at is to say, well, how do you continue to align your present physical reality with the metaphysical? And metaphysically, all things exist simultaneously. But the way that we experience them in a physical reality is a bit different. We have this perception of time or limitation. Metaphysically, there are no limitations. Everything is infinite.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Yeah, sure. In infinity somewhere, there might be a version of you that has whatever you put on this vision board and this reality, what are you going to do? What steps are you going to take to actualize that? Now, design thinking can say, let&#8217;s research it. If you want to manifest a trip to Paris, well, let&#8217;s research that. What does it take to get to Paris? I would add, and this is my secret sauce in manifestation and design thinking, is who do I need to be? Who is that version of me that&#8217;s living in Paris? What am I doing there? Who am I meant to meet? Whose life am I meant to contribute to? What lessons do I bring back with me? Those are the things that make it very clear about what I meant to do. If I know that I&#8217;m living in Paris one day and I&#8217;m there as a filmmaker, and I&#8217;m telling the stories of people who otherwise might go unheard, then I know, okay, I need to be someone who is somewhere contributing to a community that needs me. Otherwise, I don&#8217;t become that person.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
So, design thinking can say, okay, let&#8217;s research it and let&#8217;s ask questions about, well, if it could be very basic, what do you need to get to Paris? Passport, all these things. But what types of people visit Paris? What are the choices those people make? What are the problems they&#8217;re looking to solve or the solutions they bring if they&#8217;re business people? What person might be an expert there? How do I become that type of person? What version of myself is that? And it becomes very clear once you&#8217;re doing persona-based work, what the decisions are that someone&#8217;s making, but it&#8217;s important to be clear about the desired outcomes.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
So is it just to live in Paris? Oh yeah, I would love to live in Paris. Is it to cultivate a sense of culture there so that I can translate? Because I do speak French and I want, personally, I&#8217;d like to increase my proficiency so that I could be a translator in a way that&#8217;s very diplomatic and I can particularly communicate amongst French-speaking countries and English-speaking countries across the world. I think it&#8217;s really important to think big and to be specific about what can I do for where I am right now? So if I want to be a translator, a diplomat who translates and deals with issues and builds alliances between French-speaking and English-speaking countries, well, where can I learn more about French-speaking countries? I can research that for my computer. It doesn&#8217;t stop me from doing that. That&#8217;s simple.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s something that I use in a way that at this point it&#8217;s very intertwined. I think I need to find my own name for this approach because design thinking is a very specific thing and manifestation can show up in a lot of different ways. There are folks who do have approaches and particular rituals and ceremonies that they use. A vision board is a great example. It&#8217;s just that it has a title and I don&#8217;t have a title for my process yet. So I&#8217;ll add that to my list of things to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? I know you&#8217;re, it seems like throughout your creative career, you&#8217;ve been on this never ending Odyssey in a way. And now you&#8217;re here in Los Angeles, you&#8217;re about to start off with this new, really this new chapter of your life. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want to accomplish?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I see myself as continuing to lead innovation. I don&#8217;t just mean from a technical standpoint or innovation and business. Innovation and business, of course, innovation in the way that we experience our human lives. That would be leading in Hollywood in the area of diversity, inclusion, equity. I&#8217;m looking at things that would create system change and practices change, particularly when it comes to people on the autism spectrum. But also people generally, that identify to have disabilities, people of color, queer people and women. Because when I was in Silicon Valley, I got to lead, I got to advocate for and develop the existence of employee resource groups at a publicly traded company. And then I became the co-chair of a specific employee resource group or employee belonging group is what they call it there. So I want to apply those learnings to Hollywood and develop ways of working with people to grow our consciousness awareness and to shift our habits and behaviors to reflect our values.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Then simultaneously, I see myself continuing to build relationships more broadly across the business to make it more collaborative and to make it more reflective of a community oriented mindset. That may be the millennial in me, where for me what&#8217;s really important is to collaborate with people and yes, be inclusive. I think that competition is somewhat innate to us as humans, as human beings. There is some sense of an animalistic side where there&#8217;s competition. I don&#8217;t think that we need to over-rotate on that, particularly given the circumstances of climate change or a public health pandemic. I don&#8217;t think that we need to over-rotate on being competitive. I think it&#8217;s a time where it actually behooves us to be more collaborative. That&#8217;s something I see myself approaching through content development, through my choices in who I partner with business-wise, through working with different organizations to see how do we embed those values into the way that we practice our work, whatever that is?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I&#8217;m interested in seeing Hollywood be more dynamic in the stories that we tell and how we tell and what we do with those results. And when I say results, I mean monetary results in this sense. I would like to see that Hollywood is contributing to the communities of the stories that we&#8217;re telling and that we&#8217;re telling stories that are broad enough to represent all communities because people show up. Well, most of theaters are closed or limited, but people show up to the theater to watch stories. They&#8217;re watching those stories either in their own community or in a community that&#8217;s adjacent to them, but someone across the world or across the country might&#8217;ve produced that picture. I would like to see that all of the parties that are participating and contributing to that picture are compensated well. Additionally, that the communities, it&#8217;s not enough basically to have black folks in your movies. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
I want to see that these communities who are having their stories told are, one, having those stories told in a way that&#8217;s justified and respectful. And two, that they get to benefit in some way economically from having their stories told. I don&#8217;t know exactly what that looks like, but basically it&#8217;s to say it&#8217;s not enough to commodify someone&#8217;s story and be like, oh, but I told your story. It was like, okay, yeah, you walked away with all of the material benefits of that. I want to see that communities are being reinvested into, and that people have the chance to develop their own content and their own stories. And that the way that the system operates is in a way that&#8217;s more integrated and collaborative. That may be, I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a new idea or a repackaged idea. I&#8217;m not sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
The audience can find out more about me at janessarobinson.com. They can find out more about me also on social media. So on Instagram @JanessaE.Robinson, it&#8217;s here I&#8217;m often hanging out, is on Instagram. And then folks can also find out more about Artistry Land at www.artistryland.space.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Janessa Robinson, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you for really, one, describing where you&#8217;re at right now in embarking on this new journey in your creative career, But also really diving deep into how the sum total of your other experiences, whether it&#8217;s been traveling or working in other industries and such have brought you to where you are right now. I hope that when people listen to this, they take away that they can have these divergent paths that can lead them towards what their goals are, Because it certainly seems like you&#8217;re doing that for yourself. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Janessa Robinson:</b><br>
Thank you for having me, Maurice. Thank you. I love your show. I love the work that you&#8217;re doing and I&#8217;m very excited to be a part of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;A better world is possible if we approach our work with a class- AND race-aware lens.&#8221; Michael Collett was dropping gems like this, and we hadn&#8217;t even started recording! I have followed Michael&#8217;s work since 2016, and I&#8217;m glad we finally finally got a chance to talk on Revision Path about his career and his overall philosophy to life.</p>
<p>We talked about his involvement with <a href="https://greenworks.earth/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Greenworks</a> and <a href="https://www.designtodivest.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Design To Divest</a>, and Michael shared some of his origin story growing up between The Middle East and the United States. He also spoke about class awareness and politics among the Black creative class, working in San Francisco, and the one piece of advice that has stuck with him over the years. We need deep thinkers like Michael in the Black design community to keep us all honest and accountable!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
My name is Michael Collett, and I&#8217;m a multi-disciplinary designer based in San Francisco, California. I&#8217;m on the steering committee at Design To Divest which is an organization that seeks to center and uplift black creative talent wherever we find it. And I&#8217;m a partner at a company called Greenworks and our slogan is tender loving care for plants and people. Thank you so much for having me today, Maurice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, no problem. Wow, it&#8217;s so formal. My goodness. This is a night live.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
I hit my ribs real quick. [crosstalk 00:03:24].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. How&#8217;s the year been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
It&#8217;s still 2020, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In some ways, yeah, it feels like it.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, not bad truthfully like still walking around, still freelancing and keeping as busy as one can. San Francisco conspires to be approximately 60 degrees while the rest of the country is boiling, so I suppose I should just be grateful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, that&#8217;s right. Just so folks know we&#8217;re recording this right now where there&#8217;s like this massive heat dome over the Northwest United States, like it&#8217;s crushing most other cities, but San Francisco seems to be like the ice cube in the middle of all this.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Yeah, they&#8217;re joking that even the heat can&#8217;t afford rent here, yes. Understandable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What has San Francisco been like now that I guess the state and everything&#8217;s opened back up?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
As a San Franciscan, I hold the right to criticize my city a lot, but I will say that the pandemic and broadly reopening has been handled halfway okay. People were generally pretty willing to put masks on, San Francisco is very, very dense, we all sort of live on top of one another and quite literally.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And the mask rate was really, really high, people have and myself included quibbles about particularly things like outdoor dining and the way that that&#8217;s come to pass. But we&#8217;ve mostly reopened the cases aren&#8217;t really spiking touch wood. I don&#8217;t think it owes much to our political class so much as just our citizenry though.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s been weird how like Atlanta and Georgia, for the most part, it&#8217;s largely been open since, I don&#8217;t know, like May of last year.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Yeah, I have friends in Atlanta who say the pandemic never happened.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It really never felt like it happened. I mean, certainly there were companies that had closed down like movie theaters and such, and even the city itself went through this whole reopening phase. Right now we&#8217;re in phase four of five of the city fully reopening, but it never really felt like the city closed.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, traffic&#8217;s been the same going out and about is largely been the same. I think there might&#8217;ve been certainly a time in early April where it felt like, &#8220;Wow, this is going to really affect the way of life here.&#8221; And then everyone was like, &#8220;You know what? We&#8217;re good.&#8221; They just kept going.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
We just kept going hard and fast here by American standards for sure and the city, and much has been made of the exit is from San Francisco that the numbers don&#8217;t really back up, but definitely a lot of boarded up shops that quickly got covered with graffiti. I don&#8217;t know, I liked my city with a little bit of an edge to it. San Francisco in the last five years particularly had gotten to be a bit of a Disneyland, so a little more bite to the town always, always suits me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you think it&#8217;s sort of changing that way now that there&#8217;s been that Exodus?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
We&#8217;ll see. Like I said, the Exodus is I think a lot more hyped up than real, like maybe some of the folks who were pulling down six figures and never really cared to be here other than for the job itself are in the East Bay now or somewhere deeper into the valley, but there&#8217;s still just roughly the same 800,000 plus people here.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
I think what has sort of been interesting to see is that we all, for the most part, looked around and went, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll put this mask on and do what I&#8217;m supposed to do.&#8221; And it broadly sort of worked, I think of criticism that I&#8217;ve had of everybody throughout the pandemic, both presidential administrations to governors and mayors, and everybody.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
As citizens, we&#8217;ve been left to our own devices to figure this out, and it was pretty cool to see San Francisco by and large sort of figure it out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I finally got to see you speak at this year&#8217;s where are the black designers confident. For folks that don&#8217;t know, I knew Michael, when Michael&#8230; Is Michael Collett still-</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>

I probably shouldn&#8217;t say that it&#8217;s still my email address, but yeah, it&#8217;s still my email address. It was a numb day brand or whatever you want to call it for a while. I&#8217;m mostly using my full initials as a professional mark these days, but I&#8217;m always working on something that was why the name existed to begin with is because what are you doing or I&#8217;m working.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Back in the day, it was a lot of black collar work service industry stuff and that kind of work as much as graphic design. So it was an homage to being on both sides of that fence, but these days it&#8217;s mostly just graphic design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, but seeing you at this year&#8217;s conference and getting to hear you speak on that panel, I was like, &#8220;Wow, this is dope.&#8221; I was the whole event for you.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Pretty seamless, I tuned in, I was out and about on Saturday on some personal business, but tuned in and watched a session before on Sunday. And much as Zoom we&#8217;ve grown to joke is and Design To Divest is pretty notorious for glitching out whenever I get too political. The technical part of it was seamless, and then I don&#8217;t know if you stuck around for the online little after party, but there was just a wonderful sort of sense of community in particularly like the slack rooms and the chats that were going on.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
I&#8217;m always impressed that people manage to produce anything resembling a human connection when it&#8217;s just Zoom screens and chat windows, to organize a real event. And then I&#8217;m somebody who grew up on Okayplayer message boards, and the old BB boards days, and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
So I know it&#8217;s possible, but the idea of like running a whole conference just digitally, still strikes me as really impressive. So I was just blown away by all of it. The branding I thought was really, really nice, just some lovely illustrations and all the way through to the Zoom backgrounds for presenters, really well thought through. You know how designers can be, God, we&#8217;re so nitpicky, but I felt really touched to be a part of it and to be asked to be there. So that was really great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I gave the second day keynote for the conference, and that was something that I mentioned was now more than ever we have, of course, like these physical groups of people that got together, pre pandemic, we have Bay Area black designers, black designers of Seattle, and other kind of similar groups.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But then like the number of events that sprung up over the last year, because someone, like you said had a Zoom account, they&#8217;ve got a Slack room, boom, put it together. You&#8217;ve now got a conference venue where you can bring people in and they can give talks. And like the technology has progressed to the point that allows us to sort of spin this up pretty cheaply and pretty robustly which is great to see.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And credit to the organizers, I think particularly of this year is where the black designers, without naming names I&#8217;ve been to some other things that just felt like workdays, you&#8217;re just in Slack and on Zoom all day and I&#8217;m like this doesn&#8217;t&#8230; Whereas like designers this year did not have that feel, and I think that&#8217;s the real secret sauce, if you will, is being able to take these tools that let&#8217;s be clear have been built for business purposes and to use them for something that is deeper and beyond that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think that just like black folks though?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
It sure is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Making something out of nothing. But yeah, the amount of different events and things that have come on and I did some of those events last year and it has varied wildly, some of them have been super easy, super smooth, and then others have really felt like work.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
The first versus, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right, right, right. Yeah. So like you mentioned, you&#8217;re a partner at Greenworks, talk to me like&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Greenworks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, talk to me about that. What of work are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Tender loving care for plants and people. So Greenworks is a fun story, I was up in Sacramento in December looking after a family member who had some medical work done. And while I was just trying to calm my nerves, I started flipping through a shelf full of books and posting on my Instagram. And when I found cool typefaces, just mindless research type of thing you do when you&#8217;re twitchy about something.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And a buddy of mine, Mohammed Sillerman in New York saw one of them and it was this old &#8217;70s plant care book called Greenworks. And it had that one of those classic &#8217;70s wobbly font types, you can sort of picture it in your head. And the tagline was tender loving care for plants. And he joked and he said, &#8220;That would make a great T-shirt.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And I said, &#8220;Oh yeah, tender loving care for plants and people, why don&#8217;t we do it?&#8221; And so we dove immediately into the print on demand T-shirt economy. And the more we kept trying to type set the words, tender loving care for plants and people on a Gildan T-shirt the more and more it felt like we were just really fucking up. It was just this fundamental disconnect between what we were saying and how we were doing it, because look like Gildans and the cotton T-shirt economy in general is not a fantastic one.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And we wanted to do more than just add another T-shirt to the world, right? Like in what way were we improving on not doing anything? And so we stepped back and my buddy Mo realized that he had a friend Anj in Seattle who had worked with all kinds of different manufacturing and was currently working in the legal cannabis industry there. And that we ought to reach out to her about how to take this T-shirt thing on.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And so there was a particular design detail that we wanted to do, and we were having a hard time conceptualizing it. And so we reached out to Anj, and Anj not only had already solved for that design detail but immediately picked up on the problems that we were having with the quick turnaround print on demand object universe. And said, &#8220;We&#8217;re at a point now where we cannot do this.&#8221; And we all said, &#8220;Yeah, why don&#8217;t we not do that?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And so Greenworks now is a research company more than anything else. And what we&#8217;re trying to do is provide as holistically as possible solutions to problems that we encounter as designers. So with T-shirts, for instance, rather than running immediately to a 100% cotton blank that you don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;s produced, but you probably can guess, we&#8217;re searching out looking for and working with people who grow hemp and use recycled cotton, and who are looking at the water impact and waste diversion from what they do.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
So rather than simply treating the T-shirt and the thing that goes on it as the design problem, we&#8217;re looking at as much as we can, the whole thing from stem to stern. So we&#8217;re in the process right now of developing a line of houseware solutions since we&#8217;ve all been inside this year and nobody needs really another T-shirt, but everybody could use a new pot for some plants or a blanket for their couch or an ashtray to burn some incense in, or a nice water bottle. And there are ways to produce those that are in keeping with our ethos.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. When I looked at it initially, and this I don&#8217;t know if this was an intentional comparison in general, but when I thought of it and looked at it, it sort of reminded me of what Seth Rogen is doing with houseplants with his brand.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
There&#8217;s definitely I think some similarity there, I would admit that we are perhaps similarly aligned about various kinds of houseplants if you will. But what I will say is that rather than approaching things from a hype beast standpoint, we&#8217;re really interested in products as the result of design solutions rather than products as ends in and of themselves, if that makes sense, we were just having a conversation about this yesterday.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
One of the things that we&#8217;re really interested in doing as we produce objects is being really transparent about processes because what we&#8217;re interested in is tender loving care for plants and people, and that extends to the people that are making the objects that we&#8217;re designing.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And I think that&#8217;s a new, maybe not a new challenge for designers, because if you go back through industrial design history, there&#8217;s certainly that awareness of it. But when we think about the holy grail for us as graphic designers is passive income. You make T-shirts, skateboard deck, coffee mugs, that kind of stuff. And people buy it because they liked the design of it and you don&#8217;t have to worry about it anymore.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
But that stuff isn&#8217;t without its own cost and it isn&#8217;t without its own ethical problems. And the challenge I think for us as designers now is to look at not just the object, but the process as the design challenge. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I feel like that&#8217;s an ethos that has started, I think, in some aspect to creep up now because the pandemic because one thing certainly that this period has done is that it&#8217;s really exposed supply chains and how fragile they are.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so when it comes down to people trying to create new sorts of products or things like this, hopefully they&#8217;re looking at more ethical ways to do it ways that won&#8217;t be a big tax on other resources and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And selfishly ways that won&#8217;t get stuck in the Suez Canal for a month, like there&#8217;s also just the fundamental functional problems of hyper globalized manufacturing in that, your stuff is literally on the other side of the planet until it&#8217;s not. And I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m a designer I&#8217;m picky, that seems like a really bad way to have as much control as possible over what I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s the designer way, isn&#8217;t it? To nitpick over the details and to really create something that is, I think more towards art, particularly with physical works. I&#8217;ve had so many designers over the years where yes, they may be digital designers by profession, but in their spare time they&#8217;re doing pottery or woodworking or something, they&#8217;re making something tangible and they&#8217;re doing it with the amount of care and precision and such that they probably would with a digital design.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Oh yeah. Oh, well, I mean, I think once you look at the world that way, it&#8217;s hard not to do that in every part of your life. I bet you are very, very intent on how your onions get chopped, even if you&#8217;ve never worked in the kitchen before, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s I think partially how I was raised both my parents are landscape architects and I grew up around them and not only in their professional peers. And so I&#8217;ve long believed that every moment is an opportunity to bring a design sensibility to things which to paraphrase Minari, I think is just a planner with an aesthetic sense. So if you&#8217;ve got a plan and a sense of taste then you&#8217;re halfway to a design. And even if that&#8217;s just chopping onions.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny you mentioned that about onions. I remember reading something, this was years ago, about how an onion will actually taste differently depending on how you cut it.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
That&#8217;s exactly the point. Yes, that&#8217;s exactly it, right? Like sometimes you want the long slice, sometimes you want the diced onion. Sometimes you want to put it in before the garlic, sometimes you want to put it in after, sometimes you don&#8217;t want to put them in together at all.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, good point. Yeah. You&#8217;re also on the committee for a collective that&#8217;s called Design To Divest. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Design To Divest. I am just so full of love for these folks. So Design To Divest started in the context of the pandemic and the summer protests last year by a designer creative based out of Brooklyn named Vanessa. And they reached out to their network and extended black creative networks, initially for people to essentially for graphic designers to lend their skills to existing social justice organizations who needed design help.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And we quickly became a little bit of a running crew, speaking of assembling community online and in virtual spaces, it&#8217;s definitely sort of how that came to be. And over the course of, I guess, now the last year and a half, we&#8217;ve gone from hosting regular weekly meetings for black designers and allies to pulling back a little bit from the regular grind of the digital ecosystem and trying to be really, really intentional in the work that we&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And so we&#8217;re about to release in collaboration with San Francisco print shop a butt whole press that&#8217;s beauty, W-H-O-L-E, for those listeners with sensitive years. Our first Dezeen, our first publication that&#8217;s going to grapple with critical race theory and Afrofuturism and all kinds of things that are imminently topical right now that we&#8217;re only just fringe ideas six months ago when we started talking about this.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And broadly we are immersed in the process of trying to create something that I mentioned during our panel discussion last weekend, like a walled garden for black creators. And this is something that is not only, I think, a priority for me with Design To Divest, but is also a priority with my work with Greenworks.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
I fundamentally believe that keeping up with particularly the Instagram algorithm for creatives is an inherently toxic and losing game. And I think anything that we can do to literally just provide a space for black creatives and black creators to develop outside of that really consumptive and extractive digital space is something worth doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And with Design To Divest and you all sort of coming together and doing these things, I guess, where do you want to see this collective grow into? Are there larger things also that you&#8217;d like to accomplish?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Well, I mean, we&#8217;d like to divest from white supremacy in design in general. Yeah, that&#8217;s the large goal and design as broadly as possible and divest as largely as possible. We are I think, I&#8217;m going to say today, disgruntled optimists, as much as anything else about the possibility.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
It&#8217;s cliche for designers, like design can change the world, but the world is designed. So yeah, I mean, sort of, right? And that&#8217;s not to say that like any one poster is going to solve racism, but there is a level at which we can be looking to develop spaces, institutions, cultures that are not based on extraction from black people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m really curious about that notion that you said of divesting from white supremacy and design, because one thing that I&#8217;ve seen probably over the past two years now is just how much more political, I guess I would say black design initiatives have become, that they&#8217;ve been largely steeped in these concepts of decolonization, divesting from white supremacy, et cetera, because it makes sense like you have to sort of strip that away in order for us to really get back to what we hope is the root of what it is that we do, because it reminds me of an essay that the late Sylvia Harris had written for Stephen Heller&#8217;s at the education of a graphic designer, where she talks about how black designers have fallen into this pattern of imitation rather than innovation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And that the work tends to mimic what they might&#8217;ve been taught in schools or whatever around like the Bauhaus or like Swiss Style or something like that, and it&#8217;s less about their own kind of cultural touchpoints. And that&#8217;s not to say necessarily that that cultural touchpoint is a direct line to Africa, like a tribe or a country or anything like that, but just like where you come from. I mean, as African-Americans have a very unique culture in this country that is ripe with inspiration for so many things&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I had Brent Rollins on the show for episode 400 and I mean, just the shit that he has created out of his experience is so uniquely like African-American, but also is hip-hop and film. And I mean, the man made the logo for boys in the hood for poetic justice when he was like a teenager.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
That&#8217;s very much I think the point. When Design To Divest first came together, I remember we had a conversation, somebody on the call had lamented the fact that there wasn&#8217;t a black graphic design tradition that they could call upon in school. And I was like, &#8220;What are we talking about? What are we talking about? Absolutely not.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
When it comes to the combination of text and image in terms of its resonance in our culture, black designers are without par, but we just don&#8217;t consider that graphic because it&#8217;s not Swiss School publications, poster, nominations. I mean, has the AIGA ever recognized Pen &#038; Pencil Studios?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Then they are not talking about graphic arts in this country, because Pen &#038; Pencil Studios is a Seminole, Pen &#038; Pixels, Pen &#038; Pixel Studios is this Seminole studio when it comes to not just the African-American, but the American graphic design tradition, if we&#8217;re really getting down to brass tacks, right?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Whatever kind of design you want to focus on, but as graphic designer, there&#8217;s a huge black graphic design tradition that we don&#8217;t even think about because it&#8217;s so denigrated. And so when we talk about decolonizing and divesting, that can get really heady. But what I mean is that like, we should be in the same way that so much of the Bauhaus and Swiss School is about, so the Swiss poster thing, that&#8217;s about wheat paste posters that the Swiss put up on the street for advertisements.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
That&#8217;s what that&#8217;s about. That&#8217;s the root of the Swiss poster and all this other thing, it&#8217;s street advertisement. So if we&#8217;re in thrall to street advertisement, then let&#8217;s go find those iconic street ads for hip hop records, for clothing lines, for all of the representations of black American culture, which has been the primary driver of American culture since time immemorial.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And so when we talk about like, what does that walled garden look like? What we&#8217;re trying to do is to coalesce and to ideally produce and publish this knowledge and make it available for people. It kills me to see it&#8217;s definitely a common refrain among folks, take us off the mood boards and put us in the creative directorships.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
We are already as black people inherently creative because you have to be fly in the face of systemic oppression. And then our creativity is never what is compensated, while it is what drives all of the cultural engine. You can find discreet examples of that like the young woman who created the concept of on fleek, has the millions of dollars worth of advertising that have used that word in the last, I don&#8217;t know how many years, provided a dime to her.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s so symptomatic of the extractive nature of our social media platforms, I think in particular where so much, especially now during the pandemic of our culture is not only consumed but creative.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting. As you mentioned, kind of social media and the algorithm, like there are people now that I don&#8217;t want to say that they&#8217;ve come up, but what you&#8217;re finding now is like this new instantiation of a designer who is more curator than creator. It&#8217;s less about what they may themselves be making it more about what they can pull together from what others have made, because there&#8217;s so much noise for lack of a better term out there, that they&#8217;re the ones that can say, &#8220;Okay, here&#8217;s the good ship that you need to pay attention to.&#8221; And like, then that person ends up being like a tastemaker or something in their own right because of that.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Oh yeah. Well, and the ability to manipulate the algorithm has now been passed off for creative direction.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
True, true that.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And I think that&#8217;s okay, sure, it is creative direction, but it&#8217;s creative direction in the service of what? And so for me, the at all opportunity is trying to turn away from the algorithm as a driving factor in the work that I&#8217;m creating, is a big point for me these days.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit. I&#8217;m curious to know about the Michael Collett origin story, where did you grow up initially?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
I was born here in San Francisco, and like I mentioned before my parents are both landscape architects. And in the late &#8217;80s the Bechtle company was hiring lots of landscape architects to work on a project in Kuwait.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And so my folks being relatively young and fresh out of school-ish, first couple of jobs said, &#8220;Hey, pay looks good, live abroad for a couple of years. We&#8217;ve got this kid, they&#8217;ll pay for his English school out there. Sounds great.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And so I want to say mid-&#8217;88, we packed up here in San Francisco and flew off to Kuwait and planned on being there for, I think at least four or five years. Oh God, the timeline escapes me. But the summer of the first Gulf War, before it was the first Gulf War, we went on vacation to Cyprus to visit my godfather in Scotland and to visit some family in New York.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And when we got to New York and got settled in, in our hotel, and these were of course, the days before cell phones and people had to know where you were going and call ahead, there was a message from my aunt saying to turn on CNN and that she hoped we had packed winter clothes because Iraqi Republican Guard had not only entered Kuwait, but had set up its command center in our apartment building.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh shit, wow.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
So what was the vacation very quickly turned into, I guess, we&#8217;re coming back to the states now. And we returned to San Francisco, but from there we bounced around a bit. I mostly grew up in Davis, California, which I will mostly hold my tongue about. There&#8217;s some very nice people there and some less so people there, I&#8217;ll put it that way.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
But then I went to a few different schools, first University of California, Riverside. Then when my mother got a job at Penn State, I went to Penn State main campus, that was a bit of a culture shock. University of California at Riverside was the first minority, majority UC school. Penn State main campus was 85% white when I got there and it snowed in October.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And like I said, I&#8217;m from California and not built for that, but I met some wonderful people at Penn State in spite of it being occasionally a pleasant villi in the horror. And then came back to Sacramento, having not finished and then went moved to Philadelphia outside of which is Penn State Abington in order to finish my education there.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
That was sort of a choose your own adventure degree, I had originally started studying political science and bounced around and did a bunch of stuff. As the child of designers, I definitely did not want to join the family business for a long time, or at least I thought I didn&#8217;t. The punchline to that story is I&#8217;m currently now enrolled in school for architecture. So obviously I did not want to do it that badly, but you know how kids are great? You know how to get [inaudible 00:34:30] against everything, I&#8217;ll go be a lawyer. And then I realized that was a horrible idea.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
So by the time I got to Penn State Abington, I definitely needed to write some very persuasive essays to convince these folks why all these disparate classes from three different schools about to do a degree, but we did that. And then I ended up back in Sacramento twiddling my thumbs. I worked a traveling salesman job for a Mormon windows heating and air conditioning company just as the economy was cratering in 2007, which was weird, definitely got chased off of some Stockton front porches by the sound of cocking shotguns, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Surprised I didn&#8217;t get turned into a hashtag, although I don&#8217;t know if they had those then. And from there, I realized that because I could passively photo edit in Photoshop and export to PDF that for boomers, I was essentially a computer Wiz and could pass myself off as a graphic designer to people who didn&#8217;t know any better. And then I quickly realized that I was in over my head and needed to go learn a bunch of stuff, which I spent the next 10 years doing, and here I am.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So one of your early design gigs was there in San Francisco. You were working for Mule Design Studio, which I think for people that are listening to this show that know about design and probably heard of Mule Design because of its proprietor, Mike Monteiro. How was that job? I&#8217;m just curious. How was it like working there?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Mule was a really, really interesting gig. Mule has since shuttered and I think both Mike and Erica are consulting and mostly doing speaking and writing gigs now. But Mule was a really educational experience for me as much in terms of design as it was in terms of how to deal with clients and I think particularly about the politics of design work.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And I say politics in a lowercase sense that I mentioned that I studied political science in school. And one of the things that early, 101 political science courses talk about is this idea that politics isn&#8217;t just party A, party B, big national election. Politics is the struggle for power in any group of people larger than one.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And when you look at it in that lens, particularly client work is a lot of political reading and handholding of the organization that you&#8217;re performing the work for. One of the things that we used to talk about at Mule that I find is such a great metric for things these days is that the main navigation bar of any organizational website will tell you so much about the politics of that organization, if you know how to look at it.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
An organization that has a very succinct and easy to understand top menu bar, top level nav particularly, is one that&#8230; I mean, might have its internal problems still, but at least has a proper delegation of powers, like a hugely overcrowded main nav is a symptom of something organizational and much larger than just the design.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And I think that&#8217;s as much, if anything, the key that I took away from Mule, is that design is a reflection of the organizational priorities and politics of whoever it is in question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting. Now, I&#8217;m thinking back at the last two places that I worked before my current gig and how design was&#8230; It was a reflection of internal politics, like the first company I remember starting at it, started out as&#8230; or at least when I started there, it was just sort of small, stable, fairly well-known software company. And their design was pretty basic, off stare, nothing that&#8217;s like winning awards, nothing mind-blowing, but they were also very well-funded and stable and all their employees loved it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then we switched to becoming the startup overnight and the branding was so&#8230; I use chaotic in a good way, but the design was like, oh my God, I&#8217;m really trying to accurately pinpoint how weird this was. There was like late &#8217;90s, early 2000s like Murakami anime style, where it was certainly trying to like push a boundary.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And this is a tech company, like trying to push a boundary, but then it&#8217;s also like bordering on juvenile because I mean, honestly we were a young company, we had went from being this old company to a startup overnight. And that really reflected as the company went on, the people that attracted, the way that we sort of did business, unfortunately the internal politics as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then the second place I worked at was this very stoic Eastern European tech startup, and the design very much reflected that it was just black. I started, they had a logo and they had black and two shades of gray, and that was the brand. And that very much reflects the monoculture of the company like, &#8220;Oh, okay. Yeah. Wow. That&#8217;s a really good perception there.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Yeah, that I think was one of my big takeaways from Mule. The other one, and this was, I think, credit to Mike Monteiro where it&#8217;s due, was that it&#8217;s just websites. I think a lot of our industry, a lot of our profession is beset with a really inordinate amount of stress and anxiety and pressure.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Some of which are self-generated, some of which is client-generated, some of which is generated by the fact that we live under capitalism. But at the end of the day, like it&#8217;s just websites, like everybody needs to take a deep breath.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m glad that I&#8217;ve been able to keep in perspective throughout my career because I started designing websites. God, this is date&#8230; I started designing websites in 1997.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Hey.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, this is basic SHTML geo cities, Athens Roads 1130. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
I thought those sites could still run, I bet [crosstalk 00:41:17] probably.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, they definitely could still run. Absolutely. I&#8217;m pretty sure if there&#8217;s a geo cities archive somewhere in my old website with my full address and phone number at the time.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Oh God.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s probably still on the web somewhere.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Oh yeah, but the privacy fails, we all committed in those days.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh my God. And I remember when my mom found out about it and I mean, she chewed me out, like, &#8220;Why are you putting that? Why are you putting that address on the internet?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Nobody&#8217;s going to find it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Strangers on the internet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8220;Nobody&#8217;s going to find it,&#8221; like come on. Like, yeah, there&#8217;s going to be some hacker in Stockton, California that&#8217;s like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t wait to get to sell my Alabama and find&#8230;&#8221; That&#8217;s not going to happen. But I say that to say, like having been on the web, building things on the web for such a long time, all of this shit is so ephemeral and like, it&#8217;s going to get redesigned and over it, which is why I never really sweat or stress web design in general. Like some people really like live this shit like Moses came down from the mountain with two tablets. And I understand-</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
[crosstalk 00:42:20] fake my eyes, I just don&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right, and I understand that, but it&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Dude, in 10 years, all of this is going to be like sitting on a hard drive somewhere. None of this is going to matter.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Not only that like, I hate to break it to web designers, but your cookie acceptance banner takes up half the goddamn page to begin with, so I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re looking at to start with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The speed at which that has taken over every website in the past two years.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
GDPR killed mobile web design and I love it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, you go to a website and there&#8217;s like three success of pop-ups, there&#8217;s a full-page modal to subscribe to their newsletter with some snarky dark pattern. No, I don&#8217;t want to save 20%, and then you&#8217;ve got the cookie banner and then something else pops up. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I just wanted to read this news article. Oh, wait, it&#8217;s behind the paywall, damn.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Oh, reader mode. There we go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh man.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
But I&#8217;ll just go find the tweet and read it on reader mode because you&#8217;re not getting my eyeballs for this, but I mean, this is where we&#8217;ve arrived. This is the world we&#8217;ve designed ourselves into, or that has been designed around us, because I mean, I&#8217;m not responsible for the GDPR modals, but it does, I think come back to again that pressure that we have, not pressure necessarily but the potential that exists for us as designers to unfuck some of this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Hopefully, I mean, I don&#8217;t know what can be done about Shell oil or whomever, but at wherever we can there&#8217;s that potential to sort of rest things towards not sucking.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny. You mentioned that about Shell. We&#8217;re thinking, God, it might&#8217;ve been earlier this year where Exxon&#8217;s shareholders have to come to them and say, &#8220;Look, you all have to do something else besides oil.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
I mean, dissolve, like what else does Exxon do besides oil? I don&#8217;t know, I feel like that&#8217;s like walking up to the Fox and being like, you&#8217;ve got to eat something other than chicken I mean-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Diversify.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
&#8230; not Wu-Tang Financial like it&#8217;s Exxon. And if anything they should be held liable for crimes against humanity and dissolved, but like, what are we talking about? Shareholders aren&#8217;t going to vote for that, but I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ve got some crack in diversity initiatives going right now.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a bag for somebody waiting at BP to stand there and be the blackface of their diversity equity and inclusion extraction initiative.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah. The higher, most likely. And I hate to say this, but it&#8217;s only because I&#8217;ve seen it as a pattern, but they&#8217;ll hire a black woman to do it.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Oh, I know. I know. And run her out like Google did to&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tim Nutt?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Oh, I was just, I mean, it&#8217;s a shameful practice that particularly, I think a lot of the techies are very guilty of. We had brought up previously an article I had written a while ago, but there&#8217;s another one I had written this also a while ago now. But I think when I was at Mule, because we had a day in the office laughing about Google, having spent a quarter of a billion dollars trying to solve their diversity problem over the previous five years, and somehow not having solved it. And my immediate question was, &#8220;Well, have they tried hiring black people?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And apparently seemed that nobody who took their $250 million suggested that to them, but then they do that and then they do how they do. So it&#8217;s sort of a damned if you do damned if you don&#8217;t, but&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve always been wary of. And I&#8217;ve taken, I mean, in like speaking of where are the black designers, because we talked about that earlier. When I did that presentation initially in 2015 and I gave a very reluctant updates to that presentation in 2020.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I say that because when I gave it, and I mentioned this in my keynote, but for people who didn&#8217;t hear the keynote, I got so much shit for that presentation after I gave it that it pretty much tanked my studio. I had to go out and get a job because like all my business stuff had dried up just because I said.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The answer to that question of where the black designers should not come from black designers, it has to be from a coalition of people from organizations and businesses and schools. And quite frankly, black designers create the problem, so stop asking us, and so&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
That&#8217;s not an answer people want to hear.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, but like I say, I reluctantly gave an update because I let it, I recorded it, I put it up on YouTube, and it&#8217;s been up there since like March of 2015 with like no comments or anything. It wasn&#8217;t until last year, like in the wake of people getting on the streets and protesting and companies saying, &#8220;Well, we want to uplift black voices and share black voices and such that people found the presentation were willing to give me money for,&#8221; and shout out to reparations.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And we&#8217;re talking about it now in this new light to this honestly now newly perceptive design community that was willing to hear it and was like, &#8220;Oh, this is actually good advice. Why didn&#8217;t anyone take this advice five years ago?&#8221; I mean, who knows? But I gave that reluctant update.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Obama had been president, what more do you want?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And listen. But I gave them a reluctant update to it because one, I was like, I really don&#8217;t have anything else to contribute to the conversation, first of all. And secondly, not much has changed. Now, I think some certain statistics around it have changed, like when I talked about the percentage of black students at schools, but I also spliced in economic data.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Look, white households in this country have like 10X to 13X the net worth of black households.&#8221; And so if you&#8217;re looking to these high tuition schools to try to find black designers, it&#8217;s going to be hard to find when black families largely can&#8217;t afford them. But also saying that companies need to stop building pipelines, because when I hear a pipeline, I think of something that strips resources out of a place and transfers it to another place.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And there&#8217;s always a talk about all the pipeline, there&#8217;s a pipeline problem. It&#8217;s not a pipeline problem, there&#8217;s a relationship problem because what&#8217;s happening is these companies are looking at HBCUs and black design groups and such as like this fertile soil that they can keep harvesting from, but not planting seeds. And it&#8217;s like you keep&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Mentality is totally extractive, it&#8217;s totally extractive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s totally extractive. I&#8217;m like, if you&#8217;re not also helping buy, like for a school, for example, maybe offer to embed an employee there as a teacher or help to get their curriculum up to the point where harvesting has&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say harvesting, Jesus Christ, but like pulling students from those schools makes more economic sense in terms of getting them up to speed with what&#8217;s in the market and all that sort of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then I said, &#8220;Look, I&#8217;m not giving another update to this presentation, like this is it. This is it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Well, and the truth is, is I don&#8217;t need another pipeline, there&#8217;s a gentleman on the steering committee with us at Design To Divest, Aziz Ali. And he has a great quote he says, &#8220;Black people are over mentored and under resourced.&#8221; And I really love that as&#8230; It&#8217;s one of our organizing principles at Design To Divest, we know what we&#8217;re doing, just get off the money. At a certain point, pipelines and internship&#8230; No, just stop.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Pay your taxes, pay your ties if you&#8217;re a credulous person, but just get up off the money, because that&#8217;s what it is. And whether it&#8217;s a pipeline, or some other kind of extractive relationship with black communities, it&#8217;s not the way forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ve just come up off the money, write the check, or as a Tiffani Ashley Bell put it, I think she said, &#8220;Send the wire, make the hire,&#8221; or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Exactly. That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m probably butchering that quote, but it&#8217;s something to that effect, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Send the tracking number and we can get on the flight, shout out to Larry June speaking in San Francisco. At a certain point, like there&#8217;s black squares and, oh, look at, we were so sad about the way we treated all those folks in the past.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Well, have you paid them out? Are you paying us out now? Like what are we talking about? For stringently, capitalist and profit focused culture that we live in, all of a sudden everybody&#8217;s real touchy feely, talking about platitudes and emotions and shit, when all of a sudden it was the quarterly report and making sure those metrics worked.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
I certainly don&#8217;t want to hear about emotions from tech companies whose whole thing is that we make data-driven decisions. Well, your bank account is data, drive it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Just go ahead and make that detour.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Seek that exit, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
I mean, it&#8217;s not even a detour, because like speaking of San Francisco and particularly the way that companies behave extractively, we&#8217;re not just when we talk about the algorithm on Twitter on Instagram, and we&#8217;re not just talking about that in terms of extraction, but these are companies that have fermented and precipitated huge amounts of displacement in San Francisco who have gotten sweetheart deals from local politicians going back multiple administrations now who have never paid their fair tax share who in the state of California for companies like DoorDash and Uber, have been instrumental in demolishing worker protections in labor law just to pad their own bottom line.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
So when we talk about extractive stuff and especially where design is concerned, that really covers the whole industry in a lot of ways.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One thing that you mentioned, wanting to talk about, and I think it&#8217;s probably tangential to what we&#8217;re discussing now is about class awareness and politics among the black creative class. So I want to open up the floor so we can talk about that, and so you can go more in depth with that topic.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Well, I mean, I think a lot of it ties into some of what we were talking about on the panel discussion. When we talk about particularly like, are black people capable of appropriating from other black people? Are black people capable of being gentrifiers? Are black people capable of behaving in these extractive ways?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And the example that we brought up on the panel was the Michael B. Jordan now untitled again Rum brand that had run a foul of people who are deeply invested in the history and traditions of carnival. But there&#8217;s any number of examples with that, I know for black southerners and for people who are invested in the south.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
The attention that Tulsa has been getting, for instance, there&#8217;s been a lot of discussion around who&#8217;s right it is to tell this story who benefits from the telling of it. And these are questions that involve the black creative class. If we&#8217;re in the business of telling stories like that&#8217;s who we&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Listen, listen. I&#8217;m from Selma, Alabama. So let me tell you about how black people can gentrify other black people.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay? When Selma, the movie happened-</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; Selma, the city did not have a movie theater. I didn&#8217;t grow up with a movie theater. My first movie theater I went to I was 17, 18 when I first moved to Atlanta. But I say this to say like Selma&#8230; And I&#8217;ll let you get back to what you were saying, but when you said that, that&#8217;s really stuck out to me like, I just remember during that time and my mom telling me about how so many celebrities are coming through the city.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
To me I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Okay, well what&#8217;s going to happen when they leave? Are they putting resources and things back into the city?&#8221; Because I know when I go home, downtown is boarded up. Selma is still like one of the most violent cities in Alabama, probably the number one most violent city in the state. There&#8217;s parts surrounding Atlanta. I&#8217;m not Atlanta, oh shit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s parts surrounding Selma that the World Health Organization has classified as bad as third world countries, like you want to talk about how black people can gentrify and take from other black people. Why is Selma always a political stop? Obama and them come through and march across the bridge and then what?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And drive right out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right out.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sorry. Sorry.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
No, no, no. That&#8217;s exactly my point, right? Is that as designers, as people who deal in symbols, we need to be critical about how symbols are used. And that&#8217;s something I think that is often missing from, and the class awareness of that, because like not only is Selma this major political stop, but it remains a bastion of entrenched generational poverty there.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And the way that the black political class, the black celebrity and entertainment class, but also the black intelligentsia and the academic class and those of us, myself included, in the creative class treat not just Selma but other places and parts and people in our culture as symbols to be pointed at, as opposed to people to interact with.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And I think that&#8217;s something that is often that I find, I&#8217;ll try to be as sort of politic as possible, but that I find is often missing in some of these larger conversations. And when we talk about extractive, we were joking about the diversity and equity and inclusion at Exxon, but I don&#8217;t know how much of a difference I draw between Exxon and Uber in that regard.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know how much of a difference I draw between Exxon and Facebook in that regard. And it&#8217;s one thing to go get a bag and I&#8217;m not trying to call anybody out for that, but I do think that in getting a bag, we have to make sure that we&#8217;re not continuing to enable things that are detrimental, not only to communities that were part of the larger ones.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So back in 2014 you wrote this piece called &#8220;Now is the time for a Black graphic design&#8221;, and there&#8217;s a line at the end, I&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes so people can check it out. But there&#8217;s a line at the end where you say, &#8220;A black data processing associates have organized to support one another.&#8221; Why can&#8217;t we? Or maybe the better question is who&#8217;s going to stop us? Do you still feel that way?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
I mean, honestly, yes, now more than ever, I want all working people to organize whether we are white collar workers, blue collar workers, black collar and service workers. As working people, we have much more in common with one another than we do with our bosses. As black creative workers, I think it is incredibly important on us and imperative for us to organize in some way or another. I am blown away, speaking of black creative talent by the TikTok strike.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Just got out the TikTok strike because I am too old to have it on my phone, but I see it come through my social feeds. And I know that they got those white dance thieves heartened right now, because they are not putting it together for it. And I think that is maybe it&#8217;s for jokes, but I think it&#8217;s really serious. And that is very much what I&#8217;m talking about by when I say, resisting the algorithm, the commodification and the extraction of our culture, because TikTok has turned some of these offbeat as white kids into millionaires.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
When the people whose dances they&#8217;re stealing are still working with cracked phones. And it&#8217;s like, I think now the hidden upside, if you will, of our digital era is that so much of what&#8217;s already been going on for generations is now not only visible but hyper compressed.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
It took 20 years for Elvis to get famous from stealing from black artists. But now these kids are doing it so fast that you can still see the people they&#8217;re stealing from, and I think there&#8217;s something to that. So yeah, I absolutely believe that black creative workers of all kinds need to organize and need to unite because we are, and continue to be the driving cultural force in this country and massively, massively under compensated for it.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s whether you&#8217;re talking about music and dance, entertainment, production, but also graphic design and the way that design influences popular culture.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are you obsessed with right now?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
I mean, a lot of things. The thing that I&#8217;ve been getting really into at the moment is, is something that we&#8217;ve been working on for Greenworks which is 3D printing with ceramic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, interesting.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m fascinated by a lot of the potential for new materials production and new ways of doing micro industrial production, and thinking about how to rest the utility of a lot of the new manufacturing and production methods back towards more artisanal or like small run kind of production things. But I mean, I&#8217;m obsessed with lots of stuff, man, how much time we got?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We got time.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
The other thing that I&#8217;m endlessly passionate about is the history of the city of San Francisco. It&#8217;s partially just being a unrepentant homer, but in a lot of ways I&#8217;ve always felt that San Francisco can be a bit of a bellwether for the nation, particularly both politically and economically.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
This has always been a bit of a neoliberal hellscape from the gold rush onward, of course. And if you learn to read the history of it, as much as I suppose the history of any place, it becomes very clear why what&#8217;s happening now is what&#8217;s happening. And I think especially as a designer, as somebody who&#8217;s admittedly very online knowing the&#8230; And it&#8217;s also, like I said, it&#8217;s my hometown. So knowing the nooks and crannies and the how we got here is very important to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you feel satisfied creatively at this stage in your career?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
No, never.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Why is that?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Well, I mean, there&#8217;s projects that I haven&#8217;t even finished coming up with the ideas for yet. I may have mentioned it offhandedly, but I&#8217;m also currently beginning to go back to school now for a license for architecture. The built environment, of course, having landscape architects for parents has always fascinated me. And the license to change the built environment, which is what an architectural license is, feels like a real sort of Mario Star for designers, right? Like oh, you can make a website, you can make a chair, but this is the thing that sets off the theme music and lets you do literally whatever.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
So no, I&#8217;m nowhere near creatively satisfied because I feel like there&#8217;s just all kinds of things I could be sinking my teeth into. At 35, I finally feel like I&#8217;ve got my feet under me. A decade in the industry has shown me a lot and shown me as much of what I don&#8217;t want to do as what I do, but the things that are possible.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And I think especially now like what the possibilities between&#8230; The one thing about Greenworks that bears mentioning is that we&#8217;re all on separate coasts basically, Anj it is in Seattle, Mohammed&#8217;s in New York and I&#8217;m in San Francisco, and we&#8217;ve created a company and got up and running without ever all being in the room at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Which I guess in the context of the pandemic is a little less remarkable, but to me that&#8217;s still kind of wild that you can do something like that. And I&#8217;m really excited to explore the potentials that as much as I was poo-pooing global supply chains, the potentials of global networks of communication and idea exchange to me are just incredibly exciting when it comes to creative work.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And then potentially the idea of like I was talking about with 3D printing, being able to empower people to create things for themselves to take part in what had previously been seen as sort of enormous isolated industrial processes at a real personal level.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you think back over your career and where you&#8217;ve worked, the type of work that you&#8217;ve done, et cetera, people you&#8217;ve met, what advice has really stuck with you over the years?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Oddly enough, I would probably have to give another shout out to Mule here, particularly Erica Hall, who is one of the partners there. And Erica was the one who was broadly engaged in a lot of the really naughty kind of personal one to one facilitation that enabled the graphic design work to run as smoothly as it did.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And she would occasionally come back from a tough session and flopped down on the couch in the office and let out a sigh and say, &#8220;Humans are fascinating.&#8221; I think that phrase and just that sense of not necessarily like emotionless detachment, but a professional detachment from our work that as engrossing and as occasionally anxiety inducing as it can be that it&#8217;s just websites, and people are fascinating.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And we&#8217;re very, very lucky to be able to do the work that we do in a lot of ways. And if we can keep that in mind, even in the roughest moments, there&#8217;s still something to be gained out of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you see yourself doing? You&#8217;ll be 40 at that point?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Yeah, I suppose I will.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What kind of work do you&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Thanks for reminding me that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hey, look, I just turned 40 this year, so I&#8217;m well aware of the change.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Right. [crosstalk 01:06:16].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you see yourself? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Having undertaken now via, and now set it on a podcast. So I&#8217;m really fucking responsible for it. The effort to return to school for an architecture license, I would love to be working in the field in five years in some capacity or another I&#8217;m not really&#8230; I mean, between my politics and everything else, not super interested in going to work for the big firms.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
I think again, the attraction is being able to alter the built environment in small and measurable ways myself. I&#8217;ve got some dear friends that go way back with who are in the construction business. And so pie in the sky, just a small little design build firm to take on particularly affordable housing, adaptive reuse. Like I said, both the city of San Francisco and the idea of being able to work on the built environment are both very important for me.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And so I think there&#8217;s ways to alter that and to encourage that change that ideally are possible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
The best place to start is probably the Instagram account at greenworks.earth, because all of the stuff that I&#8217;ve been talking about throughout this podcast will be slowly starting to dribble out there over the next few months.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
I&#8217;m on Twitter at either __mclc or mclc__, I can never remember which. And hell, I guess I said my email at the beginning of people do want to get in touch on workingmichael@gmail.com. I don&#8217;t keep much of a web presence as is in keeping with a lot of the things that I&#8217;ve spoken with you about here today. But I do maintain a small portfolio of some work at HTTP://whatifitoldyouihadnoweb.site.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I like that. I&#8217;ve been there and it&#8217;s like a little, it&#8217;s a presentation, it&#8217;s pretty dope actually.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you. It is, as the presentation that is linked there says, now is not the time for portfolio sites. Now is the time for a black graphic design as it was in 2014, it&#8217;s still the time for black graphic design. And that&#8217;s I think what I&#8217;m focused on as much as anything else.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And also find Design To Divest @designtodivest on Instagram, which is probably the easiest place to get on our website. We&#8217;re also on a wonderful platform and I&#8217;d like to shout them out, the folks at Are.na. A-R-E dot N-A. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re familiar with them, Maurice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve heard of them.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m on Are.na, just regular old MCLC, that&#8217;s probably the easiest place to find out what&#8217;s going on in my brain these days because it&#8217;s where I collect a lot of my shots.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Michael Collett, man, this conversation I feel like has been a long time coming, but I just want to thank you so much for coming on the show, so much for sharing your wisdom, your perspective. I mean, I knew when I first encountered you years and years ago, I was like, I feel like you&#8217;ve got something to say, and I don&#8217;t know if there was maybe a reluctance to talk about it, but just to see how much you have been doing over the past few years and even, like I said, hearing you&#8217;re at the most recent where the black designers conference like I want to hear so much more from you, just like your work and your words and everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so I hope that this interview in some way can be a catalyst for that. But yeah, thank you for coming on the show.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Maurice, thank you. Absolutely. I really, really appreciate it. I think what I will say is that, I probably was trying to, I mean, this may be easy to exchange opinions over a Skype call, but in the same way that where the black designers may have thrown you for a loop, I haven&#8217;t won a lot of friends with a lot of my takes when it comes to design and politics in my career.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
And so I think maybe all those years ago, I was probably still trying to play it safe, but at this point they haven&#8217;t killed me yet. So I might as well just keep going.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, that&#8217;s a morbid way to put it, but I totally agree with what you&#8217;re saying. If there&#8217;s ever a time now to get it out, this is it.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Yeah. No, this is the time to be living as authentically as we can.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Absolutely. Again, thank you so much for coming on the show, man. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Michael Collett:</b><br>
Thank you, Maurice.</p>

<p>Design can change your life in unexpected ways, and Kevin Bethune is a testament to that. He is the founder and chief creative officer of <a href="https://www.dreamsdesignandlife.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">dreams ‚Ä¢ design + life</a>, a think tank that delivers design and innovation services using a human-centered approach. (It sounds lofty, but with over 20 years of experience in mechanical engineering, product creation, strategy, and industrial design, Kevin is a true master of his craft.)</p>
<p>We started off talking about how business has shifted over the past year as he&#8217;s transitioned further into the entrepreneurial life, and he shared a bit about his process when diving into new projects. Kevin also talked about his prior stints at Westinghouse and Nike, and how those experiences informed his later work for some of the nation&#8217;s top consulting firms. Design has truly helped transform Kevin&#8217;s life, and it can do the same for you too!</p>

<p>This week on Revision Path, I&#8217;m sharing my conversation with visual storyteller Fred Noland. You might have seen <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/fred-noland" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">his recent illustration work in <em>The New Yorker</em></a>, but he&#8217;s been featured in newspapers, magazines and museums throughout his extensive career.</p>
<p>We talked about navigating work and creativity during this pandemic, and he spoke on an ongoing project of his ‚Äî a graphic novel about professional cyclist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Taylor" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Major Taylor</a>. We also discussed representation in comics, his artistic influences, and his podcast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOxEVwG64aCeRvY7O97iowu7ZVPK2K08Y" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Serious Moonlighting</a>. Fred&#8217;s voice and his work are an important addition to the world of visual storytelling, and I hope we&#8217;ll see and hear more from him in the future!</p>

<p>The great thing about talking with so many people for Revision Path is discovering just how many things we share in common with our fellow brothers and sisters. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m so glad for folks like William Hill who are out here embodying what it means to work with purpose.</p>
<p>We started off talking about how we&#8217;re both coping at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, and William went in depth about his new role at New Relic, as well as his former role as a software engineer and team lead at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. William also shared his story of growing up in a small southern town, and talked about how he defines success at this stage of his life and career. Give this week&#8217;s episode a listen for a healthy dose of inspiration!</p>
