Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>We&#8217;re wrapping up our interviews in The Windy City this month with Chris Rudd, founder of social and civic impact design firm <a href="https://www.chibydesign.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ChiByDesign</a>. Chris&#8217; work is grounded in anti-racism, and that&#8217;s reflected not just in the clients ChiByDesign serves, but also by him building a collaborative and dynamic space for designers of color to thrive and do work that improves communities.</p>
<p>Chris and I talked shop for a while about entrepreneurship, and then he told me the story of how he started his firm in 2018. Chris also spoke about growing up in Chicago, studying at Stanford and becoming a Civic Innovation Fellow, and shared the one thing he still wants to accomplish in his career. I hope that Chris&#8217; story gives you the confidence to be yourselves and push for the world you want!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Chris Rudd, founder and CEO of ChiByDesign, and my role is to give leadership to the organization as we practice our anti-racist design and systems and social service work around the country.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s 2022 been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been good. It&#8217;s been busy. I think because our work is again, centered on anti-racism and designing anti-racist outcomes. After the racial awakening of 2020, lots of organizations and institutions are trying to figure out, A, how are they perpetuating systemic racism, and then B, figuring out pathways to stop and from our perspective, hopefully to heal the communities and folks that they&#8217;ve harmed over the past. So yeah, it&#8217;s been a lot. Great work, but also heavy work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I can imagine. So I would guess you probably got an influx of work during that summer of 2020. I think there&#8217;s a lot of people I spoke to on the show where during that summer or right after that summer, they just kept getting hit up with requests to speak or to consult or to work or anything like that. Did you kind of have that same swell of interest during that time?</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Yeah, a lot of speaking. I think during that time particularly, people were really trying to wrap their heads around what it was, and so there was a lot of, can we just talk to you? We want to hear what you&#8217;re thinking about this. Then the work started to pick up, but we actually developed a rubric for our firm on what we would do and what we wouldn&#8217;t do. So we really started to vet the organizations that wanted to work with us to see if they were actually about the change that they say they were, or if it was just we want to put a black face to the work to somehow validate the efforts, even if they knew it was going to fall short. And even if they didn&#8217;t know, we would work with them to say, &#8220;Hey, here&#8217;s where we see your shortcomings.&#8221; And da da da. And if they were willing to understand and accept that, then we could move forward. If they weren&#8217;t, then we were happy to walk away.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s good. I mean, because I can imagine people probably came all out of the woodwork that found your firm and was like, wait a minute, that&#8217;s a black guy. Let&#8217;s talk to him. Let&#8217;s see if we can help him.</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
I know. And then really they thought they knew that was a lot of all we got to do is just it will come out in this way. All we have to do is just make this one simple change and boom, racism&#8217;s gone, or we will function differently. And the hard part for us is helping them understand that changing an organization, changing a system, an institution is a huge shift or requires large scale shifts from top to bottom, not just in terms of personnel, but also in terms of philosophy, practices, policies, all these organizational structure. And so that was a hard thing for folks to deal with. Cause you&#8217;ve been doing this thing for so long and from your perspective, you&#8217;ve been doing a great job. Profit margins may be through the roof or you&#8217;ve put out a couple surveys of rate us, and for the most part, you send them to people that like you and you&#8217;re like, yep, those are great. And then the negative ones that come back, you&#8217;re like, ah, they don&#8217;t really get it. So yeah, it&#8217;s been an interesting journey.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s kind of dive in more and talk about your firm ChiByDesign. Which you describe as a collaborative and cultivating space for designers of color that already just, that hit me a ton of bricks there. Tell me more about ChiByDesign.</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Sure. That piece is huge for us. When I started the firm in 2018, I started out of anger, to be honest, honest, I was back home in Chicago and the philanthropic social sector was really starting to embrace design thinking at that time. And at that time I was like, &#8220;Ooh, design thinking is the bees knees. Here we go. We can use this methodology to change the world.&#8221; And so I would see these projects popping up around issues and health and safety and they&#8217;re always in Chicago is very, very segregated. People don&#8217;t know. It is probably, we battle Milwaukee for the top spot of most segregated cities in America every year. And it&#8217;s really hard for people who are not from here to understand what that physically looks like. And so for example, you can cross a street and the color of the people will immediately change.</p>
<p>So you&#8217;ll be on one intersection and on one side it will be almost strictly black folks. And then on the other side it will be strictly brown folks. The contrast is so stark here in many, many communities, and because of that, issues are very contained and acute in particular areas. So health disparities that affect black folks more heart disease, hypertension, blah blah, blah. Those are very concentrated in Chicago. And so there was these design projects, how might we improve heart health for black males? And it was like, oh, that&#8217;s great. I&#8217;m glad you all are thinking about that. And then I would look at the design firms that were the lead on the projects and it would be six white dudes and one Asian woman. And I just knew, I was like, there&#8217;s no way they&#8217;re going to get this right. And so at that time there was also this, where are the designers of color, we can&#8217;t find black people, da da, da.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re trying and they&#8217;re just not there. And so I just said, &#8220;All right, cool. I&#8217;ll start something and we&#8217;ll do that. We&#8217;ll bring them here.&#8221; And to do that means you can&#8217;t create the cultures that many design firms have because they are monochromatic. And so I wanted ChiByDesign to really be a place for black and brown designers to come be excellent, be great as we are, and not try to fit into some mold that is not natural to us and still be excellent. The notion that if we&#8217;re going to be us, that somehow it&#8217;s less than the notion of excellence that&#8217;s been perpetuated in our society. And so ChiByDesign is all about having a home for designers of color specifically, but for everyone generally. So one of the founding principles was that 75% of the people I work with at all times would be folks of color and 50% would be women based on the notion that you can&#8217;t design the future if you don&#8217;t have all those inputs.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m looking at the website and everything right now. I like that you have anti-racist design as of a core principle of everything that you&#8217;re doing because I know just from doing revision path, what will happen is sometimes people will look at what you&#8217;re doing and instead of seeing the positive way you&#8217;ve designed it, they look at or they sort of perceive it as exclusion. I could see someone looking at ChiByDesign and thinking, well, isn&#8217;t that discriminatory that you&#8217;re only going to have black and brown people and talk to WT as opposed to you doing that by design in very much the same way that maybe some other firms may have only white people by design.</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
There&#8217;s not a thing where we&#8217;re saying there won&#8217;t be white designer. So we hired a white designer last year, and so we&#8217;re totally open and willing to do that. I don&#8217;t believe that white people don&#8217;t have a place in the anti-racist fight. They absolutely do. And to your point, yeah, it&#8217;s not about exclusion. It&#8217;s saying that we have to center the most harmed in the process, whether that&#8217;s the design team and/or the folks that we&#8217;re designing with. So we also practice co-design only. We are not a human centered design, traditional human centered design firm. We do not design for anyone. Every project we do, the folks most impacted by that system, by that organization have to be a part of the process. That&#8217;s based on understanding. They know their challenges, their strengths better than any of us. This idea that designers can develop empathy through one hour conversations and therefore create the optimal experience or system or service for someone, in my opinion is a bit ludicrous.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to starting on a new project?</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Sure. So lots of prep work with the clients of what is the issue, who&#8217;s most affected by that? Who do they, really trying to figure out who they have relationships with on the ground in the community. And that can be a for-profit client or a social service client. We need to understand what is your relationship to those most affected by the thing you do. And then we set out to hire co-designers to join our team. So once we know and understand who are the people most affected, we do intense outreach to hire those folks to join our team for the duration of the project. And that&#8217;s a huge thing for us because, again, this notion of how do we create a space for black and brown designers, it&#8217;s also creating a space for this pipeline. I come to design very late in life. I was in my thirties when I really first understood what it was.</p>
<p>And so I think folks of color are some of the most creative people on the planet based on our conditions. We have to be. And again, I don&#8217;t say that as thinking that we&#8217;re a monolith, but proportionately to our socioeconomic status, we have learned and have had to be very, very creative for survival. Yet we have been excluded from the professional practice of creativity in terms of design. And so we use every project as an opportunity to introduce more and more black and brown folks to the field, to the practice and have them lead us in our design process. We have a methodology, but they have the expertise. And so the more we can give what we have to them, the better equipped they will be to lead us.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Why do you think more firms don&#8217;t do that?</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
I would assume, honestly, this was a journey for me when I first started projects and I was kind of independent consulting before I built up the team. It was scary to ask a client to pay for that. So I would hire people and pay them out of the money that I had designated for myself because I didn&#8217;t have the confidence to say, &#8220;Hey, this is so important that it should be important to you as well.&#8221;<br>
I actually participated in a class, a friend was teaching at ID Institute of Design, her name is Mo, and she teaches, I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s adaptive leadership. And I went through the process with her students and we talked about this and finally one of them said, &#8220;Just put it in the budget.&#8221; And I just said, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to make this commitment to you all that I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221; And I tried it and the client didn&#8217;t go crazy. And so from that point on, I said, this will be a standard for every project we do. This is one of our criteria for acceptance. If they&#8217;re not willing to do that, we won&#8217;t work with them. It shows a lot about their mentality if they can&#8217;t value people in the same way we feel like we&#8217;re trying to value people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Back when I had my studio and I was taking clients, I think I came to the pretty early realization that sometimes clients really just need to be told what to do. There&#8217;s the whole thing about, oh, the customer&#8217;s always right, yada, yada, yada. I get that. But if you&#8217;re coming to an expert for something that you may not have the skills in or you need the help in, I would think there has to be some level of deferment. And for you to be the experts, you have to be able to let the client know like, &#8220;Hey, this is what it is, this is what our process is. We&#8217;re not bending from that, we&#8217;re not changing that, or anything like that.&#8221; So it&#8217;s good that you&#8217;re sort of vetting clients, I think, and the way that you mentioned earlier, but then also just letting them know, this is how we work, and you can either get with it or not.</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
And exactly to your point, they are looking for that guidance. So we&#8217;re not trying to position as a, you just don&#8217;t get it and you&#8217;re stupid. We&#8217;ve done this a lot of times, we&#8217;ve been recognized for it. It works. And if you really want to achieve what you&#8217;re saying you want to achieve, trust us that this will get you there. 100% of the time. They&#8217;re super happy that they did it. Their relationship with those folks amplifies and expands in ways that they never thought. We get information and direction that we couldn&#8217;t conceive of because, again, we haven&#8217;t been in that position. So there&#8217;s so much nuance that we will always miss if they are not there. And so yeah, I think more studios should definitely try, especially if you&#8217;re in social sector work. If you&#8217;re developing products for P&#038;G, HCD will probably help you do that a hundred percent of the time and it&#8217;ll be fine. But if you were trying to redesign social services, if you&#8217;re trying to redesign society, we cannot do that in our studios away from the real world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are there any projects in particular you&#8217;ve done through the firm that you&#8217;re like especially proud of?</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Yeah, we&#8217;re currently wrapping up a project with the state of Ohio to redesign the foster care system to be anti-racist. So this was a huge, huge lift, but very excited with where we&#8217;re at. We&#8217;re in talks with counties to actually prototype. The challenge with doing anti-racist work is, especially for social systems institutions and governments, is that they are very averse to prototyping, especially when it&#8217;s about anti-racism because it&#8217;s just the political climate in our society is many of us are like, &#8220;Things are racist.&#8221; And then there&#8217;s a growing set of the population that is just like, Nope, that&#8217;s not a thing. Don&#8217;t talk about it. Don&#8217;t, da, da da. And so these government employees are navigating that, which typically we have not won that side of the argument. It&#8217;s exciting that we might be able to prototype some of these ideas with them. And I think the hypothesis is that they would drastically change and reduce disproportionality in children&#8217;s services for black, brown and mixed race folks in Ohio, which could then be a standard for children&#8217;s services around the country.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s been a big one that I&#8217;m very, very proud of. And then we did a project last year here in Chicago to co-design an equitable food system with urban growers, with educators, with nonprofits, business folks. And it was one of those projects that just taught me so much. So learning about the land, learning about growing practices, indigenous practices, going back to our roots in a lot of ways, and how food is just so vital to humanity. I mean, we all know that, right? We eat every day. We&#8217;re like, we love food. I do. But just the breadth of how food is vital to culture, society, not just from the consumption of it, but the production aspect. And so that was a really cool and exciting project as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What gets you truly excited about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Man, all of it. I&#8217;m getting excited as we&#8217;re having this conversation. My team, they&#8217;re just amazing, brilliant, awesome people to be with every day. The fact that we&#8217;re doing work that we all believe in, that&#8217;s just huge. I&#8217;ve talked to so many designers who are just like, &#8220;Ah, I&#8217;m so tired of creating new features on websites to help people pay faster for things they probably don&#8217;t need.&#8221; Or I don&#8217;t want to design another Pepsi bottle. They want their creativity, their brilliance, their skill sets to truly improve life outcomes. And so I just feel very privileged and very grateful to be able to do that. All of our intellectual capacity, all of our creative capabilities are really honed in on improving the lives of folks of color, which to your point earlier, would absolutely improve the lives of white folks too. If you lift our standards, my belief is that if you can eliminate racism, every racial group on the planet will have better outcomes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
True. Let&#8217;s kind of dive a little bit into your personal story. &#8216;Cause I&#8217;m curious to know where this strong foundation of civic duty in this way comes from. So tell me more about where you grew up. You&#8217;re from Indiana, I think you told me originally, right? But you grew up in Chicago.</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
So originally from Gary, Indiana, and then we moved to Chicago when I was like four. So I come from the Midwest&#8217;s union strong. And so my father was a steelworker. A lot of the men on my dad&#8217;s side of the family worked in the steel mills. He eventually got a job at the post office and has been there ever since. My mom was on the railroads and then really entrenched herself in community organizing in Chicago, but is also an artist. So that&#8217;s where my creative side comes from. So she was an art teacher for a while and then went back to labor organizing.</p>
<p>And so I very much grew up on picket lines and at protests my whole life. So I always remember when you came back to school in September, the teacher was, &#8220;What&#8217;d you all do this summer?&#8221; And friends of mine were like, &#8220;Oh, we went on vacation to blah, blah, blah.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yep. I was at a picket line for three weeks in Decatur, Illinois.&#8221; And those moments really shaped my perspective and my outlook and very much are with me in my design practice and in my life now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you mentioned earlier that you didn&#8217;t really get into design until you were in your 30s. When you were a kid, did you sort of have a sense of what it is that you wanted to do outside of that?</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
No clue. Zero clue. I think I was so many other people every year. It changed. Before the internet, for me at least on the south side, wasn&#8217;t a lot of options around you. Nobody in my neighborhood that I can think of even now had a professional career. We grew up in a very working class community, so people worked blue collar jobs. So that was kind of like my plan, if you call it a plan, it was finish high school, get a regular job. My parents had a couple friends that were professors, but I had no interest in going to college and especially for that long to become a professor. So my kind of goals growing up was to be a family man and get a job that&#8217;ll allow me to take my kids on vacation once in a while.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So when you started out in college, you went to City College in Chicago, Harold Washington College. Tell me about that time. What were you were studying at that time?</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
So I studied youth development, so that&#8217;s actually one of the only two programs I&#8217;ve ever focused on. So I studied youth development. &#8216;Cause at a certain point, I think I was around 24, I figured, okay, I&#8217;ll be a teacher. A lot of the women in my family were teachers and I was like, &#8220;All right, I could do that. I like young people, I want to help.&#8221; So I went to Harold Washington to try to get my gen ed out the way so I can go into a teaching program. But what that actually led me to was working in the non-profit sector. So I took these youth development classes and it totally changed my outlook. I no longer wanted to be a teacher, I wanted to be a youth worker because I felt like being a youth worker was more around building relationships. You could not demand respect from young people as opposed to being a teacher.</p>
<p>You go into a classroom, I would be Mr. Rudd, but as a youth worker, I was Chris. And so they were able to refer to me as my first name, the same way I was going to refer to them by their first names. So it was more around reciprocity rather than hierarchy. At least that&#8217;s how I felt. And so I went to the nonprofit sector, working with young people in Chicago and just really trying to help them figure out what&#8217;s their path. It was tough during that time. We had a lot of violence. So yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean Chicago definitely has that, I mean reputation, as you know, hear in the media and stuff for having a lot of violence. I think a lot of big cities have similar reputations. I mean, I&#8217;m in Atlanta in the West end, and I mean it&#8217;s southwest Atlanta. It gets its kind of bad reputation too for that sort of stuff. But I think that&#8217;s just a byproduct of living in an urban city, that will happen. For you though, I&#8217;m curious, you wanted to go into youth development. Was there something in particular that really drew you to that?</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Yeah, again, it was really around the relationship building. My early years were focused on organizing. I was an organizer in high school and I just knew that we&#8217;re going to make things better. We have to get to know each other, we have to appreciate each other, and then we have to struggle with each other to be our best selves. And that only happens as you are forming or developing relationships with one another. So this approach to working with young people, that centered relationship building really spoke to me. And so that&#8217;s where I focused my efforts. I didn&#8217;t go to school to become a teacher &#8217;cause that I felt like this path was the right way for me. And it&#8217;s funny having this conversation. So much of that is very much a part of my design approach and process.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like it definitely stems from a place of community. So you graduated from City College. What does your early post-grad career look like? What kind of work were you doing? Is this where you started with these youth groups?</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Sure. Yeah. So I was working on the west side of Chicago. There was a young man had gotten murdered at that time, Darion Albert. And so it was national news and all of a sudden there was just all these resources poured into Chicago to curb youth violence. And so I was working at a non-profit on the west side, which I&#8217;m from the south side and in Chicago, south side folks don&#8217;t go west side, west side folks don&#8217;t like, we don&#8217;t go to South side. It&#8217;s strange. So I got kind of thrown into this whole new world, which I love and I love the west side now. And working with these young folks who at the time there was a rubric created to identify the 1,000 young people most likely to kill or be killed. I don&#8217;t know what was involved in the rubric, but there was basically an army of youth workers deployed to make sure that they didn&#8217;t die and they didn&#8217;t kill anyone.</p>
<p>And so every day I was on the west side working with a group of 10 young men, trying to get them to understand that game banging and doing whatever else they were doing was not the right way for them and for society and supporting them to get their lives in the place that they wanted to be. A lot of them didn&#8217;t really even want to be doing the things they were doing, but there wasn&#8217;t an alternative. Unemployment rates for young men, black men in Chicago, I think is like 80%. And that&#8217;s been-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s unbelievable. And that&#8217;s been true for almost a decade now. It&#8217;s not a new statistic that happened post pandemic. This has been true in Chicago for many years. And so there&#8217;s a lot of judgment thrown at these young people. Oh, why don&#8217;t they just get a job? And now that there&#8217;s job openings everywhere, this may be partially true, but at that time it was not possible for them to get traditional work. And for many of them now, it&#8217;s not possible due to past convictions or honestly the way they look.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
We hear it all the time that soon as they walk into a place looking for a job, but they have dreads, absolutely not. The employer won&#8217;t even think about it. So a lot of this is not on them. Also, they&#8217;re children. These are teenagers, so we cannot put these expectations on them that we have on adults. And so yeah, that&#8217;s where I started. And then I moved to another organization that was less focused on violence prevention, like the one I was doing and more focused on youth empowerment, which was what I was practicing, because I don&#8217;t think youth or violence prevention is really around keeping kids busy and getting them into sports, which is all great, but my perspective is that you really have to change their outlook on life and help them figure out their own purpose, which to me is around that&#8217;s empowerment. And so I started working at another nonprofit that really focused on youth empowerment, helping young people find their voice or not find it, but use their voice. And that is what led me to the design world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s talk about that. In 2015, you had become a civic innovation fellow through Stanford University. And so this was a fellowship program. Tell me about that experience. How did that sort of change things for you?</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Yeah, I loved it. One, Stanford is like Disneyland. Never imagine anything like that. There&#8217;s always a joke that one, you&#8217;re in Silicon Valley, so there&#8217;s that bubble and then there&#8217;s a bubble on top of it, which is the Stanford bubble. And then there&#8217;s probably another bubble over that that you just can&#8217;t see because it&#8217;s too many bubbles. So it was coming from Chicago in this really deep youth work to taking a moment to just figure out what is it that I want to do? How can I really advance helping society? And then learning this new process of design that seemed very familiar. There was a lot of overlap to things that I had been doing before, but then there was also something new to it. It was this really diving into creativity as problem solving. It just really spoke to me, relying on people to help figure out the solutions, bringing diverse people together.</p>
<p>We talked about, it was always radical collaboration, and that was folks on the multidisciplinary. But for me it was always thinking about multiracial perspectives. If we&#8217;re going to solve societal challenges, it shouldn&#8217;t be on the shoulders of black folks and brown folks to figure out racism beyond the shoulders of women to figure out sexism. This is something we have to do together. And so I took multidisciplinary in that way. So Stanford was great. It&#8217;s got all challenges as Stanford, but for me to stay sane and not get consumed in the bubbles, I joined the organizing community out there and we were fighting against police murder. I think while I was out there, the police had murdered four people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
All folks of color. And so there was a hunger strike. The Frisco five did a hunger strike. So I would spend my nights on the street of San Francisco, pulling guard duty for them. I ended up getting arrested when we had a protest in city hall against police murder. Those are all things that may seem divorced from design, but one thing I would always tell my students is that designers didn&#8217;t break the world and we&#8217;re not going to fix it. You as a designer is also you outside of your nine to five. So what are you doing besides your professional work to impact and change the world? So yeah, I really appreciated my time out at the D School. Still very close with all the folks in my cohort and my instructors become, I felt like I really became part of another family, a west coast family.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. You had designed a program during that fellowship called Youth Tech Design. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Yeah, the Civic Innovation Fellowship is a project fellowship. So you had to have an idea of what you wanted to do. And so when I was in Chicago, how they found me was I was working with young people here and we created a web app called Expunge Gio to help other young people expunge their juvenile criminal records. And so that&#8217;s what got the attention on the D school and had me go out there. So because that thing worked, I said, &#8220;Okay, how do we scale this?&#8221; And so how do we allow more young people to create technology that solves issues that they care about? And so youth tech design was created for that purpose. And then the second part was how do we utilize technology to allow young people, young people of color specifically to get into college. Lots of times we don&#8217;t have the opportunities to go on trips to Haiti to build houses that look good on your college application.</p>
<p>We have too many other responsibilities. And so when you have technology, you can scale impacts pretty rapidly, which for a young person from the south side of Chicago to say, &#8220;I built an app that helped expunge 1,000 records in the first year, which then led to a policy change in Illinois for automatic expungement.&#8221; That&#8217;s huge. And the young people that I worked with here can say that they were all able to say that without, it was true. It wasn&#8217;t a lie, it wasn&#8217;t an exaggeration that they were part of such a massive shift in society.</p>
<p>And so hopefully that would give them a leg up to get into institutions like Stanford or where we&#8217;re traditionally excluded. And so Youth Tech Design was set up to do that. And then when I left the Bay and came back here, I didn&#8217;t maintain it as an organization, but I still continue to do those types of workshops for young people on the south side. And currently right now at ChiByDesign, that&#8217;s one of our passion projects is to stand up a youth program in the same vein, but now no longer focus on just teaching human-centered design, but teaching co-design as the way for social change and with anti-racist practices and principles.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;ve been someone that&#8217;s been part of the Chicago community and now part of the Chicago design community for a long time. How would you describe it to someone outside the city?</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
I feel like it&#8217;s pretty welcoming. Most of us from Chicago have a lot of roots in the south. So Chicago&#8217;s the big city with a southern hospitality vibe to it. I think it&#8217;s still pretty segregated as well, but I know that there&#8217;s efforts to change that. So I&#8217;m also on the ops board for the Chicago Design Museum. And I know in every meeting we have, we&#8217;re trying to figure out what engagements, what services, what possibilities we can create to bridge that gap. And there&#8217;s a lot of organizations working on that too to be honest. I feel like a lot of designers are trying to figure out how to use their talents for the city and for underrepresented communities. So I feel like it&#8217;s a good time. It&#8217;s very collaborative. I don&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s a lot of tension, which is great. Sometimes people jockeying for space and all that, but I feel like everyone&#8217;s so open to working together and moving a pretty strong social agenda forward that it&#8217;s really nice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now after you started ChiByDesign, you also began teaching design as well. So this is another way that you&#8217;re kind of helping to give back to the community. You&#8217;ve taught at Stanford D School, you taught at UT Austin at IIT Institute of Design. What does teaching design, how does that help you?</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Oh, I love it. So all of a sudden I got back to my dream of teaching, what maybe 10, 15 years after I initially had it. So this other thing, letting your purpose kind of drive you will always lead you back to where you should be. And that&#8217;s just something I really strongly believe in my heart. And so I love teaching. Honestly, my time at ID is what gave me the confidence to try to really break the mold of design. So again, going to the D School learning design Thinking Human, when I was there, it was like, oh, this is the Bible. This is how it has to be done. This is the only way it could be done. And when I started practicing, when I got back, it just didn&#8217;t feel right. I saw some validity in some of the things, but I was like, man, this is just not going to get us to the world that we need.</p>
<p>But I had no clue and I didn&#8217;t have the confidence that it could be something different. And so when I got to ID, I would start to express this to my colleagues and they were just like, &#8220;Well, change it.&#8221; And I was just like, &#8220;What? No, this is how it is.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;No, this is how it&#8217;s been. We made it up. All this stuff is made up. You make something different.&#8221; So that just set me, I was like, oh wow, okay, cool. And so teaching really allows you to learn, and especially when we&#8217;re talking about social issues, I feel like young people, and I&#8217;m not that old, but people younger than me just get this stuff in a much more nuanced, complex way and they just help push me. I felt like I was bringing things to them and they were absolutely bringing things to me that we were kind of challenging each other to be better and to think differently.</p>
<p>And then because you&#8217;re in an academic institution, you can experiment a lot more freely than if you&#8217;re doing client work. So when I was at id, I would get to try out these different methods that I was creating to see if they would actually help us understand racism in the system differently. Or if we tried these activities, could we create anti-racist outcomes? So one of the assignments that I created was making an inanimate object that pushed me so far to help understand the mechanisms of racism and then therefore, what are the principles that we need to embody in our work to create anti-racist outcomes. And so it was, as I was tinkering and teaching at the institutions, we were applying and refining at ChiByDesign. So they really worked well and in relationship with one another because what I was learning from ChiByDesign would help me teach more advanced concepts and methods in my classes. So I felt like that was a really exciting time. And students, I love them. They&#8217;re great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s, it all kind of feeds into each other, it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Absolutely. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at your career and all your experiences, is this how you imagined yourself when you were a kid?</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Oh, not at all. Again, had no idea what design was big into art and making, but not in the practice that I would say we do now. A lot of elements transfer over. But no, I never saw myself doing this. I never saw myself owning a business. I tell my team all the time, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Man, I&#8217;m ready to quit.&#8221; Just &#8217;cause &#8230; But it&#8217;s great to have a team that&#8217;s supportive and they push me every day. And so I guess the one thing that I would say that is true now as what I hoped it would be as a child, is to be surrounded by people who care enough about me to push me to be better.</p>
<p>And so I always saw that a part of my work, whether it was I worked at Pepsi stocking shelves, and I always surrounded myself in those environments just as I am now with people who I could talk ideas with and could push me and I could push them. So I think that part is true, but professionally, you know what I was going to do eight hours a day, 10 hours a day, so different. But I love it. This is what I love about design. You&#8217;re paying me to draw and sketch and think about things. Who could ask for a better job?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, and I would say also with what you do is you&#8217;re designing, I want to say designing futures in a way, to be honest. I mean, it&#8217;s one thing, like you said, to be a designer that&#8217;s making graphics or something like that. But you&#8217;re really taking design and using it to design the world in a way design, help youth in how youth outcomes will be shaped. And even the work you&#8217;re doing with the foster system in Ohio, you&#8217;re designing on a much grander scale that impacts real lives in a real way.</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Yeah. And I would say that I think product design is similar. The folks who designed the iPhone changed the world and changed social interactions in a way that I&#8217;m sure they didn&#8217;t plan for the object. So that was the purpose around designing the anti-racist object is that the object can shape societal interactions in very large ways. As product designers, we have to be thinking about those things. It can&#8217;t just be about the form of the object, right? Socio=technical systems, how does that object now impact the human beings around it? What organization needs to exist? So now, because of the advent of social media, there are social media departments and organizations that are attached to communications teams.</p>
<p>Now that we&#8217;re focusing on sustainability, we&#8217;re thinking about life cycles of products differently. All of this stuff has so many larger impacts that I think a lot of us are trained, I know I was, not necessarily to think about. It was like you got a really great insight that it will improve customer experience and or user experience, which I hate that term too. And go for it. And so I think where we&#8217;re at now is, and it&#8217;s not me, it&#8217;s a lot of folks, we&#8217;ve got to slow down. We got to think deeper about the systemic social impacts of what we make because they absolutely have those outcomes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there something that you want to accomplish that you haven&#8217;t had the chance to do yet?</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Actually, I&#8217;ve been thinking about it a lot. I think I might go back to school to learn industrial design. I just want to get better at making tangible things beyond, I love thinking about the systems in the larger, complex problems and solutions, but I do want to get better at making things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s a good natural extension though, of what you&#8217;re doing is to extend into things. I&#8217;m curious, have you heard of the Black InDesign Conference?</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you been?</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
I have not.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think, well, let&#8217;s see. They have it every other year, so I know they&#8217;re having it next year, because they started it in 2015. And so they do it, it takes place at Harvard, their graduate school of design. And I feel like the work that you are doing would be such a perfect fit for what that conference is about. So that conference kind of tends to deal with design in terms of the lived space. Usually, it&#8217;s been architecture, landscape planning, stuff like that. But they&#8217;ve started over the years to extend it into areas of black futurism. I think they had one year they were talking about biomimicry and stuff like that. But I think what it is is showing the application of design in people&#8217;s lives to change outcomes and stuff, I feel like the work that you&#8217;re doing would be a really natural fit for that. They had the 2021 conference virtual, I feel like they&#8217;re going to have the 2023 conference in person again, but it&#8217;s at Harvard. It&#8217;s a good conference. I think you should check it out.</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Oh, definitely. Yeah, definitely. I&#8217;ve seen it. And I think I didn&#8217;t go in &#8217;21 because it was virtual. I think I was just virtualed out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
But [inaudible 00:47:32] like the move. And it&#8217;s interesting that we&#8217;ve been doing a lot of work recently with organizations to help them figure out the future of their built environment. So there&#8217;s a lot of desire for new community spaces and activating, especially in Chicago, we&#8217;ve got a lot of vacant lots and stuff like that. And so we&#8217;ve been getting a lot of inquiries from organizations around that. So, which I think is great because architecture is just so focused on the build environment, they don&#8217;t necessarily have that perspective on what the lived environment is looking like. And so we just finished a project for a nonprofit here in Chicago that they&#8217;re trying to do, they&#8217;re trying to build a WeWork for education focused nonprofits so that they can really bring the ecosystem together physically so that they would, by extension work better and collaborate more on their programming.</p>
<p>And so we work with them to figure out what the principles of the space should look like. And so we did these co-design workshops with their staff leadership, the students that they serve, and helped them think through what is the ultimate vision for this place and what are the principles you need to design around as architects that we&#8217;re not going to build it. Don&#8217;t, I&#8217;m not going to tell you which materials and lighting and all that, that&#8217;s their expertise. But if they have this roadmap, how might that change their architectural desire? Because I&#8217;m sure for most architects, they&#8217;re dealing with the client.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re just dealing with the leadership of the organization, they can only tell you their vision. But that has nothing to do with, or not nothing that has little to do with the folks that they are serving. And so was really, it&#8217;s been interesting to do this alongside architects and hearing them say how valuable it&#8217;s been for them to be a part of those workshops and see those perspectives and see how they should create differently. So yeah. Are you going to be in Black InDesign next year?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. I&#8217;m definitely going to be there. I remember the first year I went in 2015 and I was trying to get other black designers to go. And I couldn&#8217;t. A lot of people were like, I don&#8217;t know if I want to go. I mean, are they talking about Photoshop? Are they talking about Sketch? &#8216;Cause these were product designers, UX designers, et cetera. And I&#8217;m like, first of all, it&#8217;s 2015. There were no black design events going on back then. I&#8217;m like, this is the first time something this is happening. It&#8217;s cheap. I think the tickets were less than $100. I was like, let&#8217;s just go and just see what it&#8217;s like. And a lot of people I know didn&#8217;t go that first year, but they have it every other year. So if you don&#8217;t go the first year, you can check it out the next year.</p>
<p>They record all the sessions, they live stream it. So if you happen to not be there, you can go back and watch previous year sessions to kind of get a sense of what it&#8217;s like. But it&#8217;s such, when I last went, it was in 2019 before the pandemic and I did do the virtual conference, of course it just wasn&#8217;t the same. But it&#8217;s such a collegial, black family reunion esque type experience. I mean, I would say as much as you could get on Harvard&#8217;s campus, I&#8217;ll put it that way. They&#8217;re not bringing out the grill or anything like that. But I mean, it&#8217;s as much of a collegial space for black design as you&#8217;re going to find. And it&#8217;s students, it&#8217;s longtime designers, it&#8217;s educators. And every year or every other year when they have it just brings something different to the space itself. They have it at Harvard Graduate School and Harvard&#8217;s campus and it&#8217;s great.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great. The thing about it is though, that because they do it every other year, they have a different staff every other year. So it&#8217;s always a little bit different. I hate to say inconsistent, but it&#8217;s a little bit different every time they have the event. So I&#8217;m curious to see what they pull out for 2023. For 2021, for example, the theme was around Black Matter. And so they were talking about designing for joy and black urban mobility. They had a bunch of workshops on spatial thought and things of that nature. So it was pretty good. I mean, I feel like they take design and really stretch it in a way that I don&#8217;t see from other black design conferences. And it&#8217;s even funny to say other black design conferences, because so many of them have popped up over the past couple of years now. But it&#8217;s a good event to go to. I think especially with the work that you&#8217;re doing, it&#8217;s probably good if not just for networking, but just to go and see and get inspired by what other folks are doing.</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. The other thing I&#8217;m thinking about is we started a fellowship program this summer for ChiByDesign. Again, thinking about how are we reaching back and making sure that we&#8217;re creating opportunities for young up and coming black and brown designers. And I don&#8217;t want to sound like those companies that I talked about in 2018, but yo, it was kind of hard. We were getting flooded with lots of applications from non folks of color. And I was like, &#8220;All right.&#8221; And we reached out to the HBCUs, they were kind of pushing us away.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The HBCUs were,</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Yeah, and I assume it was cause they didn&#8217;t know us, even though two of our team members are HBCU alums. So we were just like, all right, we got to do better and be more aggressive on getting our folks, I mean, we hit our goal, but yeah, we were shocked to be honest at what happened when we sent that application out. So yeah, it&#8217;d definitely be dope to be there. Network even more, not networking on the superficial, what can you do for me? But like you said, coming to the reunion.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. What advice would you give to somebody that wants to follow in your footsteps? They&#8217;ve hearing your story now, they want to do a similar type of thing. What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Yeah, whew. Figure out who you are. Figure out who you are. Stand on that. Be confident on who you are, what you stand for. Don&#8217;t waiver. Things will get very hard. There have been many times where I&#8217;ve had to decide whether or not I was going to stay true to who I am and risk my job or just do what they wanted me to do and be secure. And I would like to say the vast majority of the time I put my career on the line, I can think of many instances, but I&#8217;m sure, I don&#8217;t want to be arrogant and say I did it every time. I&#8217;m sure there were times where I folded too. So that will happen. So then be patient with yourself. There will be mistakes along the road, but letting that purpose, that who you are, guide your work, the opportunities will come.</p>
<p>They may not be as fast or as you want, but they will happen. None of us knew 2020 was going to happen. And so I had started doing this anti-racist design work before that, and that&#8217;s when everybody was talking about equity center design. And so I stayed away from that because I didn&#8217;t believe it was possible under the system we have, under capitalism. So I was focused on anti-racism, and then 2020 happened and anti-racism became a thing and people started to embrace it. Kennedy&#8217;s book was a best seller.</p>
<p>And so again, it may not come at the time that you want, but as long as you&#8217;re staying true, it will happen. And even if it doesn&#8217;t, you&#8217;re standing your own truth. So I think for, again, it&#8217;s figuring out who you are, what you believe in, what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish, and then utilizing every skill set that you have to help get there. Right? Don&#8217;t be afraid to challenge the norm. Just &#8217;cause it is doesn&#8217;t mean it should be and doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s right. So keep pushing. I feel like so many young people are already doing that. But yeah, just keep doing it. We as a society will be better for it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want of the next chapter of your story to be?</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Oh. So I feel like I will still be at ChiByDesign. With what role? I&#8217;m not sure, but I think we&#8217;ve built a thing that is exactly what I hoped for. And so part of that was also turning over power. So an example, we have at ChiByDesign, we have Ghana Independence Day off as a company holiday, and we have Diwali off as a company holiday because we have team members who are from Ghana and India. When I was developing the company, one of the craziest things that I found out about capitalism when our HR person was like, &#8220;What company holidays are you going to have off?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, the regular ones. And she&#8217;s like, no, that&#8217;s not how it works. You have pick which ones you want and which ones you don&#8217;t. And I was like, that&#8217;s nuts. I thought it was the standard demand.</p>
<p>There was a policy that you had to have these things off. And I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s wild.&#8221; But again, because we&#8217;re in the United States, they&#8217;re all American things. And so I didn&#8217;t want them to feel left out. We wanted to co-create this organization and we&#8217;re constantly co-creating the organization. And so I made a decision that we would celebrate as a company something that was important to them as well, so that they wouldn&#8217;t have to use their personal time or sick time to try to celebrate something that was meaningful to them. While the rest of us would always just get the things that we&#8217;re supposed to get off. And so I think we&#8217;ll keep co-creating and based on the people we have, it&#8217;ll always be the place that I want to be. I believe that. I hope that&#8217;s true. So yeah, I&#8217;ll be here, but again, I don&#8217;t know which role. I don&#8217;t think I will stay at the top in terms of title in five years, but I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s going to be. So I&#8217;m always excited about the unknown.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work, about the firm? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>
Sure. So our website is www.chibydesign.com and Chi is CHI also, for folks to know it is ChiByDesign. We always get ChiByDesign, or She By Design? No, it&#8217;s Chi. It&#8217;s for Chicago. Instagram, Twitter, same thing, @ChiByDesign. And yeah, we&#8217;re always looking to collaborate with folks and make the world more anti-racist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good to me. Well, Chris Rudd, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. One, I think just what you&#8217;re doing around anti-racism via design is so monumental and important that like your background of wanting to help out kids and help out youth, and now you&#8217;re being able to use this along with human centered design methodology and stuff to really impact and make change on such a grand scale. I&#8217;m really excited to know that there&#8217;s somebody like you that, one, is a designer, but is also someone that is really passionate about community and passionate about social justice and about using design to really make this a better world. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Rudd:</b><br>

<p>While the World Wide Web has evolved tremendously over the past couple of decades, it can still feel like we are fighting an uphill battle when it comes to accessibility, even though this push for accessibility has existed since the first set of guidelines created by the W3C in 1999. Making the Web more accessible is a benefit to everyone, and Tiffany Stewart is working hard to make sure that happens.</p>
<p>Our conversation began with a discussion on her work at Thomson Reuters, and she shared how she got into design systems and accessibility. Tiffany also talked about moving to the U.S. from Jamaica as a teenager, attending college in Mississippi, and spoke on what prompted her to shift her focus from engineering to UX. Thank goodness we have future-thinking designers like Tiffany Stewart to ensure that we have a Web that we can all use!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Hi, my name is Tiffany Stewart. I&#8217;m a senior UX designer specializing in digital systems with a focus on accessibility. And yeah, that&#8217;s me. Very much a blurb and just really passionate about accessibility and UX.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s the year been going for you so far? How&#8217;s 2022?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Oh my gosh, 2022 has been a blast and then some. I bought a house.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Right. I am officially now a homeowner and I am in the process of building out my office. So I went and bought the IKEA cabinets and I attached them to the wall and I&#8217;m painting and I&#8217;m sanding and breaking out the miter saw. That is my life at the moment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a huge accomplishment. Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Thank you. It was a lot. The process was a lot because I think it was right before the interest rates went up, so it was just like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, I have to hustle and get this house before everything just goes to pop.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, that&#8217;s such a big accomplishment already for the year. Is there anything else that you still want to try to accomplish before 2023?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I have so many, but I think for the immediate goal for me is to see this Black Panther movie that&#8217;s coming out this year, the second one, the Black Panther. And then on my professional work and getting my design system up and running to a point where it&#8217;s doing what it needs to do and folks are able to use it in a meaningful way. So yeah, those are my big ones for the end of the year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Let&#8217;s tap into a little bit about the work that you do. You mentioned you&#8217;re a senior UX designer and you&#8217;re working at Thomson Reuters. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I think they initially hired me as a contractor to work on one of their products as a regular UX product designer. And then once they heard about my previous work on a design system prior, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll just move you over to the design system side so we can get that up and running and you can help facilitate that process.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Okay, cool.&#8221; And so I shifted into that particular space. Design system tends to be more, because I think not many people know what design system designers do. It&#8217;s more of a space where you&#8217;re looking at applying concepts across the board holistically for several products and several teams and spaces. So my day to day is really thinking about, &#8220;Okay, how do I apply the concept of warning across a design system so that all of the products are consistently representing warning in a way that&#8217;s meaningful and consistent?&#8221;</p>
<p>So my day to day is that, making decisions about what our colors are going to be and how they&#8217;re going to be expressed and just setting all of that up so that the designers can build their products relatively quickly because all of these decisions are already made for them. So they can already just bring those into play. And then working closely with the accessibility team, which I&#8217;m very excited, the first time I&#8217;ve actually ever had one. Usually, it&#8217;s just me doing it by myself. But we do have a dedicated accessibility team at TR and they&#8217;re amazing to work with and we just make sure that the DS is accessible as possible, that our products are accessible as possible. So that&#8217;s my day-to-day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me more about that accessibility. I&#8217;m curious, what does that look like at a news organization like Thomson Reuters?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
A lot of it is making sure that we are meeting WCAG requirements. We&#8217;re making sure that within the code itself, everything is labeled with the correct ARIA labels, that the DOM is in the correct order, so that when you are tapping through with your headings, everything gets represented semantically type of thing. Making sure that people who are using screen readers are able to get their news in a way that is accessible and meaningful to them. Because I think most people when they think of accessibility, they think, &#8220;Oh, I just have to match the color contrast ratio of 3:1 or whatever it is at the time.&#8221; But no, it&#8217;s actually making sure that the code works, that someone who is a purely keyboard user can tab through, everything makes sense when they tab through, they can read things, whether they are blind or otherwise situationally disabled.</p>
<p>And so we meet with the accessibility team regularly. My particular specialist that we work with is Yvonne, hey Yvonne. And then I think on the other side is Fariel. So we meet with them regularly. There&#8217;s a whole team of them, they&#8217;re amazing. We reach out, we ask questions, we pair and make sure that the code matches as well as the Figma files match so that all of our products in theory, leave the board fully accessible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like that&#8217;s a lot to do from day to day. What does your regular everyday job look like?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
It is a lot of pairing. So I will pair with devs, I will pair with like I said, Yvonne on accessibility. And then it&#8217;s also a lot of research to make sure that we are meeting the use cases that are given to us by the various teams that we work with. And then figuring out those solutions for how do we solve their problem, but make it agnostic to a design system because it can&#8217;t be really specific. The teams are usually responsible for the more specific work that they do in terms of the workflow for their particular product. But from the DS side, it&#8217;s more of a super relatively agnostic approach to how can I apply, what does a header look like in an agnostic way that everybody can just pull from the DS and use. Modify here and there. But for the most part, this is generally what a header should look like and where things should go and it is accessible because we&#8217;ve already sorted out that when you tab through, it&#8217;s going to go through here, here, here and here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And just to be clear, a design system would be different from say a brand guide or something because it seems like because you&#8217;re applying this across several different products, there&#8217;s just going to be different, like you said, situations or use cases where you may not be able to apply it directly, but maybe some elements of it. Am I getting that right?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yeah, that sounds about reasonable. Now brand does sort of inform a lot of the things because we can set those colors and that typography and some of the spacing as set colors within the system. And then if you are that brand and you are on the brand team, we at least have those in the system so that you can pull them if you need to. Those decisions are already made. So your H1 is in whatever font with whatever spacing that&#8217;s already set in the base token work. So whenever the engineers go to code it, they don&#8217;t have to worry about it. That H1 is always going to be that H1.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Got you. What&#8217;s probably the most difficult part about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Probably convincing other designers that accessibility is the thing. That is probably the hardest thing. Now, I will say that my coworkers and my teammates at TR, we&#8217;re all very passionate about accessibility, so it&#8217;s not so much a problem there per se. But I&#8217;ve worked with other designers before or other strategists or other brand folks who are just&#8230; It is pulling teeth to get them to do the bare minimum of a contrast check on a color or a button or trying to understand that there are people&#8230; Is there a focus state that&#8217;s set? What happens if you try to tab through? Because a lot of sites will break. I think in my example at the State of Black design talk, I was just trying to buy a book from a website, but just using my keyboard and it completely failed. And so I wasn&#8217;t able to check out.</p>
<p>So in my mind, if we&#8217;re making a use case for it, which I don&#8217;t generally like applying to accessibility, but if you do need to make a use case or a business use case for it, you&#8217;re preventing people from buying your product by not making it as accessible as possible. It&#8217;s easy to throw away accessibility, I think because people as a very general rule, and I mean very generic here, seem to be willing to ignore people with disabilities or having a disability in general. You hear all these stories nowadays of airlines who are completely throwing away people&#8217;s wheelchairs or people not allowing the dog for the blind user in this space because of whatever. There&#8217;s a level of disposability there that I personally don&#8217;t enjoy and I don&#8217;t like seeing it. And more so too, if you&#8217;re looking at the numbers in the U.S., a good majority of the people who have disabilities do tend to be Black and brown people. So then I&#8217;m doubly more so like, &#8220;Oh no, no, no, we have to get into this.&#8221; We absolutely have to get into this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And accessibility is one of those things that has definitely increased in importance over the years. Not just because more and more people have gotten on the web, but there are now more and more ways of experiencing the web that is not just through a standard computer monitor. There&#8217;s laptops, there&#8217;s smartphones, there&#8217;s smart watches, there&#8217;s probably a toaster out there that can get online. There&#8217;s all these different ways now to access information on the web. And granted those use cases are important, but also just as you mentioned, just differently abled people will have different sorts of things like vision requirements for high contrast or colors or even the alt text that you put on images is I think almost remedial accessibility and that&#8217;s still something a lot of people hem and haw over.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Oh my gosh, they will fight you down. They will absolutely fight you down. Or they&#8217;ll produce this interface that has no contrast whatsoever. And so you&#8217;re just guessing at this point as to what is happening on that page? I don&#8217;t know. Because I think the new thing now is everything is light and bright, so there&#8217;s no borders on anything and everything just fades into the next one. And it&#8217;s very pretty aesthetically, I will give it that, but unfortunately it&#8217;s not really usable by everyone. And I think often people forget that by and large, when you make something that is accessible, that is usable by everyone, everyone benefits. Everyone benefits there. Like the grab bar in the bathroom, I am not disabled. However, the amount of times that I have slipped on the conditioner and that grab bar saved my life. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
And it can look cute too. So yeah, it&#8217;s just accessibility works literally for everyone, so why not just do it?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. And accessibility also makes sure that as many people as possible can experience what it is that you&#8217;re putting on the web.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember back in the day, we&#8217;re talking this is early 2000s, maybe even before that, when websites would have those badges that are, this site is best viewed an Internet Explorer 6 on a desktop that&#8217;s 1024 X 768. It was almost like a bouncer at the door telling you, you have to be this old to get in or something.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, no, it&#8217;s a matter too, because I think what people don&#8217;t include in accessibility when they are thinking about the digital part of it too, is that they don&#8217;t include access. Not everybody has access to the best monitor, not everybody has access to the fastest processor and not everybody has access to a credit card. When we make everything credit card only for the longest time, I think before a Venmo and a PayPal came into the play, it was just the people that don&#8217;t have a credit card or don&#8217;t have that level of financial literacy don&#8217;t deserve to buy things. What are we saying when we don&#8217;t include that as part of the conversation around access and accessibility?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I would say one thing that is also, I think made accessibility more important is the increase of multimedia on the web.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;re recording a podcast. This podcast will have transcripts for accessibility.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
A transcript? Yes, thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Videos with captions-</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I was going to ask.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And things like that.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;re starting to see it be more and more commonplace now that the media that we consume is not just what we read, it&#8217;s also what we hear, what we see. Even smart speakers and devices, you have to talk to them in a certain way in order to get back what you need. All of that is a factor of accessibility.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yeah, no. I think they just released a study maybe day before yesterday that Netflix was saying that the good majority of their users that have subtitles turned on are not blind or deaf.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s some shows I would watch with subtitles. I used to watch Scandal with subtitles just so I can make sure I can catch everything.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes, I keep mine on. Yeah, I know because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happening.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Another thing that it&#8217;s good for, and this is not so much accessibility, but if you&#8217;re watching foreign language programs, to have subtitles in a different language. For me, it can help with learning a bit of the language because you know what they&#8217;re trying to say and what you hear, your mind connects those things together. But even with accessibility, there&#8217;s bad captions out there.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Oh my gosh, I live for those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a whole thing.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I need to make a website that&#8217;s just bad captions. Because they&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Pop music playing enthusiastically.&#8221; And you&#8217;re like, &#8220;What, where did that caption come from?&#8221; The descriptions are great, I love it. Yeah, yeah. No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
But I&#8217;m just glad that they&#8217;re there at this point because like I said, people don&#8217;t think about those things a lot of times.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And we&#8217;re talking about now accessibility in a largely, I don&#8217;t want to say 2D context. You might see where I&#8217;m going here, but there&#8217;s been all this talk about Web3 and the metaverse, and you want to talk about inaccessibility? It&#8217;s inaccessible even for the average person because, it&#8217;s not only about what you can hear or see, but just to get it&#8230; And maybe this is a tangent of accessibility, but you have to be watching on a certain device that costs a certain amount of money and you&#8217;ve got to have a high speed internet connection. There are other barriers that I think people might not look at as accessibility that does factor into accessible web experiences.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Absolutely. I talk about it all the time. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;So let&#8217;s talk about the actual experience part of this. How am I meant to experience this when I don&#8217;t have access to any of these things?&#8221; Maybe your point is to gatekeep, I don&#8217;t know, maybe. Because that&#8217;s usually the argument that will come up too, is that like, &#8220;Oh, well those people are not my target demographic.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Run me by again, what exactly is your target demographic?&#8221; Because every demographic has someone who may or may not be disabled. So I&#8217;m not really sure why. Again, it just plays back the disposability of people with disabilities. So it&#8217;s stressful to me. I get annoyed all the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit. Let&#8217;s learn more about you, about your origin story. I can tell you&#8217;re very passionate about UX and about accessibility, but I&#8217;d like to get a sense of where that came from. So just to start off, where&#8217;d you grow up?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
So I am originally from Jamaica. I moved here when I was about maybe 14, 15. Don&#8217;t ask me about the numbers. It was a long time ago. And then moved here. And the immigrant family story, my options were either engineer, doctor, MBA. My career choices were very narrow based on that particular set of criteria, which to be fair, I gave my mom her engineering degree so I could be left alone. Right? But everyone in my family is either a physician or a NASA scientist in my cousin&#8217;s part. So we&#8217;re all pretty diverse in terms of our applications to STEAM and STEM work.</p>
<p>I was actually going to be a surgeon at one point. I was attending NYU as a bio major to do that. But I think working with my mom in terms of listening to her talk about medicine as it&#8217;s in medical practice as it functions today in the U.S. and really hearing the stories about how people with disabilities or even older people are treated in the hospital system. I was like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t sit back and not say anything about it.&#8221; So I think I got a lot of it from going to work with my mom and seeing how people were being treated within the medical space. And even being handed their prescriptions and they couldn&#8217;t read it or they had to fill out online forms and they didn&#8217;t know how. And I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever tried to fill out online form via a hospital, but it&#8217;s usually a very bad process. Nothing is readable, any of those things. Don&#8217;t even ask them about a language option for you.</p>
<p>So going through all of that and watching my mom do it and then getting into the digital space and then understanding and linking the two was probably what drove most of my passion for accessibility.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
From what it sounds like, just based on life experience, that you had this early desire to get into this, but then you also just said, I gave my mom her engineering degree. I want to talk a little bit about that. You went to undergrad, you went to the University of Mississippi and majored in electrical engineering. Did you have an interest in it or were you just like, &#8220;This is what I need to do to get my family off my back?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
No, no, no, no. I did. I really, really did. So back, oh my gosh, my mom is going to be so mad. So I dropped out of NYU, to which my mother was livid and that&#8217;s fair. But then I dropped out of NYU because the company that I worked for at the time had given me a promotion and wanted to send me out to California to train their engineers on a particular ticketing system that we were using for our IT program. And so while I was out there, I ended up switching jobs and then my job was basically what they call a client support specialist is what they called it. And I was basically a liaison between the engineering department, project management and the sales people and customers in order to get them moved into their co-location space, set up their routers, all of that extraneous good stuff.</p>
<p>This was back before when we were doing network address translations and you had to do a letter of justification in order to get IPs because they thought that the IPs were going to run out. It was a whole thing. It was pre 2000, so pre Y2K, they were very concerned about these things. So I did that. But then the Dotcom Bubble essentially burst. And so a lot of us in Silicon Valley got let go. And so I came back and I was like, &#8220;Okay mom, I&#8217;m ready.&#8221; So because of that work that I did with that ISP, I determined that I wanted to build computers because I thought that was fun. So I did electrical engineering specializing in computer engineering. So in theory, I could build you a badass circuit. So yeah, that&#8217;s how that happened.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But you had the interest in it though. That&#8217;s the important part, right?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I am of a person who I like to take things apart and tinker. I like to work with my hands. Like I said, I&#8217;m building the shelves in my office. So miter saw, table saw, planar, let&#8217;s go. And I&#8217;ve always been that person. And then I&#8217;m also an only child, my mom&#8217;s only child. So she was very much of this is broken, you need to figure out how to fix it because I have to go to work. So I was like, &#8220;Well, got to figure it out.&#8221; But I&#8217;ve always had an interest in it and it was fine. I enjoy taking things apart. I&#8217;m a very curious person by nature. So I&#8217;m always fascinated about how things work, how things are put together. And you&#8217;ll see, you see me use the phrase all the time, &#8220;Oh my God, that&#8217;s fascinating.&#8221; Because I&#8217;m generally, I am that person.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, no, I understand. I went to college and I majored in math&#8230; Well, no, let me roll that back.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes, math major.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I first majored in computer science, computer engineering because this was turn of the century, like &#8217;99, 2000. Started college in &#8217;99 and I had been already dipping my toe into web design with Tripod and Angel Fire, GeoCities, reverse engineering view source websites and stuff like that. And I thought, &#8220;Oh, if I become a computer engineer, I can design a website,&#8221; because I didn&#8217;t know. I had not heard of what a web designer was or if that was a thing. And I that first semester, I was taking courses in I think it was intro to computer programming, learning C++. And I was like, &#8220;This is not HTML. What is this? How do I make a website with this?&#8221; And I&#8217;m going to my advisor and telling him what I want to do. And my advisor, Dr. Jones, he was like, &#8220;If you want to do this internet stuff, that&#8217;s just a fad. If you want to get into that, this isn&#8217;t going to last. That&#8217;s not what we do here.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Oh no. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He&#8217;s like, &#8220;We don&#8217;t do that here.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
But I will say they are teaching you the backend part of it. So they just completely tossed you over for the front end. But they gave you the backend part.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, but again, this was-</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
You had that Java stuff too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah. And this was &#8217;99. Our lab had Sun Microsystems and SGI Machines and stuff like that. So this was still very, very early in the web/internet days. And he was like, &#8220;We don&#8217;t do that here. We&#8217;ll teach you assembly, we&#8217;ll teach you C++, but if you want to do this web design thing, you might want to change your major.&#8221; And so the next semester, I changed my major to math. And then that&#8217;s just what I ended up getting my degree in. I like math, but people are always surprised with me being a designer that I have a math degree. I would imagine people are probably surprised you as a designer have an electrical engineering degree. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;How does that work?&#8221; For me, math teaches me how to think. Yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes, that&#8217;s what I was going to say. I think for engineering, it teaches you how to identify a problem and think about the steps needed to solve the problem. So engineering for me teaches you how to think about problem solving, which as a UX designer, that is pretty much all that we do is problem solve. How do we get the checkout flow to work in such a way that they actually finish checking out? What are those steps? And if there&#8217;s an error, what happens? So going through all of those steps and iterating on that process by testing every time. It&#8217;s very much an engineering mindset, I think.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And I know with math, the thing I think that struck me at one point learning math in college was that, &#8220;Oh, there are some equations that have either no solution or infinitely many solutions.&#8221; And that blew my mind at the time because I was like, &#8220;Wait a minute, I&#8217;ve been taking algebra and trig and calc and all these things.&#8221; They resolve to something. And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, there are often going to sometimes be equations that don&#8217;t make sense, that are not going to have a solution or they&#8217;re going to have an infinite amount of solutions.&#8221; And so when I say it teaches you how to think, at least for me, it teaches me how to take something I may not know and process it and break it down. The steps of writing a mathematical proof to me are the same steps to writing a research paper, the same steps to writing a proposal for a client or a statement of work. It&#8217;s the same logical flow of take these elements, prove this thing, therefore this, all of that.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I used to love those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I look back at some-</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I was that weird kid in class who loves doing the geometric proofs. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to show you that this is a right angle. Let me break it down right quick.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I looked back at some of my old stuff. I found my thesis from, god, 20 years ago. I found my thesis recently that I wrote in college on sigma algebra and measure theoretic entropy with the existence of Lie groups. I have no idea what any of those things mean now. But I&#8217;m looking back at it and it&#8217;s just symbols and letters. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I used to really know this. I don&#8217;t know it now.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes. Listen, I stopped because with electrical engineering, especially at Ole Miss, they were like, &#8220;We can&#8217;t let you do a math minor. You&#8217;d have to double major do EE and math.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Listen, after differential equations, I&#8217;m good.&#8221; It was differential, discreet, all of that. And I think after those classes is when you start getting into the theoretical math where they just don&#8217;t use numbers at all. It&#8217;s just theory and proving that this process works.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
My last year and a half because I majored in pure math and my last year and a half, it was differential equations, it was topology. And my teachers, great teachers, but absolute sadists. They would be like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to give this test and not everybody is going to pass this test.&#8221; Or they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Well, these last two questions are only for my top students.&#8221; And there will be infinitely just wild stuff like, &#8220;What in the world? When am I ever going to use this?&#8221; I&#8217;ve never had to use anything with differential equations, ever. I love it though. The thing is, I went into math because I love it. I love to do the problems and solving and all that sort of stuff, which is a lot about what design is. It&#8217;s about solving problems, different kind of problems, but you&#8217;re still solving problems. And math teaches you those steps and ways to think and consider in a way that&#8230; I didn&#8217;t go to design school, so I don&#8217;t know, but I feel like it teaches you that logical way of thinking through something that perhaps design school may not.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yeah. Because I think for me at least, it felt like design school was more about the psychology of things. So understanding color theory and understanding that different colors make people feel a different way than other colors do. So it&#8217;s more so about how these things make you feel more so than anything else. And so it was the engineering part that taught me the problem solving and then the design part that taught me the aesthetic piece. Is that the word?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, the aesthetic piece. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
The aesthetic piece Of it, and how things make you feel.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I totally get that. Yeah. Because for example, if you put red text on a blue background, yes, that&#8217;s going to be really jarring.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I will fight you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They won&#8217;t go together. But then mathematically, I know it&#8217;s because of the frequency of the color red against the color blue causes your eyes to do this weird jump shift. It&#8217;s really tiring to read that. So I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s why it doesn&#8217;t make sense.&#8221; I&#8217;ll always be trying to think of the reason behind the feeling instead of just going with the feeling, which I don&#8217;t know, maybe if I went to design school, I&#8217;d have more of that, &#8220;Oh yes, these colors, they mesh. I get it.&#8221; As supposed to being like, &#8220;Well, this makes sense because of some other reason.&#8221; But you end up going and majoring in design after you got your degree from Ole Miss, you went to Mississippi State and you majored in graphic design. Why did you make that switch?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Well, because I wanted to be an animator. Funnily enough, I think they had not updated their website at the time. So Mississippi State was like, &#8220;Oh, we have an animation program.&#8221; Because I really wanted to do graphic design for film or design for film. And so I was like, &#8220;Oh, I can combine my problem solving with design if I become an animator and do that.&#8221; That was a thought process in my mind. I don&#8217;t know why. So on their website, they hadn&#8217;t updated it. And so I enrolled and got in and I was super excited and they were like, &#8220;Oh, we no longer have that program. All we have for you is graphic design, good luck.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Huh? Okay. Well let&#8217;s try it and we&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>
<p>But then I think at the time, maybe it was more so print focused than anything else. So I could tell you all the things about the GSM of paper. We did watercolor photography, all of those things. One of my favorite classes was 3D design. And so that&#8217;s when I spent most of my time in the wood shop. The instructor at the time, I think he was a famous furniture designer, but he was teaching us how to build things by sketching it out, thinking about from a 3D space perspective, how something would look and then we would have to build it, build it, build it. So did some sculptural work. It was great. Oh my gosh, that design program at Mississippi State, I loved it. It was great.</p>
<p>And then they also allowed me to pair with video game designers they had. And so I was doing design work for that too. So it was a good time. Even though it wasn&#8217;t necessarily an animation program, I learned a lot from the graphic design program at State. I will say that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds like a lot of fun, actually.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Oh my gosh, it was so much fun. And I&#8217;m still friends with a lot of people there. And the people that left that school went on to do amazing things. I think Tim is out here designing the graphics for Roku. Let&#8217;s see, there&#8217;s another young lady, She went on to work at Gensler as an architect. So the class is good. The classes are really, really good. And some of the students that came out of there based on the teachers that we had at the time were just amazing, amazing folks to work with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you feel like your background in engineering helped you out in any way when you were majoring in design?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes and no. It helped me figure out how to approach thinking about what I was going to do if I needed to put together a logo per se. I knew, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, this is the result that I wanted. What are the steps to get there?&#8221; So in that sense, the planning of how to do it was helpful. However, engineering is very much, I like things to be symmetrical. There&#8217;s always those projects that we had to do that were you had to make something asymmetrical. And I did not enjoy that because my brain just refused. And I think that just came from the engineering side. It was like, &#8220;No, it has to either be in order or it has to be on a scale of some sort that I can understand like 2, 4, 6, 8,&#8221; that type of thing. I can&#8217;t have you jumping around all over the place in the design. It makes my brain not work well.</p>
<p>So it does both. And more so now with the digital side of things. Like I said, it mainly applies to the problem solving part of it where I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, okay, if we want to get this result. How do we apply that concept in a way that scales on a DS?&#8221; And I can do that through my engineering thinking, coupled with my design thinking.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So once you graduated from Mississippi State, you&#8217;ve got your design degree, you&#8217;ve got your engineering degree. Did you go right into UX design after that?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
No. I actually got a job at a church. It was one of those big churches, biggest churches in Austin, Texas. And I basically was doing everything. So I was doing all of their print work, so designed magazines, all of their photography. So I was a photographer. And then I was also responsible for building and maintaining their website. So it was a full on, you&#8217;re the only person here, you have to do everything type of moment. And I learned a lot from that job for sure. Yeah, printmaking and printing things is no joke. Web work is no joke. Because I think at the time they only had access to, what is it, WordPress? So that was the medium that I was working with. And WordPress has its own caveats. So putting all of that together and making sure everything got out on time every Sunday, I learned a lot. I learned a lot.</p>
<p>What I remember the most is we had to print magazines because the rector at the time wanted us to put out a monthly magazine where we interviewed various people from the church. We had to take pictures of everything and there was whole thing. So I was like a Vogue Magazine editor with the big old board where you put things up and your articles are there, and you pick what pictures and you basically art direct that whole entire process. But then after that was done, assembling them in this giant InDesign file and then sending that to the printer because we had a dedicated printer room. And figuring out how the printer worked, troubleshooting all of that, and then actually printing it, trimming the edges, cutting it, mailing it. I actually ended up sleeping at the office doing a magazine run. It was a good time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was a good time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You were truly a webmaster.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Doing all of that. I especially tip my hat to you about the magazine thing. The last gig that I worked at, we put together a quarterly magazine and that was a lot just to try to get it out the door, hopefully every three months. I can&#8217;t imagine every month. How big was the magazine?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
It wasn&#8217;t very big. It was a very&#8230; I want to say how many sheets as I&#8217;m looking through my paper. Maybe like 24, 32.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. That&#8217;s still a lot though-</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
So it wasn&#8217;t too bad.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
To try to pull together every month.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Listen, my main thing was because people would submit photos and the photos that they would submit, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;This cannot be printed. It&#8217;s entirely too small.&#8221; So then I&#8217;d have to schedule a photo shoot and run out there and retake all the photos and then run back. But the church had money, so we did what we had to do. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
It was a good time. Like I said, I learned a lot because it was literally only me. So I was responsible for all of it. From the rooter to the tooter, as they say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
As they say.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yeah, as they say, the rooter to the tooter. And so it was just picking the font, understanding how the typography was going to be laid out in an enticing way on the cover page. Figuring out how the table of content should be displayed, what was the concept and theme for the magazine. And then making sure that we got all the articles and everybody returned their corrections on time. And then making sure that we had the correct paper in stock and making sure that the printer didn&#8217;t jam. And then after all of that, running it through the cycle of getting it mailed out to the individual households that were part of the membership was a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That alone is a job. The fact that you were doing that on top of web stuff, on top of graphic stuff. My hat goes off to you because I&#8217;ve had those positions before where you&#8217;re doing all the things because you&#8217;re the only person that can do all the things.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yeah. It makes you indispensable to a point, but you get serious burnout after a while because it was one thing after another. And I think a few minutes later or a few months after the choir director left and the choir director was responsible for printing the Sunday brochures. So after he left, guess who was responsible for printing the Sunday brochures?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That was you.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Mm-hmm, yep. I was at that job all the time, actually slept there. And one would not think that of like, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re just a graphic designer at a church.&#8221; No, no friend.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
No, no friend.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve done church work before. Because sometimes what will happen, and I don&#8217;t know if this happened maybe in your case, but sometimes what will happen is that your obligation to your job ends up getting wrapped up in some level of religiosity where it&#8217;s not just the work that you&#8217;re doing for the church, but you&#8217;re doing the work for God.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
None of that, fortunately that was not. They were very nice. I want to say the church was Episcopalian. And I just was like, &#8220;Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm. This is great. I&#8217;m very happy for everyone involved. Yes, exactly that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel like maybe if it had been, for lack of a better word, a Black church, that might have changed. Because I feel like there&#8217;s a level of guilt, I find.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Guilt? Yeah, that&#8217;s what I was going to say.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I know, I&#8217;m trying. How do I say this nicely? But there&#8217;s a level of guilt that only Black churches because-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hear you.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Because they&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Oh well, your grand mama Marlene.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh no. So now I have to do this flyer.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I empathize with that a 100%. Oh my God. Okay, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Especially if your parents or family members or members of the church too. It&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Yeah, no, I&#8217;m absolutely going to just have to make this flyer and make Miss Martha look good.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So after your work at the church is when you got more into, I would say digital design. You worked as a product designer and then a UX designer, which is what you&#8217;re doing now. Was it a big shift to go from doing all the things at the church to now just focusing on product or focusing on UX?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Honestly, no. And I think that&#8217;s because the church in its way of making me do everything, prepared me for the slightly, and I do mean slightly, slightly less work of being a product or UX designer because I&#8217;m only focused on one thing at that point. I&#8217;m not focused on doing everything. So it was a breath of fresh air because I was like, &#8220;Oh, okay, I can just focus on the digital. I don&#8217;t have to worry about the magazine and whatever and whatever, whatever. I can just do the digital.&#8221; And then it also helped that I worked for a luxury travel agency. So I was just staring at beautiful pictures of hotels all day long and being like, &#8220;I will go there some day. Absolutely.&#8221; But yeah, no, it wasn&#8217;t too bad at all.</p>
<p>I think a lot of my experience with my work in print actually helped with my work at digital because they actually also did print magazines, but I was responsible for the digital version of it. So since I already knew how to do all of that work from the church, it was like, &#8220;Oh no, no, this is good. This is great. I can do this.&#8221; And I think the engineering team had already set up a pretty decent templating system. So at that point it was basically just making sure that all of the digital stuff was set up in a way that I could just very quickly upload it to the web what I needed it to, whenever they needed to release a digital article. And on my side, it wasn&#8217;t a set thing. So we only had released maybe one or two articles a week. And so it was just basically sourcing photos and making sure that all of the digital stuff was set up on there.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until they decided to end the print half or move the print half and mainly focus on digital in terms of booking flights and booking hotels. Then that&#8217;s when it was like, &#8220;Okay, so now we&#8217;ve shifted to the user experience side of things.&#8221; Because before, it was a lot of really just allowing consumers to just read articles based on our recommendations for things. And so it was very narrow in that sense. And then when it came time to book things, then it became, &#8220;Okay, so how does our booking thing work? How does search work? What is the experience if someone were to try to book a flight?&#8221; Is it that it goes to the travel agent or can they book directly? And what did the steps look like for that?</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s where it shifted is that that last piece of the UX of completing a full entire process to get that booked result versus I&#8217;m just serving you up an article on the best restaurant in LA type of thing. Does that make sense?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, that makes sense. And I think for people that are listening, I feel like at least nowadays, UX and product tend to get conflated in a way. There may be subbed out one thing for another. So I&#8217;m glad that you were pointing out what the differences are between those two.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
They do both carry an aspect of user experience in the very basic sense of how is a user meant to experience reading an article on restaurants versus how is a user meant to experience a checkout flow for booking a flight? So they do share that in that regard. You could use them interchangeably, I don&#8217;t think anybody would be mad. However, I do have friends who are product designers and I think they call them industrial designers now. I remember they&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m applying for a position for a product designer.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Ooh, that&#8217;s not what you think it is, friend.&#8221; So it also depends on what the company defines a product designer or a UX designer as well in the job description. And so a lot of my industrial designer friends were like, &#8220;This is lame, we&#8217;re the product designers, not you guys.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
So, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What gives you purpose to keep doing the work that you do?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
So I follow several people on Twitter who are in the disability activism space. And while I don&#8217;t comment per se, them sharing their experiences fuels me to make the web better. The internet is not going anywhere as far as I know. I would love it if they made it a utility, but I digress. And so I want everyone to have an equitable experience on the web. I want for, or I would like to be able to help that further along, whether it&#8217;s being passionate about making sure that there&#8217;s a contrast and the code is right and whatever.</p>
<p>But I want the web to be as equitable as possible. Because a lot of times when folks don&#8217;t have access to these things, people&#8217;s lives are in danger. No one talks about that side of it. But if all of a sudden you&#8217;re saying access to government grants and access to COVID vaccinations can only be achieved by going to a website, how many people are you cutting out with that one decision alone? Especially if the web is not accessible enough to accommodate everybody. And so following these women and their work in that space really fuels me to make sure that I champion it on my end as best as I can.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you work to stay your authentic self throughout your career? certainly I think when people hear this interview, they get that you&#8217;ve got a bubbly personality and working in tech and then working in design and working in tech in news. I would imagine you encounter a lot of different types of folks, we&#8217;ll just put it that way. But how have you worked to stay your authentic self?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Antionette told me to, I think you&#8217;ve interviewed Antionette Carroll?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, I&#8217;ve had her on the show. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Yes. Yes, yes, yes. So she used to come hang out at the house whenever she would come in for South by Southwest and we would have these long conversations about the work that she was doing in design equity. And she&#8217;s amazing and she&#8217;s also another inspiration. But Antionette was like, &#8220;Listen, you have to be authentic in your work all the time. You just have to be.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Okay, yes ma&#8217;am.&#8221; I just did what she said. I trust her and she&#8217;s an amazing human. And I do find that it is helpful because people then know what they&#8217;re getting from you. And I do tell people in front. I remember teasing my poor boss. I was like, &#8220;Are you sure you want to hire me? Because you were getting this mouth along with the hire, so I need you to be okay with that.&#8221; And he was like, &#8220;No, no, it&#8217;s fine. Please, by all means, bring your authentic self to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so I appreciate that about my bosses at my company. They&#8217;re very much supportive of that. And I have not run into a situation, because sometimes they&#8217;ll say that and they don&#8217;t mean that. But I have not run into that thus far here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m very grateful for that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Very grateful for that.</p>

Listen, that could be a series in and of itself. My goodness, I miss her so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is the best piece of advice that you would give to somebody that wants to follow in your footsteps? They&#8217;ve heard your story, they want to be like you, they want to be where you&#8217;re at, at that level. What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Stay curious. Be curious about everything. How everything works, how people feel about things. Be observant. Watch people, watch how things function. You would be surprised what you can learn just by looking at a thing and being like, &#8220;So what was that meant for?&#8221; We always used to joke that there&#8217;s these products out there that the designers built them for one way and then the users use them in a completely different way and you&#8217;re just like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not what that was meant for.&#8221; But even that is some semblance of feedback. So just observing and being curious and watching and learning. Stay learning. Stay curious and stay learning. Never stop learning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
To that end, where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I feel like at the moment, my big thing is I&#8217;m planning on having my mom come live with me. So learning more about accessibility in terms of interior design and home design and making sure that everything is set up for her to live comfortably if she chooses to come live with me. So just furthering my experience in accessibility, but just applying it to different things and seeing what that looks like. And then whatever I learned, share it with everybody who asks or didn&#8217;t ask. Y&#8217;all gon&#8217; get this accessibility on today, as I say, often.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
I tend to keep a low profile, but I am on LinkedIn. You can find me there. I am on Instagram, but I don&#8217;t post often. I am a lurker, as it were, one of those things. Those are my two spots that I&#8217;m usually-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s the Instagram name?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Elemango.design. It&#8217;s from an old graphic design project that I did for my senior year at university.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
But yeah, elemango.design. Elephants and mangoes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I thought that what it might be.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
My two favorite things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounded like that&#8217;s what it might be elephants and mangoes.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Elephants and mangoes. My two favorite things. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Awesome. Well, Tiffany Stewart, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Thank you for sharing your story. It sounds like you&#8217;re someone that is just passionately curious about a lot of things and you had the opportunity to be able to really go into a lot of places with your career. Engineering degree, then doing design and then doing all these other things. It sounds like you&#8217;re someone that is always trying to keep on the pulse of what&#8217;s next. And I think of course, with accessibility being such an important topic to our world right now, I feel like we&#8217;ll be hearing and seeing a lot more from you in the future. So thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Stewart:</b><br>
Thank you. So lovely to do this. This is a lot of fun. So yeah, no, I appreciate it very much. Thank you.</p>

<p>Striking out on your own can be tough, but I can tell you from personal experience that it can be one of the most rewarding things you do in life. And what better person to talk about this feeling than design strategist Lisa Cain. Lisa has worked in the visual design field for well over 20 years, so she knows a LOT about what it takes to get things done.</p>
<p>We started off talking about how she started her studio, and Lisa gave a peek in to her creative process on some of her projects. Lisa also spoke about her early career in visual merchandising, how that has helped her as a designer, and how her family has helped motivate her drive to succeed. (Also, did you know she was a backup singer?) It&#8217;s awesome to have designers like Lisa to show us how to thrive as a creative on your own terms!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
All right. Tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
I&#8217;m Lisa Cain of Lisa Cain Design and I&#8217;m a design strategist that helps nonprofits. Some of those nonprofits are healthcare and medical organizations, advocacy organizations and educational institutions. I help their brands stand out and build awareness, raise funds and also build their membership.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Now, we&#8217;re in the second half of 2021. I&#8217;m kind of curious to know how has the year been for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Oh the year has been really good to me. I&#8217;ve been very busy this year. This year&#8217;s busy. Actually, 2020 was actually pretty busy as well. It was a little bit interesting at first and it slowed down and had to kind of pivot and do business a little bit differently. But for the remainder of 2020 and throughout right now at &#8217;21, it&#8217;s been very busy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Do you have any sort of plans or things that you want to do for your business for the rest of the year?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Just continually working on great ad campaigns, finishing out some of those things, really exciting projects that I&#8217;m working on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Now, you mentioned your focus is on medical, education, advocacy, nonprofits. How did you come to specialize in those particular fields?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Right out of art school, right out of college, I worked for&#8230; It was a nonprofit management company and basically they managed hundreds of nonprofits under their umbrella and it was a group of designers that they had to do all of the design work. So I had maybe 10 clients that I managed, design project management, things like that, and just learning how to work with nonprofits. They were called my clients and just doing projects from high tech, medical, healthcare, food manufacturing. I just began to love work for nonprofits. My niche, for me, became healthcare, medical and advocacy because I just really love helping people and making a difference in their lives.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Is that what sort of really gets you truly excited about your work?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
It is. It is. Really seeing that project come to life and then seeing the numbers. For instance, one of my clients is the Organization for Autism Research and we created a brochure years ago to send out to schools and the teachers would present it to the students and teach them about autism acceptance. And to date, this brochure has probably influenced, touched the lives of children, over 125 million children worldwide so &#8211;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
To me, that&#8217;s really huge. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
That is a huge. That&#8217;s a big&#8230; It&#8217;s always good when your work is able to make that kind of a big impact. I think oftentimes &#8230; I&#8217;ve worked with nonprofits too and I&#8217;ve worked one in particular here in Atlanta. It&#8217;s the Grady Health Foundation, this was years and years and years ago, but some of the work that I did, I&#8217;ve actually seen on billboards and that&#8217;s such a&#8230; It&#8217;s a good feeling. You&#8217;re driving along and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Wait a minute, I did that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
It is. Yep, it&#8217;s awesome. So yeah, seeing your stuff plastered all over the place and then getting those numbers in that this many people have been touched by it, it&#8217;s a wonderful thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Yeah. What does your creative process look like when you&#8217;re starting on a new project? Walk me through that.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Sure. My creative process, I usually like to kick off every project with a meeting, so meeting with the client, listening and gathering information to better understand what the client is working with, then we collaborate and strategize their goals and challenges and expectations. Then from there, I&#8217;ll create a scope of the project using a creative brief and a proposal just to make sure we&#8217;re on the same page about vision, deliverables, costs, timeframes, things like that, and then once that is agreed upon, we move forward. It could be a mood board or concept development. From that gathered information of the creative brief, find out about the clients, target audience and mission and work on different concepts and different design solutions. From there, present those design solutions and explain my thinking behind that and my recommendations. Usually, we&#8217;ll narrow down one direction to go in and there&#8217;s the revision, refine process. Usually within my proposals, I&#8217;ll include up to three rounds of revisions. Once we go through that, there&#8217;s delivery or production.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Now, I hope for people that are listening, they got a sense of like that&#8217;s a pretty rock solid way when it comes down to starting the process. I mean, part of it is that creative and strategy work, but then, as you&#8217;re mentioning, you&#8217;re getting a proposal, you&#8217;re making sure that you and the client are really on the same page as you move forward is super important because nonprofits, they can sometimes change on a dime. They want something completely different midway in the project and you have to make sure that you have something that can hold them to what they promised would come from the project.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Now, do you mostly do print design or do you do a mix of that with other mediums?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s a mix, but more heavily print, yes. Usually, I&#8217;ll create a theme around something, say for&#8230; Nonprofits do a lot of event publication, event collateral, things like that and so I&#8217;ll create a theme around that and that is printed on everything. If it&#8217;s around an event, then it&#8217;s their lanyards, their brochures, their signage and then it can go digital where it&#8217;s social media, banner ads and even apps.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Now, aside from Lisa Cain Design, which you&#8217;ve done now for what? 20 plus years.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
20 plus years. Yep. Officially though, officially it&#8217;s 16 years. That&#8217;s when I truly got the business license and this is the name that I decided upon. But yeah, before I was freelancing and burning the candle at both ends, working a full-time job and freelancing on the side, kind of making my path to truly going into my own business.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
I think once you make it past 15, you can round up to 20. I think that&#8217;s acceptable. But yeah, aside from Lisa Cain Design, you also have a company with your husband. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s called Black Action Tees. Black Action Tees is a pop culture website that offers T-shirts and the T-shirts feature superheroes, music culture, sneaker culture and TV and movie pop culture.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
I think I told you this when we talked earlier, but I actually had ordered something from Black Action Tees way back in&#8230; I think it was like maybe 2010, 2011, something like that, I think so.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Yeah, probably about 10 years. Yeah, 10 years ago. First started it, yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Well, I hope the experience was really good and you really enjoyed your tees.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Yeah. Do you and your husband blend business like that a lot? I mean, you have your-</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:10:46].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Well, you have that business with him with Black Action Tees, but does he end up doing anything with Lisa Cain Design or is that just a separate thing?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
You know what, he doesn&#8217;t do any of the design, but he&#8217;s an IT guy so he does IT as his professional. He&#8217;s a IT manager, but he&#8217;s my IT guy. That&#8217;s as far as it goes within my company.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
I gotcha. Now, we&#8217;ve gotten to know a bit about your work and everything and we&#8217;ll probably dive more into the specific things later, but tell me about where you&#8217;re from. I know you&#8217;re located in Chicago. Is that where you&#8217;re originally from?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
I&#8217;m originally from South Side of Chicago. I grew up in South Side and then, yeah, moved to the south suburbs in the mid 70s.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Okay. What was it like growing up in Chicago back then?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
It was good. I think it was a really good experience. I mean, we had a neighborhood full of kids. I remember playing. You had to come in when the street lights came on, things like that, but it was a really good experience. Lots of great kids to play with. Families intact still in the 70s, I&#8217;m dating myself, yes. But it was a wonderful experience growing up in the city.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Did you get exposed to a lot of design and art growing up?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
The only real exposure that I had creatively was sitting at the kitchen table with my grandpa and he would teach me how to draw different things. Then I don&#8217;t know if you remember the TV guide, there was this ad on the back and it would say, &#8220;Draw this pirate and you can win a scholarship to art school.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Oh yeah. It would be like a pirate or like a turtle or something like that, yeah, I remember that.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
So I would draw that and I would send it. I was too young but I would draw it and send it in but I would never hear back from them. So that was pretty much the extent of being creative. I also had this set of books, it was kind of a sister set that came with an encyclopedia set, and there was this one particular book called Make and Do and so it was a book full of crafts and I would just do crafts endlessly in that book. So that was pretty much the extent of being creative at a young age.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Now was your family kind of supportive of you going into design?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Absolutely not.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
They came from that generation of thinking that design, you would become a starving artist. I remember back in high school, I had finished all of my graduation requirements as far as credit so I was able to take a lot of electives so I chose to take nothing but art and photography classes and just be totally immersed in my last year and it was absolutely wonderful. I had wonderful art teachers and I think from that experience that&#8217;s where I knew and chose that I wanted to be a graphic designer. They had alumni come in and show their portfolios from art schools and it was just so inspiring and exciting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Eventually you started out studying in visual communications, even though your parents didn&#8217;t really unfortunately support you going into that.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
That&#8217;s correct. I remember I got a catalog for the Art Institute of Chicago and I was so excited and I showed my dad and he saw one look at the tuition cost and he was like, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you take some secretarial classes at the local community college?&#8221; Yeah, we&#8217;d butt heads on hat. We&#8217;d butt heats. But again, he came from that generation where just they couldn&#8217;t see it. He meant well and I have to say that years later, when I did go to a different art school, he bought my first Mac. So he was supportive down the line.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Okay. So you were at Prairie State College majoring in &#8230; Back then it was called visual communications.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Yep. Visual communications. That&#8217;s right, and back then, nothing was computerized yet. So I was taking illustration classes and intro to graphic design, things like that. So we used, my supply list at the art store, you had this long list you had to go get all of these supplies for for your classes. It was things like hot press boards, Zipatone, technical pens and Prismacolors with Letraset type that you kind of rub down and using light boxes and making folding dummies for brochures. Everything was really hands-on. I remember walking with those gigantic portfolios and a little tackle box with all your things. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Yeah, a lot of the design back then was really &#8230; I mean of course it was tactile because the personal computer I think was not fully in homes at that point. I know it was available, but it was really expensive.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
I remember seeing ads for RadioShack for the &#8230; I think it was the Tandy?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Tandy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
The Tandy 1000 I believe? It was like $1,600.00, $1,700.00. It was expensive. I mean &#8211;</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
For folks that are listening, that&#8217;s about the cost now of like maybe a souped-up MacBook Pro or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Right. Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
I mean you&#8217;re talking something that had maybe, maybe 512 megabytes of RAM. Like there&#8217;s no way you&#8217;re really designing anything on something like that.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Anything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
It was basically just a very expensive calculator at that point.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Yep, and at Prairie State, they did have a computer lab and they had like a handful of &#8230; I think they were Apple [inaudible 00:16:39], the Macs.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Oh goodness.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Yeah, so you know you couldn&#8217;t really do much on it at all. You&#8217;d draw a circle and put some color in it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Yeah, and even if you really drew a circle, it wasn&#8217;t like smooth. It was sort of like a jagged kind of &#8230; Yeah. I remember those times very fondly. I remember I was learning Basic and I&#8217;m dating myself by saying this but I was learning Basic in elementary school and they were &#8230; Like little graphic stuff, like you&#8217;d make a rocket or something like that. I mean it was very rudimentary stuff compared to certainly what you can do now, but it&#8217;s amazing to see how in such a fairly short amount of time, how much design on computers has really kind of taken over and changed and grown. It&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
It is amazing, it is and you have to stop never learning and keep up with all of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Yeah. So from Prairie State, you ended up going to the Art Institute. But you studied a different kind of sort of design. Can you talk about that?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Sure. So I decided &#8230; I wasn&#8217;t sure about graphic design, I was trying to just kind of find my way in, discovered the Art Institute of Illinois which at the time was called Ray-Vogue College of Design, and I decided to go for fashion merchandising but minor in visual merchandising. At the time it was kind of interesting being middle class and it was kind of hard not being able to get a student loan for like your full four years. It&#8217;s like you ran of money and your parents needed to get a plus loan, you didn&#8217;t qualify for grants. It was kind of hard. That&#8217;s exactly what happened. I finished my first year and couldn&#8217;t get another loan, my dad couldn&#8217;t get another loan. I decided to go ahead and finish out my minor which was in fashion merchandising, finish that, and then I was able to get a job at a big department store in Downtown Chicago. I was already working there as a salesperson so making that move into that position was fairly easy. So it was exciting. I thought once I got that job I thought I had made it. I was a visual display designer down there and it was fun and again it was a lot of physical work. But a lot of fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
So when you say it was physical work, like you were &#8230; Were you like designing storefronts and stuff like that?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
We designed all of the store windows. Then we did interior design and we set up for fashion shows, things like that. So it was like set design and prop building. I remember once we had to spray-paint hundreds of styrofoam trumpets and then glue them to eight foot panels. So we were making like sets and backdrops and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Wow. It&#8217;s interesting, it sounds like the design got even more I guess &#8230; I don&#8217;t want to use the term analog, but it got a lot more physical I would say because you&#8217;re now really building the designs that you want to see.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Right, right, and then on top of just the set design, you were dealing with these really heavy, expensive mannequins. Like a rite of passage for being a visual display designer is learning how to strike a mannequin and basically it&#8217;s posing, but what you did was you wrapped wire around the mannequin&#8217;s waste and then it would be under the clothes and then you would have to attach nails to the end and you would actually &#8230; So I&#8217;d be walking around with a hammer all day and you were hammering these nails in, striking the mannequin so they&#8217;re standing up and styling a wig was a rite of passage and getting burned with a glue gun on a regular basis because you had to do everything, you had to dress this mannequin from head to toe and that meant clothes, shoes, sometimes pantyhose, even the jewelry. It was fun, it was interesting and very physical.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
How often were you kind of doing these displays?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
On a weekly basis. So there were &#8211;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Oh yeah. The downtown, that store was eight floors. So yeah, there was a whole team of us. That was interior, windows, everything and then there&#8217;s like these little light boxes. You did like the cosmetic displays, you had home furnishing. All the different departments.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
That sounds kind of thrilling actually to be able to kind of turn around and do that so quickly every week.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
It was. It was fun. It was again a lot of physical work, and at the same time the building that we were in, it&#8217;s a Chicago landmark. So a lot of times we would be goofing off and we would go and explore this building. This building was built in 1904, the architect Lou Sullivan did it and it was like this beautiful elaborate rotunda entrance and be exploring and we found like hidden staircases that were absolutely beautiful and beautiful tiled flowers. There was like sub, sub, sub, sub basements, so yeah, we were running around there and just having fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
That&#8217;s amazing. I mean for people that want to look up or have not heard of Louis Sullivan, he was like the father of modern architecture. Like he was a mentor to Frank Lloyd Wright, a lot of what I think people see now in skyscrapers is really thanks to him.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). And the building was the Carson Pirie Scott Building.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Okay. Wow. That&#8217;s amazing, so you were doing that while you were at Art Institutes or was that after you left there?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
It was after, it was right after I left there. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Okay. Why did you decide to sort of make that shift from visual communications to merchandising like that?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
It just seemed more exciting to me at the time and again I&#8217;m young and I&#8217;m just trying to find myself. So just trying out something new, and that&#8217;s something that I do encourage up and coming designers. Don&#8217;t be afraid to just take chances and try out new things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
So aside from doing that kind of storefront set building kind of work, what other kind of career experiences did you have after you graduated from the art institute?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
After that, I decided actually &#8230; I did kind of a detour and believe it or not, I ended up getting secretary experience. I became an administrative assistant. I guess again trying to find myself and I ended up working for The NutraSweet Company. It was a big company at the time. This is in like the early 90s, mid 90s. They had a Mac there that no one knew how to use. So I volunteered and they decided to send me back to school, and so I ended up at the Illinois Academy of Design and Technology. So there, computers were for the design community and design studios and all of that. They were starting to make that transition from doing everything by hand to going digital and doing everything on the computer, I remember at the time it was a lot of animosity between new people coming in and people like old-school people that just refused. They would not learn, they would not get computer skills. So it was a good time, a good transition to kind of be on that cutting edge of learning. Up there I learned how to do Photoshop, I think it was Photoshop 2.0 and CorelDRAW and some 3-D animation applications. So by the time I finished that, I had three job offers before I graduated.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Oh nice. So even then, you have kind of this burgeoning &#8230; I guess this burgeoning rise of design on computers and now that you&#8217;ve learned these tools or you&#8217;re learning these tools, it&#8217;s opening up these different opportunities.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Right, right. Because when I graduated, it was a student portfolio but I think they could see the creativity there and the ideas that were sparked. But more importantly they knew how to work within these applications. So that was huge at the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Would you say that your work in fashion merchandising kind of helped with that though?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Oh absolutely. Absolutely. I think just from doing fashion merchandising or visual merchandising, project management, bringing something together like on a set, we had to like plan things out on paper first and decide what was going to go where and then this color scheme, there was always a theme about something so that kind of translated to design, absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
I mean I would imagine also just being able to come up with those concepts. I mean that&#8217;s creative direction, that&#8217;s art direction. Those are things that if you look at a blank Photoshop canvas or something as your stage, like you can kind of bring those same visual elements in with perspective and sizing and all that sort of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Nice. Now you&#8217;ve said that you came through the back door to become a designer at age 30. Tell me what does that mean? Because it sounds like you were already doing a lot of design.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Well you know what? For me I felt like I truly didn&#8217;t arrive until after I graduated from the Illinois Academy of Design and Technology and I was actually doing graphic design on the computer, and that was at age 30 and The NutraSweet Company sent me back to school and yeah, I felt like, &#8220;Okay, it&#8217;s official now, and I&#8217;ll officially have the title graphic designer.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Okay. I mean aside from I guess getting that title, did that &#8230; I&#8217;m curious, did your family at that point kind of see like, &#8220;Oh, this is something like serious.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Oh yeah, oh yeah. Even when I was in school, they finally came around. Like I said, my dad, he was the one while I was in school because it was rough. You had all these projects to do and they had a computer lab but you needed something at home to work on and so he bought me my first Mac and that was what, 1996? It wasn&#8217;t inexpensive at the time. We&#8217;re talking, you had to get the modem and everything else separately and yeah. And speaking of modems, my first job &#8230; So out of school was with USRobotics who actually built the modems. That was quite interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
So now you&#8217;ve made this shift. I&#8217;m looking, kind of trying to follow this. So you&#8217;ve made this shift now from visual merchandising to graphic design. How was the work different, I mean aside from obviously physical to digital but how was the work different that you were doing now?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
I think with graphic design, this opened up a whole new world. I think I personally felt like the possibilities were endless to be more creative. As a visual display designer, you&#8217;re working at this one particular place and you&#8217;re doing stuff at one location. But as a graphic designer, it&#8217;s like endless possibilities to creativity. There&#8217;s always different projects coming up and not only that but it could be different clients, different organizations or companies. So the creativity is endless.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
One thing that I really remember from those like early days of kind of digital graphic design. It really was like &#8230; You could do anything you wanted. It was like &#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say it was like the wild, wild west because that implies some level of lawlessness but like you really could get away with anything because the tools were so accessible. Like everyone can point and click, but not everyone&#8217;s going to do the same combination of filters or colors or even settings on certain things. So you end up coming up with just the wildest kind of designs just by playing around. I felt like there was a lot more play back then to get to kind of what the end result could be.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
It was, and then at the same time &#8230; I actually started creating websites with my husband at the time we were dating and we were doing webs, I created my first, my website, my portfolio website like in &#8217;98 and I thought it was like the coolest thing because it was like this crocodile on the front. Remember it was like landing pages and it was like maybe a little bit of animation. I thought it was so cool because my crocodile&#8217;s eye was like winking at you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Oh, those early animated GIFs. I love those.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Now as you kind of continued on in your career, you worked in-house as a designer for SmithBucklin and then you were an associate creative director at Urban Ministries Inc. When you look back at those particular experiences, what did they teach you?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
I think most importantly they taught me how to work with my clients, how to project manage everything, stay on timelines, stay within budgets and be creative at the same time. They were invaluable experiences.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Were they like different? Because I mean I&#8217;m imagining in Urban Ministries, that&#8217;s kind of more religious whereas SmithBucklin I guess you could say is secular. I don&#8217;t know. Was it a big difference in just like the type of work that you were doing?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Yeah. SmithBucklin was very, very fast-paced and they had to account for every 15 minutes of our time so they could build a client and if you had to go to the bathroom, you had to figure out a way to pad that in there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
It was rough but at the same time it was such a good learning experience and truly taught me everything about working with non-profits. Urban Ministries definitely. It&#8217;s a publications company and way more laid back. I designed the Vacation Bible School curriculum there, so they were much more laid back and actually even just the attitude, they were way more appreciative of your work. You felt valued there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Is that where the seed was kind of planted for starting your own studio?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
It was. It was because at that time I decided to go part-time. They allowed me to work part-time and I started again burning the candle at both ends and I would work like till 3:00 a.m. on my freelance projects and then get up and go to work and yeah. But it was definitely the stepping stone to build Lisa Cain Design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Aside from it sort of being that stepping stone of seeing how your work impacted people, did you just kind of feel at this point like you were just ready to strike out on your own?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Absolutely. Because at the time, I had small kids that I desperately wanted to be here for. My son at the time, we had found out, he was diagnosed to be on the autism spectrum and he was put in a special pre-K class and I really needed to be there for him. So I was driven to be here, be home, and run my own business.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Oh, interesting. What do you wish you would have been told about the design industry when you first started?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
I think the number one thing, and it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m truly still working on to this day and that&#8217;s boundaries. Healthy boundaries. So what I mean by that is it&#8217;s okay to say no to some things. Being selective in the type of projects that you want to work on, the type of budgets you want to work on. That&#8217;s super important to determine and work within.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Who are some of the mentors and people that have really kind of helped you out along the way as you sort of rose as a designer?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Besides my high school teachers, there was one particular person that actually I grew up with. I&#8217;ve known him since first grade and I remember, he could draw really, really well in grammar school. So I was kind of drawn to him and we remained friends over the years. He is a graphic designer and at the time he was working for Frankel, it&#8217;s an ad agency in Chicago. But he was also freelancing for Burrell Communications. So I would go to his design studio and he&#8217;d let me just kind of hang out and work on some of the stuff he was working on here and there and kind of built my skills but then there was one particular project that stood out and it was a media kit for the Sprite Voltron ad campaign and it featured rap artists like Fat Joe, Goodie Mob, Common and Mack 10. So it was really cool to work on that project, and at that time, we made stock art. Stock art was really, really expensive at that time, so I remember they wanted like a sky created for like a Voltron thing and with stars, and instead of buying that stock art that was like $300.00, I like hand-placed each star in the background.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s on my Instagram page if you want to take a look at it but yeah. I&#8217;m super proud of that project. That was in &#8217;98 actually, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
That&#8217;s where that visual merchandising muscle kicked in. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;I just got to go and do it.&#8221; That was a really &#8230; God, I remember that campaign too. That was dope. They had two of them, there was one that had male rappers with Voltron and then I remember there was one with women rappers that was more like &#8230; I think like kung-fu based?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t remember. I didn&#8217;t work on that one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
I think they both might have been kung &#8230; Okay, there was one I remember that had &#8230; Oh god, who was on it? I think it was Eve, Angie Martinez. I don&#8217;t remember who else was part of the fighting squad but the last person they fought against was Roxanne Shante. Like they unmasked the villain and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh.&#8221; I remember those, those were really good.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Is there any advice about like design or about your career that&#8217;s really stuck with you over the years?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
I would say &#8230; You know what? My teacher back in art school, she said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t work for free to get a deposit.&#8221; You know what? It&#8217;s advice, don&#8217;t work for free, don&#8217;t give your work away. However at the same time, like currently, there is a project that I&#8217;m working on and it&#8217;s a newly created non-profit organization and it&#8217;s a school, they&#8217;re teaching kids with disabilities how to do automotive and carpentry and stuff like that. So I think it&#8217;s okay to do a pro bono project every once in a while for a good cause that means something to you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Yeah. What is it that you&#8217;re obsessed with these days?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Sleep. Sorry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
See, I thought you were going to say the dog. No, sleep &#8230; I mean look sleep I think is great, don&#8217;t get me wrong. I&#8217;m probably going to take a nap after this interview but sleep, I totally, totally understand that.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Yeah. Actually my dog, my dog, I&#8217;m not obsessed with him but he is my inspiration. There is this quote that says, &#8220;To grow creatively, you must give yourself time to play.&#8221; So my dog is my hobby. He&#8217;s my play. It&#8217;s humorous dog photography and it&#8217;s kind of my inspiration and kind of way to get away from things and have some fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Now speaking of having fun, there&#8217;s one thing that you had shared with me before we recorded. I have to bring it up because I think it&#8217;s just so dope. You were a house music backup singer once upon a time.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
In another lifetime.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
In another lifetime. Please tell me about that because you sent a YouTube video and I can put it in the show notes if people want to check it out but like I noticed it was like, oh it was like Frankie Knuckles Productions? I have to know how did this happen.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually I was dating Jamie Principle at the time. I was right out of high school, so it [inaudible 00:37:57] era. Yeah. Yeah, and so he needed a backup singer and at the time he was making music actually out of his home and we went to the studio and I did my part and at that time there was no sampling. So that part that you hear? I&#8217;m saying over and over and I had to say it perfectly, all the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Yeah. That time was a lot of fun. It was a lot of fun. We performed in a lot of Chicago clubs and went to New York and performed. That was a whole nother lifetime.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Now were you just on this one record or id you do others?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Just that one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Okay. I mean that&#8217;s quite a claim to fame though. That&#8217;s really dope.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it was really cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Is there anything that you would like to do in your career that you haven&#8217;t done yet?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Yes. Actually I want to do kind of a pivot. I guess this would be kind of a career/hobby thing but I would love to get into doing newborn photography. [inaudible 00:39:03] kind of my hobby and I absolutely love newborn photography, so I&#8217;m kind of working on really perfecting my craft in that and that&#8217;s something that I see myself doing somewhere down the road.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Do you feel creatively satisfied now?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
I do. I do. I actually absolutely love what I do. I absolutely love campaigns, the ad campaigns that I&#8217;m working on currently and doing some really exciting projects with a Chicago PR firm. Yes, I love what I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Now after &#8230; I mean I know you&#8217;ve had a storied history as a designer, both with your studio as well as this kind of physical design work with visual merchandising, but when you look back over all of that, especially with being in the game as long as you have, what&#8217;s next? Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
I think I want to focus more on &#8230; I guess I love the ad campaigns. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ll get away from non-profits. Right now I&#8217;m working on some things like the Chicago Department of Public Health and we&#8217;re also creating like a food bank app. So I want to do more things like that. It&#8217;s advocacy but not so much non-profit. Like you said earlier, just seeing stuff come to life and seeing it kind of plastered all over the place is really exciting. I want to get more into that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
Well Lisa, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
My website is Lisa Cain Design, that&#8217;s L-I-S-A C-A-I-N Design, or on Instagram at Lisa Cain Design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well Lisa Cain, I want to thank you so much, so, so much for coming on the show. When I reached out to you initially, I really wanted to have you on to talk about just the fact that you&#8217;ve had your studio for 20 years and the work that you&#8217;ve done. Because I think that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s so rare that we really hear about from black women. I don&#8217;t know if I mentioned this when I initially reached out to you but I had saw you in I think it was a Graphic Design USA like people to watch for one year.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry: </b><br>
I was like &#8230; I had put your name down on my outreach list, like I&#8217;m going to get around back, I&#8217;m going to come back to Lisa one day, and I&#8217;m glad now to have been able to do so and to talk with you and learn more about you and of course share your story of how you have come up in the design industry throughout the years. I think it&#8217;s really inspiring and hopefully for people that are listening, they get something out of this too to know that they can do &#8230; They can sort of accomplish their dreams and design like you have. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Cain:</b><br>
Thank you for having me.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s no secret that I&#8217;m a big fan of video games, so when I learned about Derrick  Fields and Waking Oni Games from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozqhc7YXd3M" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Wholesome Direct Indie Game Showcase</a> back in June, I had to have him on the show.</p>
<p>We talked about how 2021 has been going so far &#8212; a new gig and a new baby! &#8212; and he spoke on why he created his own gaming studio and gave some history behind the studio&#8217;s first title: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI1gfJOmJHs" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Onsen Master</a>. Derrick also shared his inspiration behind getting into game programming, the indie gaming scene for underrepresented designers, and he gave some great advice for anyone looking to start making their own titles. If there&#8217;s a video game out there that you would love to see, hopefully Derrick&#8217;s story will inspire you to create it!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
My name is Derrick Fields. I&#8217;m the founder and studio director or game director of Waking Oni Games, also the assistant professor at Northwestern University, teaching 3D modeling and game design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I&#8217;d ask how your 2021 has been so far, but I mean that sounds like a pretty big announcement right there, teaching at Northwestern. Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Thank you. 2021 has been a series of transitions. Formerly, before leaping into Northwestern this year, I was the lead artists over at Uplift Games which is responsible for a really popular Roblox game by the name of Adopt Me! And so it was a significant portion of my life being able to create a title that contributed to kids. But now, I get to teach some of those children in an academic setting and all the while working on games and creating projects for myself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. So I guess as you settle in to your new role, do you have any other plans that you might have had for the rest of this year?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
One is in the oven or I should say, I&#8217;m thinking of a pun that doesn&#8217;t sound so morbid. I&#8217;m not sure like in the oven. The package is on the way. And my partner and I are expecting a little one in November and so it&#8217;s been a lot of at home, nesting and preparation as we invite a small human into our lives or another small human into our lives, I should say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Congratulations. Look at you.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
A new job, new human. 2021 sounds like it&#8217;s your year.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
It has been my year. I am very thankful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me about the Northwestern gig. How did you get that?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Sure. So through some work and prior to working at Uplift, I had always maintained doing some freelance work and working on side projects and other projects. It&#8217;s like simultaneously balancing a lot of plates there. The one that came along was through a friend and colleague who was creating a grant-funded project out of Northwestern. And they were, at the time, the assistant professor who held the position. And so I have done some talks with him and his class and met some of the students to discuss aspects of game design and 3D modeling. And a little later on, this individual ended up leaving the position for another university out of state. And so I was very surprised to see an email arrived from Northwestern asking if I would be interested in interviewing for the position.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s when I carried on the discussion with the same individual who was leaving the position. And he was very excited that they ended up reaching out off of this recommendation. And so from there, it was a lot of paperwork. I did a job talk which was new to me, which feels like giving a TED Talk to other teachers, faculty and students and to discuss the aspects of why I would enjoy teaching, what I hope to bring to the space and sharing bits about my past. And everything worked out for the better, so I&#8217;d be starting with them in September.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Is this your first foray into academia.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve always been on the periphery of the space doing other conversations. I&#8217;ve done some talks over at the University of Chicago in their Media and Arts Design Lab, I believe the name is. So yeah, always tangential to this space, but yeah, this will be the first time that I&#8217;ll be responsible for my own class, my own syllabi and a handful of students in that capacity. Prior too, I am a board member of the Japanese Arts Foundation where, before we transitioned to this quarantine and pandemic state, I was teaching how to draw anime classes to people of all ages. And so education has always been a really important component. And so I&#8217;ve been very fortunate to be able to provide that in certain spaces and this really just became the crux of it all.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Very nice. That should be a really good gig. I don&#8217;t know, forgive me for saying gig, I used to be a musician years ago, so I call every job a gig.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Absolutely. I&#8217;d use that too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But that should be a really good thing to settle into, especially because I remember just when I was in school 20+ years ago, goodness, this kind of stuff wasn&#8217;t really taught. I didn&#8217;t go to an art school. I just went to a regular liberal art school. I know now technology has allowed for so many different types of things to be taught. So it&#8217;s really good that you&#8217;re going to be able to teach this, because I would imagine, this is probably you passing that knowledge on from your own personal experience with 3D design.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Absolutely, hopefully, being able to lens an avenue for students who are interested in that space and give them direct feedback based on my experience within the industry, I think is going to be really great and I&#8217;m excited to be able to share that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Let&#8217;s talk about Waking Oni Games. How did you decide to start your own studio? Where did that come from?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Right. So I was, I think, definitely mid store at the beginning of some freelance work. And some years after, I&#8217;d say, I don&#8217;t even know at this point, but definitely some time after, would be a more accurate description, some time after university and not finding the career placement that I wanted in games that I had grown to expect, I started mingling with other friends. And we got to brainstorming about what would it be like to create our own project and what type of experience could we get out of that just with limited resources. And at this time, it was just myself, my friend and a friend of his and so just the three of us, whom is now a very great friend of mine as well.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
The three of us, we were brainstorming, we played around and I said, &#8220;We should,&#8221; so pausing real quick to rewind, just a tad, but Spirited Away, the Ghibli film directed by Hayao Miyazaki is one of my favorite movies and has left a lasting impression on me. And so I had always imagined what it might be like to play a game that takes place in an onsen or hot spring as what we might know it as. And so that was really the origin of the idea and the motivation to wanting to create something for myself. And so with that came the need to have an LLC formation and go through all the legalities to make sure that we can be eligible to receive various licenses and things like that. And so then Waking Oni Games was invented or generated.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So how long has it been since you started?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
It has existed, I would say, from the signing of legal documents for six or seven years and Onsen Master was a hobby project throughout that time period. And so it wasn&#8217;t until two years ago, I believe, two almost three years ago that we decided to take that project and actually pursue it as something of an actual game, a game that we wanted to share with audiences, a game that we wanted to put up on Kickstarter for crowdfunding and see what the interest would be. And so very thankful that in September of the year that we did Kickstarter 2019, that it went successfully.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Thank you. Since then, we continued working, of course, maintaining full time jobs and any other commitments outside of that to get this game out to audiences that were interested in it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me a little bit more about Onsen Master for those that might not be familiar with the concept, you mentioned as being hot springs. Talk to me about what the game is about.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Sure. I&#8217;ll say I can&#8217;t explain it without getting past the elevator pitch part. So it&#8217;s a hot spring strategy game about healing. You play as a character who has been tasked with managing their own bath house, their own hot spring. And that managing component comes by way of various customers who will arrive to your hot spring. And they each have a different ingredient that they desire. And so it is your job as the player to sort them into one of four baths that are located in the hot spring, locating the ingredient that matches to their needs and then mixing it up and tossing it in there with them. And so you play this mix and match game while moving through different environments that may change in scale or layout.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it sounds like it can also be partially educational as well because I&#8217;m assuming this is based off of how onsens actually operate.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
In a very broad stroke, some details are true, some details are not. I would say there isn&#8217;t the component of somebody procuring an ingredient for you and lofting out into the bath. What is true to reality is that when you go to an onsen, a hot spring is a naturally heated water and there are many towns and prefectures in Japan, across Japan that have onsen and bathhouses that are, I should say, sento. So there&#8217;s a difference there. Sento or bathhouse is artificially heated and onsen or hot spring is naturally heated. And so it&#8217;s like small detail. So those are the types of things that really what I hope players will get other experiences that when they play Onsen Master, I hope that it will spark interest in wanting to find out what real onsen like or what real sento are like and learn about those.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Another component in the game that I hope will spark interest in players is, as you&#8217;re playing through the game, you&#8217;re visited by these spirits called yokai. And they are essentially personifications of the unexplainable. If we hear a creek in the night, we might say, &#8220;Oh, that is a creek monster that is responsible for making this noise.&#8221; And so when you play Onsen Master, not only will various customers be arriving, but these various spirits that take the form of one that looks like a turtle, one that looks like a skeleton and so on will also be visiting the onsen. And they&#8217;ll come bearing with a couple antics to them. One might spill water all over the place, for example, or one might try to come after you and grab you as another thing that you have to deal with while managing these different customers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It definitely sounds like you put a lot of thought and care into the game and with all of these different mechanics and such. It sounds really cool.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Thank you. It&#8217;s definitely my experience in &#8230; I&#8217;ve spent a lot of my time learning about Japanese history and culture and mythology and so wanting to build a game that can spark that same interest and hopefully lead others to wanting to educate themselves about what yokai are, for example, is really the desire out of that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think anyone that has kids under 15 probably knows what yokai are because they&#8217;ve seen Yo-kai Watch or something like that. It&#8217;s amazing how much, I don&#8217;t even want to call it American shows because they&#8217;re just Japanese shows that have been in many cases dubbed over, but there&#8217;s so much anime from Japan that gets dumped over that now are, in some cases, cultural staples in this country like Pokemon, Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, etcetera, but then there&#8217;s a lot of newer shows like Yo-kai Watch and others that that&#8217;s how people tend to find out about Japanese culture through these different shows and through videogames as well. I remember playing videogames as a kid and that&#8217;s how I really learned about small things about Japanese culture. I&#8217;d probably say I got more from anime, but videogames definitely played a part in that as well, even through localization.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
And I really agree with that, we&#8217;ve got to say the sort of subtext to Waking Oni Games and Onsen Master and the projects that are to follow that are intended to explore specifically the intersection of Japanese and African American culture because there are many BIPOC individuals that have had their experience in childhood and through their adulthood, tangent to all sorts of pop culture and media. But mine specifically intersects a lot with Japanese culture and continues to even in my adulthood, being a board member at the Japanese Arts Foundation and teaching anime drawing classes. And so wanting to explore that and hopefully articulate that at my age now has led me to learn that there are many Black individuals that also have that sort of intersection.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
And wanting to find representation in the media that doesn&#8217;t necessarily originate from our culture can be a challenge depending on the circumstance, but it has led to other outcomes. And things like when we watched Dragon Ball Z, this is why we might code Piccolo as Black. Having those shared experiences with other Black individuals is something that&#8217;s very specific. And so with Onsen Master and with other projects, I would really like to continue to explore that conversation and build content that is derived of anime and the pop culture that surrounds the medium, but also insert people that look like us and be able to center that conversation a little bit more.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right around this time last year on the show, we had Arthell Isom. He&#8217;s a Black guy who owns an anime studio actually over in Japan called D&#8217;ART Shtajio. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard of this.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Yes, I&#8217;ve heard of this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So a lot of what you&#8217;re talking about, it&#8217;s funny because this interview was literally about a year from now, a year ago from now. And what you&#8217;re saying mirrors a lot of what he also said in terms of working within the culture but also working to bridge that gap and tell these stories in a way that is not only, I would say, culturally relevant but also is appealing to customers. So that makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
I was just going to say hello to Arthell in a year ago. I wish we could cross paths, but I do. I love a lot of the work that he and his studio are doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So what do you think it is that people misunderstand when it comes to being a game designer?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Sure. I think the term game design can be a little bit obfuscated. If you aren&#8217;t readily in school and learning about what the role might entail. It isn&#8217;t just thinking about all how one might want to create a cool thing and just enacting on it, it can become a lot more granular than that. And there has to be, and I can explain further, but there has to be a willingness to want to pursue getting very nitty gritty about details but also hoping to drive and create certain or, I should say, elicit certain experiences out of the audience that you intend to interact with your media.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
And so taking that to a game, let&#8217;s say, Mario or Final Fantasy, any of those things, everything that you do in that game that you don&#8217;t necessarily notice per se, the reason why the text, the font looks a certain way or the reason why when Mario jumps, a very specific height or just help conveniently placed that height and that distance from when you jump off a ledge and land on a platform is just so far away or just close enough that it creates ease or difficulty. Those types of things are thought about by somebody else and labored over constantly to make sure that you as the player can have ease of access or have experiences in difficulty but not difficulty that&#8217;s hard enough that turns you away from the game and makes you not want to play it.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
There has to be that balance in wanting to engineer an experience that maybe makes you feel just close enough to a reward that you are now driven to want to achieve it. I will say that that&#8217;s one component of game design. There are many ways to create experiences and engineer outcomes in a way that you are trying to impart that on somebody. I&#8217;ve been trying to stray away from falling into just spouting off nothing but buzzwords, but it really is. It really is that. You&#8217;re thinking about the player. You&#8217;re thinking about what type of experience you would like to give them while also wanting to share entertainment and fun and cool things happening.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
And maybe it&#8217;s swords, maybe it&#8217;s horses, or fairies or robots, but also wanting to make sure that your vision for it all is concise among those components that you&#8217;re trying to sort out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like there&#8217;s a lot of testing that has to happen with game design. It&#8217;s not just as a simple as Mario Maker or something like that. But even that, I think also, I love how Nintendo has really abstracted a big part of the game design process when it comes to a game like Mario Maker or this new game that they have called like Game Garage or something like that. They make it seemed pretty easy because you&#8217;re just dragging and dropping sprites onto a canvas, but there&#8217;s so much logic and testing that has to go behind that to make sure that it&#8217;s playable, it&#8217;s enjoyable, hopefully that you&#8217;re guiding the player along and you&#8217;re making sure that they&#8217;re having an enjoyable experience as well.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Absolutely. And what I really love about both of those software is that they create accessibility to individuals who may otherwise not have the background in programming or have the background in 3D modeling or 2D art or everything else that comes along with creating a game. There&#8217;s so many resources there that they can, as you said, drag and drop and immediately get a reaction on whether or not it works. And I think those types of systems are great because it allows burgeoning creators and players to be able to explore those limitations and hopefully build something out of them and test, test, test away.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, this might be a bit of a easy questions. I think anyone that&#8217;s grown up in the United States in the past 30+ years has been exposed to videogames, but tell me about your history with games. Were you always into design in videogames? Tell me about that?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Yeah. My experience in games has definitely been lifelong. I grew up with Nintendo and Sega and Sega Dreamcast and etcetera, leading all the way up to now, but wanting to contribute to games wasn&#8217;t always a component that &#8230; It wasn&#8217;t always something that I had considered. There was a disconnect. You bought games or you receive games as a gift. You loaded them up, you played them to the end of the credits and then you look for the next one. But I, for a long time, never really bridged the gap that somebody else was behind a computer, somebody had labored over this to give the experience that I&#8217;m now having in my bedroom or on the couch.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
When that happened, I think that&#8217;s when things really, really shifted for me and wanting to envision, creating worlds that I could interact and that other people could interact and what that might be like. Prior to that, my background has always been in drawing and illustration. And so I used to always want to create comic books and create cartoons. And so I spent a lot of time drawing and imagining worlds and imagining characters. Getting into high school, I think that&#8217;s when things started to transition and I understood that there was a pathway to being able to create these games that I was playing on PlayStation 1 and 2 at the time. And then I started to reengage with these worlds and imagine them as virtual spaces and seek out opportunities as we start getting into university in how I might be able to achieve that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember, like you said, growing up in Nintendo and Sega, especially if you were a child of the &#8217;80s. I would say even like a child of the early &#8217;90s. It was inescapable. I don&#8217;t even know if it&#8217;s really so much now because kids have the internet to contend with and social media and stuff. But it&#8217;s hard to really understate just how much of a vice grip Nintendo had over your childhood. If you were like a child of the &#8217;80s or the early &#8217;90s, there was television, there were videogames, there was breakfast cereal, there was clothes. You really could not escape it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I would say Nintendo probably more so, I&#8217;d say probably more so than Sega, but even still, as both of those systems grew in popularity, you really could not avoid the Console Wars, I should say. You really had to be in one camp or another. And games often would come out for one and then come out for the other one later. And it&#8217;s just amazing how much of that really is, because of course, the foundation for what we see now in gaming, but also what it&#8217;s done is it&#8217;s helped to create a whole new generation now of game designers and people that want to work in games and comics and similar fields like that.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Absolutely. And I got to ask, you mentioned the Console War, which side did you find yourself on, whether intentional or unintentional growing up?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So definitely Team Nintendo 100%. I had a Gameboy I had a regular. I remember when the NDS came out in &#8217;80, I think it came out in &#8217;85, I think, &#8217;85, &#8217;86 and I got it me and my brother. I have an older brother, we got it. And the cartridge was like the combination of Super Mario Brothers, Duck Hunt, so you put it in and then you choose which one you wanted to play and whatever. It was Nintendo for a long time. My cousin, I have a first cousin named Jeff and he had a Genesis. And so I got to go over his house and play a little bit of Sega. I always thought the three button controller was really weird. I didn&#8217;t quite understand that like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go back to Nintendo where the buttons have an even amount of numbers. That makes more sense to me.&#8221; I&#8217;ve been trying to do that. But yeah, mostly Nintendo. I think I&#8217;ve had every Nintendo System except the 64 and the Virtual Boy. I don&#8217;t think anyone really had the Virtual Boy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember when the Virtual Boy came out because it was around, I want to say &#8217;94, &#8217;95. And the Walmart in our town had one as a display. So I did get to play it, but I&#8217;ve never had one. But yeah, I was firmly, firmly Team Nintendo until probably around college and then I diverted to Dreamcast. Although, well, someone of my friends&#8217; floors had a 64 and we just play GoldenEye all the time.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
You got to play GoldenEye. Absolutely. My upbringing did find itself seeded in the Sega route and it was a bit of the opposite for me where my first cousin was the one who had the Super Nintendo and &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
&#8230; the Virtual Boy. And I will not spend any time just discussing how VR has been an exploratory tangent to videogames for so long with something like the Virtual Boy and seeing where it is now to a device like the Oculus. But Sega led me to Sega Dreamcast and all of those, unfortunately short-lived experiences on a very cool system. I headed down the path of PlayStation and I got to say it I probably never looked back. I&#8217;ve loved PlayStation ever since.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What was the game that hooked you into gaming?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Final Fantasy IX. I definitely played plenty of games prior to that, but Final Fantasy IX and just the PlayStation 1 console in general, I think, is bookmarked as a significant part of my life. I think I played tons and tons of games on the PlayStation. And there were so many when you think of the time period, this is why I love PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 especially, but when you think of the time period of both of these consoles, there&#8217;s so much development and exploration on both of the consoles from the beginning of their release to the end of their cycle when the next generation of that platform is coming out.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
And so looking at it a title that released on the beginning of PlayStation and looking at a title that released at the end of PlayStation 1&#8217;s time period is significant. There&#8217;s really vast differences. You find games that explored with voiceover and games that have walls and walls of text, games with sprites, games with Final Fantasy stuff, blocky 3D bodies and everything else. So it was a time. It was a time that all these different companies were trying out new things. They&#8217;re always trying new things. There&#8217;s always iteration and development, but something felt really cool about that transition to 3D and everybody trying to figure that out at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The game that hooked me into gaming, there&#8217;s a few. I think if I think about what was on the regular Nintendo, the game that probably hooked me was, it&#8217;s a very rare choice, there was this board game on NES called Anticipation. Have you heard of it?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
No, I haven&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look up Anticipation NES on YouTube. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s probably videos of it, but I remember I would check that game out from what we had a Blockbuster adventure, but we had back home this little place called Movie Gallery. And I would check out Anticipation or I get my mom to check out Anticipation, let me correct that, to check out Anticipation every two weeks or so and keep playing it. And it&#8217;s essentially like a, I don&#8217;t know, Pictionary-style game &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Got it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; where it&#8217;s like for players. You&#8217;re either a trumpet, an ice cream cone, a pair of pink high-heeled shoes or teddy bear.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
I see that now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And there&#8217;s these different board configurations. And you roll the die and you land on a certain color. And then there&#8217;s like this pencil that just starts drawing and you have to guess what it is that it&#8217;s drawing. And usually like at the beginning levels, they&#8217;ll give you some sort of hints like the number of letters or something. So you get a sense of it or the category, I should say, that&#8217;s drawing. But then as you go up to the higher boards, there&#8217;s no clues, no category. It just starts drawing and you have to figure it out and you have to get four of the different colors to proceed to the next round. And I loved that game. I think my brother hated it, but I loved that game. And that game sort of hooked me into like, &#8220;Oh, this is cool. This is like a board game, but it&#8217;s on videogames.&#8221; That blew my mind.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then I&#8217;d say also, was this NES or SNES? So this is SNES. The SNES game that hooked me was also a Final Fantasy title. It&#8217;s Final Fantasy II which is Final Fantasy IV in the Japanese line of games. But that game, it&#8217;s sunk its fangs into me deep.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it is to this day, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s my favorite Final Fantasy title, it&#8217;s top two. It&#8217;s top two definitely. I love that game like no other. Because that game aside from just the story aspect of it and you had the double-crossing character and all this sort of stuff. Also it&#8217;s my foray into music. I really liked the music and tried to learn how to play the music. I have little keyboard or whatever. And I would record it on my little tape recorder and then go back and try to play it on my keyboard and stuff like that. But Final Fantasy II and Anticipation. Those were the two games that got me into games, just like, &#8220;Oh, man, this is such a great, great medium to tell stories in.&#8221; Because Final Fantasy II, I had never run across a story like that before.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s like on this thing and you play as these people, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; It was my first role-playing game too. It was great. Absolutely great.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a really great story in it. I think that&#8217;s why Final Fantasy IX sits with me so well. And again, there were plenty of games that I definitely interacted with. Leading up to that, I fondly remember playing Rocket Knight on Sega which was a really cool side scrolling, incredibly difficult game. Wow. I think a lot of us have memories with titles like Aladdin and The Lion King and Animaniacs on that system as well, but it wasn&#8217;t until PlayStation and Final Fantasy IX that, again similar to what you said about for the character, the story, the very imaginative world that is being set in front of you. And it just raises the bar on, &#8220;Oh, this is what fantasy can be when &#8230;&#8221; Prior to this, it&#8217;s just been Dungeons and Dragons and medieval shows and medieval fantasy, but that presented an entirely new world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Or you&#8217;re like Mario or Sonic, you&#8217;re just playing this linear left to right, up and down sort of thing. And Final Fantasy really came along and just like, I don&#8217;t even want to say it shattered expectations, it certainly shattered my perception of what can be done now with the medium. And my God, that was 1992 I think. Wow. It&#8217;s amazing what they were able to accomplish with so little back then, just in terms of the technology that tells us the vast story and with such few elements. I think now with computers and with software and everything, there&#8217;s no telling what you can create, even just on your own without having to do it through a big studio.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
We have so many possibilities now. And I think developers AAA all the way to indie, we continue to share and show reinvention within this space. And I love marveling at it. Every time there&#8217;s a new game trailer or game event that is coming with a handful of announcements, I cannot help but tune in because I know it&#8217;s going to come up with some indie game or some other studio that&#8217;s revealing an experience that you just didn&#8217;t imagine could happen with a controller in your hand or with something like an Oculus VR headset.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m trying to get more into Oculus. I got one fairly recently. And I&#8217;ve been just playing around with it, sitting on the couch or playing around the living room, but I need to get more into the VR experiences because I know there&#8217;s probably some really great stuff there.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
I&#8217;m trying. I&#8217;m trying as well. And I think right now felt like a time that was okay to leap in because the space is starting to hit its stride and starting &#8230; It&#8217;s hit its stride and it&#8217;s definitely developing and creating all these cool experiences now that the devices have so much fidelity to them which was always limitation leading up to what we have nowadays. Now, there&#8217;s three, four different pieces of hardware that you can acquire and create that experience for yourself and dedicate an entire room to VR if you wanted to. So I too have an Oculus and I&#8217;m dabbling on the store. I got to say, I&#8217;m very interested in a title called Demeo, I believe is the name where you are &#8230; Essentially, my favorite part of D&#038;D where you have the D&#038;D dungeon, you have your character sheet, but you have a miniature representation of your D&#038;D dungeon in front of you and you&#8217;re playing through this campaign with little figurines that are an indication of your character and your party members.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Well, there&#8217;s a VR version of that now and I got to say the way I&#8217;m passively just recruiting people to want to play that game, some handful of time from now is my side mission, but it looks very interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you went to school for design. You went to Columbus College of Art and Design. You eventually graduated from Kent State. When you think back on your education studying design, how much of that has really helped you out now, as a game designer?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
I think some of it came from not getting the experience that I was hoping to have and some of it came from gaining way more than I even thought could come of it. Getting into university at that time, the discoverability of spaces that were teaching games was still new. There was, I think, a lot of advertisements around this time for the art institute and going to the Art Institute of Pittsburgh or whichever state [inaudible 00:36:35] that it had and trying to explore, &#8220;Where am I going to get that? Where am I going to get the experience? At the risk of loans and everything else, where will I find my seat in all of that?&#8221; And so it&#8217;s bizarre. I remember going to the Art Institute of Chicago or sorry the Art Institute of Pittsburgh for a preview. They invited &#8230; You could register for a summer preview camp and stay there for, I think it was like three days or three or four days or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
But the idea was it was to introduce students to the campus, their experience, get them hands-on experience and playing around with game engines and tantalizing or giving the movie preview of what game development might be. Instead, what that experience for me was connecting with a bunch of very cool students, but ultimately never getting that experience. I remember distinctly we went into this game lab and the teacher who was supposed to be providing preview of education on Unreal Engine was absent. They were just gone and nobody knew where they were.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
And so the entire class just played Unreal Tournament. And that&#8217;s what we did. I remember thinking, &#8220;This is cool, but this isn&#8217;t what I came here for.&#8221; So I was so frustrated because I thought I came in, the veil was yanked away in what I was supposed to expect when I got there. So yeah, I ultimately went to Columbus College of Art and Design. I pursued illustration. I said to myself that I&#8217;m going to find entry into games, doing concept art. I still was feeling really keen about 3D modeling and wanting to do something with that. And so I remember asking my advisor if I could switch to 3D modeling because I wanted to pursue game development. And they said, &#8220;Well, we only have 3D animation. We don&#8217;t support game development here.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
And I thought it was another moment that was disillusioned and I&#8217;m going, &#8220;Oh, man, am I thinking about this wrong? There&#8217;s got to be other spaces where people are really driving for this outcome that they too want to create games, that they too want to 3D model and rig characters for videogames. I love Pixar films, but that&#8217;s not where I&#8217;m trying to land.&#8221; And so I transferred to Shawnee State University. That is where I was introduced to this really amazing game development program that was still in its earliest stages, but the community of teachers and students really brought an experience together that continues to thrive today.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
I think, if you go to their website, they&#8217;re doing all sorts of really cool in-university events to support their students and give them that experience that I think a lot of us were going for at that time. So shout outs to them. I ultimately ended up transferring yet another time and graduating out of Kent State University with a degree and I don&#8217;t remember the name, but I graduated there and here we are with some gaps and other stories in between there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I would say though, what you&#8217;ve mentioned though is actually, at least from my experience with talking with others on this show, it&#8217;s pretty common because the technology in the industry changes so quickly that schools aren&#8217;t really able to keep up and be able to have curriculum and stuff like that. And then, as you say, because it&#8217;s so new, different schools are going to have different just types of programs. It&#8217;s not really standardized. You can go to any college in the country and learn English, but you can&#8217;t go to any college in the country and learn game design. Different programs are definitely going to be just better suited to what&#8217;s currently in the industry. They might have a better alumni program. There could be a whole bunch of other things. There&#8217;s a guy I had on the show. This was, I don&#8217;t know, maybe 2017 or so. His name is Michael Hollander. Do you remember the &#8217;90s show, VR Troopers?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He was the Black guy on VR Troopers.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Oh, cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He&#8217;s a game designer now.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Oh, wow. What a track record. That show is amazing. And there&#8217;s a side note, but the genre of tokusatsu, VR Troopers, Power Rangers, Kamen Rider, all of that stuff, there&#8217;s a really cool story, I think I saw it on Netflix, just the whole process of how that gets localized and arrives to us and then this relationship that we have with, I think it&#8217;s the &#8230; I forgot the company that licensed Power Rangers here, but they have a specific relationship with the original source that they are allowed to take the fight scenes and reedit it to add in actors from the US and-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s Haim Saban, right?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Yes, that&#8217;s the one. Thank you. If you end up watching shows like VR Troopers, shows like Kamen Rider or Power Rangers, the original content has a completely different story, but the battles will be the same in a lot of ways or they&#8217;ll be &#8230; You&#8217;ll recognize certain battles or certain confrontations, experience in the US version. And so cool thing there, but that&#8217;s amazing. What a life to live to go from VR Troopers to game designer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But a lot of what I remember him saying from that interview was about how he had to jump from place to place to really almost cobble together the skills that he knew he was going to need once he got on in the industry because one school maybe didn&#8217;t have this or another school had it. So it&#8217;s that process of transferring. And for him, it sounded like he just learned more working in the field as opposed to going to school to prepare to be a designer.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
I relate to that in a lot of ways that I think in that time period, when you said that there were a lot of universities trying to figure out how to do it correctly, I think similar to who you just mentioned &#8230; I&#8217;m sorry, what was the name again?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Michael Hollander.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Michael. Thank you. Similar to Michael&#8217;s experience, we weren&#8217;t the only ones knowing that. I think we could see that universities were also trying to figure this out and we&#8217;re trying to figure out where can we get the best education with limited resources as far as research goes. It&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s a university out here just being championed by others in the industry saying, &#8220;I graduated from here and this is the space that taught me the best.&#8221; Everybody was flying by the seat of their pants. Unfortunately, for some people who are seeking education in that space, you flew by the seat at the risk of your wallet, so there&#8217;s that aspect there and you landed somewhere and you said, &#8220;This is close. So maybe this is the one that I&#8217;ll go with because I don&#8217;t want to go through registration again.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He said the same thing. It can get expensive doing all that transferring from school to school, especially because it&#8217;s such a specialized field.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you freelanced for a few companies after you graduated from Kent State. And it looked like your first big long-term game design gig, you&#8217;re at William Chyr Studio, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right. And touching back to what we were just talking about, after graduating, it was still trying to find placement in the industry, trying to figure out what to do with my portfolio and learning how it stood up against other candidates that were getting positions in 3D modeling and so on. And so that process led me to having to, again, reevaluate where I was and pursue continued learning, taking to YouTube and books and everything else to continue to make sure that I&#8217;m developing content that was on par with what the industry was asking for.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
I had a lot of difficulty trying to find career placement. And so this is where I began to seek dabbling in creating my own world, playing around with engines like Unity, but constantly going to events and networking with other individuals whom were already in there and already creating and developing projects, sharing my portfolio and ultimately landing freelance gigs from time to time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you remember most about working at that studio?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
With William Chyr and the other team members, everything was fun and it was great. We mostly communicated digitally because people were across time zones and different locations in the US. It was very just casual, &#8220;Hey, can you model this or animate this thing.&#8221; And I had a lot of fun being able to contribute to manifold garden, which was the title that ended up releasing. And so my primary role there was creating a lot of environment objects. There are a lot of doors that I did the animations for and some other objects that are throughout that space.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I know we&#8217;re recording this right now at the time when there&#8217;s a lot of news actually in the videogame industry, particularly around certain company known as Activision Blizzard which people may know from some of the big games that they put out like &#8230; Oh, God, I&#8217;m blanking. Like Crash Bandicoot and things of that nature. I&#8217;m curious, as a Black man that&#8217;s in this industry, have you ever been privy to any discrimination just working at studios or showing your portfolio or things like that? What sort of things were you surprised about when you really started to get out in the industry?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
I think most of all, that came down to finding an entry level position, trying to weigh the quality of my work against other potential candidates for positions that I was applying for. And as an outcome to that, not finding a lot of opportunities where I felt like I was good enough to apply to a lot of spaces. I received no a lot, a lot when I was at the beginning of trying to become a 3D artist. And I would oftentimes turn to other portfolio websites, spaces like Art Station, what we have today, to look at the quality of my work and again weigh that against what other people were doing, other people in roles that I was trying to apply to.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
It just never made sense to me why I wasn&#8217;t even getting past the interview phase. I tried going to job fairs and sharing portfolio and receiving very poker-faced feedback on the content that I was sharing. And then would watch peers and other people who had also exited university game positions. And it wasn&#8217;t fair to myself or to them to want to go, &#8220;Well, now I got to look at their portfolio and see what did they do and what did I not do.&#8221; It&#8217;s never fun to have to draw those types of comparisons, but I couldn&#8217;t help it at that time because I wanted so badly to be able to be in this space and really, really had this dream that I can &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
The veil has very, very much been lifted to since then, but I used to dream so much of sitting next to a colleague in a game studio and working on 3D models and discussing which piece of armor should this character have or stuff like that. Back then, it was the labor of videogames, was something that was romanticized. I, not only has that but the space in general, continue to receive their scrutiny that it should to redefine what it means to work within that space, that creating games and creating experiences should not come at the sacrifice of your time in a way that is a detriment to you by way of how individuals used to romanticize overworking themselves in videogames.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
And that is still a narrative that we&#8217;re trying to separate from and relating to what you said with Activision Blizzard. The constant harassment that women and other marginalized folks experienced within these industries are other things that continue to need the scrutiny that they are receiving in order to hopefully get the change that we&#8217;re all asking for.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if this is a good follow up for this, but I&#8217;ll just throw it out there. Do you think that that is why we&#8217;re starting to see so many indie developers and games out there because they&#8217;re just not meshing with this AAA title, big game studio kind of culture, they&#8217;re just striking out on their own and doing their own thing?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Yeah, I think there&#8217;s many layers to why indie developers create the games that they do. One is absolutely they themselves could not find placement within the industry. One is, we&#8217;re not ever fairly represented within the industry. One is the experiences that were being set on store shelves, weren&#8217;t the experiences that they wanted to have and that, just the word experience can mean so many different things in terms of gameplay or narrative or style and aesthetic. I think all of those things motivate indie developers to create their own games. And I think, just as you said, that&#8217;s absolutely why there&#8217;s so many of us out here now creating cool things.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
And now there&#8217;s so many more avenues to be able to access the experiences that they are delivering with platforms like itch.io for people who just want to create something small or fairly sizable and distribute that out to their own audience. We now have publishers and platforms that vocalize their support for indies and now have a much more visible pipeline for indie developers to be able to release games on spaces like the Switch and so on. So I hope and I always had my fingers crossed that that will continue to grow in the way that it has and that more indie developers will be able to receive the support that they want.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What games are you currently playing right now?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
I was revisiting Final Fantasy VII Remake after purchasing it when it came out and then not touching it for a long, long time. The announcement of the, I think, it&#8217;s called Intergrade DLC, was enough for me that it sparked motivation to want to return to the game and I said, &#8220;You know what? We&#8217;re going to finish this.&#8221; So yes, I&#8217;ve been casually pursuing that and I think I&#8217;m about three quarters of the way complete with it finally. But aside from that, I spend a little bit of my time streaming on Twitch various stealthy games. It&#8217;s another genre of games that I just really, really take to and enjoy playing. So titles like Thief &#8230; One of my favorite games is Thief Deadly Shadows which is this older medieval fantasy stealth game replays this thief called Garrett. I almost said the main character of The Witcher, Geralt. I mixed them up there, but great game.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Immersive sims is the genre, so other games like Hitman or Dishonored, any of those things where you&#8217;re presented with a level and you have to decide how you are going to solve the level and get from point A to point B are some of my favorite types of games to play. So I&#8217;ll dabble with one main game and then pursue other ones in the background. And so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing. How about yourself?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What am I playing now? That&#8217;s a good question because, and I said this before we record it, I am really big on buying games and then never playing them. I&#8217;m more of a collector at this point. So the games I&#8217;m currently playing now? So on PS4, I don&#8217;t know, I guess about halfway through Persona 5 Royal, I think. I think I&#8217;m halfway through. I&#8217;m in July because the game starts out in April and then it like goes to I think January or something, but Royal has a third semester. So I think I&#8217;m about maybe not half, I&#8217;m probably about a third of the way through that when I think about it because I&#8217;m in the summer. So I&#8217;m playing Persona 5 Royal.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then on my Switch, I have Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I feel like I&#8217;m just tending to that, I don&#8217;t know, neglected child. I&#8217;ve gotten my island to a point where I&#8217;m not going to change anything. My villagers are at a point where they&#8217;re not moving out. So my island is just in stasis, and because Nintendo&#8217;s not really rolling out a whole bunch of new content for it, I just log in every day, speak to people, dig up fossils at the islands. I just bought The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles, which I look forward to getting into that this weekend.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Great. I&#8217;ve been looking forward to that one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m looking to get into that pretty soon. And that&#8217;s what I have now. I&#8217;m a big fan of puzzle games, so I also just recently bought I think it&#8217;s Picross S5 I think is the latest one in the series. So I bought that. I haven&#8217;t played it yet, but I know eventually I will. Picross is just one of those games you just, I don&#8217;t know, you play it in the airport. You play it while you&#8217;re waiting for the train or something like that. It&#8217;s one of those games you can easily pick up and put down because it&#8217;s a puzzle game. Have you heard of Picross before?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
I have. I&#8217;ve not played it. Honestly, most puzzles I usually keep to something that&#8217;s like haptic, though I&#8217;m not opposed to them. They&#8217;re usually not my go to, but yeah, I&#8217;ve heard of Picross, but I didn&#8217;t know that they released a new iteration.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Jupiter cranks these games out every three months.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And they always have 150 puzzles or more. At least 150 to 200 puzzles, they just crank them out regularly. It&#8217;s insane. I think they just recently announced there&#8217;s going to be a Picross with, I think Sega and Master Collection. So it&#8217;s going to have Sonic sprites and things of that nature, Puyo Puyo, that kind of thing. I saw it and I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m going to buy that,&#8221; because also the games are like 10 bucks. So they&#8217;re like really cheap, they have a ton of replay value and they&#8217;re long games. Each puzzle is maybe anywhere from like a few seconds to maybe an hour, depending on the size of it and putting it all together, but that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m playing right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m looking forward to &#8230; What did I preorder? I preordered Metroid Dread. I think I pre ordered No More Heroes III. And I also pre ordered Advance Wars 1 and 2, the remakes that are coming out because I love some Advance Wars. I recently bought, not that I&#8217;m showing my age here, but I recently bought a, there&#8217;s this guy on Instagram that does these custom Gameboy Advance builds.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
That&#8217;s very cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They are pristine. I&#8217;m not going to say how much I paid for it. I paid too much for it, but they are pristine. And I bought one of those and I bought some games off eBay because I was like, &#8220;I love the form factor of it, plus I just love those old games. And now that Advance Wars 1 and 2 is coming out on the Switch, I was like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, I&#8217;m getting that. Absolutely. No questions asked.&#8221; There&#8217;s a couple of games that I don&#8217;t even have to think about it. My credit card&#8217;s already out like magic. I don&#8217;t even have to think about it like, &#8220;Oh, yeah. I&#8217;m getting that.&#8221; That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m playing right now.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Cool. Cool. Those are definitely some exciting things to look forward to. No More Heroes, especially, is one that I am a big fan of that. I&#8217;m trying to think if there&#8217;s anything that I&#8217;ve been looking forward to for some time. It is on the tip of my tongue. Elden Ring, From Software, so the new From Software title has been one that is definitely on my list, definitely looking forward to that. And then Deathloop from Arkane Studios which again talking about how as a fan of immersive sims and games that include the option of stealth. The creators of Dishonored are releasing a new title and this one looks like a lot of fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
So I&#8217;ll be getting that one right away.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And of course, you&#8217;re creating your own game, Onsen Master, but what videogame would you love to see developed one day?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
When it comes to the games that we experienced now, I&#8217;m just touching on the arc of indie games and how there are so many developers who have taken to their own to create experiences that they aren&#8217;t seeing. I would love, love to see a game that centers just like an Afro fantasy or Black fantasy or like Afro futurist game that is at the scale of a Square Enix title. If I could play a game that feels like Final Fantasy XV or any of those titles with that sort of fidelity and story and amount of hours dedicated to creating an original world and high-fantasy narrative, but it centers on Black people and the genre of Afro futurism. I think it would be phenomenal that I would preorder that before.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
I would somehow hear about it before the studio made formal announcement and be sitting at their front door just saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m ready. Just hand me the disc whenever you&#8217;re done.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, say someone&#8217;s listening to this, they&#8217;re hearing your story and everything and they want to become a game designer themselves. What resources or things would you tell them to check out to try to start that journey?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
So we briefly talked about things like Mario Maker and the Nintendo&#8217;s, I believe it&#8217;s the garage, I don&#8217;t remember the full name of it, but resources like that, going back to PlayStation 1, there are games like RPG Maker and stuff like that. There are avenues to be able to create games and use systems that are available now. You may not be able to completely realize the version of the game that you are seeking, but I think it&#8217;s important to remember that vision, that lofty vision that we all have for the game we dream of creating is an iterative process. We have to create the small games and the other experiences to get ourselves there. And so use these platforms, use these systems.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Dreams is another one from Media Molecule, creators of Little Big Planet, where you can now create your own assets, your own experiences using their platform. That might be one avenue. Another one is the Unity Engine that we use for Onsen Master is free. And there are a lot of resources not only on YouTube, which I affectionately call YouTube University, but Unity itself offers courses that are available for free for individuals who have no background in either programming or creating or 3D modeling, an avenue to be able to get access to those. One of the most important things that I want to acknowledge in saying all of that is the availability of resources is not equal. It&#8217;s not across the board for everybody and not everybody has the computer or the game hardware to be able to leap right into creating those things.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
I imagine that if they do, a lot of the times, they&#8217;re already exploring those possibilities already, taking to Google and figuring out which one of these might be the application or software for them. And so if pencil and paper are what is available for you, creating tabletop games and board games is game design. And I always think to myself that if it works on paper, it&#8217;s going to work digitally, but we just have to trade some of those paper systems for code and some of those cards or drawn assets for 3D models or 2D pictures and etcetera, but practice game design, creating board games between yourself and your family, creating card games.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
These are ways that still lead you to becoming a game designer because you&#8217;re creating experiences that you&#8217;re trying to elicit that from somebody else and have these sorts of fun moments with other people and design those fun moments. Use that. Use that as a platform. And so those are the things that I would say for individuals who are looking to explore game design, looking to leap into it, take one of those things and just try a little bit every day because those moments that you spend in it in doing it, that you&#8217;re just getting closer and closer to it every moment and it&#8217;s going to take time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look at the work that you&#8217;re doing now and you look back at your career and you think back to a young Derrick who was getting into Final Fantasy IX and was really starting to learn about game design and everything, are you where you want it to be at this stage in your life?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
I am. This is like one of those things that a &#8230; Very recently, I was all sorts of emotional about it and stuff because I was talking to my mom, whom &#8230; She is my number one hero and she has helped create an environment that has allowed me to thrive creatively and watched me evolve into the person that I am now and have the hardships and the hiccups that have led through to that. When it comes to creating games and what I would like to be doing in this space with Onsen Master on the way out and seeking to fund, our next project and most recently stepping into Northwestern University, I&#8217;d say I think I hit everything on young Derrick&#8217;s checklist.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
And so the only other thing left is to make sure that everything that I&#8217;ve earned sustains and that I can extend it to another young Derrick or a young individual out there who has their own checklist brewing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
I want to stay in education. I want to be able to continue contributing to Northwestern and hopefully help build a space that is comprehensive. Right now, I&#8217;m just one individual within the department who will be providing games education. And I would love to find ways to collaborate with other faculty and student across like interdisciplinary opportunities for faculty and students to be able to share experiences. I&#8217;ll be in like the radio, TV, film department. So there&#8217;s a lot of creativity that&#8217;s across these spaces, but the other thing is wanting to bring in other faculty or hopefully be able to advocate for bringing in other faculty to touch on other experiences and facets of game development.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
There&#8217;s music, there&#8217;s narrative, there&#8217;s so many other components to be considered and I think developing a space that feels conducive for all of those is really important to highlight for burgeoning creators or writers or musicians. As far as Waking Oni Games goes, Onsen Master is not the only title that I want to build and I want to develop a studio that can create games and create them sustainably. And when I say sustainably, I mean support every individual at their choice of part time or full time and not have to burden anybody with a decision of balancing life in a part-time job and a freelance gig on top of that.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
I hope that this game studio can be a space that somebody can, not only lean on for support, but feel as though they are contributing to the type of games that they want to see represented as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and your work and your studio and your game and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
So for the games, that is like waking up in the morning, wakingonigames.com. I can be found as WakingOni on Twitter and those are primarily the two main spaces that you can find us interacting between. There&#8217;s a Waking Oni Games Twitter as well. And I mentioned earlier that I stream on Twitch, sharing not only gameplay, but game development from time to time under the name Waking Oni.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Derrick Fields, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you for, one, sharing the work that you&#8217;re already doing through your studio and the game that you&#8217;re creating. I just have a soft spot in my heart for indie game designers. I just think it&#8217;s so cool that you all get to do this kind of stuff. And even just the Black community around gaming is so good to see. There&#8217;s developers, there&#8217;s designers, there&#8217;s musicians, there&#8217;s artists, game artists, voiceover, etcetera. It&#8217;s just so good to see all of that, but then also to really hear about your story of getting into it and the type of games that you want to see out there in the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hope that this interview is a way to introduce what you&#8217;re doing to our audience, so more people can discover what it is that you do and hopefully can help support your work. So thank you so much for coming on the show, man. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Derrick Fields:</b><br>
Thank you very much. It&#8217;s been a pleasure to be here.</p>

<p>Lately, I have been doing a deep dive into the magazine archives of EBONY and JET. While skimming the masthead of one of the old issues, I stumbled across this week&#8217;s guest &#8212; Brandi Davis! Brandi served as Johnson Publishing Company&#8217;s web designer from 2004-2012, and was front and center at the company&#8217;s shift from print to web. Wait until you hear her anecdotes about working there!</p>
<p>While we do spend a good bit of time talking about that portion of her career, we also talked about the importance of Black media online, how she has expanded into doing art therapy, and we dive into Brandi&#8217;s latest creative project &#8212; her own line of custom apparel inspired by her faith, her life, the culture, and her love for the city of Chicago. Brandi&#8217;s drive and tenacity are the keys to her success, and I think after this interview, you will be motivated to conquer your own fears as well!</p>
