Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>It&#8217;s been fun checking up on folks I&#8217;ve interviewed on Revision Path before, which brings us to my interview this week with art director Kendell Burton. <a href="/kendell-burton-2013/" data-wpel-link="internal">When we spoke nearly a decade ago, he was just kicking off his career.</a> Now he&#8217;s winning awards and staking his claim as one of NYC&#8217;s most dynamic creative talents.</p>
<p>We started off talking about his current work at international health agency 21GRAMS, and from there Kendell shared his story of growing up in Brooklyn and getting excited about tech through an unlikely source &#8212; Xanga. Kendell also spoke about the high points of his career, gave some tips about working at agencies, and talked about his horror podcast <a href="https://www.terrornovapodcast.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">TerrorNova</a>. Kendell truly loves what he does, and I can&#8217;t wait to see how his career continues to grow well into the future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Hey. My name is Kendell Burton. I am a senior art director at 21GRAMS, currently. I&#8217;ve been there now for a year. Yep. Coming up on a year. Yeah. Just past the year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. How&#8217;s the year been going so far for you?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
2023 has been nice so far. I can&#8217;t complain. I&#8217;m always excited for what comes each year. I try to mix things up a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything that you want to accomplish this year that you didn&#8217;t accomplish last year? Any New Year&#8217;s resolutions or stuff like that?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t really do resolutions that much, but I guess if I had to say the closest thing to it is this year I want to travel a little bit more. I haven&#8217;t traveled as much as I would like, in a lot of ways, these past few years. Of course, due to the pandemic and stuff like that. I want to get back to doing that a little bit more.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I hear you there. I took my first plane trip since the pandemic back in October. I went to Toronto and spoke at a conference. I was tripping, leading up to the trip. You see on the news folks be fighting the airports. I don&#8217;t want to go and it&#8217;s some hassle. I just want to go to the airport, get on the plane, get where I&#8217;ve got to go. You know what I&#8217;m saying? It was fine. Once I got back into that rhythm, I was like, &#8220;Okay. This is good. I can do this.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
That&#8217;s cool. You went to Toronto. I love Toronto. It&#8217;s one of my favorite places to visit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That was my first time visiting. I didn&#8217;t get to see a whole lot of the city because they had us right by the convention venue where we spoke at. I tell people that Toronto kind of feels like if Hollywood made a big city to shoot movies in, it would be Toronto. It feels like New York, but less gritty and grimy, in a way.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a perfect description, actually. Yep. Someone who goes there every year, that&#8217;s a perfect description.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interestingly enough, I got to the airport, took my cab to the hotel, got to the hotel. Soon as I walk in the hotel, they&#8217;re playing Drake. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Really? Really?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
They love Drake over there. [inaudible 00:07:03] Drake. Cab drivers have asked me and my lady about that last time I went. I went in the summertime last year and the guy was like, &#8220;you heard of Drake?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I know [inaudible 00:07:11]. Who didn&#8217;t hear of Drake?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who hasn&#8217;t heard of Drake?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t listen to his music like that, but of course I&#8217;ve heard of the man. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;He&#8217;s not popular in America?&#8221; It said, &#8220;Very, very popular.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. You mentioned 21GRAMS. Let&#8217;s talk a little bit about the work that you&#8217;re doing there. Can you tell me about that?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. I could tell you a bit about agency. I&#8217;ve been there, like I said, for a year. The work is pharma based, which is really interesting because it&#8217;s my first step ever into pharma. I&#8217;ve like never done anything pharma before this. It&#8217;s been really interested. 21GRAMS a pharma agency. It sometimes comes down to figuring out the best way to market a drug. Very similar to a traditional agency in the consumer space where maybe Mars or M&#038;M&#8217;s would come to the agency and say, &#8220;Hey. We want to do a campaign. What should we do? What is the thinking? What is the concepts? What does your campaign look like?&#8221; That&#8217;s pretty much the 21GRAMS does with pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>It could be a general campaign that&#8217;s about bringing awareness around a particular disease or particular condition that people suffer from or it could be a campaign that&#8217;s about a very specific drug that is meant to help and treat a very specific condition. The campaigns kind of range, but the thinking and all of that stuff, strategically, conceptually, design-wise, all that stuff still applies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is a typical day like for you?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Oh, man. It&#8217;s exciting for me, because I&#8217;m still learning so much new stuff every day. Some things are the norm, just hopping on Teams or hopping in chats and talking to my teammates about what&#8217;s happening on the project. Some days can be very heavily design focused where I&#8217;m in design or Photoshop or XD or any of the millions of programs in the Adobe Suite. Could be one day of me making maybe working on a brochure or a lead behind or working on a direct mail alert or it could be working on a page for a website or I could be working on print ads. Like I said, it&#8217;s a variety. Honestly, some days can just be very heavily meeting focused where I may be having conversations with my internal team about the upcoming project, relaying questions to them about what I need to do, what I can do.</p>
<p>This is the interesting thing about working on pharma, you kind of have to learn about the drugs or a disease stage you&#8217;re trying to fix. That&#8217;s another meeting, they call it Med 101. They may be sitting in a meeting for an hour where I&#8217;m just learning about the condition that people suffer from and this is why this particular medication was created to treat this. It&#8217;s really interesting. My day could jump around. It could be very, very different from day to day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What attracted you to work for them?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I wanted to try something new, to be honest with you. I wanted to try something new. I remember telling them that during an interview process as well. I wanted to try something different throughout a good portion of my career I&#8217;ve to work consumer side, which you knows things like Nike, Adidas, my Little Pony, Hasbro, all of this variety of brands I&#8217;ve been fortunate to touch. I remember one of my professors always said with pharma, he was like, &#8220;Hey. Some people get stuck in it. Some people don&#8217;t like being stuck, so if you could try consumer for a little while and then go into pharma, so at least if you don&#8217;t enjoy pharma, you can go back. You might find that you like it, so it&#8217;s kind of up to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m the type of person that likes to try new things. I was like, &#8220;Great. I&#8217;ve done all these years of consumer.&#8221; The opportunity for pharma came up to me and I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I want to try that. I haven&#8217;t done that before, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have to think differently and learn new things.&#8221; That&#8217;s kind of a part of a reason I got this field to begin with. So I was like, &#8220;Time to launch a new step.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Overall, as an art director, what would you say is the best thing about the work that you do?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a lot of things. Of course I&#8217;m a fan of the end result, when the project is done. [inaudible 00:11:03] A everyone&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Wow, this really came out better than we expected.&#8221; It&#8217;s always great to hear that. I honestly love proving the people that design requires more work than people think. I think oftentimes people just to just go, well, you know the brand color is, what photography to use, I would direct that. I think sometimes a big part of art direction, which is different from design, they are not a hundred percent the same. A big part of our director is trying to direct people like, &#8220;Hey. We can do it like this. We can do it like this. I know you may be selling this particular thing, but we could style this in the style of, I don&#8217;t know, a Cinderella book or something or some type of fairytale story.&#8221; You could just remix things in the ways that people don&#8217;t expect and that&#8217;s a part of the experience.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just laying out the content, but it&#8217;s the way in which you lay out the content that makes things really interesting. That&#8217;s a part of the art direction. What type of typography do we use? What type of photography do we use? That&#8217;s a part of art direction that&#8217;s slightly separate from design, but is of course connected. That&#8217;s one of my favorite aspects of it. Just kind of showing non designers that and showing &#8220;non creatives&#8221; that aspect of what we do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I hear people kind of use art director and creative director somewhat interchangeably. What would you say are the difference between those two, from your perspective?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve heard it a few different ways. I would say, I guess, in my experience, the way the industry has been lately, within the time I&#8217;ve been in it, it seems like people have tried to merge the two. From my understanding how things used to be, there was never really a mergence of the two because thinking and doing are two very different tasks. There are people who are really good designers, like fantastic designers, but they may not be the best in terms of figuring out the best direction for something to look visually, but they may be the best to put it together. They just may not be the best to come up with the idea. Generating ideas is important. Similarly, to how people think of Apple when they&#8217;re just, &#8220;Steve Jobs didn&#8217;t design anything.&#8221; You&#8217;re like, &#8220;You&#8217;re probably right.&#8221; Having the vision and coming up with the idea is a big part of the process too. You can&#8217;t separate the vision from the actual technical part they&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always viewed creative director and art director as they&#8217;re different. In my opinion, the creative director is more of the manager. The creative director is the manager of the entire project. Not just necessarily the art aspect of it, but understanding what are we trying to accomplish? What are we doing on brief? What is the brief. What is the brief action? Do we have enough information in the brief? All of those things. I feel like, the creative director is a part of kind of guard railing to make sure that the art director and the designers can succeed.</p>
<p>The art director, I&#8217;ve always viewed it as art director is generally in charge of what is the ownable creative POV in which we can tell this story. Are we telling the story in a way of a video game? We know some type of video game narrative that uses maybe a UI video game experience. What are we trying to say? Here&#8217;s the best way to say it. The career director is just, I would say, there to make sure that you have all things in place such you can actually get to doing part. That&#8217;s just how I viewed it. I&#8217;m sorry if that sounds a little complex, but that&#8217;s just kind of how I thought it. Art director is the creative vision. Creative director is making sure art director has everything they do and need and being the guardrail and the pressure cooker to make sure that things are going out make sense.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re like the, I would say, the artistic version of the client. That&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve always thought of it. When I work on a project, even though I&#8217;m designing as well oftentimes, I&#8217;m going to the creative director far before I&#8217;m going to anyone else to go, &#8220;Hey, here&#8217;s what the brief said. Here&#8217;s what the POV is. Here&#8217;s what the goal is. Here&#8217;s how I think we should do that. We should tell that story. We should solve this problem. What do you think?&#8221; I feel like the creative director&#8217;s supposed to put their client hat on in some ways to go, &#8220;Okay. The client may or may not like certain aspects of this. We&#8217;re kind of pushing a bar, but that&#8217;s cool. Let&#8217;s push the bar. Let&#8217;s do this.&#8221; That&#8217;s kind of how I&#8217;ve always viewed it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, I got you. No, I like that distinction and that comparison. When I&#8217;ve had folks on the show or even when I&#8217;ve just talked to other creatives, I keep hearing them used interchangeably. I know they&#8217;re different, but I don&#8217;t know if they know that it&#8217;s different, if they&#8217;re saying one thing and it should be something else.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s why I say what it is now, because from my understanding from people I&#8217;ve spoken to who have been in this field far longer than I have, even before I knew this field was an option in life, people who have been in this field maybe 20, 30 years, maybe even longer. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Hey. These jobs used to be treated entirely separately.&#8221; Even the designer and art director were treated entirely separately. You weren&#8217;t just promoted from designer to then your next level was art direction because some can&#8217;t make that jump. I was like, &#8220;That makes sense.&#8221; Now it seems like it&#8217;s been smushed together in a lot of ways. I&#8217;m sure it has to do with money, it&#8217;s easy to pay one person versus two. I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s why that decision was made. Everyone who&#8217;s an art director is not meant to be a creative director and vice versa.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Got you. Got you. I kind of want to switch gears here a little bit because you sort of alluded to earlier about not even knowing this was a profession. I kind of want to know about your origin story, how you first got into design and art direction and everything. You were born and raised in Brooklyn, right?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me what it was growing up there.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I loved it. I still live in New York. I&#8217;m not in Brooklyn anymore. Now I live in Manhattan, but I&#8217;ve always loved Brooklyn. It&#8217;s always had a good community, in my opinion, especially being a kid. I was born in 89, which isn&#8217;t that long ago, but it can feel like it [inaudible 00:16:42] hindsight. I&#8217;ve always had a really great community. I was not a cool kid, but I mean I had a good time as a kid growing up in Brooklyn. I was always in parks, really simple life. My family wasn&#8217;t super wealthy or had money to really do vacations in crazy places or anything like that. It was a lot of spending time with family, going to block parties when Block Brooklyn used to do more of that when I was a kid, block parties were a thing. The thing, especially in the summertime. It&#8217;s the best thing ever. Just every morning in the neighborhood comes out, everyone&#8217;s cooking, giving stuff to kids, nobody&#8217;s worried about kids getting kidnapped. It was chill. It was really cool.</p>
<p>I really just loved that as a kid. That&#8217;s literally my fondest memory of Brooklyn is just block parties and everybody just kind of being out and no one calls [inaudible 00:17:31]. Everyone&#8217;s just chilling. Hey, you want a hamburger? We&#8217;re making burgers over here. You want some hotdog? You want some ribs? Everyone&#8217;s making everything. It&#8217;s a great time. I loved it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I love that sort of sense of community that comes from close-knit places like that. I mean, I grew up in the deep south, but that&#8217;s one of my memories of growing up is we were around this tight-knit community where if you needed something, you went across the street. It sounds quaint. Oh, I&#8217;m going to go across the street and borrow a cup of sugar or whatever, but you could do that. Folks would sit out on their porch and wave to each other and all of that. Doesn&#8217;t happen now, but back in the day it definitely was just a different vibe back then.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. I try to recreate that in my everyday life in some capacity. It&#8217;s a little challenging, but I try to create some small aspects of that going forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, were you a really creative kid? Did you do a lot of drawing and stuff?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I tried. I tried. I guess I would say I was creative. I was like every other kid watching Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon and things like that and trying to draw the character as best I could. I did have that aspect of it. Drawing never really stuck with me, but I did do that. I just enjoyed comedy and seeing and doing creative things. I was a really active kid. I was never one of those kids who just knew what they wanted out of life in terms of &#8230; Some kids are like, &#8220;I know I want to be a doctor. I know I want to be this.&#8221; When that question came to me in elementary school, I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, man. I&#8217;m five. I know firemen do cool stuff, but I know police do their thing. All these other companies and professions do their things, but I don&#8217;t know. Can I just learn life?&#8221;<br>
That was always how I&#8217;d been. I would just learned stuff. I was like, &#8220;Oh. This is interesting. That&#8217;s interesting.&#8221; Standup comedy was interesting. My father would play that stuff in the house and that&#8217;s how I knew Richard Pryor and things like that. I was like, &#8220;This is funny. This is interesting.&#8221; It was movies another thing.I just experimented with everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You said you were born in 89, right? Right around that time of the late eighties, early nineties. I would say even going into the mid and late nineties, there was such an explosion of culture that happened, I think particularly here in the US, because of the advent of technology and personal computers and cable and the internet and all that sort of stuff. Prior to the generation before us, we just got exposed to so much more stuff at a formative age. It kind of makes sense that when that question gets asked about what do you want to be, it&#8217;s tough because you have so much choice.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. I think it&#8217;s good to have choice. I&#8217;m always the person that thinks people need to experience stuff to know what they like. That&#8217;s just how I view it. I guess you can call it my childhood wisdom even. That was just the way I viewed things. I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know until I tried it,&#8221; I would just try stuff. That&#8217;s why I played a billion sports. I was also drawing stuff. I was trying to write poetry, I was doing so many things. I was just like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m good at yet. I know I&#8217;m smart. I don&#8217;t have any self-esteem issues or self-confidence issues, but I need to explore the world. I just got here. I&#8217;m eight.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now did your family support you in this, all this sort of exploration of all these different things?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. They definitely did. My dad, I mainly raised by my dad, because my mom passed when I was a young age. My dad, he didn&#8217;t even tell me to do these things. I just was interested in stuff. I would see stuff that he did and I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s kind of cool,&#8221; obviously. Whether it was movies we watched or TV shows or bike riding. We did a lot of bike riding when I was a kid. I still try to ride my bike now. It still applies. Seeing things in the world, seeing things in the park, seeing people try stuff maybe in a TV show and I&#8217;m like, that&#8217;s interesting. Let me try that. My parents never discouraged me from doing anything.</p>
<p>They kind of in some ways opened the world up to me. They didn&#8217;t really shield me from things in the world heavily. They were just kind of like, &#8220;Yeah. Some things are like this and things like that.&#8221; They kind of encouraged me to ask questions and tell them my thoughts if I had any. I just kept going. I just kept doing it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now I read in another interview that you cut your teeth in tech trying to set up a Xanga blog to meet girls. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yes, that is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me about that. What&#8217;s the about?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
This is my origin story. You know what&#8217;s funny? I tell this story at job interview, so I&#8217;ll tell you exactly how I tell it. I need people to know my personality. I&#8217;ve always felt like if people don&#8217;t understand my personality then there&#8217;s no point in me working at places. I tell them the same story when I go to job interviews. People are like, &#8220;What got you in the design?&#8221; I go, &#8220;Women.&#8221; People are like, &#8220;What? What does that mean?&#8221; It&#8217;s not a answer you expect. You expect me to sit down and be like, &#8220;I was drawing such a young age, Picasso.&#8221; No, it was none of that.</p>
<p>It was gross. I was a teenager, I was 13 years old. I had my first summer job or first job, period. It was a summer job. I worked at a senior center in Queens. I lived in Queens at the time. I worked at the senior center and Ravenswood in Queens. This kid that I worked with with was a little older than me. He was a graduating senior in high school. I just finished my freshman year. He was always on this website called Xanga. I didn&#8217;t know what it was. I just saw he was always on it.</p>
<p>They had a computer. This is before computers were everywhere. People had computers, but not everyone had a computer at home. I was one of those people that didn&#8217;t have a computer at home. I knew how to use computers because schools had computers. In our office job, at the senior center &#8230; It was office job. You&#8217;re sorting paperwork, you may occasionally have to type something, you may occasionally have to send an email. We mostly hung out with the elderly people that were there, because that was what it was. It was like maybe bringing lunch to him, stuff like that. It was just a space where older people could hang out in the summertime and they didn&#8217;t have to go out and worry about the heat or anything like that. It was a really chill place.</p>
<p>My coworker that worked there, he was just on his website all the time, Xanga. I always saw he was on there, whether he was putting music or changing photos. It was a really simple blog. I guess this was before people even called them blogs, but it was a really simple blog. He always had music playing. He was just metal. He had cool backgrounds. I think one day after a few weeks of getting to know him, I was like, &#8220;Hey, man. What is this website?&#8221; He was like, &#8220;Oh. I use it to talk to my friends who are&#8221; &#8230; What is the word I&#8217;m looking for? For people who were shipped out in the military, because he was in a program called ROTC, I believe was the name of it, which is kind of a preparation program for people who were going to go to the military or go to military schools, things like that. He was like, &#8220;Yeah. I stay in touch with my friends who are overseas and who have already been deployed. I just used us to stay in touch with them and talk to other people.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s cool. That&#8217;s really cool. Can I meet girls on here?&#8221; Specifically, can I meet girls on here? He was like, &#8220;Well, technically, yeah.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Cool. That&#8217;s all I need to know. Create a profile for me.&#8221; [inaudible 00:24:45]. I had my own page. I remember my username was Shadow 1989. I had my own page and I just started tinkering with it, because I saw that he was always tinkering with it. I was like, well, what can you do? The page gave you limited HTML on coding capabilities, honestly. It was like you can change the background color, you can put an image in the background, you can position the image in the background, you can change the color of the text. You could change some of the effects over the text. Maybe you hover over the text and instead of it going purple, maybe it glitters or something. It was just these little capabilities that were really cool. Me and my friends were literally Googling stuff to find out how to change the code on certain things.</p>
<p>It just opened up a can of worms. I was on it all the time, customizing my page all the time, thinking of really interesting themes for my page. Oh, I want to do a Final Fantasy theme. I think at the time, Final Fantasy 10 was a thing. I had the photo of Titus and Uno. It&#8217;s from the game for people who played the game. There&#8217;s a scene in the game that&#8217;s really beautiful where they&#8217;re in this water and there&#8217;s these fireflies around. I had that in my background. The hover state for my links was this sparkling glitter that looks like it was from the scene. It was beautiful. [inaudible 00:26:03].</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know what design was at the time, but I was just doing that all the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean I think what you&#8217;re mentioning here is something that&#8217;s really important for, I think, anyone that&#8217;s looking to learn something new. Use the gateway of something that you enjoy to be that sort of fuel that pushes you into it. Do you think you would&#8217;ve gotten into this if you couldn&#8217;t meet girls or &#8230; You know what I mean? Because you knew that because that was an avenue for you, you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay. I think I want to learn more about this,&#8221; because you had a vision of what you wanted to do because of what you were interested in.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. It was a hundred percent that. See, that&#8217;s the funny part. I had years of using that software, using that website. I got all my friends hooked on it. We were all 13 at the time. I think one or two of my friends maybe a year older. We all got hooked on Xanga. We&#8217;re all using it for the same reasons, pick up girls. We also all were just really getting into the design aspect of it, but not knowing that it was something that people do professionally.</p>
<p>The way I found out graphic design was an option was in my junior year of high school. Yeah. My junior year of high school, I had a computer class. I transferred schools. I went back to Brooklyn. I had a computer class, I remember with a teacher, Mr. Mastell. That was his name, Mr. Mastell. Mastell. I remember his name. Really nice guy. I remember seeing him years later and I told him this story. He laughed. He was like, &#8220;I forgot all about that.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I know you&#8217;ve had a hundred students.&#8221; The computer class, we had to build a webpage. We had to build a website, but mainly you could just build a webpage. He was like, &#8220;Just build a page.&#8221; In that class, as we were on computers all day, I was bouncing between building my page and then playing with my Xanga. Why not. I&#8217;m a kid so this is what I do.</p>
<p>Then one day the teacher was coming over to my desk and I was on Xanga and I saw he got close, because remember when he used to have those big computer monitors, it wasn&#8217;t like [inaudible 00:27:54]. Well, you could see somebody walking up to you. It was the big one. I didn&#8217;t see him until his shadow basically came over the top of my screen. I was like, &#8220;Oh snap. Let me minimize this window.&#8221; Being an old computer, the window froze and it got stuck. My Xanga page was just stuck on the page. I&#8217;m just sitting there clicking so hard on the minimize button. It just wouldn&#8217;t minimize. He came by and he was like, &#8220;How&#8217;s your project going?&#8221;</p>
<p>He sees my screen. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;It&#8217;s going.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;Hold on. What&#8217;s that?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. This thing [inaudible 00:28:29].&#8221; Yeah. I thought I was in trouble. He was like, &#8220;No, that&#8217;s actually really cool.&#8221; I remember having this tornado marquee with typography coming out of and stuff. He was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s really cool. Wow, that&#8217;s really cool. How did you even learn how to do that? I didn&#8217;t teach you guys anything like that. This is cool.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;Wow. You should maybe be a designer or something.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Hold up. I was just using this to pick up women. You&#8217;re telling me I could have a career choice here?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was like, &#8220;Yeah. There are people who do graphic design, professionally, whether it&#8217;s websites or other stuff.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I had no idea. I&#8217;m so happy you said that. I didn&#8217;t even know what I wanted to do in college. I just knew I wanted to go to college.&#8221; That was kind of how it started.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of college, you went to City Tech. For folks that have been listening to the show for a while, we&#8217;ve had a few professors on the show; Douglas Davis, Danny Shaw, we&#8217;ve had a couple of City Tech alums too. Tell me what your time was there.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
That&#8217;s my professor, Douglas Davis. I had him as a professor.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, really?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yep. Danny Shaw, that&#8217;s one of my good friends.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
City Tech was great, man. I loved City Tech. It was a really nice experience to get around other people who were trying to do something in field. Remember, I&#8217;m just a kid who&#8217;s just playing around on the website. I don&#8217;t know design principles, I don&#8217;t truly know color palettes. I know how to use color. I know what looks good to the eye. I wasn&#8217;t that kid who was like, well, you&#8217;re supposed to use these particular shades of red to go with this particular shade of blue. I didn&#8217;t understand or know any of that, because I never was traditionally taught any of it. That&#8217;s why college was really great, because I got to really see the basics of how to do some of these thing, even just basic drawing. I still don&#8217;t draw much to this day, but just having life drawing classes and things like that was really fun. You see different people skill levels. You see people who&#8217;ve clearly been doing it for way longer than you, or you see people who are also learning as well.</p>
<p>Meeting these people, becoming friends with them and become friends with the professors. City Tech was honestly one of the best parts of my life. I met a lot of really cool people that I&#8217;m friends with to this day. It was great. It was a great experience, man, from beginning to end. My skillset was terrible walking in, considering I only knew how to play around on our websites. To what it was post, after leaving City Tech, like drastic change, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d imagine it was probably pretty cool also having a black male professor, someone that&#8217;s teaching you how to do all this stuff too.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. Doug was cool. His class was hard. As somebody who didn&#8217;t have any traditional training in the field or any understanding of what a concept for a campaign was, it was very hard for me at first. I remember telling him this. He was always just like, &#8220;Oh, I know it&#8217;s hard. I make it hard because this is what it&#8217;s going to be like.&#8221; His class isn&#8217;t hard for the sake of being hard. It&#8217;s hard because he&#8217;s being realistic about how projects are done and the actual agency space. I was like, &#8220;Okay, cool.&#8221; It was super challenging. I didn&#8217;t know how to come up with a concept fora campaign. I didn&#8217;t know what a campaign truly was. I knew commercials I saw that were really cool. I remember, I used to always tell people this joke, but I&#8217;m clearly when I saw the Old Spice commercial, which was out at the time with the dude &#8230; What was his name Isaiah Washington?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, Isaiah Mustafa, I think.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah, something like that. The guy riding on the horse?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:31:42] to the camera. That came out when I was in college. I remember seeing that commercial going, I don&#8217;t know how they got to a black guy on a horse, but I know it couldn&#8217;t have just been somebody saw Old Spice black guy on a horse. There had to be thinking again from A to that. There had to be thinking. He was like, &#8220;Yeah, for sure.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what any of that thinking is, but I would love to learn.&#8221; His class was great for that. His class was really, really good for that. Yeah. Seeing a black professor was awesome. In a lot of ways he was inspirational, because I didn&#8217;t have many black professors prior to that, that I can recall, let alone that was still actively working in the field and still was keeping up with where things are moving. He&#8217;s a very innovative professor for not just City Tech, but just in general.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What was your early career after you graduated? You obviously had this interest that you had sort of cultivated through getting on Xanga and meeting girls and stuff. Then you&#8217;re also strengthening it through college. Once you got out there, what was your early career?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
It was interesting, man. I didn&#8217;t know where to go. There&#8217;s no clear handbook for what you do once college is done. You know you want to get a job in your field, but for somebody like me, like I said, I didn&#8217;t know what was possible. I had a better idea of what was possible after all of this college stuff, whether [inaudible 00:33:02] internships or talking to professors or being fortunate to volunteer for some award shows to actually see what those were like. I still didn&#8217;t really know where I wanted to go. When I graduated, I didn&#8217;t get a job right away, but I was applying places. I was talking to recruiters and all that. I still do that to this day, honestly. Talk to recruiters, email recruiters, hop on the phone with recruiters and talk to them. I always kind of try to make a habit of that because you never know.</p>
<p>Actually, Doug used to always say this. He was like, &#8220;It&#8217;s best to talk to people when you don&#8217;t need them.&#8221; [inaudible 00:33:35] for a favor. I was like, he&#8217;s a hundred percent right because I hate when people hit me up only to ask for favors. I try to it make a habit. No, I make it a habit to be a good person in general, not just when I need something, to everybody, whether you can give me something or not. I was the same way with recruiters. Yes, I needed their help when I was coming out of college, but I was also just trying to build a relationship. It actually worked out for me. That was how I got my first job.</p>
<p>I got my first job three months after I graduated college. It was at VaynerMedia. I got that job because of a recruiter that I spoke to probably about two or three times a week. He was always so proactive about trying to help me get something, it&#8217;s my homeboy Jakes. We still talk from time to time. He was so proactive about helping me get a gig because he was like, &#8220;Your work is clearly good. Obviously you&#8217;re a junior and [inaudible 00:34:22] stuff you have to learn.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I know. For sure. I&#8217;m willing to learn it.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to keep trying to place you.&#8221; He kept trying to place me.</p>
<p>Then eventually the intermediate reached out to me through email for an interview. I went to the interview, I got the job. I was like, &#8220;Wow. This is awesome. I got first job.&#8221; Ironically, the first day I ran into him in the bathroom. He was like, &#8220;Hey.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Hey, man. What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; He was like, &#8220;Hey. How&#8217;s everything going?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Good.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;How&#8217;d you think you got the job interview?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. They just randomly reached out.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It was me, dude. I recommended you.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Oh, thank you, man. I didn&#8217;t know. You didn&#8217;t tell me that. I knew you left your recruiter job, but I didn&#8217;t even put two and two together that you came here and then they reached out to me.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s so cool. I appreciate that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I remember when I reached out to you. I think this was almost 10 years ago, almost a decade ago. Good Lord. You were working at VaynerMedia at the time. For people that know Vayner Media was founded by Gary Vaynerchuk, who &#8230; I haven&#8217;t really followed him lately, but I know back during that time, right before he started VaynerMedia, was really well known in the social media entrepreneurship space. What did you learn from that experience working there?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I will say a lot. Honestly, I also want to preference, I didn&#8217;t know who he was when I went to the job interview.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That probably is a good thing, to be completely honest with you.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I guess. Well, I&#8217;m sure people do, but I didn&#8217;t go there like, &#8220;Hey, I really want to work with Gary.&#8221; In my mind I&#8217;m like, I just got out of college. It&#8217;s an interesting job where I could do social media work. I&#8217;ve always been told that digital is going to be the future anyway, in a lot of ways. This is a cool opportunity. I remember the woman who interviewed me, she said, &#8220;Hey. Do you know anything about Gary?&#8221; She was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to hold it against you. I just want to know.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about this man. I just found out who he was when I found out about this agency and that&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;m cool with that.&#8221; That&#8217;s not to say that he&#8217;s bad or anything, it&#8217;s just I didn&#8217;t know who he was prior to getting the job.</p>
<p>Sorry, what was the question?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What did you learn from that experience working there? Did it teach you anything? Any sort of lessons that you still carry with you to this day?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. I worked with some really awesome art directors there who were, I would say, patient with me. I tell everybody, you need patience with people. Regardless of job level and title, you need patience with people. It was my first gig. I&#8217;d done social media work a little bit prior to that, but honestly not a lot. I did intern at Buddy Media when I was around at one point I interned at a F Sharp building user experiences for social, but not creating daily social content.</p>
<p>Working at Vayner was a bit of a change, because at that time we were pumping out social content for so many different brands daily. It was a very go-getter energy. I kind of really liked that. I didn&#8217;t right away appreciate it. I was kind of like, &#8220;What&#8217;s going on here? What the hell&#8217;s going on here?&#8221; Because everyone was kind of bouncing around doing different things. I would see the art director. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;I&#8217;m heading to a shoot.&#8221; Then I see him five minutes later, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;I&#8217;m designing something for something.&#8221; Then I see him a few minutes after that. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;I&#8217;m overseeing this other person who&#8217;s working on a different brand, but I&#8217;m in charge of what happens on that brand.&#8221; I was just like, &#8220;Wow, this guy&#8217;s doing a lot in two hours. There&#8217;s a lot happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was just the energy there at the time. Even as a designer, they gave me a good amount of responsibility. I was in charge of my daily creative needs where it was a certain amount of content for maybe a brand I was on. I was on Hasbro. I touched a lot of brands when I was there, probably some of the most in my life. It&#8217;d be like maybe designing maybe four to five pieces of content a day. I remember this daily content, they&#8217;d do daily content at the time for brands. My day would be designing maybe four or five things. Then I may be leading a small photo shoot for one of the products for one of our brands. Then maybe I&#8217;m also helping out somebody else for another brand because maybe someone just needs a body to do something.</p>
<p>Hey, guys. We&#8217;re trying to record a Vine, when that was a thing. Need someone to be here. We need someone to be here. Who&#8217;s free to help? Then it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Kendell, are you free for 10 minutes?&#8221; Sure, I&#8217;m free you. Then I&#8217;ll go in and help out with a Vine, whether we&#8217;re doing something for Chips A-Hoy or doing something for a random brand. I was like, &#8220;Cool.&#8221; It was just a really good go-getter energy. I really appreciated and that it. It was really cool. It was a lot to learn there from everything that was just happening.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now after VaynerMedia, a couple of years afterwards, you ended up working at another agency G and you were their lead designer. Was that kind of a big shift from that sort of fast hustle culture that it sounds like VaynerMedia had to, what was going on at GLOW?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
A little bit. Yeah. A little bit. I felt like with Vayner, often days you didn&#8217;t know what you were going to get. I knew it was going to be designing a few things, but you sometimes didn&#8217;t know if you were going to be leading the shoot or volunteering with different things. There was a lot going on. It was really fun. I loved being a part of that. That was awesome. GLOW is drastically different and drastically smaller. It was way smaller. When I first got to Vayner, I think two weeks in and they were moving to a new office, because they needed more space. I think we might&#8217;ve been over 300 employees at that point. It was a lot of people there. So much so I started losing track of names of so many people. If you weren&#8217;t on my direct team, or I didn&#8217;t work with you in the past, it was hard to keep track of names. There was so many people.</p>
<p>GLOW was a lot smaller. GLOW was maybe 20 to 30 people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:39:41] the creative team. I meant the company was 20 to 30 people. It was a lot smaller. The work I did there was some of my favorite work I&#8217;ve done in my career. It was just a good time. It was a different experience. Whereas, Vayner was a lot of consumable goods, whether it was like Hasbro or Chips Ahoy and things of that nature. With GLOW, it was a lot of entertainment focused. It was TV shows, which was drastically different. I worked on social for a lot of TV. It was still social based, so that aspect I still hold down to. It was a lot of TV shows, whether it was shows for HBO, Showtime, Star, Sci-Fi Channel. It was a lot of TV shows. There was a little bit of a learning curve in what you can say for a TV show, what you can do or what you can&#8217;t do. It was interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting. I&#8217;m trying to place the year. I&#8217;m guessing this is like 2010s maybe, mid to early 2010s?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. Roughly about maybe five years ago almost. Probably mid to late.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Yeah. I think about how television and social, because you mentioned that, I remember when Scandal came out on ABC. I had been on Twitter. I had been on Twitter since 2007. I don&#8217;t think the concept of live tweeting a television show was really a thing back then until that show. It really popped off. Now you go on Twitter and you can&#8217;t escape every web series, movie, television show has some kind of hashtag or social campaign behind it or something. I feel like that was really sort of the golden age of that stuff popping off.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. I was actually just looking at the year. It was like 2015 till 2018 I was there. Yeah. Definitely during that time where live tweeting was becoming a big thing and brands were starting to care, TV shows in particular, but all brands. Really TV shows are starting to care a lot more about how they appeared on social, how did they engage with the audience? Were they doing good stuff prior to the episode airing and then during the episode earring and then after the episode airing. It was really cool, man. It was a great time. Some of the stuff I got to touch and work on, some of the most fun work I&#8217;ve done in my career, honestly. It was just a really interesting time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, after GLOW you worked for even more agencies. You worked for 360i, you worked for Collected, you worked for Ghost Note. We actually had their art director on last year, Rebecca Brooker. What draws you to working for agencies?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
They keep hiring me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look, that&#8217;s real. Hey, I get it.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
It&#8217;s really that. They kept hiring me. From Vayner, like I said, I had no predetermined career path. I was like, &#8220;Well, this agency works for me, let me try another one.&#8221; It just kind of kept snowballing that way. It&#8217;s been good. It&#8217;s been interesting. It&#8217;s been good. I&#8217;ve learned different things from every agency. They just kept hiring me and I kept getting really interesting opportunities. I was like, why not? I&#8217;ll keep rolling with this. It just kept working.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What qualities do you think agencies look for in a designer? Is it just about having a portfolio of good work or is it something else?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s a little bit of both. I&#8217;ve heard people say different things, but I think it&#8217;s a little bit of both. I think on one hand they see a portfolio that people look for potential. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh. How does this person think? What does this person think about?&#8221; Who they are based on their work. Then I also think they&#8217;re looking for a fit. Oftentimes, a lot of agencies, at least a lot of ones I&#8217;ve experienced, I can&#8217;t speak for all agencies. A lot of agencies I&#8217;ve experienced, they usually hire because they were trying to fill a specific need. It was like we got new business coming in. They probably have a specific type of business coming in, so they&#8217;re looking for a specific type of person to fit that brand that they&#8217;re bringing in. Whether it&#8217;s a cooking brand or something, like looking for somebody that probably fits that niche.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s just general and they&#8217;re just like, we just need bodies in here. We need people in here who are going to fit the mold and fit the team. I think oftentimes people are looking for a specific kind of fit. Yeah. It is your work. I think also it&#8217;s a part of who you are. That perspective of who you are can be very helpful in your day-to-day life.</p>

I&#8217;ve always kind of just been curious about that because I mean, I&#8217;m speaking partially from personal experience, but also from what I&#8217;ve heard from other designers. For those that may have worked on more of the UX side or product or tech, what I&#8217;ve heard and experienced personally is that it&#8217;s hard to break agency because agencies are looking for &#8220;agency experience&#8221;. Have you heard that before?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I have heard that. I have heard that, but I can&#8217;t say definitively they are, because I think it&#8217;s mixed. Here&#8217;s the thing. I think a lot of people like agency experience because agency &#8230; It&#8217;s just my opinion, I&#8217;m not speaking for everyone. I think a lot of people look for agency experience because agency experience tells them that you know how to deal with a lot of crazy things happening at once. I think there is an underlying but known secret that a lot of agencies are not super organized. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s that they&#8217;re unorganized, because they just decided we&#8217;re going to not be organized. There&#8217;re things that happened. There&#8217;s a lot of moving pieces in our field from account, strategy, creative. There&#8217;s a lot of moving pieces. It&#8217;s easy for something to slip through the cracks. Some people can&#8217;t function when things slip through the cracks. They&#8217;ll just be honest. There are different personalities. I have friends who don&#8217;t want to do agencies at all. I understand, because I work in agencies so I can understand why that wouldn&#8217;t be for everyone.</p>
<p>As an employer I can see why employers would see that as exciting because it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Wow. This person knows how to kind of function in a little bit of chaos. They may be good here.&#8221; Some people don&#8217;t know how to function in that little bit of chaos. Depending on the type of jobs or internships you&#8217;ve had prior, you may not have dealt with this kind of chaos. You may have been in-house, probably had one brand. That one brand that&#8217;s probably not super dependent where you selling something every day. You just kind of, not coasted, you ain&#8217;t coast, but your workload was different.</p>
<p>Agency, you could be on three brands doing campaigns for three different projects that are completely different. They have the deadline of four days between the three, they just slightly staggered. That&#8217;s not what it should be like, but that is what it&#8217;s like sometimes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You know what? Thank you for saying that. I have asked that question to so many people and the response I get is almost like they&#8217;re ruining the first rule of fight club. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, well I can&#8217;t tell. If you don&#8217;t have it, you don&#8217;t have it.&#8221; Even my personal experiences with trying to work at agencies, they&#8217;ll look at my work and be like, &#8220;Oh. Well, you&#8217;ve done all this tech stuff. We&#8217;re really looking for agency experience.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t get agency experience if I don&#8217;t work at an agency.&#8221; I&#8217;m glad that you mentioned what that distinction is.</p>
<p>I get. It makes sense mean. From the other folks that I&#8217;ve had on the show that have worked at agencies, you do have the opportunity to work on lots of different projects. It can be kind of fast-paced, a little frenetic. Again, if you&#8217;re in-house and you&#8217;re only working on a brand or part of a brand or part of a product, it&#8217;s just different. It&#8217;s just a different type of workflow.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s very different. I often think when I&#8217;m on Twitter, I&#8217;m on Twitter quite often, but I&#8217;ll see someone, unfortunately when Twitter did all those layoffs, a lot of different people talked about different aspects of their job. Some of those people have very specific needs, I mean very specific rules. Some people were like, &#8220;I work just on bookmarks.&#8221; I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Only bookmarks? That&#8217;s all you did for Twitter? You work specifically on bookmarks?&#8221; That&#8217;s really interesting. I wonder what their day to day is. That&#8217;s tech, so it could be very &#8230; That&#8217;s not to say their life&#8217;s cushy, but if you&#8217;re working on just one thing &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a little cushy. A little cushy.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I would hope your job is some level of cushy from time to time. Every day can just be grinding nonstop. I would [inaudible 00:48:00]. You go, &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s cool. You get to work on this one thing and really refine this one thing.&#8221; There is a lot of pros to that, but some people could look at that as a con, because like I said, similarly to the creative director, art director thing, it seems like people are kind of smushing these roles together. They want somebody to be a bit of a Swiss Army knife.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s so tricky because in the tech world, at least what I&#8217;ve found, there&#8217;s just so much sort of needling down to specialty. They want specialists. They want a UX person that&#8217;s done work on a healthcare brand. They&#8217;re looking for a specific person that fits in that specific niche. It could be a person that&#8217;s done UX as more of a generalist, but if they haven&#8217;t done it for this brand or this type of company, then they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh. We&#8217;re looking for this one thing.&#8221; I&#8217;m kind of grossly generalizing this, so please, people don&#8217;t write to me and be angry. I find tech really wants specialists in very particular, finite roles and places, because even that can differ for company. Whereas, advertising is kind of more about, like you said, being a Swiss Army knife, someone that can do a lot of things at a particular level across a number of different brands.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s not bad. I don&#8217;t think being a specialist is bad. I don&#8217;t think being a general is bad. When somebody&#8217;s hiring, they could ask for whatever they want.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s wild man. It&#8217;s wild.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
It is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to somebody listening to this episode and they want to follow your example in being an art director. What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Network. I always tell people this for any field, but network heavily. Network. That means with people in your field and out of your field. It is good to know people because the more you get to know people, you get a better idea of not only what they&#8217;re capable of, but maybe what you&#8217;re capable of, which you didn&#8217;t even consider. Right now we&#8217;re talking about design and the design field, but there are a million other ways to be a part of the design field and be a part of this industry in one way or another, whether it&#8217;s a strategist or an account person. There&#8217;s a lot of other ways that can still utilize design thinking. You could have a good design taste, but be a project manager. You don&#8217;t necessarily have to be the person that&#8217;s in Photoshop. You could have a good design taste and be an account person. That doesn&#8217;t mean that you are a designer, but that means that you can at least do a good job backing up the designs that are being presented to clients. There are a lot of ways into this industry.</p>
<p>I think you need to talk to people and network with people to kind of figure that out. Hell, go on LinkedIn, man. Go on LinkedIn. If you ain&#8217;t got one, create on LinkedIn. Message absolute strangers. I think of it as back in the AOL days when people were just online like, &#8220;A/S/L, where you at,&#8221; but on LinkedIn. You type in project manager, if that&#8217;s what you want to be. You could literally type in project manager or senior project manager. A bunch of people will come up. You can narrow it down to your state, your country, whatever you prefer. I would just recommend you message somebody.</p>
<p>Hey, man. I&#8217;m a new kid who&#8217;s interested in project management. I see that you have a title that does this. Can I ask you about it? I&#8217;ve done some research on project management, but do you have a few minutes to tell me what you do or type? Why not? Right? You may not get response, but LinkedIn has unlimited people. You can do this all day. You can do it for five people a day. Somebody might respond. I&#8217;m saying that because I did that. I did that at times when it came to finding a job. I got an interview at ESPN a few years ago because of me doing that.</p>
<p>I was going online, looking up other things. I was like, hey, I&#8217;m interested in sports. Let me see what people were doing in this. I&#8217;m looking for recruiters. Recruiters, lot of times they&#8217;ve got the 411, they know what&#8217;s going on, they know what&#8217;s happening. I was just online looking up recruiters. All right, man, design recruiters or recruiter or whatever, narrow it down. Okay, cool. I&#8217;m not familiar with this recruiting agency. Let me reach out to one person that works there and tell them who I am and maybe they can at least give me on their list of creatives and then down the line they can push something out from me. I started those conversations. Somewhere along the way, somebody at ESPN got pushed my way. I was like, &#8220;Oh. That&#8217;s great.&#8221; I had an interview at ESPN. I would&#8217;ve never gotten one otherwise, probably just existing out here. People do and just get reached out to, but you can also play a little bit of active role. That&#8217;s networking.</p>
<p>I would highly recommend your network online, of course. I would also recommend you network work in person, the people you sit next to in class. Doug used to always say this to us, Professor Doug, our professor, as I always call him. He always said this. You&#8217;d be like, &#8220;The people who sit next to you in class, to your left, to your right front and the back, these might be the same people you end up working with. You never know which one of them end up giving you a job or you end up giving them a job or they end up recommending you for something or you end up recommending them for something.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have friends who finished in City Tech like I did, who did not get into design, who still reach out to me for design related jobs doing other things. They just reach out to me. They just like, &#8220;Oh, Kendell, I was thinking about you because this gig popped up.&#8221; Does that always mean I want it? No, but that opportunity is there from me just being a good person and being their friend for so long that they&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Oh. I thought of Kendell when I saw this.&#8221; There were 40 other people in his classroom, when we were teens learning this stuff, and he was like, &#8220;I thought Kendell when this position popped up. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m reaching out. What&#8217;s going on, Kendell? Network.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Network. I agree with that a hundred percent. That&#8217;s a really great thing I think people should all try to cultivate. Like you said, you never know when you&#8217;re going to need it. Don&#8217;t just do it when you&#8217;re in need. Continually network even when you&#8217;ve got the job, when you&#8217;re in the job, but just let people know that you&#8217;re always out there.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s how I met Danny. I met Danny through networking.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, was he not teaching at City Tech when you were there?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
No. When I was there, Danny had already graduated. He&#8217;s a few years older than me, so he had already graduated. I think I might have heard his name in passing because Professor Davis mentioned him a few times. At City Tech, I think they still have it, we had a design club. In the design club we would do this event called Meet the Pros. We&#8217;d bring the professionals to talk to the students. We&#8217;d also do an alumni version where we&#8217;d bring back people who graduated from City Tech who are working in the field. Danny was one of the people who they brought in.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t the president at the time, so I was just a part of the club. I wasn&#8217;t the one actively talking to them that had those conversations. Well, after the event was over, I was like, &#8220;Hey, man. You seem really cool. I appreciate everything you said in the talk, man. You want to stay in touch?&#8221; Then we just stayed in touch. Now we&#8217;re good friends. We are very good friends.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, aside from work, you are a podcaster. You co-host a show called TerrorNova. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
That&#8217;s my baby. TerrorNova, it&#8217;s a horror podcast as it says in the title. It&#8217;s TerrorNova Horror Podcast. Me and actually one of my fellow alumni from City Tech, Jackie, Jacqueline Martinez, we both were fans of horror. We&#8217;re both really big fans of horror.I grew up watching horror. She grew up watching horror. We&#8217;re both massive fans of horror. Even when we were City Tech, whenever I needed somebody to talk about horror movies, it was usually her. Now we&#8217;ve got Get Out and all that, so a lot more people get into horror. Before that, a lot of people weren&#8217;t as broley into horror. Me and her would always chop it up and watch horror movies, whether it was digitally sending each other the link or just talking generally about horror movies.</p>
<p>I was like, &#8220;Man, she&#8217;s always my go-to for this. This is great.&#8221; Then during the pandemic, we had that, I guess you could say two years or a year where everybody going through different stuff, everybody&#8217;s figuring stuff out. We had a little bit of that slowdown when it was kind of like you just stay in the house. Then after that two weeks slowdown, we still had a bit of a slowdown. I was like, &#8220;Man, I kind want to do something. I want to do something that&#8217;s fairly positive, but also enjoyable and doesn&#8217;t really feel like a job, but it is something I could have fun with.&#8221;</p>
<p>I listened to a lot of podcasts. I was like I guess I could do a podcast, but what would I want to do it about? I didn&#8217;t want to do it generally. I wanted to be very specific about what I talk about. Horror just popped in my head. I was like, sure, why not? I love horror. Let me see if there are any podcasts out there to talk about horror. There were a few and I was like, okay, cool. There&#8217;s a little bit of market for this. Let me have some fun with this. I want to do it with a co-host, I don&#8217;t want to do it by myself. Then Jackie came to mind. I reached out to her. I was like, &#8220;Hey. I have an idea for a horror podcast. Do you want to do it? If you don&#8217;t do it, I probably won&#8217;t do it.&#8221; Then she was like, &#8220;Okay. I&#8217;ll think about it. You know what? Yeah, sure. Why not? Let&#8217;s do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then we kind of jumped in. We have a horror podcast. We talk about movies, we talk about TV shows, we do topics. We started doing kind of more autobiography type episodes where we highlight your figure and talk about their relationship with horror. Yeah. We do everything horror. It&#8217;s really, really fun, man. To go back to that whole community thing, there&#8217;s a really big horror community everywhere, honestly, but definitely on Instagram as well. We found some really interesting people on there. We&#8217;ve brought people on as guests from all different walks of life. I had people from London who came on, people from Texas, people from just all over. They were just like, &#8220;Hey, man. If you ever in town, let us know we&#8217;ll hang.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just kind of an extension of the stuff I was doing when I was in high school with Xanga, but now I&#8217;m doing it not to pick out women, but to meet new people who also like horror. It came full circle.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What has podcasting as a medium taught you? Has it taught you anything that you kind of take back with you in your work as an art director?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
It taught me to be clearer with my thoughts. Not even just as art director, as a human being, it is sometimes hard to clarify your thoughts. You have so many of them going through your head, especially at once, even before someone probably even asks you a question. Just someone can say a statement, you have a hundred things running through your head. I&#8217;m really big on trying to be clear about what I&#8217;m saying when I say something. That is probably one of the biggest things I try to be hard on myself about. When I say something, do I mean what I&#8217;m saying and is it clear what I mean what I&#8217;m saying? I don&#8217;t want to misinterpret or mislead someone. I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s in part because of a lot of the fake news stuff going around in the world and fake thoughts and fake opinions that people have about stuff. I try to be very clear on my thoughts.</p>
<p>The podcast has been a huge help for that, because we end up talking about horror movies. We always say the podcast is for people who horror movies and even for people who don&#8217;t horror movies, whether it&#8217;s you don&#8217;t want to watch them or you&#8217;re too scared to watch them. The podcast is for those people as well because it&#8217;s not that we spend a bunch of time talking about the guts and people being ripped in half. We spend time talking about how the characters feel and how the characters are relatable and how there&#8217;s a scene and the themes and the socioeconomical version of this stuff, the race. All of these things that make these movies, these movies that people go, &#8220;Oh. That&#8217;s [inaudible 00:58:47] culture.&#8221; No, all of these things were written and baked into the film for a reason. We&#8217;re not making this up.</p>
<p>We spend time talking about all of that. It forces me to get clearer about what I&#8217;m saying because I&#8217;d never want to say something and people would just go, &#8220;That person&#8217;s being crazy,&#8221; or, &#8220;That person&#8217;s making stuff up,&#8221; or, &#8220;That person&#8217;s being hateful,&#8221; or, &#8220;That person&#8217;s being ridiculous.&#8221; I try to be very clear in my thoughts and it translates to my job a lot because often as the art director, even the designer, you have to just explain your decision making. Even if you wow somebody with a design, the person still probably wants to know the logic behind it because [inaudible 00:59:25] the design is nice, but if it&#8217;s not on brief and it&#8217;s not hitting the goal, not hitting the mark, it just looks good and that doesn&#8217;t help anymore.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is your favorite contemporary horror movie?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Of the past few years? Something recent?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;d even go say the past decade or so.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Actually, no, I&#8217;m going to just go with something fairly recent that I really enjoyed. There was this horror movie that came out recently called Pearl that I thought was really the great. I saw it in theaters three times.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, I think I saw a trailer to that movie. I think the setting is in the twenties or something. Is this the movie I&#8217;m thinking of? I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Kind of, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think the lady that&#8217;s in it is Mia Goth, I think.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah, Mia Goth. It&#8217;s set around I think a time of World War II.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. She&#8217;s like an actress or something, right? You can tell I watch a lot of movies.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
[inaudible 01:00:20] you only saw the trailer then I can understand why you wouldn&#8217;t know what it is. She&#8217;s a farm girl in a lot of ways. Her family grew up on a farm. They&#8217;re German, so they in some ways fled from Germany during a war and all of that stuff. She just wants to get off this farm. She has aspirations of being a star, whether it&#8217;s a singer or actor, she has these aspirations. She grew up on a farm. The way her life is going there&#8217;s probably no chance that she&#8217;ll see those aspirations come to life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
The thing that makes it interesting is the style of it. I tell people it&#8217;s The Wizard of Oz of it was a slasher because it&#8217;s not styled like a dark and grim horror movie. It&#8217;s styled very beautifully with bright colors and mostly during the day, similarly to Midsommar. It&#8217;s styled really interesting, which kind of in some ways is a reflection of how the main character sees the world. I could talk about it all day. It&#8217;s very interesting stylistically how they did the movie versus what the messages of the movie are and the themes that are super relatable about identity and self and all that stuff. It&#8217;s like it&#8217;s a really, really well done movie.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. It&#8217;s clear that horror is certainly a big thing for you. It&#8217;s something that you really love. What are some other influences for your creative work? Is it any people in particular? Any things in particular?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I wouldn&#8217;t say a specific person or anything like that. Just like when I was a kid, I&#8217;m a fan of stuff. I love science fiction. I love action movies. I love every genre of everything. I try to take pieces of that with everything I do. Just how I tell stories, how stories are told, how I design. I try to take all of these things into account when I&#8217;m working. I wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;m inspired by any specific visual style or specific person. Honestly, life just inspires me. Life inspires me. The people I get to have conversations with, the people I meet, the characters I see in movies and TV shows, all of those things inspire me. I&#8217;m not inspired by any specific graphic designer. I&#8217;m sure there are better designers than me in the world, but I&#8217;m not heavily inspired by super great graphic designers. I&#8217;m inspired by super great storytellers and super great stories that I&#8217;ve seen unfold that feel very human, they feel very grounded.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
At this stage of your career, do you feel creatively satisfied?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Surprisingly, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Why surprisingly?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
I say surprisingly because, man, you would expect the corporate world to kind of beat you down. There&#8217;s always that tragic story of the artists of they got in it because they love it and then somewhere along the way money got involved and they hate it. I could see that very easily happening in this field as well to people. Trying to fill a lot of bellies, [inaudible 01:03:03] task of a designer or honestly even any world you have in this field. You&#8217;re trying to fill a lot of stomachs, man. Whether it&#8217;s account people, the clients, strategy, yourself, creative. There&#8217;s a lot of people that have go to get fed before an idea goes out into the world and actually exist.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of battles that people have to fight for their work to be seen by the general public. You would think with all of those challenges in front of you that some people end up hating this, but I actually surprisingly still enjoy it. I do enjoy these conversations. I enjoy the people that I work with. I enjoy the people that I&#8217;ve worked with in the past, whether we had disagreements or not, because I&#8217;ve learned something from them, whether it was about myself or about them. Honestly, if it was just about myself, how do I handle a situation? How do I handle moments where things feel like it&#8217;s too tough and they feel impossible? How do I handle moments where I spent a lot of time on a design and then someone goes, &#8220;Let&#8217;s just change the whole thing.&#8221; How do I handle that? How do I bounce back from that?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been satisfying, man, how I&#8217;m bouncing back for these things and how I learn from them and how I get better from project to project. It&#8217;s been very satisfying.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, when I had you back on the show again, this was 10 years ago, I asked you where do you see yourself in the next five years? You had mentioned that you wanted to create a product that you can build a company around. Granted, since then you&#8217;ve worked for agencies and such, but at this stage of where you&#8217;re at now with your career, where do you see yourself in the next five years?</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Oh, man. That&#8217;s a good question. I forgot I told you about that. That was back when I was working on this bike app idea that I had. I still have that somewhere. I think in the next five years, man, I feel like I still see myself doing this. Maybe my title will probably go up, but I still see myself doing design or possibly even still pharma, but I&#8217;ll see. I still see myself just enjoying this field, man. I&#8217;m not tied to any specific industry in terms of which one I [inaudible 01:05:01] or not. I just really enjoy what I do. It&#8217;s a good time. You get to meet interesting people and they get to tell you interesting stories. You get to live a pretty interesting life when you make it in there.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not flying to Dubai every week or something for photo shoots or anything like that. I&#8217;ve done very little of that in my career. The type of people you meet and the type of stories you get to hear people tell and that you get to tell yourself, from the projects you work on, it&#8217;s really interesting and priceless, man. I really enjoy it. I kind of just see myself still going down this road of in some ways where the winds takes me, but in some other ways, I&#8217;m just enjoying this space.</p>

You could add me on LinkedIn. You can look me up, my name, Kendell Burton. It should be in a show notes and everything. You could add me on LinkedIn, feel free too. You could follow me on Twitter if you like. Honestly, on Twitter, I don&#8217;t really talk about the field much. I just kind of enjoy the craziness of Twitter. Enjoy the memes and the wild stuff people say on Twitter. That&#8217;s pretty much what I&#8217;m doing on there. I guess if you want to laugh along with me about the crazy stuff that happens on Twitter, then feel free to follow me there. My name is theKendellB.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my name on most things. You can find me on Instagram, same way, where you can follow my podcast, which is exclusively on Instagram. I just don&#8217;t want it bounced between a million platforms. The podcast TerrorNova is only on Instagram, but you can listen everywhere. It&#8217;s on Spotify and all that stuff. Yeah. So LinkedIn or Twitter, or Instagram. Those three places, best places to find me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Kendell Burton, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you for, I think, honestly for just showcasing how much your enthusiasm and passion for what you do. To me, it just sort of permeates through everything you talk about, your life story, your story of working through the industry and things like that. I can tell that you really have this innate, deep, burning passion for it. That&#8217;s something that I think we all need to kind of work to try to cultivate, find what it is that sort of lights your pilot light.</p>
<p>I get the sense from you that really this is something that you&#8217;re super passionate about. I&#8217;m excited to see what you end up doing next, man. Thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Kendell Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. I appreciate it, man. I appreciate the invitation to come here and talk to you again, man. It&#8217;s a pleasure. It&#8217;s great. For everyone listening, man, just find what you like, man. Find what you like and just strap yourself to it, the best way you can, because you&#8217;ve got to enjoy life.</p>

<p>By now, you&#8217;ve gotten acquainted with design educator and design strategist Andrew Bass Jr. In the second part of our interview, we explore Andrew&#8217;s calling as a design mentor, as well as his early advocacy work for diversity in the design industry. (If you missed the first part, <a href="/andrew-bass-jr-part-1-of-2/" data-wpel-link="internal">check it out here</a>.)</p>
<p>We start off talking about Black design leadership back in the day, and Andrew tells the story of how he learned about the Organization of Black Designers and how that led to his work leading AIGA&#8217;s first Diversity and Inclusion Task Force. From there, we discuss the current state of DEI with AIGA and the design industry, and he shares what gets him excited about design now at this stage of his career. It&#8217;s really an honor and a privilege to talk with Andrew about his longevity in design and about leaving a legacy for generations to come!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You mentioned when you were at Prats that you saw you had Black design professors and stuff like that. Once you got out there as a working designer, did you see a lot of Black folks in design leadership back then?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
No. That was the unicorn. I was in the libraries. That was one of the things all through my years as a student to my beginning years as a practicing professional, I would hit all the design annuals, books to see who&#8217;s leading in the industry to kind of know names. And I kept coming across the same thing. It was always white men. It was always white men. Eventually it started opening up a little bit where you see the spattering of white women, but it was all predominantly white men. And I barely, barely ever saw anyone Black, Latino. Occasionally there may be a spot, a spot of an Asian. And again, usually it would be a guy, but it was very much pure white and that&#8217;s all I ever saw. And I was actively searching to find, okay, there&#8217;s got to be more folks out there.</p>
<p>And then eventually I did find some folks out there, not through any of the exposure through manuals. At that time there were not a lot of big design conferences. I had not heard of AIGA at that point yet. Definitely there was no HOW. There was no HOW design. And there was Communication Arts because there was a lot of design magazines out back then. Print, design, communication, arts. What was the other one?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Step.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Step was there. Yep. Step. This is a Canadian one, Applied Arts, I think it&#8217;s called. Some other stuff. And so it was not until somewhere in around &#8217;93 in print when I saw Cheryl Miller&#8217;s article on, no, about Cheryl Miller, I should say. It wasn&#8217;t her article. Or was it her article? But it was in print about where are the Black designers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
And I read that article I don&#8217;t know how many times. Right now, these names. I&#8217;m like, who&#8217;s this person? Who&#8217;s that person? Oh wow. Because I had not seen that in any the quote general mainstream stuff. And that&#8217;s when I started learning that there were folks out there, and I started digging a little bit more into history. And that&#8217;s when I learned that there were a lot more that actually existed. And back in the day, just never given any exposure due to societal, the US view on race. So growing up I never saw any of the studios that I admired ever have any person of color in their leadership. And generally ones that I did find in leadership, they usually owned their own businesses. They had their own practices. I really am hard pressed to think of any leaders at any of these Fortune 500 companies throughout the nineties to even I&#8217;d say early 2000s. Nothing pops off in the top of my head. There&#8217;s always people doing their own thing.</p>
<p>And so a few years later, I think that was around &#8217;95, &#8217;96, that&#8217;s when I discovered HOW, HOW Magazine, which I sorely still miss today. That was a fantastic design magazine. Of all the other design magazines I had saw, they actually seemed to have tried to make an effort of showcasing designers of color and somewhat kind of touching the subject of diversity in the industry, because diversity didn&#8217;t exist back then in the nineties, that wasn&#8217;t a word. Some market chair came up with diversity. &#8220;Hey, I think this is going to be a good trend.&#8221; I was basically looking at it as like, fair is fair. It&#8217;s just not white folks out here. So I didn&#8217;t really started to see leadership until around then, around &#8217;95, &#8217;96 when I started seeing that and I started seeking them out. And then I learned Cheryl Miller was here in New York City, did actually meet her face to face. I think I did a freelance project with her.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Woo. She was tough too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I believe it. I believe it. A hundred percent. A hundred percent I believe that. Without a doubt.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
She knew her stuff and I understand why she was very sort of stern, because the industry, it was a very different mentality. She had to fend for herself and stuff and she was doing some major work. I also met Cynthia Mackenzie, I believe. She has a studio in New York too. CM something, something. Oh man, I met her and I was like, oh wow, okay. And then I started meeting some others, especially like I said, my professor Dwight Johnson, he&#8217;s the one who really started giving me some opportunities where he was connected to NBC. He got me to meet some people at NBC. No, I didn&#8217;t meet any Black people at NBC, but he started putting me onto folks that are out there. And then I started learning about Archie Boston, started learning about Tony Gable, rest in peace, started learning about Richard Baker. I started learning about, oh, oh, Eli [inaudible 00:10:29].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Maurice Woods. And that was a little later in the nineties. Oh, how could I forget about the south? It was where I&#8217;ve met her, Cynthia Worley.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, here in Atlanta.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah. And then also Turner. Turner. Illustrators where I first saw them in HOW, oh, I think the name is Turner, last name is Turner. I cannot remember their first name. They&#8217;re based in Atlanta. I think they&#8217;re still around. And I started learning about more folksm and I was like, whoa, how come they don&#8217;t get shined in these magazines? I just went into overdrive to try and find as much history as I could. That&#8217;s how I started finding it about Georg Olden. I&#8217;m still stuck on his story and the total disrespect I feel that the design industry has given him completely. And still, I wonder if I hadn&#8217;t brought up Georg Olden to Ric Gref√© back then before there was Design Journeys and all that. Because I had mentioned an idea on that, and they named the Design Journeys that they honored Georg Olden, what, two years after when I was on the task force, it just dissolved and then, oh, now you decide to award Georg Olden the Medal?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m like, you&#8230; Okay. But at least he got it. I just feel like there needed to be more of an acknowledgement to it. Honestly, I&#8217;m sorry, an apology. Because I read that he also had won an art director&#8217;s medal, art director&#8217;s club medal. But I could not find any records of that. I did not see any of that leadership until I kind of found it on my own. And I like the fact that they were leaders on their own. They didn&#8217;t wait for other people because they couldn&#8217;t get certain opportunities they made their own. John Morning, that&#8217;s the other name, John Morning. And they did it for themselves. It wasn&#8217;t until honestly 21st century, early 2000s that I started seeing Black leadership. I still say it wasn&#8217;t like top tier Black leadership, I still think some of it was just, okay, not semantics, but perceptions, start putting some folks here. So I think they&#8217;re more middle leadership, not top leadership. So even today at 2022, I mean, yeah, you have a few that truly you can say top leadership, but it&#8217;s nearly not enough. So it was very, very barren in those early years that you had to find it and dig to see it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember, and I want to talk about AIGA because that&#8217;s an important part of your story, but I remember when I first started doing Revision Path, I did a lot of research leading up to wanting to start this. And I came across those older magazines you mentioned like Step and Communication Arts is still around, but HOW, and I wonder actually for HOW, because HOW was based out of Cleveland I believe, or somewhere in Ohio, the Midwest.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Somewhere over there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I wonder if that informed the perspective they had because so many of these other design publications were out of New York. And so maybe for them it was through a more New York lens. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the case, but I remember doing a lot of that research and I would see where people would write a letter to an editor at Step or something and be like, &#8220;Well where are more Black designers?&#8221; And the magazine would be like, &#8220;Oh well we don&#8217;t know where they are and we can&#8217;t find them,&#8221; and all this sort of stuff. And I&#8217;m like-</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I was one of those that wrote a letter.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was like, they&#8217;re out there. But then granted, this is also a time before the&#8230; Well, I don&#8217;t want to say necessarily before the internet, but really more before the worldwide web when where people could create these destinations for people to go to. I discovered the internet, or the worldwide web I should say in high school in the mid nineties. I was in a lot of places I probably shouldn&#8217;t have been just in terms of the fact that the Web was just such a big place. So there were things like AOL Black Voices and Africana.net and NetNoir and all those places. So there were obviously places where people were trying to create these destinations for Black people. But I don&#8217;t think those social connections really became prevalent until of course the 2000s with the advent of social media and stuff.</p>
<p>So I was doing my research to try to start Revision Path and I would see that a lot of people were asking these questions, and the editorial boards would just shrug their shoulders. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where they&#8217;re at. I don&#8217;t know where they are.&#8221; And I remember through that research also discovering, or finding out, I should say, about the organization of Black designers and how they kind of started out in the Midwest. I think it was either in Chicago or somewhere in Ohio, but starting out there and then building things out. Did you know about them back then?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Oh that&#8217;s a whole nother story.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, I did. I found out about them early nineties. Actually because I found out about them and that&#8217;s how I found out about Fo Wilson and Michele Washington. Yeah, see now these names are coming back. Michele, she&#8217;s a teacher at City Tech right now. Yeah, I know about OBD and I actually went to one of their conferences. I can talk about that after AIGA because that&#8217;s a whole nother thing. So I lose track of where we going with AIGA.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, let&#8217;s talk about that. So you mentioned Ric Gref√© who was I think a longtime executive director.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, he was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
For AIGA, and you kind of worked with them back in the mid 2000s to-</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
2016, 2017. [inaudible 00:16:38]. Yeah, actually, yeah, you&#8217;re right. Earlier.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve been a lot earlier. Yeah, because Ric, I think Ric retired or left or something.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Sorry, it was 2006, 2007, 2008.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, okay. Yeah, right around that time. Because I think Ric left I want to say in 2013, 2014, something like that. But you had worked with AIGA to not only create the diversity and inclusion task force but also serve as chair. Tell me what that was like, because if diversity was not even in the conversation with regards to the design community, how much of a uphill battle was that?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Shoot, I don&#8217;t even think we even got the first step. Honestly looking back, it was all for show. It was all for show. How that all came about was Step in Design had an article based on women in design, very good article, very interesting. I was kind of starstruck that, not starstruck, I was kind of awestruck that out of all these listing of women designers, how come there weren&#8217;t any people of color in them? I think there was one, and I think it was Lucille, and I never really know how to pronounce her name, but Tenazas, Lucille Tenazas, she&#8217;s a name in the industry, [inaudible 00:18:01]. So I believe she might be either Filipino or-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
She&#8217;s Filipino. I know who you&#8217;re talking about, Lucille Tenazas or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yes, yes. And I was like, you got one person on here. There&#8217;s a whole lot of other people out here. So I wrote a letter to Step in Design at that time just saying, &#8220;Hey, great article, cool and that, but hey, you&#8217;re kind of lacking X, Y, and Z.&#8221; And I rolled off some names that I knew of, such as Cheryl Miller, Of Wilson, Michele Washington. And just questioning, if you&#8217;re going to do a compilation like that, you really need to be a more thoughtful and full approach in doing these kind of compilations. And at the time the editor in chief there, Emily Potts, actually replied back to me via my email. I was like, ooh, I didn&#8217;t know I was going to get an actual response. And she actually struck up this conversation, I should say we struck up this conversation and she had told me she was having conversations with Bill Grant at the time who was AIGA president, right? Yeah, yeah. Board of director president.</p>
<p>And that was one of his issues. He wanted to expand AIGA&#8217;s reach, and so that it becomes more inclusive to people and stuff like that. And she told me, would I be interested in talking with him and that she&#8217;ll put me together with him. And I said, &#8220;Sure, I don&#8217;t mind talking. Talking&#8217;s free, not going to hurt nobody.&#8221; So within the span of I guess a day she got me in touch with him and he called me at home, because I think it was some sort of holiday because I know I was there with the kids because they were upstairs. I had to go in the basement because they were so loud. And we were just talking and he was telling me about his idea that he wanted to start up this task force about diversity for AIGA and would I be interested in helping out with it if I had any thoughts on it. And so I kind of told them some of my thoughts and what it is and stuff like that. That&#8217;s when the conversation started shifting to hard left that I did not anticipate, was that, &#8220;How about you serve as chair?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wait, this ain&#8217;t even a real task force yet. You want me to be chair?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, because you have your ideas and what you&#8217;re thinking with something like that. How about you lead the task force?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; Because I was kind of hesitant because I was not an official member of AIGA at this point. I&#8217;d always worked with AIGA, like some sort of ghost warrior on the end on the outside. But I never actually paid for a membership. But somehow I kept finding myself at AIGA events. And so I was like, all right, let&#8217;s talk. And he said there was a few people who are of like minds with this. And so we met, we talked, and I sincerely felt he actually wanted to do this. That he had a desire to see this happen and that to affect some sort of philosophical change within AIGA in the industry. And I was like, okay, that&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s when I first met Ric. I went to a couple of their leadership meetings out in San Francisco to talk about the task force. I mean, I should have kind of seen it then when I gave that speech, I forgot who, it was with somebody else that we were talking. I can&#8217;t remember who it was. It was a last minute addition to the leadership summit. I kind of took that some kind of way. This was like, okay, it was last minute, but you&#8217;re president. Because he was in his last year. Now, I don&#8217;t know how much pushback he might have gotten, and having the experience I&#8217;ve had now I kind of understand maybe why he was trying to push it through his last year. Because I think he really did meet a lot of resistance. And so I think he just found a way to pigeonhole it in there and stuff.</p>
<p>Our presentation was sort of last. I really can&#8217;t remember who the other person was. But the response from the leaders there, these were chapter leaders about, well, in terms of this diversity task force and chapters looking at it, what if we don&#8217;t have any people of color here? Basically let&#8217;s put it straight. What if we don&#8217;t have any Black people? And I was like, &#8220;Okay, diversity does not mean just Black people.&#8221; I explained to them diversity means a group collection of different voices. And I said, &#8220;Just because there may not be any Black folks there, Latino folks, Asian folks there, you as white folks can still talk about diversity. There is different white folks too. There&#8217;s also the gay community, this disabled community. You can talk about diversity and how you can address practitioners of design who have been left out.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can be a participant and not some sort of like, well if you need help I&#8217;ll be over here but I&#8217;m not going to do anything until you ask me. The kind of snide blow back getting from that at that time kind of told me what we were headed for. But I was like, all right, fine. This is about education. Let&#8217;s school folks. Yes, I knew some chapters, they don&#8217;t have any Black people around. They probably not even been in the same room with a Black person, let alone anybody else. So back in New York, formulating these plans with the&#8230; Well actually, no, we were doing that in San Francisco. We started burgeoning a task force. It was, oh man, I&#8217;m so bad with names. I think Jose Nito out from Boston, Tracy Woods from St. Louis. There&#8217;s a brother down south, can&#8217;t think of his name. I see his site in my head. A white lady from DC, I can&#8217;t remember her name, and somebody else.</p>
<p>We were sort of like the initial pool. And so we started trying to put up strategies, what we&#8217;re going to do, what&#8217;s going to be the tenant of the task force, what are some of the things we&#8217;re going to try and achieve? How do we talk to chapters about this? And I was assured that the New York chapter, not New York chapter, because it&#8217;s always tricky because New York chapter is the headquarters. So it&#8217;s like, we were assured that headquarters would be a hundred percent behind this. Ric said, &#8220;Yeah, we&#8217;re going to do this.&#8221; I think Emily Woods is a name. I don&#8217;t know if she was on the board or if she was from DC, but there was some board members there or staff members from headquarters that were going to help coordinate this, set up some workshops, help supplement our plans. In meetings that I had with Ric, I talked about some of my ideas and some of the research that I had, which I still have a copy of that letter, where essentially I outlined the plan of what needs to be done with diversity task force in the infancy stage.</p>
<p>Because I knew, okay, I&#8217;m not going to hit you up with everything, because we got to convince you guys just to do a little bit first, and let&#8217;s test the waters to see how serious you are about this before wasting all of our time doing this. And I basically was telling him first and foremost, you can acknowledge now the invisible designers out here, the invisible pioneers both past and present. And that&#8217;s when I mentioned the idea that became Design Journeys. My plan was for that to be a roving exhibition going from chapter to chapter to chapter like they do with other stuff. Gave them a whole list of current, at that time current because this was a 2006, current and past design professionals that they could focus on and recognize for not only just AIGA and [inaudible 00:26:05] but just to make up for the, what&#8217;s the word I&#8217;m looking for? The blind eye that they existed and then set paths for people.</p>
<p>And again I was assured, yeah, we&#8217;re going to do this, we&#8217;re going to help put this through. And so as I tried to set up, oh that was Cooper, from Cooper Design in Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, I forgot her name, her first name. As we were beginning to do and set up these programs with the assurances that Ric, the headquarters was going to be behind us, started having as we tried to put these planning meetings together more and more of this initial task force, the participation wasn&#8217;t existing. Folks, some of them checked out. There was only about three of us who were actively meeting, confirming, talking and trying to set stuff up. As they sort of slid off to the back burner, like oh we&#8217;re engaging in the conversations or attending the meetings, as we try to put plans to Ric and the headquarters team as, okay, can we set this up? They&#8217;re like, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to pass it to the board and talk about stuff and see if we can get allocations and resources.&#8221; Nothing ever happened. It was always a talk, &#8220;We&#8217;ll get back to it.&#8221; Let&#8217;s talk about this. What can we do?</p>
<p>And that went on for about a year of just, okay, we&#8217;ll get back and talk about it. And I was really getting very frustrated and pissed off about it because I&#8217;m like, okay, it&#8217;s like this has been set up to fail from get go. Headquarters is not doing anything. And then I got half this task force team that is MIA. The three of us can&#8217;t do all this stuff. And I&#8217;m not going to say the three people that were there. I&#8217;ll keep that out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh man. No, I&#8217;m kidding.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
But they were very active. And the funny thing is they were active because we all shared the same thing. We were all people of color. Those who were active members on this. With the exception of the lady from DC, the white lady from DC, I have to say she was actually very active too. So it was from a biased perspective so to speak. We had a vested interest in this happening. Did not get that same vested interest from headquarters and from some of the task force members. And so as those task force members started whittling away, tried to shift the focus on, all right, let&#8217;s just stick with the task force members that are here and try and get at least something jumped off from headquarters.</p>
<p>They tied the diversity task force into their mentoring program because it was high school art and design. Well, predominantly most of the students are Black, Latino and Asian. But I was like, but that&#8217;s already in place. I mean yeah we can kind of put that, but if you&#8217;re trying to set this as a standalone, we got to do something that puts us out first. How about we first move with, at the time I had The Invisible Designer, but it became Design Journeys. I said, &#8220;How about this exhibition? Now let&#8217;s start introducing folks to these names.&#8221; Then there was this whole thing about money, how would it be, would it be a roving thing? Who can we put together? And that&#8217;s what I learned about the bureaucracy. AIGA is ridiculous. Which I think is on purpose because they definitely can move stuff when they want to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m holding my tongue so much. But yeah, go.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I mean the biggest, I&#8217;d say two of the biggest programs that they definitely move fast was women in leadership, women in design, I forgot that. And then the voting. Oh, they&#8217;re moving heaven and earth to do that. And granted, yes, the women in leadership, great. You still didn&#8217;t focus on anybody of color in there. Still a whole lot of white people. But you can move heaven and earth for that. You can&#8217;t do it for there, where there could be potential sponsorship opportunities here, where you can get Adobe into this. You can get vendors that this is a necessary need because this broadens the industry. And quite honestly, if you just want to go business wise, increases your sponsor&#8217;s customer base. Because we all use the products that they do. We have to, this is our industry. So through all that, my time spent there was, like I said, we barely got a foot because it was all meetings and back and forth and conversations, like okay, we&#8217;re going to set this up.</p>
<p>All these emails that would have back and forth, I&#8217;m like, can we do something? And because of that inaction, basically most of the members left because they were like, &#8220;Okay, nothing&#8217;s going to happen.&#8221; And then eventually I was told, you know what, this chairpersonship should be every year, which I agree it should be every year. But I&#8217;m like, look, we haven&#8217;t even done anything yet. Because the next chairperson after that was Jose Nito, who was part of the original task force. And they still didn&#8217;t do anything. They still didn&#8217;t do anything. But then it was, what was it, in 20&#8230; When was the first design studios thing? When they got their promos and everything, they held it at AIGA headquarters. That was in 20 something? Twenty&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know when that might have been.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
2015, 2016. Maybe it was earlier than that. Maybe it was 20-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it might have been earlier than that.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Because the only thing I saw came out of it was that in 2008, a year after I just basically left and the new chairperson came on board for the D&#038;I task force, they awarded Georg Olden the medal. And I was like, all right, so you took something out of the list. And then the subsequent years I noticed they started pulling more of the names off that list, giving them AIGA medals. So I&#8217;m like, all right, cool. Now in the beginning a lot of it was the older ones, some passed, some were old. I don&#8217;t have the polite word to say, but I&#8217;m like all right. So at least you&#8217;re recognizing them, you&#8217;re still not giving a context to it. So it&#8217;s like a half assed kind of thing. It&#8217;s like, oh, let&#8217;s just do this. Because it definitely was done just to say, &#8220;Yeah, this is what we&#8217;re doing. We are recognizing diversity, we are recognizing our past invisible pioneers in the industry, and that&#8217;s all you need to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>They gave no context to it, anything like that. And then a few years later they started recognizing some living folks, which I&#8217;m like, all right, you can do a mix of living and past. It doesn&#8217;t have to be one year&#8217;s all dead, now you start going to living. But I noticed that they used quite a few of the names that was on the list that I provided. And I was like, all right, fine. At least something happened. I was like, I still think it&#8217;s for show. And then I got the bomb dropped in my mail when I got the promo card for the exhibition of Design Journeys. To say I almost felt like going down the AIGA headquarters and lightening it up. I was pissed because they created, I really thought it was just a empty shell of what it could have been. It definitely felt like a lip service. Definitely. I mean, I wasn&#8217;t doing it for any acknowledgement or anything like that, but the way they did it where it just was born out of them pissed me off to no end.</p>
<p>Still pisses me off to no end. Because every conversation I have with them is like, oh, we didn&#8217;t know you brought this to them. And I&#8217;m like, you mofos, it&#8217;s right there in black and white. Emails, letters. It&#8217;s like, yeah, yeah, okay, whatever. When I went to the thing, because they gave me it like, &#8220;Oh come down, Design Journeys, blah blah blah, this little promo.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, you didn&#8217;t even spend the money for the kind of promos you do for everything else. It&#8217;s this matte cardboard thing that looks like it came out my own printer. I was just ashamed to see that.</p>
<p>And I went down there, it was just basically a wall of some names, and I&#8217;m like, this is really not a true testament to folks&#8217; legacies and their work. I mean, you&#8217;re not even showing the full showcasing of their space, not their space, but of their actual work and what they went into. I was not a fan of it. I thought the exhibition design, I didn&#8217;t particularly like. And then they turned it into this exercise of, &#8220;What is diversity to you?&#8221; And it turned out was AIGAs membership at that time, it was still predominantly white folks coming in. I&#8217;m reading some of this stuff and I just got offended by some of the stuff that I was reading there. &#8220;Diversity is having some Black people, some white people. It&#8217;s about listening to a different perspective you don&#8217;t necessarily have.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, okay, you&#8217;re not really getting to the root of what it&#8217;s supposed to be.</p>
<p>Whiteboard exercise they had. I&#8217;m like, that means absolutely nothing. Because people are going to go in there, they&#8217;re drinking their little wine. &#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s do this because I&#8217;m down for the cause,&#8221; and then next day what cause, what are you talking about? So that incensed me. And I was just kind of done with AIGA at that point because all the conversations I had with Ric, in the beginning it started pleasant and nice but towards the end he definitely could tell my frustration. And I did start getting a bit raw, which I don&#8217;t think anyone&#8217;s ever talked to him raw before, he&#8217;s high in academia and stuff. But I was like, at that time &#8220;I&#8217;m done with this bullshit. This is crap.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;You&#8217;re not doing anything.&#8221; And then he retires, and they give him a big send off and I&#8217;m like, all right. Yeah, you did great for AIGA, but you left a huge part of your membership underwhelmed.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s how that came to be, this leadership. I never really felt like I got a chance to do anything with the task force because it was such a step. The thing is, while going through all this, I came to City Tech because I was now teaching there and I would talk to Dorothy Hayes and that&#8217;s when I bumped into her and I was like, &#8220;Hey, by the way, let me tell you about we&#8217;re doing this diversity task force for AIGA.&#8221; She was like, &#8220;Oh God.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;What do you mean oh God?&#8221; &#8220;You do know that&#8217;s not the first time they&#8217;d done that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Was like, &#8220;We tried to do that in the seventies. Me,&#8221; meaning her, Dorothy Hayes and a few others, &#8220;And we got nowhere.&#8221; She told me, &#8220;Don&#8217;t trust AIGA. They&#8217;re going to give you the runaround. They&#8217;re going to make you think they&#8217;re doing all this stuff. You&#8217;re going to do all this work and it&#8217;s going to leave you empty.&#8221; They will find an excuse why they can&#8217;t do stuff. Because she said they&#8217;re not interested, they&#8217;re really not interested. They don&#8217;t see the value in it.</p>
<p>And that I have to say came to fruition. To this day I still don&#8217;t think AIGA values what really D, E and I really means about, because at this point I&#8217;m even saying that diversity, get rid of that word. That&#8217;s becoming a trend word. It is very much about inclusion. It is more about being included in the conversation.</p>
<p>Diversity means, okay, I got a representative here, there, there, we&#8217;re good. Those representatives don&#8217;t mean nothing. It&#8217;s like you come here, you can&#8217;t say nothing, don&#8217;t be seen. Just look good. At this point it is about inclusion and equity. Giving me that same access to that power pie that you have and not the crumbs. I don&#8217;t want the crumbs, I want the pie. I don&#8217;t think they value that. I don&#8217;t think they understand the value of it or intentionally underplaying it. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>So those early years to the subsequent later time that I came back onto the task force with AIGA under a different leadership, Julie, Julie Anixter, who I actually liked, I thought she was on point because it all comes down to leadership. Because at the time it was Bill Grant who was pushing this, but his term ended. The next president came in. He had a completely different agenda and it was not about D&#038;I. No. I forgot what he was working on. And then subsequently every board president after that has not picked up the ball with diversity. Let me stop saying diversity. With inclusion and equity.</p>
<p>And then they brought in Julie. At that time, the task force leader then was Jacinda Walker.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Jacinda Walker, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
And Jacinda I had met years ago from an OBD conference, and she was pegging me all these questions about a AIGA and I was telling her, because at the time I didn&#8217;t really know why. I was like, &#8220;All right, cool. You want to know about AIGA? Let me tell you the good, bad, ugly so you making an informed decision.&#8221; And she becomes the chairperson, which Jacinda has got energy for days. Which is great. I&#8217;m not that kind of person.</p>
<p>I loved how she reinvigorated, and actually that version of the task force got more stuff done than I ever seen. And I think a lot of it had to do with Julie. They were in sync. That got more traction and things going on, which reinvigorated me, honestly. I got reinspired. I didn&#8217;t want to do anything with leadership or anything like that. I was like, look, I&#8217;ll just be in the back. I&#8217;ll be a worker. Just put me in the back. I&#8217;ll work with you. I will say that was probably the best time working with AIGA was that iteration of the task force. From, I think I rejoined 2017 till 2018, until after Julie left. That was great. There was things happening and I really felt people were committed. That actually members were committed and that Julie was committed to it.</p>
<p>Now the board is another thing. Which at this point I feel the board has more power than the actual executive director of AIGA. I did not feel the same energy from the board. So with that, as we kept going through stuff and doing things and even the offshoots emerge, which was very interesting, and actually enjoyed working with that too. It was all about emerging designers, and that definitely was a more inclusive kind of recognizing designers and stuff like that. But Julie left, AIGA has gone through a major, major transformation. Seemed like they no longer support any of these programs. I haven&#8217;t seen anything about emerge. I no longer am a member of AIGA and won&#8217;t go back as a member of AIGA because during that last part, once Julie was gone, they had the interim CEO or interim executive director.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Barry.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, Barry. Somehow they got wind, I forgot, it was the engagement director or membership director who reached out to me. Because I had posted a Medium story about my frustration with AIGA, and they reached out to me probably just to cover their ass and for prep. &#8220;Oh we didn&#8217;t know this was going on. Explain this to us.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ll talk to you. I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m talking to you. You a membership person. What are you going to do?&#8221; Come to find out after I explain all this stuff, she left three days later, she had a new job.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So that went nowhere.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
That went nowhere. And I was like, okay, you guys are really wasting my damn time and you&#8217;re going to see Brooklyn come out with that if you keep going. So at that point I was like, I&#8217;m officially done. I&#8217;m officially done. Julie&#8217;s gone. I didn&#8217;t like how that went down. Definitely could see the support being pulled from the task force, left folks questioning what&#8217;s going on. So folks started peeling back and I was like, look, I&#8217;m not going through this road again. I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m officially done. I ended my membership the end of 2018. I let it lapse, I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not doing this anymore. I&#8217;ll join somebody else. I&#8217;ll go to SPD.&#8221; From that point on, I&#8217;ve just seen AIGA sort of disintegrate when they appointed the new executive director Bennie Johnson. Yeah, Bennie Johnson.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, Bennie F. Johnson.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I was like, oh wow. They actually appointed a Black man. And I&#8217;m like, now is that for show or are they actually really serious? But I hadn&#8217;t seen anything with AIGA after that. I slowly started seeing all the initiatives being peeled away. And then to now, D, E and I task force is just a picture on the webpage. That&#8217;s it. They don&#8217;t do anything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now Benny&#8217;s no longer the executive director, which will be news by the time people listen to this. But yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I mean, what, three years, again, that&#8217;s crazy. So essentially that signals one or two things to me. That AIGA definitely may be in its death knell, or two it really is lost in what it&#8217;s trying to be. It definitely does not serve its membership anymore. Definitely doesn&#8217;t serve a segment of its membership. Even though I still keep an eye on what AIGA is doing and some of the things, the conferences, don&#8217;t get me started on AIGA in New York because they do nothing. I don&#8217;t see anything there. I will say I do see more faces of color on the speaker panels, which instinctually I&#8217;ll say when I read the bios and stuff, I&#8217;m like okay, you got folks of color here but they&#8217;re still not creative leads. They&#8217;re from other industries. If this is a design conference, show me the Black design leadership. Show me the Latino design leadership. Asian American, not Pacific Asian, basically darker skin Asians. They&#8217;re not represented. But you still have what I say, the Eastern Asian representation. That&#8217;s still there. But you don&#8217;t really have in terms of when it comes to a whole lot of brown folks up there, that it is more from some ancillary industry.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m like and that&#8217;s great, you may have some inspirational stuff, but I want to know about people in my own industry, how they&#8217;re leading, how they&#8217;re faring, how their experiences to get where they&#8217;re going. I can&#8217;t relate to somebody that&#8217;s speaking from, I don&#8217;t know, they just got a motivational speaking company, I could care less about them. Give me somebody who&#8217;s leading a top design company. I want to know the trials and tribulations with that. So to me, I still see AIGA&#8217;s doing this sort of face paint. They&#8217;re really not digging into it. I don&#8217;t even see them really digging into some of the major things that they always used to do. It&#8217;s dialed very back.</p>
<p>So I just wonder how long is AIGA going to be around, and who&#8217;s going to pick up that vacuum? Because to me it feels like there is a emptiness there of addressing this issue. Leading into OBD, which I thought would be a good variant to AIGA, they don&#8217;t do much either. Because I got aware of them both around the same time as AIGA and OBD. Because I learned about OBD back in the early nineties and I just stumbled on it. I forget how I found out about that. I think it might have been in HOW design, where they were talking about the conference that they put on OBD did in Philadelphia back in I think &#8217;93, no, I think it was maybe &#8217;96.</p>
<p>It was full blown. I mean, I saw so many design professionals that looked like me in these companies I never heard about doing this amazing work that I really thought that was going to do something, and it did nothing. It went nowhere after that. But that&#8217;s a whole of other reasons of internal fighting and the genders and what are they really after. Seemed like it was somebody&#8217;s method of supporting themselves. It was just a lot of, again, empty promises that kind of went nowhere. That didn&#8217;t really help the community at large and stuff. But it did, at least that conference showed me that I wasn&#8217;t alone, and that was just the one thing I wanted to do with AIGA so that beginning students or students coming in to design know that they&#8217;re not alone. That there&#8217;s other people out here that look like them that may have similar stories so that they can look up to and aspire to.</p>
<p>I still try to do that to this day to let people know that you&#8217;re not alone. That there are folks out here. They may not get the shine but it&#8217;s up to us to give the shine to them and stuff. But that was the experience with AIGA.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. So much of what you described just now is point by point what my experience was like being on the D&#038;I task force with AIGA, it almost felt like your hands were tied at some point. You couldn&#8217;t say anything, you couldn&#8217;t do anything. We had a large amount of members, most of them never said a word. They just weren&#8217;t out there. And it was clear that for the people that were people of color that were out there, we were sort of being elevated more as the main group to the point almost where the group was more so associated with us personally than it was with AIGA.</p>
<p>And so when people started leaving, because when I came on, which was in 2014, Antoinette Carroll was a co-chair with this woman Aidan O&#8217;Connor who worked at AIGA. Antoinette was positioning to have a full-time diversity and inclusion employee at AIGA headquarters because she was making the case that this affects everything. This affects membership, this affects other organizations, having it as the side thing along with women in design and voting and stuff, it sort of takes it off of the main plate. It doesn&#8217;t give it as much prominence as it should. I know she was lobbying for that to happen. It didn&#8217;t happen. AIGA eventually hired this diversity and inclusion fellow I think who worked with the task force for a while. This guy named Obed Figueroa, he left and then people just started dropping off the task force left and right.</p>
<p>I left in 2017, not too long after Julie left the organization. And it&#8217;s funny you mentioned Jacinda. I brought Jacinda in.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Oh okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I had met Jacinda prior to AIGA through, I had heard about the work she was doing with the Organization of Black Designers and with this studio out in Cleveland called GoMedia. They were putting together this event called Weapons of Mass Creation Fest every year. And Jacinda was on their ass about how come you all do this every year in Black ass Cleveland and ain&#8217;t no Black people there, how is that? What is that? She was getting on them about it. That&#8217;s when I first learned about her, and then she knew about the stuff I was doing with AIGA, and I was like, &#8220;Well, you should join. I feel like you can take what you&#8217;re doing on this local level and really amplify it.&#8221; This is before I knew how much they would tie our hands to do anything. Everything had to go through a particular AIGA conduit. This woman that worked there&#8230;I&#8217;ll say it, she was racist. She was racist, hands down. I&#8217;m not going to say allegedly. She was racist.</p>
<p>We would mention stuff to her. And the thing was us, the people of color on the task force, put this together. We put two and two together and I was like, wait a minute, why is she telling you one thing and telling me another thing? And she&#8217;d send us these random emails that looked like a ransom note because she would copy and paste from all these different places, and it just pissed a lot of people off because it was like we can do more individually than being part of this task force with this organization, because you won&#8217;t let us say anything through AIGA. We can&#8217;t do anything. We couldn&#8217;t even get an Instagram profile. The Design Journeys and all that stuff, we would recommend people, they would never push that stuff through. A lot of us left after that.</p>
<p>I know Jacinda was chair for a while. I know she left. And I think the only person that might still be around, because after I left, I know Douglas Davis has been on the show before, he also teaches at City Tech. He was doing stuff with them. This woman out of DC, Phim Her was doing stuff. George Garrastegui who&#8217;s in New York was doing things, and Carlos Estrada who&#8217;s out of AIGA Detroit.</p>
<p>I want to say Carlos might be the last surviving member of the task force. Because I don&#8217;t think George is doing anything with them. I don&#8217;t think Pam is doing anything. I know Jacinda&#8217;s does not. I want to say Carlos is the last person standing. But the way that AIGA internally eroded that task force from within, I mean it was like an ulcer just eating away at everyone&#8217;s motivation. We were trying to do surveys and we were trying to do all sorts of things and everything would just get, nope, shot down, don&#8217;t want to do it, can&#8217;t do this, this, this, that and third.</p>
<p>And I was lucky to have Revision Path and still fall on that. And they did one or two features about Revision Path, but then people would say, &#8220;Well how come you have Maurice doing Revision Path and doing 28 Days of the Web and AIGA isn&#8217;t doing something like that?&#8221; And I was like, you got to talk to them about that. I don&#8217;t know nothing about how to get things on the website. It was a pain to get anything on the website because it had to go through another channel and it was a mess. It was an absolute mess. And what I left, and I rescinded my membership I want to say in 2017, 2018, I still sort of kept tabs with the organization, or rather I should say the organization kept tabs with me. Because they would would keep hitting me up about stuff and different chapters would hit me up and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Leave me alone. I don&#8217;t want to mess with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It got to the point, especially with my local chapter, with AIGA Atlanta, I literally had to go to them and say, &#8220;Keep my name out your mouth. I know you are using me, you&#8217;re dropping my name to get other people in here. You&#8217;re dropping my name about stuff. It&#8217;s coming back to me. Keep my name out your fucking mouth.&#8221; And to this day they don&#8217;t. I mean, it&#8217;s whatever. But I say all that to say Benny came on 2019, 2020 ish. And I had him on the show. We talked about the importance of him coming on as the first Black person in the organization&#8217;s hundred year history. I know there was a lot that he tried to do. The pandemic I think also just threw a wrench in a lot of things. And I&#8217;m not using that as an excuse, but I don&#8217;t know what AIGA is going to do now. Because like I said, by the time this airs, news would&#8217;ve went out that Benny is no longer the executive director. I don&#8217;t know who else they&#8217;re bringing in.</p>
<p>And as you&#8217;ve said, and as I know, D&#038;I through AIGA is only as strong as whomever the executive director is that&#8217;s championing for it. Without them being the person at the top to say, &#8220;We&#8217;re doing X, Y, Z,&#8221; nothing really happens. And I&#8217;ve been on the nominating committee for the board. So I see how the board operates, I know how that operates. And they do hold a lot of power. They can oust an ED. They&#8217;ve done it before. So I don&#8217;t know. AIGA is, look, if you are a designer and you hear the sound of my voice and you are actively paying dues to AIGA, and I&#8217;m not saying don&#8217;t do this, but I&#8217;m saying really take a hard look at what the organization provides for you as a modern designer.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I say modern because for a long time AIGA did not acknowledge UX. They didn&#8217;t acknowledge product design. And the reality is a lot of working designers now that work for tech companies or other places are UX designers. They are product designers. They&#8217;re experience designers. There are other designers that&#8217;s not just visual or web. I feel like the organization has started to acknowledge that a bit through some events. But what is the value of an AIGA membership to the modern designer? If you didn&#8217;t go to design school and picked up everything you know from YouTube or courses or a bootcamp or something and you&#8217;re working as a mid-level product designer at a tech company, what importance is AIGA going to be you? How is it really helping you as a career professional outside of just saying you&#8217;re a member?</p>
<p>I mean, I could be a member of the Subway Sub Club, but that don&#8217;t mean anything to the random, you know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m comparing this to RGD in Canada. If you&#8217;re an RGD member and you&#8217;re an RGD registered designer, that means something to companies because they found a way to really get themselves a part of the business community. I don&#8217;t think being an AIGA designer, now saying you&#8217;re a member of AIGA really means anything when you try to get a job or you&#8217;re talking to clients as a freelancer, I don&#8217;t think that means anything. It probably means something on a more local level depending on the visibility of the chapter.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But as a whole, what does it mean? So I&#8217;m not telling people to give up their memberships. I am asking them to take a hard look at the money that they&#8217;re paying and see, is it really worth it?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, you&#8217;re right. I mean, Canada, I&#8217;ve been contemplating moving to Canada mainly because of how the design community is looked at up there. I actually like the idea of registering as a graphic designer. I like that classification that Canada does because it seems like it has a more of a value added perk to you as a working professional and signifies that, hey, you know what you&#8217;re doing and you&#8217;re the real deal and that we&#8217;re going to help you with that.</p>
<p>I mean, for a whole host of reasons it&#8217;ll be like pulling teeth through I don&#8217;t know what in the US to do something like that. I don&#8217;t look upon AIGA in the same light as I did 20 years ago. I don&#8217;t look at it as like, oh, they&#8217;re going to help me. Because honestly, in my career, has AIGA ever got me a job? No. Has AIGA ever really connected me to any of the superstars within AIGA? No. I&#8217;ve met some in passing through meetings and workshops, but no one&#8217;s ever really vested any interest in trying to talk to me more than just, &#8220;Hey, how you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve actually been kind of shunned by some folks in AIGA. A lot of the events that I used to go to, every time I would kind of step in, I&#8217;d always get this look like, what are you doing here? Even when I went into the headquarters, last time I went to the headquarters for something, I forgot what it was. I mean, the staff there was looking at me, and they were younger than me, I mean, looking at me like who&#8217;s this Black man in here? What you doing?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I&#8217;m just like, ooh. So tell students that, I tell them AIGA is a good resource to find information. That&#8217;s what I look at AIGA as of right now. Just an information tool. I still think AIGA is very good in terms of the business information they have on there. It&#8217;s great. I don&#8217;t need to get in, I don&#8217;t need to talk to anybody about that. I can just pull off the information, look at the resources and stuff like that. Cool. You&#8217;re a great library for that. But for the true socialization and the true advancement for designers, as I&#8217;m seeing now as I guess I fall into the seasoned category now, I don&#8217;t see them doing anything about seasoned professionals. It&#8217;s more like you don&#8217;t exist. We&#8217;re only focused on designers up to 30.</p>
<p>I try to tell students it&#8217;s a good resource for that information. But as a member, really think about the value that you may get out of it. You go to some initial events to see how you think about it and see if you see any concrete pros and cons is going to help you personally from that experience. And being the fact that the national headquarters is the New York City chapter is a double edged sword, because the New York City chapter honestly to me is dead as a doornail. They don&#8217;t do much. They didn&#8217;t do much before Covid, they don&#8217;t do much now. And it&#8217;s like, so if you join that, what is it really helping? And I hate saying that to folks, but I don&#8217;t want them to go through the experience I&#8217;ve went through, especially when there&#8217;s other organizations that I see. Yeah, they&#8217;re more of a specific design orientation like Society of Publication Designers.</p>
<p>They seem a lot more active and a lot more forward thinking on what they&#8217;re trying to do and who they showcase and how they extend stuff. I&#8217;m really thinking about joining them. I&#8217;m kind of gun shy because I&#8217;m like, do I really want to join another organization at almost $300 a year? I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know. And then walk away feeling unsatisfied. I mean, because I could do something else with that money. It is tempting, at least what I see in the presence of what they do, they&#8217;re [inaudible 01:01:18] above more stuff than what AIGA does. AIGA&#8217;s big focus is their conference. And I think that&#8217;s just a money driver. I think it&#8217;s fair for folks to start questioning the value of it. And if it&#8217;s not of value, then it&#8217;s time to either create something brand new or maybe just dissolve it completely and rethink this whole process from scratch.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean it&#8217;s interesting because, yeah, you&#8217;re right. You&#8217;re right. I don&#8217;t have anything to add. No notes. 10 out of 10, right?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What gets you truly excited about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
It&#8217;s different nowadays. I&#8217;m approaching I guess 30 some odd years, 32 years working. Because I started working as a sophomore in college. What gets me excited now about what I do is not so much, I&#8217;m not driven by the money anymore, which is kind of backwards to say. But I actually just like trying to educate people about what design really is in terms of a strategic path. I think too many people see design as just make me something pretty. And I&#8217;m like, no, it&#8217;s a lot more deeper than that. It&#8217;s about a strategic path on how you can make your company&#8217;s voice sing. And I like doing that. I get more excited about doing work for not-for-profits because they&#8217;re doing some really good work, a lot of them. But when you come across them you&#8217;re like, oh my god, what is this?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no thought, no rhyme and reason. They look mismanaged when the organizations really aren&#8217;t. They have a plan, they know what they&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s just the only thing is their front facing is not as organized as their internal specter. And that stuff is what gets me excited today is doing a lot of not-for-profit, dare I say pro bono work where taking away, I mean, yeah, I do non-profit work at a discounted rate, but pro bono stuff, you take away the money thing and you just focus on just creating to help them just for the altruistic nature. I don&#8217;t know, I just get a very different feeling. It just really inspires me because it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m helping you become better, to help you take yourself to another level that you deserve to be at.</p>
<p>And that I find in this aspect of my career is what truly motivates me today. If folks are willing, I like telling them about design and how it helps and what it can do, which is why I like teaching. And I think design education is paramount both for clients and students. Because I think as a designer, I think it&#8217;s our responsibility to also educate our clients about the power of design and what it truly is. But teaching, I feel like with all the experience and everything that I&#8217;ve gained over these 30 years, I feel I&#8217;ve been very fortunate and blessed. My career&#8217;s gone through so many different curves. It&#8217;s nowhere where I initially started seeing myself, where I envisioned there&#8217;s going to be some high powered VP of design at some mega billionaire company where I&#8217;m jetting from country to country and stuff like that. That doesn&#8217;t appeal to me and stuff. What appeals to me is just passing forward this design legacy to beginnings designers and so that they have a better experience than what I have had in my beginning journeys and stuff. And so that&#8217;s what excites me today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does success look like now? I mean, you&#8217;re at this point in your career where you have really seen design through all these different changes. Of course you mentioned being a design educator. What does success look like?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I would say immediately, right off the top of the head, some of the successes I like is when some of my former students have landed jobs that they really wanted and they come back and say they actually really value what I&#8217;ve done and help push them to be better than what they were when they were studying. They say, &#8220;Well yeah, you&#8217;re a little bit of a hard ass, but I get why you did that. It&#8217;s got me where I am today.&#8221; And we still keep in touch. They&#8217;ll contact me about industry advice, to just basically to have an air. That&#8217;s a success to me. But overall, I just find success in that, if I can actually just help someone, an organization, just put their message out a little more clearer. That they feel better about themselves, that I feel is a success to me. That&#8217;s how I&#8217;m counting that. Is how well does my knowledge or how does my help make them feel better about what they&#8217;re doing and stuff like that.</p>
<p>To me, I feel that&#8217;s more of a success I count today. I&#8217;m not discarding money. I still [inaudible 01:06:44] money, but I&#8217;m not driven by that, and that&#8217;s a fleeting success. Because I&#8217;ve been there when it&#8217;s been coming in like buckets and then when it&#8217;s dust, [inaudible 01:06:55] desert, it is more of the untangible successes that I think is great because that&#8217;s what&#8217;s lasting. So if I can help somebody else, they will remember that, and that just helps propel them. So while the name may not be there, the root of that help grows forever. I mean who doesn&#8217;t want that? That&#8217;s eternal. That&#8217;s great. And I find that success. Yeah, that&#8217;s how I&#8217;d answer that. If that&#8217;s clear. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think so. Yeah. Now this might be a harder question to answer, but I&#8217;ll ask it.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Uh oh.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I&#8217;m actually asking myself that now. I&#8217;ve been toying with the idea of in about five years, which I&#8217;ll be 60, which I still can&#8217;t get my head wrapped around. God, I got to take a breath on that one. In five years I still want to be a practicing designer, but I want to see myself pull back. I want to see where I&#8217;m doing design more at a leisurely pace. I see myself still teaching part-time but in a different scenario where I&#8217;m really seriously contemplating on starting my master&#8217;s next year to be able to teach at any institution. Because you need a master&#8217;s to move around outside of where I&#8217;m teaching at community college. And I&#8217;m 75% sure, I think I may actually move from being an in-house designer and going back to a full-time studio. I&#8217;m thinking in five years I may want to resurrect a physical entity of Straight Design, which it probably will not be called Straight Design because I&#8217;m thinking about rebranding myself completely.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s sort of where I see, I don&#8217;t see myself ever retiring. Because people say, &#8220;Well okay, five years you&#8217;d be 60, then there&#8217;s 65. What about retirement?&#8221; I can&#8217;t do retirement. I have some friends who are retired early, they look bored as crap, and I can&#8217;t do that. And the thing is, I still feel design. I still get very much invigorated when I see great design. I still keep my nose to what&#8217;s happening in the industry as fast as it&#8217;s changing. And I&#8217;m also very interested in that, I&#8217;m hoping within the next five years that I can actually transition into a field that kind of peaks my curiosity, and that&#8217;s motion graphics. Whether or not to get a full-time gig for that, but to be able to offer that as a service. And to be honest, just to be selfish, I just think it looks cool.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done a little bit of motion graphics now and it&#8217;s intriguing, it&#8217;s fascinating and it&#8217;s fun. It&#8217;s fun doing that to take this static idea and bringing it into a motion life,, is something that I&#8217;d like to do more of, especially since I see that as the way design will start changing as we move from the platform of the basic augmented and virtual reality platforms we have now, which is clearly in its cell phase. I can&#8217;t even call it embryo, it&#8217;s still in the cell. That doing something, and I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m a big fan of social media, it has its place, but I like the premise of how you, not necessarily the still aspect of social media, how Instagram originally started that it was all photos. Now it&#8217;s all videos. So you might as well just say TikTok.</p>
<p>That aspect of promoting stuff from a brand ad perspective is fascinating to me, because that&#8217;s where you can apply the motion graphics to that. It&#8217;s high hopes, but I kind of see myself doing more of that in five years. So like I said, I&#8217;m dabbling a little bit right now with it, that I&#8217;m trying to incorporate a little bit more into my full-time job. To feel comfortable enough to be able to offer that to clientele. That&#8217;s about as far as I can see what I think myself for five years, because in just the last five years I&#8217;ve gone through such a major transition professionally and personally that I&#8217;ve learned I&#8217;m not trying to forecast anymore, because tomorrow could be very different right then and there. So five years could be a very, very long way aways, and many different things go. But that&#8217;s kind of where I see my vision board for five years might be.</p>
<p>And that could change next week too. Because I have become very sort of transitory, I&#8217;ve been very flexible about, oh, where we&#8217;re going to go. I don&#8217;t know. Let&#8217;s see where the journey takes us kind of thing. Because at this point I don&#8217;t feel I need to prove anything to anybody. I don&#8217;t need to prove anything to myself. I actually just want to enjoy myself and I just want to contribute with, especially more so in terms of, wow, as I&#8217;m listening to myself in my head as I&#8217;m thinking about this, that Lord help me, do I want to actually become more of a social activist? I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;d like to actually as these issues are popping up more and more in society, as a global society because you can&#8217;t really say we&#8217;re stuck in our own little neighborhoods anymore. But I want to do my part and help on that kind of scale.</p>
<p>In some part that also too is in that projection for the next five years. Maybe it&#8217;s a lofty idea, but it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s kind of sparking some initial interest now that I want to see how that, once I plant these seeds where it may grow within five years. But that&#8217;s where I see still doing the stuff and just hopefully still looking as young as I do now for five years. And just hoping my kids are, because they seem to, my son&#8217;s on this creative journey that I hope he&#8217;s successful in what he&#8217;s doing, and helping guide him as much as I can. As well as my daughter who is still trying to find herself. But she has a really strong creative base, even though she keeps trying to deny it. To make certain that they, like I said, my son makes certain that his career path is as solid as it can be, and to really try and guide my daughter because by that time she&#8217;ll be going to college. Kind of push her to be a creative too. So yeah, that&#8217;s what I see.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
They can find me on my website str8tdesignllc.com. But the domain is not spelled as you would say straight, it&#8217;s S-T-R, the number eight, the letter T, designllc.com, had to play off of that because somebody took the domain Str8t Design. They could find me there. They could also find me on Instagram as Str8t Design spelled as you just say it on Instagram. That&#8217;s generally my main two points where you can find me, because my social media presence really is contained to just Instagram. I no longer use Twitter and I don&#8217;t really use anything else. I just use Instagram and my basic website.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Andrew Bass, wow. I mean, I knew that this was going to be a great conversation, but this was a conversation and a history lesson and a therapy session. This was so much wrapped into one. I mean, first of all, I just want to thank you for just the work that you&#8217;ve done. I mean a lot of what you&#8217;ve done in terms of just educating and then also even the work with AIGA has really kind of set the platform for me to even do what I do here with Revision Path. Like you were one of the first people that I interviewed back before this was all a podcast and everything. And to see that you&#8217;re still continuing to do this work throughout the years, that you can really speak truth to history about how things have went and how technology has changed design and everything. I hope folks get a chance to really listen to both parts of this episode, of these episodes, I should say, to really get the full breadth of what it is that you bring to the design community. And I hope to see you honored one day. I mean, through AIGA, maybe we&#8217;ll see, I don&#8217;t know, but I think what you&#8217;ve brought to the design industry is indispensable. And I just want to thank you so much for sharing that perspective here with our audience. So thank you for coming on. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Well, I thank you for that and I thank you for interviewing me. It was a really cool talk, great to listen and listen to hearing myself talk. And actually it was very therapeutic to actually share some of the agony going through some of this and just trying to lay groundwork for future folks, trying to lessen the burdens that they&#8217;re going to have to face. And the fact that in 2022, coming into 2023, that this is still going to have to go on is sort of mind numbing to me. But it&#8217;s still very much the fight to happen. I may not have as much fire in this fight as I used to because I&#8217;ve taken a reprieve and taken a step back because it does kind of wear you down a bit. But I&#8217;m kind of been refreshing myself to like, you know what? Let&#8217;s throw my hat back in this one last time.</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t be with AIGA, it&#8217;ll be actually doing through some other things, because forget them. It&#8217;s time to go to other means out there, and actually just basically ourselves. Because I still have floating in my head, even though we&#8217;ve had OBD, no, yeah, OBD, which has had mixed results, I still feel very much that if this is going to change, that we have to do it for ourselves. Completely independent and self sustained.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
A hundred percent, a hundred percent. I believe that. Again, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
No problem. Thank you.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re ending off the month talking to one of the unsung trailblazers for diversity in the design community &#8212; Andrew Bass Jr. Longtime fans of Revision Path will recognize Andrew as one of our early profiles back in 2013, and it was great to finally have him on the podcast to talk about his story and his work.</p>
<p>In the first part of this two-part interview, Andrew talks about his design consultancy Straight Design, and shared his story of growing up in Brooklyn and falling in love with graphic design. He also spoke about attending Pratt Institute, the battle scars he received working in print media and gave me a look at his career as a designer throughout the 90s.</p>
<p>Make sure you tune in next week for Part 2!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Well, I&#8217;m Andrew Bass and I am essentially design strategist, educator, art director, graphic designer. Day job I work as a art and production manager at an association called RIMS, handling their member publication. And I, on the side, I also have my freelance consultancy, Straight Design LLC, where I take on various different clients, focusing a little bit more on the small business side and not for profit as well as I&#8217;m an adjunct lecturer at City Tech or the full name New York City College of Technology where I teach Design Thinking, Design Studio.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2022 been going for you so far? We&#8217;re kind of near the end of the year. When you look back, how would you say the year has been?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
It&#8217;s actually been, in perspective has been pretty good. I&#8217;m employed so that&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hey.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I&#8217;m getting transitioning more from my basic print background into more digital design, which is actually good, where I also trying to kind of squeak my way into doing a little bit more motion graphics. But it&#8217;s actually been going pretty well as I&#8217;m been focused more on my full-time job in teaching and a little pulled back away from Straight Design due to family thing, personal issues. So I went through a divorce, had to sell the house and all this during COVID.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah. But 2022, has been compared to 2021 and definitely 2020, it&#8217;s been great. In the grand scheme of things, I really can&#8217;t complain about stuff, but it&#8217;s been going pretty well and I&#8217;m just trying to gear myself up to get, for 2023 to get a little bit back into focusing a little bit more on Straight Design and what that next evolution&#8217;s going to be for it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I feel like the last few years for a lot of people have been this sort of, I don&#8217;t know, period of trying to just gets get acclimated to the way of the world now and especially now that it seems like capitalism is trying to push us out of COVID in a way that everyone&#8217;s really trying to think, oh well for next year I need to try to get back out there more. I need to try to do more, try to resume what life was like prior to all of this, you know?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Well, I mean I will say for myself, and I&#8217;m still wrestling with quote, and I hate all these trend words that they keep coming out with, but quote &#8220;the new normal&#8221; because I now officially work from home and will be working from home for the next several years for my full-time job, saddle that with Straight Design, which is also still from home. The only time I actually go out for design is when I teach. Learning how to marry all that in one residence, basically my home without losing my mind and still maintaining that creative inspiration, is extremely hard and I&#8217;m still trying to formulate plans as to how to tackle it because I&#8217;m on what plan A.2 Now or something like that. Because I&#8217;ve gone through the 26 alphabet and gone through 1 through 10. So I&#8217;m on my third iteration of how to make this all go down seamlessly.</p>
<p>I think COVID just also put a pause on so many things that I think it is really hard to get, jumpstart ourselves back into, okay, this is how we did business, this is how we talk to each other, this is how we do stuff. And from the design aspect, I definitely have seen it become stagnated where I really feel that face to face has actually hurt a little bit of, at least my design process. In talking with both coworkers and clients that without that sort of personal face to face stuff, reading each other&#8217;s body language, playing off the vibes and stuff like that, that it has kind of stiffened a little bit of the creativity. I understand why everybody&#8217;s trying to say, &#8220;Okay, how do I get back into this normal life before COVID?&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of it I think is self-induced because for whole host of thing reasons 2020 was, I say from 2020, 2021 was a real big pot of let&#8217;s stir everybody, let&#8217;s scramble everybody&#8217;s brain with so much crazy misinformation about so many things. From the pandemic to politics to just how life is going to be to the state of the world and all that, that I think it really kind of, if I could say mind fucked us a bit that we still haven&#8217;t really kind of gotten out of it. But the thing is we need to, and the thing is, even during COVID, life doesn&#8217;t stop, you just have to adapt and figure a new way to do things.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s slowly coming, it&#8217;s slowly coming. And I think as more and more folks get out that haze things will kind of lock back into place and pretty much kind of sync up as to how things were beforehand with just new processes, that&#8217;s all. It&#8217;s just going to be new processes. So it sort of forced the change for a lot of things. And we all know humans don&#8217;t like change very much. So it&#8217;s a shock to everyone&#8217;s system and I think it&#8217;s starting now to seep in and okay, this is what we&#8217;re going to do now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. No, I mean you&#8217;re absolutely right. It&#8217;s been something I think a lot of us have just had to get comfortable with the constant pivots, whether it&#8217;s lockdowns or work from home or hybrid. And that&#8217;s we&#8217;re just talking about on a work kind of level. I mean personal level, there&#8217;s people that have lost loved ones, there&#8217;s people that have gotten COVID multiple times, they have long COVID, like there&#8217;s a lot that has really come out. And it&#8217;s continuing to happen, I would say even with the vaccines and such, there&#8217;s still just a lot that&#8217;s going on right now.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
It&#8217;s something we just got to have to learn to live with and navigate that as anything else.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And we have to do it unfortunately on the individual level because I don&#8217;t think that structures have really been set up for us to do it on a societal level yet.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
No, that it&#8217;s been misstep from day one and once it&#8217;s been misstepped, it&#8217;s very hard to start building that foundation and so that momentum is lost. So it is very much individually, which will be the success rate on that is going to be a wide range of stuff. Because some folks will do better, others will do worse. And the only thing is we just got to try and support one another when we can. I mean that&#8217;s lofty goals. Let&#8217;s hope that we all can do that and I think that&#8217;ll help things a little bit better. But yeah, it&#8217;s very much a matter of now it also kind of shows how fleeting life is and how, I mean a nanosecond, how things can shift and you have to either be ready to jump in and adapt or you just stay in that place and just cease to exist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s lighten the conversation up because people probably tuned in didn&#8217;t expect us to be going all deep about COVID and stuff. Let&#8217;s lighten it up and talk about your design consultancy, Straight Design, which you&#8217;ve ran now for 15 years. Tell me about that. How did it start?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
It wasn&#8217;t even planned, it just kind of happened because I will freely admit it started because of my arrogance. I was working in a time and a company and I was going to have the opportunity to start teaching as an adjunct and I just kind of took for granted that because we had such a relaxed work schedule there that oh I could teach classes during the day and come in four days a week and not just one day. This was before anyone ever did any sort of remote stuff. And I didn&#8217;t bother to tell my editor-in-chief that I had done this. And so basically I was tasked with, &#8220;Look, if you drop the teaching gig now or teach at night or you just got to leave the job,&#8221; it&#8217;s essentially you&#8217;re making, you accepted two jobs and this is your first job.</p>
<p>And I kind of refused. At that point, subconsciously I was kind of done with where I was working at. I had been there for a few years and there was a lot of changes. The company was going through a merger, I should say an acquisition. And things were changing in my department. My staff, they had had me actually cut my staff and so I was the only one working on the magazine at the time and through budget cuts. And I kind of just used that as an excuse subconsciously to of exit out. And so when I did that I realized, oh what am I going to do for money? So I was like, &#8220;Okay, we&#8217;re going to have to kind of freelance.&#8221; And I took some time to just kind of coast a little bit, get my head together and I was approached by a client to submit a proposal for developing a magazine prototype as well as what it would be to produce this magazine on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>And it was a magazine based in the Netherlands based on financial technology, which I had was completely unfamiliar with that subject. But I submitted my proposal and I was awarded the gig and that gave me the impetus to, okay, let me start Straight Design. Now at the time it was called AD Bass Designs until I changed the name later on. And that started the ball rolling for Straight Design and they were very good [inaudible 00:15:06] and it morphed from just doing the magazine and the production to doing event materials to promotional collateral and it spurred adding to my clientele roster.</p>
<p>And so I was running that in a physical studio in Manhattan for a good number of years, at least like five years in there. And then the recession of 2008 hit, as well as everybody else, I started losing some clients because they were cutting back on money, but I was still doing pretty well with that. But then once my big client sort of went away because the owner of that company didn&#8217;t realize what the financial investment was in starting up a magazine because a magazine doesn&#8217;t really break even for at least five to seven years. And the owner was like, &#8220;Whoa, this is taking too long.&#8221; And so they kind of pulled back on it, still kept all the event stuff and the event materials and stuff but just wasn&#8217;t doing the magazine.</p>
<p>I started losing clientele a bit because of the economic situation and at the time I was married and both my wife then and me were self-employed and with, we just had our daughter and I was like, &#8220;Okay, somebody&#8217;s going to have to go back inside because health insurance was as much as my mortgage.&#8221; And I was like this is killing my savings quick. And that&#8217;s when I had just made the transition to go back in-house. But I still kept Straight Design as my freelance consultancy so that I would basically do the projects that I still were very interested in on the side, but I didn&#8217;t have to worry about hunting down and bringing in clientele while maintaining my whole household. And I&#8217;ve kept that way from since 2012, I think. Yeah. From 2012 to now. Where I&#8217;m now thinking about eventually I might resurrect Straight Design in a more full-time capacity in the next several years. But that&#8217;s how I started it. It was really just a fluke.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s so interesting. Hearing you talk about how you started that reminds me of how I started my studio. It&#8217;s so funny that you said it was out of arrogance. Because I feel like I started in the same way. I was a senior designer working AT&#038;T. I mean I was completely self-taught. I just felt like, oh I got this, I got this. And I mean I was working there in AT&#038;T, for at least back then, I can&#8217;t speak to how it is now. This was 2008 when I quit. But it was very much a production house. It was all on the assembly line basically. You got packet with all your stuff that you needed to design and you did it in Photoshop and you sliced it up in Dreamweaver and coded. There was no love or soul into it because you had to crank it out and eight hours or less essentially.</p>
<p>And so you&#8217;re just doing this on a constant loop. And I was like I could do this better myself. And I just quit and started my own studio. I really felt like, yeah, I could do this, I got this. But yeah, it&#8217;s interesting because even when I started, I had a different name for my business. I started it out, it was called 318 Media because I wanted to, one, it was after my birthday and then two, I just wanted to have a cool kind of funky name. I ended up changing it later because there were other three blank blank media companies in Atlanta. There was a three, I know there was a 352 Media, there was a 360 Media and people were getting us confused and so we had to have a standoff, okay, somebody&#8217;s got to change.</p>
<p>And I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;ll change mine,&#8221; because I had a weird spelling for it too because I don&#8217;t know, I thought it was cool to have the number three, the word 18, but then I had to keep explaining it to people and then forms wouldn&#8217;t take a business thing that started with a number. It was a whole bunch of things.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then I just changed it to Lunch in 2014, 2015 and completely rebranded the company. So it made more sense after I did all of that. And I even found business increased once that happened because one, people weren&#8217;t getting us confused with other companies. And then I had all these kind of gimmicks around lunch. My business card was one of those plastic key tag things where like CVS or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It was like that was what the business card was. And every time I met with a client I&#8217;d mark off a little circle on the back.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Oh that&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Oh, if you get a certain number, you get a free whatever.&#8221; I could play all these little gimmicks into it and it was fun.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
That&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve thought about going back to freelancing now, especially since I am not working and the job market is trash, I&#8217;m thinking about it. So I get what you mean about always having it in your back pocket in a way is something that&#8217;s just your own thing, you know?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean it was great experience, still is a great experience. It was a great experience having the actual physical space, dealing with clients coming into the office, going to presentations and stuff like that. Contracting freelancers to work on projects and something like that. But it was also a good experience in understanding that New York City does not small business. They don&#8217;t like freelancers. Unless you are a huge company, the state is just going to rob you blind.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s really hard. It was harder than I really imagined to run a business in New York City and New York state because New York City is its own entity and then you have to deal with New York state as well and then you got the feds so you get triple hit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
It was very, very interesting. And I would probably not open up a business in New York City again. I would go to a different state. I&#8217;m starting to understand some of the reasons why some companies open up in particular states. Just from the business point of view, it makes a lot of sense. But it was a good experience I have to say. And it actually did very well, even to my surprise because I didn&#8217;t expect to do so well starting off. I thought I was going to have to kind of struggle a bit, but things just rolled in really nicely and I was like oh. And I knew that wasn&#8217;t going to last. I just didn&#8217;t know it was going to hit sooner than it did. But it was a great experience and it just helped strengthen how I do my consultancy now when I freelance and stuff, that I got a little bit better practice with clientele because I really don&#8217;t like that side of doing a business. I really just want to create.</p>
<p>And I was always trying to find, I said if I was going to do Straight Design as a company company again where there&#8217;s just more than me, I need to find somebody who&#8217;s this, who&#8217;s good on the business side that doesn&#8217;t mind doing all the numbers and the paperwork and stuff like that. Because now that stuff really does consume a lot of time and it really showed being a creative takes a lot. We all know being a creative takes a lot of our energy. But when that&#8217;s split with doing this sort of the other side of our brain, the more logical side sometimes how that can disrupt things now and it&#8217;s hard to get back into that creative flow after you&#8217;ve been dealing with invoices and setting out proposals and responding to RFPs and tracking down those clients that are a little late in their paying and then taxes. That, yeah. We don&#8217;t like taxes but that, that&#8217;s woo those quarterlies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:22:50] on that one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You are preaching to the choir on that one. I know exactly what you mean.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah. So it was a great experience and I try to pass that information to students now and always have incorporated a little bit of business sense in my teachings with students so that they&#8217;re better prepared for that. Because I never got that when I was in school. There was business not considered part of the curriculum. It was about technique and creating and stuff. Not like, &#8220;Okay now you got to make a living, how are you going to survive?&#8221; But it was a great experience. I mean it still is a great experience but what it is now is that I can pick and choose what I really want to work on.</p>
<p>And I really tend to working on not for profits or trying to help businesses get their start and really understanding how important the strategy of design is. And not so much get sidetracked by all the nice shiny bells and whistles, but to really understand how this design strategy is going to help them propel their company&#8217;s message to ensure they are successful in interacting with their consumer, their customer base and stuff. And I kind of like that. And that working full time and doing the consultancy on the side, that enables me to do that a little bit more without having to worry about the slow times and stuff like that. So it has worked out pretty well for right now. Although like I said before, I&#8217;m thinking of the next evolution that&#8217;s probably going to happen within the next year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean you mentioned nonprofits and sort of smaller businesses that you really like to work with. What does your creative process look like when you&#8217;re starting on a project?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Generally when I&#8217;m first starting on a project, this is assuming I&#8217;ve been awarded a project, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Okay. Because then there&#8217;s another process on trying to get that project. Once I&#8217;ve gotten a project, I really try to just hone in and identify what is the problem that they&#8217;re facing, what is it that they really need to happen? And in that, once I&#8217;ve kind of locked that solid, that kind of helps me figure out my focus on what I need to sort of really understand about them, their audience, what they&#8217;re actually trying to put out there. Whether it&#8217;s some sort of service, whether it&#8217;s about the face of their company. And I really try to learn as much as I can about them to sort of really put myself in their shoes and trying to put myself in the shoes of who they&#8217;re trying to reach so that way I can talk in the same tone, the same voice. And that usually that&#8217;s a lot of my discovery time.</p>
<p>I always tell my clients that I need a good, I give myself about four weeks of discovery time to go through stuff to understand, to talk to people, to be able to really understand the gist and the spirit of what this is and who they claim their audience is to see if it actually matches up before I ever begin thinking about creative solutions. And then once I&#8217;ve done that, that&#8217;s when I just go back to them and kind of confer my findings, where I sort of send back to them, for lack of, a creative brief, just letting them know, &#8220;Okay, this is of where I think this is at.&#8221; And just to get them the co-sign, &#8220;Yeah, this is what we see for ourselves, this is what we see our audience, this is where we definitely agree with this is what&#8217;s happening, this is the sentiment.&#8221; And then that&#8217;s when I start getting into my creative process where start trying to now understand the competitors, see what they&#8217;ve done, see what this company&#8217;s done and what works well.</p>
<p>Because sometimes companies don&#8217;t realize they have some good stuff, it&#8217;s just maybe not executed well or thought out correctly. And so I try to see what is good. Nobody wants to reinvent the wheel unless it&#8217;s necessary. And see, like I said, see what works, what doesn&#8217;t work and then start beginning to put those pieces together and start developing my own of creative point of view as to how I think the project should go and what&#8217;s going to be best for their purposes moving forward. Which again, that&#8217;s another big chunk of my time that depending on the scope of the project, definitely is at least a month for, I like telling folks weeks versus months because it seems shorter in weeks than months. Math. I tell them it&#8217;s usually about four to six weeks I&#8217;m going to start doing creative development if it&#8217;s a kind of small base project, small to medium side.</p>
<p>And that allows me to actually kind of run through a lot of my ideas because in all transparency, as a creative I also build in cushion time for myself with that. Because I&#8217;m not starting on that project right off the bat. I&#8217;m a procrastinator and I probably should not be putting this out on air, but I&#8217;m a procrastinator and sometimes it takes a while for me to jumpstart to get in things because deadlines really drive my juices. I don&#8217;t know why that is, but at least about a week or so I kind of just kind of float through the project in the development phase. Kind of looking at things inspiring myself before I realize, oh man, okay, I got to get my stuff going in into gear.</p>
<p>And then once I&#8217;m in gear though, I&#8217;m going through it. I&#8217;m flying through it to build up my mock so that way I can present to the clientele. And I walk them through the whole process and I explain, I kind of educate them about the aspect of design and why I have done exactly what I&#8217;ve done, the choices I&#8217;ve made from all the elements. So that they have a better understanding that this is not just about making things look nice and that colors, type, images just seems like random choices when no, there&#8217;s a calculated reason for the choices on this and what the desired result is expected from it because of these choices.</p>
<p>And then it&#8217;s a matter of, I don&#8217;t usually have not gotten from clients an extensive back and forth on things. It&#8217;s been a pretty quick, &#8220;Yeah, we like this choice, we&#8217;ve got these few little changes and then that&#8217;s it.&#8221; And then the end of the process is where I now start finalizing everything up. And that usually is the quickest part of the process because all the stuff I build up is to high fidelity in terms of the conceptuals. And so that way all I&#8217;m doing is just tweaking some things unless it completely requires a rethought and which we never want to do there. And luckily I&#8217;ve only had one or two of those and that&#8217;s an earlier part of my career because that&#8217;s embarrassing. Go back to the drawing board to because you completely did not catch what was going on. And then from there it&#8217;s just providing the materials to the clienteles and following up with them.</p>
<p>Now that&#8217;s one of the things that I think sometimes as designers, creators we don&#8217;t do is that we don&#8217;t follow up to say, &#8220;Okay, hey, how did things go six months out? How did everything happen? Are you satisfied? What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; To try and maintain and build those networks and those relationships so that it becomes a longstanding client base. But also I think it&#8217;s just good practiceship or businessmanship to follow up with your clients, make certain what you provided to them is doing what they needed to be done and that they&#8217;re satisfied and that it&#8217;s helping them. So, that actually tells you how well you&#8217;ve done yourself. But that&#8217;s [inaudible 00:30:48] my process. I hope I didn&#8217;t drone on that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, I mean I think that end part definitely is good because then it also means that you can possibly get repeat clients.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Repeat work from the same client. I mean that&#8217;s always good. I know back when I was doing my studio, I would have clients I do work for and then I would follow up and if they needed things on a more regular basis, eventually that graduated to becoming a retainer. And then that&#8217;s guaranteed monthly income, which we all love that. That&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
And referrals. Current clients can refer you to people, so you get new clients.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Absolutely. Let&#8217;s kind of dive a little bit into your personal story. I think folks now can kind of hear the New York accent.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Oh my god.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me about growing up there.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
You mean my Brooklyn accent? Yeah. Well I mean I&#8217;m born and raised in New York, specifically Brooklyn. Because people ask me, oh where I&#8217;m from, I say, &#8220;I&#8217;m from Brooklyn. I&#8217;m Brooklynese.&#8221; Because yes, people from Brooklyn, we have Brooklyn is a culture. Other folks realizing, or at least old Brooklyn now, because yes, I&#8217;m going to say Brooklyn is not quite the same as it used to be. So old school Brooklyn. Yeah, I grew up in Bedford-Stuyvesant, now during the &#8217;70s, &#8217;80s, and &#8217;90s. Crack era and blackout from 1977. So Bed-Stuy was rough. It was not for the week of heart. And me growing up as the nerd, because I&#8217;ve always been a nerd, always been the tallest dude out of everybody, very quiet, reserved. So I was the art kid. And so naturally I was bullied growing up and for me to deal with that, I always used to just draw. Now I would just go into my notebooks and draw these fantasy worlds just to escape from all the crap that I was growing up with.</p>
<p>Because I also, my dad was an alcoholic. When I was younger it wasn&#8217;t as bad as it was when I got older, but when he did drink, it was not a pleasant environment. So coupled that with the knuckleheads in my neighborhood who were bugging me and my brother, I retreated to my drawing. Now I just went in there and I just started drawing worlds to just escape for a few hours and stuff. It was great therapy for me. Unfortunately, as I think back, a lot of the scenes that I would was drawing were conflicts. It was like war, space invasions, shooting. I was just blowing up shit. If you talk to a therapist, that means that&#8217;s a manifestation of what&#8217;s going on out there. And I&#8217;m like, but I had fun.</p>
<p>And with the drawing that actually got me interested in do people do this? And so I started looking deeper into cartoons cause I love cartoons and how they were drawn. I was like, oh people do this. When I found out as a kid, folks actually do. Because I don&#8217;t know what I was thinking as a kid, I just thought they magically appeared. I didn&#8217;t know you actually had to do that. And that fascinated me because I was like, &#8220;Ooh, maybe one day I can draw some cartoons.&#8221; And that shifted my invasion drawings into drawing characters and doing little mini cartoons. And to date myself, I used to do these little flip books where you draw them on the edge of the paper and you just flip them. And then-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember flip books. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
We all did that back then. It was just so cool. And people loved when I did it at my school and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Ah, do one for me, do one for me.&#8221; And I started getting a little reputation for Andrew&#8217;s, &#8220;He&#8217;s the animator, he makes these cartoons that move,&#8221; and it was pretty cool. And I was like, oh, maybe one day I could do this for a living. But as I started growing up, I got into graffiti because the introverted kid started breaking out his shell a little bit. And I was fascinated with graffiti. Little did I know, that was my first introduction to design, specifically graphic design. Because what folks don&#8217;t seem to realize back then graffiti was just that was vandalism, got to get those kids. And I don&#8217;t advocate now at 55 to ever go paint up on people&#8217;s property. That is having been a property owner, I&#8217;m going to beat you up if you write on my property.</p>
<p>But it was beautiful work to see the letters, the formation of these characters and then the letters of the characters, and then actually the figurines you put into the pieces in the murals. Which all based off of the smurfs, Vaughn Bodƒì&#8217;s work, I forgot the character name with the mushroom head. Or at that time it was the, because that was the beginning of the hiphop culture. And I say hiphop purposely now because hip hop culture was the trifecta of MCing. Notice I say MCing and not rapping. MCing, breakdancing, and graffiti. Graffiti was the visual expression of all this, where breakdancing was the physical manifestation of the movement, and MCing was the verbalization of it. And there&#8217;s a distinct difference between MCing and rapping. Now, again, dating myself because we rappers today are not MCs.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh no, no. I would venture to say rappers today are barely rappers.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Bingo. But that&#8217;s got me into graffiti. And I just fell in love with how you create your own letters and create these characters into these stylized formations. And then the color, when I had my black book with the markers, it was Pantone markers. Little did I know Pantone would actually be so much a part of my life. But those Pantone markers with the smell, I love those smell of those markers. It was pure alcohol now. Yeah, pure alcohol. And they soaked through everything, but they left beautiful pieces. And that was actually my very first foray into being an artist and drawing and in design. And from that point on, I knew I wanted to do something creatively for the rest of my life. Now I just didn&#8217;t know what now.</p>
<p>And I went through different phases as I went from high school where I went to Brooklyn Tech, which was, and still is a very specialized high school that focuses on math and science. But they had an industrial design program in there and a little bit of arts. And so I took that because I suck at math, I love science, but I&#8217;m not a scientist. And so I did industrial design, which was very much equated to let&#8217;s say package design, product design and architecture, which did interest me. And for a time I was like, maybe I&#8217;ll do be an architect. But I really liked more the spontaneous creativity in design oriented projects.</p>
<p>So when I left Brooklyn Tech, I applied, was thinking about college and I applied to Pratt, I applied to City Tech. At the time, City Tech back then was called New York City Technical College. That&#8217;s what it was called back then. And those are the only two schools I applied to because I didn&#8217;t know of any other schools. And also because my mother told me I was either going to go to Pratt or City Tech because they&#8217;re in Brooklyn. And so that way I&#8217;m close to home. So my mother was very much the SuperMax warden growing up. So I looked at both. I applied to both. I got into both.</p>
<p>I went through, I first focused on going to Pratt, but I couldn&#8217;t afford that bill. I was like, &#8220;Ooh, that&#8217;s too much money.&#8221; And I didn&#8217;t really have a true portfolio back then. I just had my black book and some work from high school. Because like I said, Brooklyn Tech was not based, was not an art school. So I didn&#8217;t know anything about building a portfolio, what&#8217;s needed or anything like that. So I just had little trinkets. So I went to City Tech or New York City Technical College at that time.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s where I really started learning what it is to be in the creative industry. And I knew right then and there, yeah, this is the choice I want to do. I definitely want to be in the creative industry. Now I got to decide, is it advertising, is it this thing called graphic design? Is it this thing being an illustrator? Because a couple of my professors were pushing me to be an illustrator now. And they were like, &#8220;You just have this natural tone. You should be an illustrator.&#8221; I just didn&#8217;t like sitting in those classes for six hours drawing stuff. I was like, are you kidding me? That&#8217;s like, this is boring me. It did. It wasn&#8217;t as fun to me. And I did a year at City Tech and then I transferred, especially at the encouragement of one of my professors because I was all A&#8217;s, I got 4.0 for that first year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
All my projects just didn&#8217;t feel like it was a challenge to me. Even though at the professor who I&#8217;m revering right now, her name is Dorothy Hayes, she&#8217;s passed on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, I&#8217;ve heard of her. She&#8217;s been mentioned on the shows by a lot of people. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah. Dorothy Hayes at the time when I was a student of hers, I could not stand her. She was too hard. I was like, she was always on my. Always, always Bass. Because she always called me Bass. Never call me Andrew. &#8220;Bass, Bass, you could do better. You could do better. Where&#8217;s your work, I want to see your work.&#8221; But looking back, I mean that really forged who I am and I&#8217;m forever thankful to her, and a few other professors I met. By the way, which they were all Black. I was lucky. I had quite a few Black professors in my design education.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Which was unheard of. That&#8217;s why I was saying that was destined to be and stuff. And so I transferred to Pratt and that&#8217;s where shit got real ,when I went to Pratt.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me about it. How was it?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
It was challenging. I wanted the challenge. I got challenged. It was like I almost dropped out at my, what was it, sophomore year? Well actually not, it was my transfer year. Yeah. Because when I transferred over, some of my credits transferred over, some did. Because Pratt had a foundation year that they required everybody to take. So I had a mix of classes that were from the foundation class and then classes that were able to be transferred over. It was a completely different environment. And we&#8217;re talking about 1986. Pratt was intense. The workload was nothing I had experienced at any school. It was weekly. It was a lot to manage. I mean many projects very much about understanding and defending the basis of your projects, which I hadn&#8217;t understand before that. I thought it was just about, oh, how do you make this stuff pretty. And then that&#8217;s where I first learned, no, it&#8217;s about why are you doing this and for who is it for? Basically what is your thinking behind this?</p>
<p>And that tripped me up because I was like, &#8220;Oh that seemed like a lot.&#8221; As well as at that same time, there was a lot of things going into my, not childhood, but at my home with my focuses at that point now. My dad definitely was heavy into his alcoholism. And so going to Pratt was a good and a bad experience. Good in the fact is that the work was intense. It forced me to double down and really get involved in understanding the nature of the work that I&#8217;m building. Because the very coming from four A&#8217;s to where I just thought I automatically get that coming in the Pratt. And then the end of that first transfer year, I realized, now granted also too, I was doing a little more partying that transfer year. Because I was like, &#8220;Ah, I got this. This is easy.&#8221; That&#8217;s when my GPA went from 4.0, dropped down to 2.0. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a dip.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Oh it&#8217;s a major dip. And couple of my teachers came to me, professors came to me and said, &#8220;Look, hey. You can do the work. What is going on? You&#8217;re not applying yourself.&#8221; And that&#8217;s when I woke up and said, &#8220;Okay Andrew, you forget this partying, you can party after you graduate. Let&#8217;s get on the ball.&#8221; And I worked my house off to try and get my grades back up. And it was never back to 4.0. I graduated what? 3.0. I worked it back up. But that one year did that much damage to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah. And so the other good things with that was the, I&#8217;d have to say, with the intensity of the work, it was also the way the professors tried to instill some of the actual business dynamics into how you build a creative, but also how to be a creative. It wasn&#8217;t extensive, it was snippets. It was, what was her, it was my copywriting professor, Lorraine McNeil, who also happened to be Black. She was a Black woman. She would occasionally mention about the business aspect and what would be expected out of there. It wasn&#8217;t a full fledged business kind of introduction, that didn&#8217;t exist when I was going to school. But she did try to put some nuggets out there because I found out about business and stuff on my own.</p>
<p>Now that was the other good thing about Pratt is that they had an extensive library. And that&#8217;s where I really got a lot of my supplemental education was in that library. I was in the library too much. They had so many books I couldn&#8217;t keep my hands off those books. The bad aspects of Pratt was that I felt very isolated as a Black student. Pratt was predominantly white and there were students who basically came from more affluent families. There was a contingent of students of color on there. A lot of them stayed on the dorms because they were not basically from New York, they were from other states.</p>
<p>So I didn&#8217;t have that kind of connection because the folks who were in the dorms, they had their own clique. They focused more, a little too much more on partying than education. I always called the edutainment and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I already saw the effect of partying on my grades. I was like, nah man, I got to get serious because we want to get a job. We got this is going to be our career.&#8221; The isolation was very detrimental to me in that aspect because I didn&#8217;t have a vacuum. I had, I didn&#8217;t really have folks I can confer with about how their education was going, how classes were, how projects were, to bounce off ideas with somebody else is to, what do you think about this? And something like that.</p>
<p>The other thing is too, I thought the teachers, the white teachers, I thought they were very sort of offhand with the students of color. They seemed very apt to help the white students but not so eager to help the Black and Latino students. It was kind of like, &#8220;You can figure this out on your own. I&#8217;ll just give you this little nugget and let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s going on.&#8221; But then you see them confer very regularly with the white students after class, off premises. They would extend numbers to them. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Huh, how come we don&#8217;t get that?&#8221; The only professors actually did do that were the professors who happened to be of color. I had three of them. I had Richard Perry who was an English teacher, Dwight Johnson, who was one of my design teachers who also actually gave me my first freelance gig. Lorraine McNeil, who was my copywriter teacher.</p>
<p>Those were the three professors that I had through my years at Pratt that did offer me help, is particularly Dwight Johnson. Now he&#8217;s the one that really, in the beginning years, I modeled myself after him. Now he gave me first freelance job. I just personally and professionally, I styled myself after him because I just thought he was on point. I was like, &#8220;I want to be like him.&#8221; So Pratt overall, if I had to choose today, I would not necessarily go to Pratt. There&#8217;s so many other schools out here that are actually pretty good and cheaper that I probably would&#8217;ve went to. But that&#8217;s how Pratt was. There&#8217;s really not much to say about City Tech because at that time City Tech had a reputation of being a super high school. It was just a continuation. And then, I mean having worked at City Tech now and working at City Tech now I will say they definitely have changed that, which is for the better.</p>
<p>But back then it was really classified as just an extension of high school and folks acted the same way. So it was good to get that sort of foundation in City Tech. And actually meeting a few professors there, Dorothy Hayes, Joel Mason, Robert Holden, they were actually good teachers that kind of helped me build a real portfolio, so that when I, they applied to Pratt again to transfer over, my portfolio was much more readily accepted now that I had a portfolio. But yeah, that&#8217;s how my experiences, I don&#8217;t look too fondly on my college years. It was kind of rough on instances that I wish I had more camaraderie among some of my fellow classmates and a little bit more, actually not a little bit, a lot more help from my professors. It just wasn&#8217;t really there. May have changed now, I don&#8217;t know how Pratt is at this moment now, other than I know it&#8217;s highly expensive. But yeah, that&#8217;s how my experience was there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you graduate from Pratt. Tell me what your early career is like, because I want to also just kind of put this in a timeframe here. I mean you&#8217;re studying design at a time when personal computers were not really part of design.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
No. No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I&#8217;d love to kind of hear what was your early career like once you graduated?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
I have to say, I think my early part of my career probably was the most fun part of my career. Where I think I chalk it up to youth where, I mean there was no holds barred. I thought I could do anything. I was like I was ready for every stuff and it was pre-computer. So I was pretty good with my hands in doing that. Because in the beginning, in my beginning career, we did everything by hand. So we did boards, type was done through a, we&#8217;d send it to our type setting department or you would send it out to type setting companies and they would run off, what was that called? A linograph, I think it was called linograph. Basically it was just a sheet of paper that had the type set on there and you would cut that up, paste it on the board, with rubber cement. It was very hands on. That was where you would get your-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, Letraset is that what you mean? Letraset?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
No, Letraset was for the, if you&#8217;re doing display type.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
But the actual body copy, the that text, if you tried putting that on Letraset, you would kill yourself. It would be tedious and oh so time consuming. So that was set by a machine that just ran off, sort of like photo paper you can kind of say it and you would just cut it down to size as you need.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, that&#8217;s linotype.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, linotype. That&#8217;s it. Not linograph, linotype. The Letraset really is for display type. If you want to do custom things and stuff like that. Especially like logos. If you were going to do logo stuff. Oh yeah, that&#8217;s what I was going to say back then, that&#8217;s where you would actually get your battle scars because by cutting all that stuff with the X-Acto blade or an actual razor blade, it was no way you were not going to cut your hand. And getting cut with X-Acto blade is better than getting cut by a razor blade. Because hoo, those razors are deep. But that was just par for the course. Your hands, your fingers would be all scarred up. You don&#8217;t see them so much now in my hands, but there&#8217;s one or two spots that you still see where I have some heavy cuts.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s how we actually did stuff by putting them on board, gluing down the type. The images we would actually have to send out to a stat house and they would take basically what was a full scale image or a film. It&#8217;d be like they would send you a negative and you would send that negative to the printer. You would put down sort of a for all intents and purposes, like a Xerox copy of what it is, just to get them in position, placing everything down with tracing paper to cover everything up, do some inking when you needed to do some things. And that was a lot of pen and ink work, which I think is solely missed from today&#8217;s work. Folks are so reliant on digital that they don&#8217;t know how to create stuff by hand anymore. And there is a beautiful nuance between hand created stuff and digital stuff.</p>
<p>Digital can be too clean. Even the stuff that try to simulate manmade stuff, it still has a cleanness about it that doesn&#8217;t exist in handmade stuff. And all that would take us some serious time. So if you wasted time, if say, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m not going to work on this today.&#8221; You lost 24 hours that can really impact your deadline. Now, unlike today where everything is like, &#8220;Okay, well I&#8217;m not going to work on this right now, I&#8217;ll do it tomorrow.&#8221; You don&#8217;t lose that kind of time because digital is so quick, it&#8217;s so instantaneous. But working there, my very first thought was I had gotten an internship at a small ad agency out of the result of, at that time I was the president of the Black Student Union at Pratt and I was all about business.</p>
<p>So I was looking at the Black Student Union as a way to start linking us up with job opportunities to various different agencies and studios in New York City so that we can get a head start on the other students, ie our white students who easily have these connections and get into stuff. But folks were not looking for us. So I was determined to try and get us a jump start. And one of the agencies who participated in that program, I was awarded the internship, which was a whole story because essentially folks didn&#8217;t participate. There was only a few folks that actually came out and participated, which really disappointed me on that. And I got it because my portfolio was the best out of it and folks had issues with that. But I&#8217;m like, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t apply, you can&#8217;t complain.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so I worked there for the summer of 1989. So once I graduated they offered me a full-time job. So I worked there for the summer and I was doing, it was an ad agency, but I was doing a lot more design work and I was the defacto art director because I was the art department because the agency was, it was a Black owned agency, it was just the principal and two other people in there. Excuse me. And it was a good experience because I was able to do my first photo shoots, meet these photographers, do [inaudible 00:55:03], set up model stuff. I had to battle folks because folks were like, &#8220;You sure you&#8217;re the art director? You seem a little young.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Well yeah, I am young but I am it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The only thing that kind of saved my grace a bit where people gave people a little pause at time was that, yeah, I towered everybody. I was six, was I 6&#8217;6 then when I graduated? I was either between 6&#8217;4 or 6&#8217;6, because I don&#8217;t think I reached my peak until around 23, 24. And so I towered over everybody. So my height kind of gave me some more credence and credibility and stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
But I always had a baby face. I still sort of do have a baby face. I mean it&#8217;s getting a little older. And so folks questioned that. But once I started doing the work, they were like, &#8220;Okay, no, you seem to know what you&#8217;re doing.&#8221; Because I kind of learned it as I went because if I didn&#8217;t know something, I was determined to go find out how to do it. And that&#8217;s where, I mean, because that was pre-internet. So again, I hit up libraries now. I mean there was so much information out there that people just don&#8217;t realize if you just get up and look for it, there&#8217;s a world at your fingertips. And I would just find out information on the rare occasions that I&#8217;d actually just ask people in the industry, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You don&#8217;t don&#8217;t know me, but can I just ask you a question?&#8221; And folks were surprisingly helpful. So I did that and I was pretty much given leeway to do stuff, which is not usually the case.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why that actually occurred. I consider myself lucky in a lot of the places I was employed at, I was given a lot of leeway. I was given the autonomy to like, you are the leader, create your stuff. Now I don&#8217;t know if it was the aspect of how I carried myself, how I did my work, because I always felt I was nervous. I was a nervous wreck. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Do I really know what I&#8217;m doing? I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; I was always doubting myself in my head, but I would not let that show, I would not let that be known to anybody. And so for those three months, everything was still done by hand. No, the only computers in there were for the administrative views. And I will freely admit I use that computer to play my video games. Because I&#8217;ve been on video games since Atari 2600. Even though Atari was crap, I had CalecoVision, but that&#8217;s a side note.</p>
<p>So we were still doing stuff by hand and I was doing some long hours. There was no, okay, it&#8217;s 5:00, everybody go home. No, I would stay until about 11:00 at night, 12:00 at night. And the owner would just give me the key to the place and say, &#8220;Just lock up when you need to.&#8221; Which I thought was, wow. Again, I seemed to endear confidence to people that they gave me this responsibility and I never broke that trust on that responsibility. So from there, after about three months, like I said, again, being a young creative, I was a little too cocky and I was like, &#8220;You know what? I&#8217;m tired of this. I can get me another job like that.&#8221; And so I quit. I was like, I wanted to do something else.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s when I realized, no Andrew, that&#8217;s not how it works. It&#8217;s like I got a hard dose of reality. It was like that I need to get my ego in check. And I was out of work for a good number of months. Back then you found your jobs through the classified ads in the paper, which I know today everybody would be like, &#8220;What&#8217;s a newspaper? What&#8217;s a classified ad?&#8221; But it&#8217;s equivalent to a job listing online. And I found a listing for an associate art director at this publishing company. And I said, &#8220;Oh, okay, that&#8217;s a different genre. Let&#8217;s kind of see how that is.&#8221; Submitted my resume, they called me in for an interview and I got a surprise because when I came in for the interview, that&#8217;s when I learned that the magazine was for an adult. It was an adult magazine, it was an adult publishing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
And I was like, okay, this is interesting. But then when they actually specified what market in the adult publishing, it was a gay lifestyle magazine, I was like, &#8220;Oh, this is 1989.&#8221; And that was in the height of the AIDS epidemic, the Black kid from Bed-Stuy, there was a lot of stigma to the gay community and stuff like that. My concern was like, &#8220;Well okay, this X-rated stuff, can I get a job after this if I take this?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
That was my main concern. And so did very well in the interview. It was interesting when they said this, I&#8217;ll share with everybody, in 1989, the starting salary at that position was $22,000. I thought that was a lot of money back then and it was a lot of money because it supported me very well. Went back home, had a conversation with my mom, like, &#8220;Hey I went to this job, it looked pretty good. What do you think?&#8221; And she was like, &#8220;Are you there to do what you earned your degree in?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8220;What are they paying you?&#8221; I told her the salary. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;So what is the problem?&#8221; I said, &#8220;There&#8217;s no problem. It&#8217;s just if you&#8217;re doing what you&#8217;re supposed to be do not supposed to be doing, but if you&#8217;re doing what you&#8217;ve been, you&#8217;ve got your degree on and this is your career. What&#8217;s the issue? It&#8217;s your starting point. Now it doesn&#8217;t mean that&#8217;s your end point.&#8221; And with talking to my mom, I was like, &#8220;You know what, that makes sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so after that conversation, it again, coincidentally I got a call from the art director that I met. She offered me the job now and I was like, &#8220;Okay, yeah, I&#8217;ll take it, I&#8217;ll see you.&#8221; And I started working, I stayed there five years. And so I rose from associate art director to an art director for monthly magazines. And yes, they were all towards the gay market. I learned quite a lot. I learned that if you are a good designer, you can design for any market. It&#8217;s about understanding your market and understanding what you&#8217;re doing for, what are you doing in that project to address your market. And the benefit of doing that magazine was that it wasn&#8217;t a straight just pictorial kind of magazine. It had lifestyle. So they had editorial in there and it was, unless you know what the magazine was, it could have just been in any mainstream magazine.</p>
<p>At the time The Advocate and Out were two magazines in the gay market that just kind of came out and they were getting a lot of shine. They were the number ones and they were beautifully done magazines. They were beautifully designed. And I kind of used that as my inspiration to model, to sort do my lifestyle stuff as, which was very successful. And it helped me transition from there to my next gig, which was at Essence Communications. But in those five years, that&#8217;s when I started. We transitioned about a year. Yeah, I think it was about a year after I started transitioning into computers. The Mac.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
In 1991, I believe. Because that was the other premise I stayed with. Well I wanted to take the opportunity too is that they had said they were going to make that transition from doing stuff production wise with the mechanical boards to move into doing the work electronically. Now that they were going to use Mac. I&#8217;m sorry, that wasn&#8217;t in 1991. That was 1990.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, it was 1990 because I started in &#8217;89 and then I think in the spring of 1990, that&#8217;s when they started introducing the Mac, gave us courses. We went out there and myself and my other coworker who was the other associate art director on the magazine I was working on, we just blew it out. We were at class and then we would come back to the office and take what we had in class to apply it and continue it. Learning and doing stuff and seeing how things work when we were back in the office. And our art director at the time was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s great because you&#8217;re going to help me learn this because I don&#8217;t get what&#8217;s going on.&#8221; And he was older than us and stuff like that. But it was fun. And it made things go so much faster. And now we are doing our own type setting.</p>
<p>We now scanning images so we now can place them into our documents. We actually have the live files where we actually start learning how to photo retouch, photo calibrate how to type, how to create special print techniques like masking, fit colors, all this stuff that. The bad side of that was it actually, with the advent of the Mac, it eliminated whole industries. We lost type houses. Those faded out because now people could do it themselves. We lost a lot of production folks who actually, if you didn&#8217;t actually do the boards yourself, you could hire people to do it. No, just create and then give the directions to them, to losing some of the business with the photostat houses, those closed out. And those closed out [inaudible 01:04:52] within one year after the Apple came onto the market. Changed the whole face of downtown Manhattan, which used to be all type setting printers and photostat houses. By 1991 it was virtually a ghost town from those businesses. They had gone.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
They had transitioned to something else. So some of the photostat houses turned into scanning places. So they could scan some original art now because illustration, especially big pieces. Because at that time a lot of the illustrators still did the work by hand. They didn&#8217;t do digital work and some of these pieces were pretty big. They couldn&#8217;t fit your normal day tabletop scan because all this stuff back then was pricey as heck. Tabletop scanner poly was like next to a $1,000. That was a lot of money. So it was cheaper just to send it out and get a $50 scan now and you just get that scan to you and you can put it on. But that changed the where you no longer now had your battle scars so your fingers were saved, you didn&#8217;t have to cut up your fingers anymore. And it also kept from getting blood on the boards. Because that was always interesting when we got blood on the boards. Because you had to wipe that out. Otherwise that&#8217;s in the actual, when they shoot it. Now it&#8217;s just clean.</p>
<p>And now at this point though, our role shifted as creatives because so much stuff relied on us. We actually had to know how to operate this Mac inside and out. Especially when if there was a problem with the Mac. Yeah, we had IT, quote &#8220;IT department&#8221;, but thankfully the Mac was and still is very sort of self-sufficient. So when things go down it&#8217;s kind of easy to figure out what&#8217;s going on to get it back up. But that usually relied to us. In the beginning we had a service that would come in and fix that stuff, but eventually the owner was like, &#8220;Look, you guys are working on this. Do you know how to do this because we&#8217;re cutting this.&#8221; But it actually opened up more doors on the creative side.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, we lost a lot of industry and a lot of people had to adapt, some folks didn&#8217;t because of the manual nature of design at that point. A lot of them were older generations. So they did not want to learn how to use the computers and learned these programs, very much today. It&#8217;s a generational thing. The older generation just was like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t change. I learned all this. How am I going to, I don&#8217;t want to sit down and learn this whole new program and this contraption to do this.&#8221; And that&#8217;s where a lot of folks didn&#8217;t make that transition. They either had to leave the industry and do something else or just completely retire.</p>
<p>And like I said, that changed the shape of downtown Manhattan because it also changed the printers. And a lot of those started consolidating and shrinking down to what we see today. But it also sped up our creative process. So if we had an idea, we could actually instantaneously see how it works. Where at that time it was QuarkXpress, that was the defacto thing. There was no creative cloud. Adobe was this brand new company battling with Macromedia, battling with, what was the other one? Oh, Publisher. Yes. QuarkXpress had to battle Microsoft Publisher back in the day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember Microsoft Publisher.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, we had not Illustrator, but it was freehand and Photoshop was Photoshop. That never disappeared. And so you had to buy all these individually. So back then being a designer was expensive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Expensive. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Because the Macs themselves were these god awful paper weights. Because the face of the Apple, I mean at the time it looks sleek, but looking at it now, it&#8217;s like, oh man, that&#8217;s [inaudible 01:09:16].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It was a big rectangle kind of thing, right?</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It was like the screen and the CPU were all in one.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yes, that version. Yes, they had that. The screen was probably no more than maybe 13 inches, which seemed big at the time. And then they transitioned to having the monitor separate from the tower because everything was a tower back then. And that&#8217;s where the screen started getting bigger and stuff. But it&#8217;s still, it cost a lot of money and everything was on a disc. Nothing was cloud-based. Because the internet didn&#8217;t come into play until 1985. Is that correct?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, the cloud wasn&#8217;t a thing back then. Everything was-</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, the cloud didn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Everything was floppy discs. And then the floppy discs gave way to those smaller hard discs.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Floppy to the ZIP to actually floppy to the Quest, to the ZIP to the dat. Thank God we didn&#8217;t have to do the dat much. And then there was something in between. It was a hybrid of a ZIP and the Quest, is that right? I forgot the technology in it. But it went through some iterations in the span of five years. Now each year was something new, which was expensive. It was crap. I mean it didn&#8217;t come out of my pocket, but it was expensive. But you had to adapt to each of those technologies and stuff.</p>
<p>Basically if you kind of damaged your CDs, there was no way to get a backup. If your machines got corrupted, the disc got corrupted and corrupted meaning by, just scratched the back of that disc because somebody did not put it up properly. It&#8217;s done. That would mean you have to spend another $1,000 to go buy some brand new disc of one program. Same with type, you have to do same with type, all that stuff. But it did enable to have more creative tools at hand. So if you had an idea, you could still do it by hand, but now you could translate it, do your sketch and translate it onto the computer where you can actually do different variations in the same day where it may have taken us a few days to do iterations of one idea.</p>
<p>And that sped up a lot of stuff and it was kind of cool. It expanded our imaginations. It put more responsibility on us, which I liked because I liked being in control and knowing what&#8217;s going on with the Mac and the program so that way I could troubleshoot myself. Because at that time I was thinking, okay, this is going to be helpful for one day when I want to start freelancing and get my own materials or when one day I have my own studio. Because back then I thought about my end goals. I had this studio, get this whole staff and become a small to midsize kind of well known studio. And that&#8217;s pretty much the early days. It was very much unexplored. So anything and everything was open and it was just, if you were into adventure, it was an adventure. You were so curious to see what the next thing was going to be.</p>
<p>Whereas today I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Look, slow down. Yeah, there&#8217;s too much stuff coming out. I just learned this, now you got something new. No, no, no, no, that&#8217;s not happening. That&#8217;s too fast.&#8221; As well as I think today, technology&#8217;s great, but I think it also makes people stupider, people put more faith on the tech versus their thinking and they&#8217;re not sort of, they&#8217;re relying too much on the machine and not relying on themselves. Because the machine is just a tool. And in the early days we did see that. It was just a tool. That&#8217;s all we looked at. It was like, unless we had our thoughts together before we went to the machine, we&#8217;d be wasting our time. Because you&#8217;re just fiddling around just getting lost in this virtual world. Today it seems to be the reverse. People don&#8217;t mind fiddling on there and they spend so many hours that basically are futile, they just waste stuff.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s how the early days were. It was a really a fun exploratory, I don&#8217;t want to say Wild, Wild West, but it kind of was a Wild, Wild West. And then when the net came on board, because I remember fully using the internet in &#8217;95, but we actually did have the internet. The company was called a Mavety Media. I think that came, we had that online around 1993 because I left Mavety Media in 1995. So yeah, I think it had just started. And at that time I think it was all, everything was AOL or Netscape. And the net just was, oh, we just went bonkers with that. It was just like, oh, I can get this right now. Even though that was on dial up. So that was taking a long time. Dial up, I don&#8217;t miss at all. You could not do any high files with that or anything like that. It just was too slow. But that&#8217;s what the early days were like. It was kind of cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When I give presentations sometimes I&#8217;ll tell people how in the early days of the web you had a fast lane and a slow lane. The fast lane was like if you had 56K and the slow lane was 28.8. I love that you&#8217;re talking about all of this because I feel like this is something which is definitely not talked about in this current age of design. Everything is done in the cloud, on the web, on a PC or a Mac so quickly. Sometimes even just on mobile devices. I see what people do designing on just mobile devices. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;This blows my mind.&#8221; Because I was in high school in the &#8217;90s when a lot of this technology was coming out. And to your point, as you were mentioning, these things were changing rapidly, as the technology was changing, there were no sort of monopolies like an Adobe, like we&#8217;re talking about now. But there was Adobe, there was Macromedia, there were other sorts of products. There was Quark. You had to try to figure out which one you wanted to do.</p>
<p>It was all extremely expensive and there really was no, I want to say there was no learning curve, but you learned by having to actually get in there and work it or go through those huge big, thick instruction manuals. Because there&#8217;s no-</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s no YouTube video, there&#8217;s no class you can go to that&#8217;s going to teach you how to do this. You got to read that 1,000 page manual and figure out how to type set these columns and how to do all this stuff. I mean, to your point about the Wild, Wild West, it really was a time when I think innovation was happening at a speed where people were really just trying to catch up.</p>
<p>You had these different options. Like you said, you could do Quark, you could do Adobe, you could do Macromedia. And a lot of jobs sometimes even when you applied to them wanted you to know one more than the other. It wasn&#8217;t so much about whether or not I think you had the skill, but more so whether you knew the program. And I think that&#8217;s something which technology has definitely changed a lot. It&#8217;s less about the skills and more about, &#8220;Do you know how to use Figma? Do you know how to use Sketch?&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;But I&#8217;m a designer.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well we really well we use Figma. So do you know how to use that?&#8221; It&#8217;s so different now.</p>
<p><b>Andrew Bass Jr.:</b><br>
Well, I mean back then when I was looking at stuff, when I was doing job searches, when I was moving from space to space, the thing that did start happening was that they wanted you to know this insane amount of programs. I think they just listed these programs because that&#8217;s what was out. And they were like, we want you to know everything. And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s impossible. You can&#8217;t know all this stuff.&#8221; And it was very much, I don&#8217;t think they really wanted skill set, but just to say, &#8220;Okay, well we have somebody who knows this,&#8221; regardless of whether or not they actually know how to use it. I could have just went into the program one time just to look at it, oh, I know this program now.</p>
<p>That kind of impeded some people as they looked for jobs back then because it was like, &#8220;Look, I don&#8217;t know this stuff. I&#8217;m not going to put this down and then get busted when they give me this.&#8221; And like, &#8220;Hey, we need this full fledged project done in this, by this time,&#8221; and you don&#8217;t even know what you&#8217;re doing with it. I mean, granted, there were some people who did do that and coasted by until they got found out later on. But by then they could kind of sweet talk it through and then others shamelessly got blasted. I remember that back then. But yeah, it&#8217;s where it went from it was like more, &#8220;Okay, what is your true skill set and experience that you&#8217;ve actually shown a pattern of this,&#8221; versus, &#8220;Here&#8217;s our laundry list. Just let us know you&#8217;ve done this.&#8221;</p>
<p>I still kind of see that today though. And whenever there&#8217;s some new tech out, I do see some of these listings out here. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, do you know this?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, that just came out last week. How are people going to know this?&#8221; But I mean I think that&#8217;s going to stick forever that&#8217;s going to be there. Because any new tech that comes out, I think people in the who post these jobs, I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re really the ones that, and we all know it&#8217;s HR departments, and so the HR departments don&#8217;t really know what people do in their day to day stuff. So I think they just put all the trendy stuff in there just to cover their bases.</p>
<p>But I do miss some of that from back in the day. And it was kind of cool. And I mean, there is some new stuff like that today, particularly in terms of web and video that I see some parallels that I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Ooh, that&#8217;s intriguing.&#8221; But now with a seasoned book, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s kind overwhelming.&#8221; I kind of feel overwhelmed at times. Like, oh, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m going to learn all that. Yeah. But it would be cool. Yes.</p>

<p>We all know there are several ways to achieve success as a creative, but sometimes it takes inspiration from others to set you on the right path. That&#8217;s definitely the case with the multitalented TTK. His work as an art director, painter, designer and illustrator have taken him far, and now he can add another title to his roster &#8212; filmmaker!</p>
<p>Our conversation began with a quick year-end check-in, and then TTK talked about <a href="https://www.justlikeme-havas.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">&#8220;Just Like Me&#8221;</a>, a short documentary he created with Havas to educate and inspire the next generation of Black creatives. TTK also shared more details of his life story, including growing up in Florida, serving in the Navy for 10 years after going to art school, and more. Hopefully TTK&#8217;s story and documentary can help inspire you to rise to greater heights!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
My name is TTK. What I do, I&#8217;m an artist, I&#8217;m a designer. Currently, I work in advertising. I&#8217;m a director, I&#8217;m a painter. I wear a few hats.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has the year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
The year&#8217;s been good for me so far, man, the year&#8217;s been very, very good. How I measure if the year is doing good, I measure if I&#8217;m doing something this year that I didn&#8217;t do the previous year or if I accomplished something this year that I didn&#8217;t in the previous year, that determines for me whether it&#8217;s good or not. We&#8217;re going into the fourth quarter right now, so the accomplishments and what I&#8217;ve accomplished so far in this year, I&#8217;m really proud of myself. I took a few punches, but that&#8217;s life right there. I hop back up and take it on the chin and take it as a lesson learned. But all in all, this year&#8217;s good for me. It&#8217;s been going great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything in particular that you still want to try to do before the year ends?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Paint more. A friend of mine jokes and it says once I learned how to do digital work, it made me lazy with painting. And I don&#8217;t want to admit it, but he is right because painting is a process. Well, everything is a process, but whenever you&#8217;re painting, you got to wait for the paint to dry, come back to it and work into it some more, then work into it some more. It takes much longer.</p>
<p>And you would think with me being traditionally trained before I even learn how to do anything in Photoshop or any software, I was doing this first years before I knew how to use any software. You would think I would be conditioned for it. But learning how to work in digital just made me just work faster and have less patience maybe because working in the industry, working the agency, working the companies, I&#8217;m on a timeline where I got to turn this stuff around fast. It can be very competitive, whereas with painting, this can take&#8230; Because I&#8217;m so meticulous with the details and everything when I&#8217;m painting, it can take anywhere from weeks to a month. Depends on how much time. Well, I try not to take breaks in between, but I wind up doing that. Anyway.</p>
<p>All that to say I just want to paint more, knock out more pieces. Because I got a solo show coming out in 2023, a solo art show. It&#8217;s the first solo show that I&#8217;ve done in, oh my god, probably 12 or 13 years with all original pieces, so I&#8217;m on the clock right now. It&#8217;s next year in the spring, but time catches up real quick so I got to start really cranking out pieces. Teah, all that to say I want to paint more.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I find when visual creators, particularly when they get further along in their career, they often want to go back to some sort of physical, tangible way of creating. Like you said, doing it digitally does make you faster, but there&#8217;s a craft in the visual art that gets lost I think sometimes when you&#8217;re relying too much on digital tools.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. People will ask me, &#8220;Can I get this? Can I commission you for this piece?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Truthfully, it&#8217;ll be probably easier for you on your budget to commission me to do something digitally.&#8221; Because paintings, it takes a while. Well, for me it takes a while because there&#8217;s a certain level of quality that I want to put out. And there&#8217;s no command Z to go back when I make a mistake or it doesn&#8217;t come out the way I want it to look. I got to wait for it to dry and then I got to go back and rework it, or I&#8217;m mixing these colors, and the tubes of paint ain&#8217;t cheap. You know what I&#8217;m saying? You can buy the cheap stuff, but you going to get cheap results. It really adds up. But all in all, this is always my first love right here. And I always go back to that.</p>
<p>I was just working on this piece that I&#8217;m currently working on. I&#8217;ve been working on it about two months now. I just think working in it, I forget about how I used to feel painting before I was doing anything digitally. How I would just put a album on, put a CD on, put a record on, just rock out for hours on. And I miss that feeling of seclusion and just painting.</p>
<p>I was watching something, one of those shows that come on Sunday, one of the Sunday weekly news shows or whatever, but they were talking about&#8230; This is a few months back. They were talking about George Bush, how he put out a book, maybe it was last year. It was a book about people across the nation or people in this community or something like that. But it was his paintings and these people. And it was like, we don&#8217;t really rock with George Bush. You know what I&#8217;m saying? We don&#8217;t rock with George Bush, but his paintings weren&#8217;t bad. You know what I&#8217;m saying? Man, this dude actually isn&#8217;t that bad. He was on his ranch just painting or whatever and everything. I was like, I never would&#8217;ve guessed that from this guy. But I&#8217;m like, man, I would love that life just to be in a loft somewhere just, I don&#8217;t know, in the middle of nowhere, just painting. I don&#8217;t know, man. One day, one day. I&#8217;m going to speak into existence.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think you&#8217;ll get there. You&#8217;ll get there, absolutely. Let&#8217;s talk about your day job, what you do. You&#8217;re a senior art director at Havas, which is ad and PR company. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah, so I&#8217;ve been at Havas for about three years now. It&#8217;s been good, you know what I&#8217;m saying? A lot of opportunities have come from me being there. What I do, I work on clients. The main client that I&#8217;ve worked on since I&#8217;ve been there is Michelin and doing stuff for Michelin social. And I got a chance to kind of be&#8230; Not kind of be, I got a chance to be very creative with their brand. I worked on stuff for Mike&#8217;s Hard Lemonade, worked on a few other projects, but&#8230; My mind is blank right now, but Michelin is probably the main one that comes to mind because I&#8217;ve been on the brand pretty much 80% of the time I&#8217;ve been there.</p>
<p>One thing I can say about working on stuff for Michelin is that I&#8217;m blessed it. Everything I touch, I&#8217;ve been able to add my own personal touch or flare to it that they probably wouldn&#8217;t have done, whereas I push the limits where I can bring my personality and my style of creativity to a brand like that that has so much rich history and it&#8217;s been doing something a certain way for so long. But I&#8217;ve been able to bring my look and feel to it and explain to them why this works. And they&#8217;ve been open and they&#8217;ve been receptive to it. Sometimes we get pushback, of course, that&#8217;s just how it goes. But for the most part, I think with me working on the brand for so long, I know the do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts and know where I can push it and where I can&#8217;t. But the areas where I can push it, I really try to flex and really do something where if someone&#8217;s scrolling, if they&#8217;re scrolling on their phone or whatever and they see this graphic like, &#8220;Oh, this is pretty dope right here,&#8221; it would make me as a consumer want to check out more about this product right here. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now, you started there in October of 2019, which it feels like&#8230; With this pandemic, that feels like a lifetime ago. But how did the pandemic change up how you work?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny you say that because I was doing&#8230; Right now I worked out of the Chicago office. And prior to me working out of the Chicago office, I was in New York, I was in Brooklyn. I was doing freelance work for them, and then they gave me a full-time&#8230; offered me a full-time role. And I was like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m already doing freelance for you guys out here and I&#8217;m delivering what you&#8217;re asking me for. Can I just stay out here in New York?&#8221; It was like, &#8220;Yeah, we want to have you in the office.&#8221;</p>
<p>I move cross country, and then a couple months later everybody&#8217;s working from home. You know what I&#8217;m saying? My partner, Chevon, she was working remote as well at the time for a nonprofit, and she had been telling me, yo, everybody in her nonprofit is all over the country. You know what I&#8217;m saying? Working. You&#8217;re doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Working from home thing, it definitely&#8230; I always say as messed up as the pandemic has been and COVID and all of that, it was a big reset to show some of these jobs that we do the way we do them is outdated. And this is just my opinion. And going into office every day, five days a week, sometimes six, and sitting there for eight, 10 hours just to say that you&#8217;re here, we can do the work everywhere. You look at people on&#8230; What&#8217;s the site? Fiverr. You know what I&#8217;m saying? You don&#8217;t know where these people are at, but they&#8217;re still delivering stuff for you or whatever. And that&#8217;s what this pandemic showed. In my opinion, what it showed is thankfully the type of work that we do, the digital creative stuff, we can do it from anywhere. It definitely opened up my eyes and everything because I feel like I was&#8230; Like a lot of us, we were programmed to just come and to go into the office, just sit there and just look watching the clock waiting for 5:30, 6:30 to come, paying $15 for lunch every day, all of that right there.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind working remotely at all, man. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I don&#8217;t mind it, truthfully. I know me personally, I can be extrovert, I can be reclusive as well. When I&#8217;m creating, sometimes I just like to be alone. We can collaborate, but I like to be alone. I&#8217;m able to execute the way I really want to execute and execute my best way sometimes when I&#8217;m alone. I don&#8217;t mind working remote. I actually love it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s a typical day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I juggle a few things, man. It depends on the workload sometimes, man. A lot of times, like when I was working heavy on Michelin, when we had a lot of deliverables for the brand, it would be coming up with all these different creative pillars of ways to how the brand incorporates into travel or how they incorporate with food, how they incorporate it in their heritage, coming up with creative ways to display this stuff right here, like getting things ready for a client meeting.</p>
<p>Basically, the day starts, we get briefed on what&#8217;s due, what everyone&#8217;s working on. And that&#8217;s pretty much it, thankfully for me. I&#8217;m in a space where I can just do what I need to do and no one really bothers me, I guess because maybe they know that&#8217;s how I operate best. That&#8217;s pretty much my work day.</p>
<p>As far as doing side projects or painting&#8230; Well, the paintings more so of recent things. I take breaks in between that. But sometimes I might work on little side project here, do little brush strokes on the painting for maybe about, I don&#8217;t know, 15 minutes, come back to it a couple hours later. My day is basically just me being creative. I&#8217;m thankful to say that. I enjoy what I do, and I have fun doing what I do. And it&#8217;s how I envision my life. No stress. I&#8217;m not working in the cold. I&#8217;ve been there before. I&#8217;ve done a lot of things, man.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thankful that right now every day when I wake up, no two days are the same, but every day when I wake up, man, I can honestly say I&#8217;m not stressed about what I&#8217;m doing. And I&#8217;m doing what I love to do. It may not be the exact project that I want to work on, but at least I can say that my day consists of me being creative. And I&#8217;m getting paid to be creative. You know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. No, that&#8217;s a good thing. I think especially agencies tend to get the reputation&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if they get the best reputation, I&#8217;ll put it that way, sometimes because you&#8217;re often working from client to client so you don&#8217;t have a lot of time to spend with maybe a particular brand to do something before you&#8217;re put on another project or put on another campaign or something like that. But it sounds like with what you&#8217;re doing, especially because you mentioned earlier you&#8217;ve been on the Michelin brand for so long, you&#8217;ve had time to grow into it in a way.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
It&#8217;s cool because I&#8217;ve had access to all of their assets and their personal login site where it&#8217;s so many assets, so much history. And that&#8217;s a cool thing about working on a brand like this right here that&#8217;s been around for over 100 years; there&#8217;s so much that you can pull from. A.And not to sound cliche, but a lot of times with working on this brand, you don&#8217;t have to reinvent the wheel. Everything is there already, you just got to figure out how to repurpose it. I&#8217;ve worked on&#8230; What&#8217;s the faucet brand MOEN. I worked on MOEN briefly. I worked on Yellowstone National Park.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I said it before, but Mike&#8217;s Hard Lemonade. That was cool working on that. This was pre-pandemic. We had a cool, very, very dope idea and campaign for Mike&#8217;s Hard Lemonade, but didn&#8217;t see the light of day because the pandemic happened at the time. The pandemic happened and everything shut down so we had to redirect the direction of where we wanted to go. And it was a much, much, much more scaled down version of&#8230; It wasn&#8217;t even scaled down, it was a whole new direction. Everything that we created, the hours that we spent, no one really will ever see this out into the world. But that&#8217;s the nature of the game, you take it how it comes, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, you&#8217;ve worked before as a graphic designer, and we&#8217;ll talk about that a little later, and now you&#8217;re an art director at an agency. How would you describe the difference in those two?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t think there is any difference, man. Personally, I don&#8217;t. Maybe on paper where it says what the roles are, what the responsibilities are. On paper, it probably says certain things, but from my personal experience, I was doing the same thing coming up with ideas, coming up with ideas, coming up with ways to execute this thing, thinking of ways where we can&#8230; places where we can place these ideas so people can see it and engage with it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s similar to what I&#8217;m doing now. I worked in music, working at Mass Appeal. I worked on the record label side of the house. And sometimes I would work on the agency side as well. But it is the same thing, just one&#8217;s more culturally hip hop based, the other one&#8217;s more very American and reaches a broader audience and selling products.</p>
<p>But selling music is like selling products as well, man, so it&#8217;s the same thing. The way I see it, I think the only thing probably change is the company that you&#8217;re getting to check from. I always joke and I say this to people, and not to sound like a Debbie Downer or nothing like that, but you pick your poison. What are you able to accept and what are you able to deal with and whatever role or company or agency that you&#8217;re with? But I don&#8217;t find it any different at all.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is that the most challenging part about what you do? What you just mentioned?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I think the most challenging part about this right here, that working in design and advertising, from my experience, it&#8217;s a revolving door. I don&#8217;t know too many people that&#8217;s been in one spot for over five years. I just don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Early on, it was shocking. Not necessarily shocking to me, but it affected me emotionally. Damn, am I good enough? Or what could I have done differently? But then I understand it&#8217;s never personal, it&#8217;s business. And sometime business is up, sometime business is down. And when business is down, you might get cut. And that&#8217;s just the nature of the game.</p>
<p>And I think that&#8217;s where it just comes in. In trying to figure out too what do you love? You know, could work on one thing where the money is great, but you don&#8217;t really care about the work that you&#8217;re putting out. You&#8217;re not really in love with the brand or product or whatever that you&#8217;re working on. And then it could be something where you&#8217;re all about the mission that this one company or agency has, or you love what you&#8217;re working on but the pay isn&#8217;t the greatest. It&#8217;s all about trying, well, for me, trying to find that middle, that medium where, okay, I can get the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>But in all, back to what I was saying it&#8217;s a revolving door from, just from my experience, and a lot of my peers, not too many people I know stick around for a long time. And I don&#8217;t know whether it is because us being creative, you want to do your own thing eventually, or&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t want to make it a race thing or whatever, but it goes back to how do we see ourself? Well, for me personally, how do I see myself in a place where there aren&#8217;t many of people that look like me, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
And cannot coexist and naturally be myself in these spaces, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Do you think it might just be burnout or something?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s a few things. I feel like with junior people, when they don&#8217;t have the support or support from senior leadership, you got somebody might be fresh out of college and they got all these dreams of, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to do this. I&#8217;m going to do this award-winning stuff.&#8221; Of course everybody&#8217;s got those thoughts in their heads or whatever. But I feel like you take someone junior and you put them in a position and you don&#8217;t give them the support that they need to grow, it can be discouraging. And people will, &#8220;Yo, this ain&#8217;t for me right here.&#8221; You know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Or resourcing or whoever, they may not know a person&#8217;s&#8230; What&#8217;s their skillset? What&#8217;s that person&#8217;s strength? And the only thing they see is the person&#8217;s name and a title. And then, &#8220;Okay, well let&#8217;s put this person on this right here.&#8221; They might not even be the person that&#8217;s equipped for that. It&#8217;s like playing basketball; you can&#8217;t have the center playing the point guard position. You know what I&#8217;m saying? It don&#8217;t work out like that. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Well, you could, but you&#8217;re not going to get the optimum results.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit and talk more about you, talk about your personal life. Tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I&#8217;m originally from Jacksonville, Florida. That&#8217;s where I&#8217;m originally from. That&#8217;s where my early years were based out of. I moved away years ago, years ago. But I went to high school down there. And I was thankful to be in an art program going to an art school, Douglas Henderson School of the Arts, which at the time when I was going there, it was prestigious art school and everything.</p>
<p>But my father, when he went there, my father went there back in the &#8217;50s or the &#8217;60s or something like that. And at the time when he was going to that school, I think it was a school for Black students. You know what I&#8217;m saying? This is when segregation and all that stuff was going on. He went to that school decades before me. I just think it&#8217;s ironic that I ended up going there, but it&#8217;s a whole little different school at the time when I went.</p>
<p>But yeah, I got introduced to the arts there. Well, what&#8217;s the old TV show from back in the day? Fame?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Fame. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
It was like that, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Yeah, so it was a school like that and everything, man. Shortly after I graduated high school, a couple years went by, I tried to dabble in fashion for a little bit, but I couldn&#8217;t so I realized there wasn&#8217;t for me. I could design the stuff, but I couldn&#8217;t sew. And then going to college for&#8230; I went to Artist Studio Ft. Lauderdale only for one semester. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, I can&#8217;t sew then.&#8221; But it was cool though, it was cool though. I&#8217;m like, it&#8217;s more than just drawing, illustrations and everything.</p>
<p>Some years went by in between me having a child. After graduating high school, I just joined a Navy. I joined a navy cold turkey one day. I went to a recruiter and I was like, &#8220;Yo, I need a job.&#8221; You know what I&#8217;m saying? I need a job I can&#8217;t get fired from, maybe because the jobs I had at the time, life put me on a path where I wasn&#8217;t doing what I really wanted to do creatively, creatively, I was just working jobs. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Damn, this ain&#8217;t it right here, this really ain&#8217;t it.&#8221; I&#8217;m 21, 22 trying to figure life out. I went to a recruiter one day and I was like, &#8220;Yo, let me just hear what you got to say.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t even think I was going to sign up, but they hustled me like a car salesman, like a used car salesman.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Of course.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And at the time, they told me, &#8220;Yeah, you can get a sign on bonus for $7,000.&#8221; At the time when they told me that, $7,000, I had never seen $7,000 before. When they said $7,000, I&#8217;m seeing a million dollars in my head. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I was like, &#8220;Yo, yeah, let&#8217;s do it.&#8221; I joined the Navy in September 2001.</p>
<p>Yo, it&#8217;s crazy. I went to a recruiter station on a Friday. September 11th happened that Tuesday. Two weeks later, I was in bootcamp. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I was in bootcamp. Yeah. And I was in the Navy for 10 years. I&#8217;m a ex sub mariner. I was on submarines. There&#8217;s not many brothers on subs. At the time when I was on in the early 2000 and everything. And with me being in the Navy and being mostly in the north or whatever, the bulk of the time I was in the Navy, I started planting my roots in New York and in Brooklyn. A lot of people think I&#8217;m originally from Brooklyn, you know what I&#8217;m saying? That&#8217;s my second home. But I&#8217;m originally from Florida, from Jacksonville, man. I got roots down there as well. We&#8217;re all over the place right now. What else you want to know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m just curious about this 10 years in the Navy. First of all, my dad&#8217;s a Navy man, so I understand what that&#8217;s about. But the whole time that you&#8217;re doing this, were you also still pursuing creative things during this time?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yes. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Or how did that happen?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
No. Mind you, at the time in my early 20s, man. I look back on it now, I was a kid doing adult shit, you know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I was trying to figure it out, man. And I was a parent as well, you know what I&#8217;m saying? I was a parent trying to take care of a kid. I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t really know myself just yet. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
But I just know I need to provide some kind of way. And so the first couple of years of just me being in, it was just me just trying to figure out this thing, figure out this system, figure out what I got to do to not get in trouble and still keep some funds in my bank account and still perform and learn all the things that I need to learn, man.</p>
<p>Like I said, I was on submarines, and that&#8217;s&#8230; Aw man, that&#8217;s a whole nother world within itself and so much stuff that we have to know, from physics to&#8230; It&#8217;s so many things that I had to remember, being around top secret stuff, having a security clearance, working around nuclear weapons and things like that, man. It was a lot.</p>
<p>I was always doing drawing or whatever the whole time during those early years, drawing little tattoos for people and stuff like that. But it wasn&#8217;t until probably around 2004, the end of 2004, the sub that I was on, we left Norfolk, Virginia and we went up to Kittery, Maine. Kittery, Maine is on the border of New Hampshire, so Maine/New Hampshire. It wasn&#8217;t until I got up there that I wasn&#8217;t going out to sea, I&#8217;m just going to work for a couple of hours every day then going back to my barracks room. That gave me time to really do my art the way I really wanted to do it because I hadn&#8217;t done any art for so many years outside of high school. And by this time, I&#8217;m out of school for maybe seven years now, so I wasn&#8217;t really doing anything besides maybe sketching in my sketchbook. Seven years of not producing any work, it was really eating away at me. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I&#8217;m like, I know it&#8217;s more to life than this right here, there&#8217;s more to life right here. People tell you like, &#8220;Oh man, you do your 20 years, you&#8217;re going to get your retirement or whatever, and you still get out. You be young, you still be able to pursue other things.&#8221; But I knew deep down inside that that wasn&#8217;t me, that wasn&#8217;t for me.</p>
<p>But going back to, like I was saying, in 2004, a good friend of mine, he was from the Bronx. And around this time in early 2000, he was like, &#8220;Yo.&#8221; He knew that I like sneakers a lot. This is the early days before everybody&#8230; The sneaker app and all this other stuff like that. I was always one of those guys that had mad sneakers, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Before everybody knew me for my clothes and my sneakers and stuff, and he knew I could draw as well. A good friend of mine at the time, he was like&#8230; I guess he had went home for the weekend. He was from the Bronx. He went home for the weekend one time or something. He comes back, he was like, &#8220;I see these dudes customizing sneakers and everything. Why don&#8217;t you start doing that?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; I&#8217;ve always thought about it, but I never really tried to pursue it.</p>
<p>And I started searching on lunch, trying to figure out what paints and stuff I need to get. And once I figured out the right paints and everything, I think that&#8217;s when it really, really took off, where it really began for me as being an artist and putting my work out into the world through sneakers. This is the early days too. This is around &#8217;05, &#8217;06, going a little forward, the MySpace days, me just putting my stuff upon MySpace at the time and people checking for it. And it was like I was running a business out of my barracks room up in Maine. Nobody knew who I was, you know what I&#8217;m saying? No one knew who I was, they just knew the name TTK. That was my tag that I went by. My real name is Michael Harris. It&#8217;s a very generic name. There&#8217;s always another Michael Harris everywhere I go, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I was like, I got to do something that makes me stand down or whatever, so TTK. I was always into graffiti and stuff, man, so TTK was the initials that I like to tag. And I just like just it looks, the two T&#8217;s together and the K from a design point, I just like the way it looks.</p>
<p>Yeah, so everybody just knew, &#8220;Yo, this guy named TTK is customizing sneakers.&#8221; And this is the early days so there wasn&#8217;t a lot of people doing it how it is now almost 20 years later. That really opened my eyes. While I&#8217;m doing what I love to do and I&#8217;m getting paid to do what I want to do, this is what I want to do right here. I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s going to be customizing sneakers or working for Nike or whoever one day, but I&#8217;m being creative and I&#8217;m getting paid to be creative. This Navy thing, this right here is going to be my way out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was just asking were you still doing design and stuff or interested in design this whole time while you were in the Navy? And it sounds like you turned it into a profitable side business almost.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah. That led to me doing a bunch of other things. I went to high school for visual arts, traditional means in the &#8217;90s, man, like painting and things like that. I knew I wanted to paint, but I knew I couldn&#8217;t carry a big canvas with me everywhere. And I know not everybody has an appreciation for, I don&#8217;t know, fine art or the graphic design. Even though graphic design is isn&#8217;t everything that we see and interact with, most people don&#8217;t even realize that. But I was like, &#8220;Wow, how can I get my skillset, show what I want to bring out to the world and how people buy it?&#8221; Put them on sneakers. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p>The first year of me customizing sneakers, I wind up being featured in a book, I can&#8217;t even think of the name of it right now, but it was a book about custom sneakers or sneaker art from the early 2000s. But I was featured in this book. I wind up winning some contest with Finish Line at the time. I wind up having my two solo art shows at the time, and I wind up doing some freelance work for Timberland, the brand. And this is within the first year of me doing this. And I was like, &#8220;Wow, you know what? I got something right here. I&#8217;m onto something.&#8221; You know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
And what I was doing then, it&#8217;s very&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, I call it maybe it&#8217;s&#8230; It wasn&#8217;t on the skill level that I&#8217;m at right now, but I saw, you know what? I got something right here. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I got something right here.</p>
<p>And then shortly after that, I wind up meeting a good friend of mine who&#8217;s like a brother to me, Justice Hall. He was a designer at Timberland at the time. Because Timberland&#8217;s headquarters is in New Hampshire. I forget the town that it&#8217;s in in New Hampshire. But Justice saw my work on display at this skateboard shop. He saw my custom sneakers. And when Justice saw my work, he reached out to me. And he didn&#8217;t know who I was, he just saw the name TTK and he saw the work that I was doing. And it was like, &#8220;Yo, this person&#8217;s dope. I need to find them.&#8221; And he found me and we connected.</p>
<p>And he calls me up. It&#8217;s funny, I tell this story all the time. But when Justice, he got my information from the guys at the skateboard shop in New Hampshire. And they didn&#8217;t tell him who I was or anything like that. He was like, &#8220;Yo, this is this guy, this is TTK. Call him up, man. He&#8217;s dope.&#8221; When Justice calls me up and I answer the phone, I said, &#8220;Hello,&#8221; the first thing he says is, &#8220;Oh shit, you&#8217;re Black.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;What you thought I was?&#8217; I was thinking the same thing too because when they said designer, I didn&#8217;t think it was going to be another brother, someone the same age as me. You know what I&#8217;m saying? That&#8217;s into the same things that I&#8217;m into. It was like we were shocked to meet each other. And it was crazy because up there in New Hampshire/Maine, there aren&#8217;t many brothers up there. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
At the time, whenever it was like you see another Black person up there, you were like, &#8220;Oh man, you&#8217;re from up here? Oh man, where you from?&#8221; Or whatever. &#8220;Man, we should hang out or whatever.&#8221; You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Because I really didn&#8217;t see many of us up there or whatever, man. But anyway, so whenever me and Justice connected, it was like he put me onto so much. And I talk about it all the time. He showed me that everything that I wanted to be, I could be it. This guy&#8217;s the same age as me, similar interest and everything, come from similar backgrounds, and this guy is doing all the things that I wanted to do in life at that point. He just encouraged me.And at the time, I didn&#8217;t own computer, I didn&#8217;t own anything. The only thing I knew how to do was to paint and just hustle and just do art. And he told me, he was like, &#8220;Bro, you&#8217;re a brand and you don&#8217;t even realize it. You created a brand in a barracks room and people are buying your work from all over the world.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;You&#8217;re special, man.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;Yo, you really need to get out the Navy, man.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yo, I can get you a job right now.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m under contract.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;You can&#8217;t break it?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Nah, I can&#8217;t break this contract. I get out in&#8230;: At the time, I think I had five more years left because I had just reenlisted.</p>
<p>Yeah man, I owe a lot to Justice, man. He credits me for giving him a breath of fresh air and inspiring him as well, but I thank him all the time, man, because if I never met him, I think I would&#8217;ve got to where I needed to go eventually, but it would&#8217;ve probably taken a little bit longer. Like I said, at the time when I met Just, this is 2006. He&#8217;s showing me his portfolio. I didn&#8217;t even have a portfolio at the time, I just had some photos of my work that I took. And I took him to the pharmacy at the time to get the photos developed [inaudible 00:37:03] or whatever, man. Like I said, I didn&#8217;t know, I was very, very green. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I didn&#8217;t know. I knew I got a good product and I just know how to hustle. That&#8217;s the only thing I knew.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s showing me all his credentials and everything, he&#8217;s telling me about, &#8220;Yo, I work with Kanye.&#8221; This is during the Touch the Sky era and all of that, man. He&#8217;s showing me this. He&#8217;s showing the brands he&#8217;s worked on. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I did this cool sneaker for my man right here.&#8221; You know what I&#8217;m saying? He was like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t even worry about the credentials. It&#8217;s going to come, man. You trust me. You got it.&#8221; Once I met him and I saw what I wanted to be, it was no turning back after that. I was like, &#8220;Yo, I&#8217;m getting out. I&#8217;m getting out. I&#8217;m going to figure it out one way or another.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fast forward, I don&#8217;t know, I can&#8217;t do the math right now, 15 so years later I&#8217;m here talking to you, bro. There&#8217;s a lot of stuff in between that I&#8217;m jumping over, but, yeah, I&#8217;m here, I&#8217;m here. And I think I&#8217;ve done a lot of great stuff. My name is in places where I only dreamed about, or I&#8217;ve worked on things where when I was a teenager only dreamed about working on or thought it would be cool if I got to work on this or connect with this person and work on this project. And I did it. I&#8217;m still doing it. Sorry for the long rant, yo.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, it&#8217;s all good. Let&#8217;s hop forward to 2011. That&#8217;s when you got out of the Navy. You had been in the Navy for roughly about a decade. And then right afterwards, you enrolled in City Tech, which is a university in New York city. Talk to me about that time.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
It was interesting, man, because I was so hyped to get out and just be a civilian again because&#8230; In fact, most people didn&#8217;t even know that I was in the Navy because I was doing so much my artwork, putting my work out there. By this time, I&#8217;m not really even doing sneakers anymore, I&#8217;m painting, and people know me for my paintings. It was an interesting time. But I knew just from my first time going to college in the late &#8217;90s, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;All right, things are getting&#8230; It&#8217;s digital now.&#8221; I just can&#8217;t see myself going to school to pay to be a fine artist. Nothing against people who do. You know what I&#8217;m saying? But for me, like I said, I had bills. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I still had some kids to support. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;All right, how can I be creative and get paid to be creative?&#8221;I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to do. I knew the process of applying for art colleges just from the past, but I&#8217;m like, damn, I don&#8217;t really have any work that represents what people are looking for in this current state of the world, 2011. And I was like, &#8220;Man, I know I got the skills, but I don&#8217;t necessarily have the work to show it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A good friend of mine, he told me, he was like, &#8220;Yo, why don&#8217;t you go to City Tech?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What&#8217;s City Tech?&#8221; He was like, &#8220;You can get the same education there at a fraction of a price.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;A lot of the teachers that teach there, they teach you the big name schools as well.&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yo, dude, you don&#8217;t even got to do a portfolio, you just go and you show up. Just apply.&#8221;</p>
<p>I went to City Tech, I applied, I got in. And within maybe, I don&#8217;t know, two weeks of me getting out the Navy, it&#8217;s my first day of class. And the first year or so I&#8217;m trying to figure out, all right, what do I want to do? I didn&#8217;t feel like I was being challenged. And then maybe almost around the first year of me being there, I was in a class with this professor named Douglas Davis. Whether he knows it or not, he&#8217;s the person that really inspired me to stay at City Tech because I met him in the first day of his class. I saw he was speaking in a language that I understood. And I just liked the way he just came across in the room. You know what I&#8217;m saying?I&#8217;ll never forget this. This is over 10 years ago, but the first day of class, he comes in, he looks&#8230; He&#8217;s not much older than me so he looks young, he looks like he could possibly be a student at the time. He comes in and he says, &#8220;My name is Douglas Davis.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;What I do, I get money.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You listen to me, you&#8217;ll get money too.&#8221; And he says something, I think he says, &#8220;I&#8217;m surprised. I remember it was yesterday.&#8221; He said, &#8220;My wife, she don&#8217;t got to work. I bring home enough money to support my family doing what I love.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;You listen to me, I&#8217;m going to give you everything that I got. But when I ask for it back, you better give me 100%. I&#8217;m going to run this class like it&#8217;s an agency. If this ain&#8217;t going to be for you, I&#8217;m not going to judge you. I&#8217;ll help you get to where you need to be. But if you here for the ride, let&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, man. I never heard no professor in the classroom talk like that. And I was like, wow. His whole presence. He&#8217;s saying what I want to hear. Yeah, man, and that really put me on the path of going the route of learning about advertising and the stuff that I&#8217;ve been seeing for my whole entire life and just wondering why, wow, I like the way this ad looks, but I can&#8217;t explain why I like it. Being around him and other professors as well, but that really&#8230; I guess I feel like it cemented me in at City Tech where it&#8217;s like, all right, I&#8217;m not going anywhere because I like studying under this guy right here, I like studying under this other professor right here. They&#8217;re talking in the language that I want to, you know what I&#8217;m saying? That I want to hear. And they&#8217;re telling me the things that I need to know to apply to what I do already. Yeah man, that&#8217;s how I ended up at City Tech.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, shout out to Douglas Davidson who we&#8217;ve had on the show twice now. That&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve heard his classroom style, though. But as you described it, I was like, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s 100% him.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yo man, I tell you, he&#8217;s a great guy. No joke, man, when I was in his class, I felt like I was on&#8230; What&#8217;s the one show? Making the Band or something like that, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Because I didn&#8217;t want to mess up, you know what I&#8217;m saying? I didn&#8217;t want to mess up.</p>
<p>The nights leading up to the days when we had to present, he was like, &#8220;Yo, when the door is shut, the door is shut. If you not in, you not in.&#8221; I would make sure I&#8217;m on the train early, that way I&#8217;m not late to class that day and everything. I have everything set up, staying up all night just trying to get it right and just going up there. Because he didn&#8217;t hold any punches or whatever like that, he really ran it, his classroom&#8230; He didn&#8217;t run it like a classroom, he ran it like it was an agency, like it was a business. He&#8217;s a great guy, man. You can tell he really cared about what the people that&#8230; The students that he was working with. And he was there. He&#8217;s a real special person, man, he&#8217;s a real special person. And he&#8217;s someone that I&#8217;m very happy that I was blessed to meet in my journey along the way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Speaking of that journey, you documented a lot of this in a recent project that you released called Just Like Me. You directed it, you put the whole thing together. Douglas was in it as well. Talk to me about the documentary. First of all, why did you decide to do a documentary?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
With the documentary, that came about&#8230; Well, actually it&#8217;s a idea I&#8217;ve had in my head for many, many years but I just never really talked about it. I didn&#8217;t really talk about it to anyone; maybe one person. But it&#8217;s just something that I had in the back of my head. I was like, if the opportunity presents itself, it&#8217;d be cool to make this thing. It&#8217;s just something like a passion project.</p>
<p>And the opportunity came sooner than what I thought it was going to come in life. But around the time&#8230; In 2020, summer 2020, everybody&#8217;s in the house, the pandemic, COVID, all that stuff, and then the incident with George Floyd, all these agencies and companies having, I don&#8217;t know, a coming of age moment. We didn&#8217;t know. You know what I&#8217;m saying? What can we do to support Black people? Or whatever like that, man.</p>
<p>That was a moment in time where someone said to me&#8230; A real good friend of mine, a mentor as well, he said to me, &#8220;This is a moment in time where you need to use this opportunity to make what you want to make and do what you want to do, because I know you can do it.&#8221; And when he said it to me, I&#8217;m just thinking from a point of having anxiety and just fear of what&#8217;s the worst thing that could happen? This could happen, this could happen. And I just brushed it off.</p>
<p>And he came to me, he was like, &#8220;Yo, look man, make what you want to make.&#8221; I&#8217;m paraphrasing right now, but he said to me, &#8220;Your story is a very, very special story. How does someone go from working on nuclear submarines to knowing all the people that you know and working on the stuff that you worked on? You really have an interesting story.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not telling you what you should make or whatever, but you got something.&#8221; And I was like, all right. He was like, &#8220;I&#8217;ll help you get to a certain point with putting the pieces together, but after that, you running the show.&#8221; Because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never directed a documentary. I&#8217;ve been around when documentaries are being made from my time working at Mass Appeal and I saw how much work goes into making a documentary. I know it&#8217;s a lot of work. He was like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, you have what it takes.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I was like, &#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll put some days aside.&#8221; I wrote up three paragraphs, three, four paragraphs. I talk about basically the moment, this particular moment in time about how people were talking about the state of Black people in America with all the whole George Floyd&#8217;s things and the police incidents. It&#8217;s nothing new, it always happens, but the spotlight was on it in that moment in time.</p>
<p>Like I said, plus these companies are talking about, &#8220;Yo, we need to bring in more diversity,&#8221; and all this other things like that. I thought about why is it that there aren&#8217;t many Black people and there aren&#8217;t many brown people in these spaces of creativity?| And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Why is that?&#8221; And I start thinking about my own personal experiences, about how we don&#8217;t really hear about them. And it&#8217;s like, I know a lot of Black creators, but the average person don&#8217;t know who these people are. But they&#8217;ve done a lot of great things and they&#8217;ve contributed to a lot of things that are historic now. And I&#8217;m sure you know, with you doing your podcast, you know we create a lot of great things that everyone knows and a lot of people benefit from, but a lot of times people don&#8217;t know who the wizard was behind the curtain that created this thing.</p>
<p>And I thought about too about why there aren&#8217;t many of us in these spaces. And I thought about a lot of us don&#8217;t know that this path exists until maybe much later in life when people got bills, they got families to support and they give up on being a creative. They give up on it because there&#8217;s always this narrative of being a starving artist. And that&#8217;s not true.</p>
<p>Going back to something Douglas David said to me once, and I always quote it, he says, &#8220;This thing called design is like the Matrix.&#8221; You know what I&#8217;m saying? &#8220;It affects all of us. We all work, operate in the Matrix and everything, but you&#8217;ll never know the Matrix exists until someone points it out to you.&#8221; And that&#8217;s like how design is. Everything is designed, everything, but most people don&#8217;t think about the whole process of that and how it interacts with us. And I thought about, wow, more of us, more Black people knew about this at an early age and were aware that you can make a living off of this, you&#8217;re not going to be a starving artist, I felt like you could see more of us in these spaces. And in order for me to try to educate more people on it, I wanted to show people who were influential to me. There are many people who are influential to me, but I wanted to show a few Black men and women who I&#8217;m blessed to cross paths with them in my journey and what they meant to me.</p>
<p>And not only just show who these people are, show their work because a lot of times I feel like when it comes to designers and things like that, or just anything&#8230; I&#8217;m losing my train of thought. But I feel like we will show a person and we&#8217;ll have the title, but a lot of times you don&#8217;t know the work that they&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p>I think about if I was 16 or 17 years old, I might not know what a creative director is. I might not even understand what a ad agency is, but I know this Nike shoe right here, I know this commercial right here, and now I can connect the dots like, oh man, this is the person to help put this thing together right here. You know what I&#8217;m saying? Show the work. That&#8217;s what I wanted to do with the project. I wanted to show some people who that were like me and the work that they&#8217;ve done and the work that have had impact on so many other people. And I pretty much wanted to make something that I would&#8217;ve loved to have seen when I was younger.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long spiel, but I wrote up a short paragraph explaining that, about how representation is very important, representation is very important. You need to see examples of a roadmap of people that have done things before you that can hopefully inspire you to want to go down that path.</p>
<p>And I also told a story in the pitch about when me and Justice met each other, when mt man Justice hall, when me and him met each other in the early 2000s, why were we surprised that we were both Black? We were surprised because we don&#8217;t see many of us so it&#8217;s a shock whenever we do find it, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
At that time. And I pitched it and I got the green light, you know what I&#8217;m saying? I got the green light. And I reached out to everyone from St. Adams to Douglas Davis to Julian Alexander, Aleesha Smalls Worthington, Dana Gibbons, John Petty III, and Justice, Justice Hall. I reached out to them, and they were all on board.</p>
<p>I connected with my man&#8230; He&#8217;s a creative director, he&#8217;s a director as well, my man, Ben Hype. And me and him came up with the whole creative look and vision, and we put it together. I just knew working on this right here, I knew that I wanted to make something visually appealing, visually, visually dope. The message is dope, but I want the visuals to be engaging as well where when someone&#8217;s watching it, they&#8217;re not going to want to look away because it&#8217;s just a beautiful piece. And I thought about what&#8217;s the series on Netflix? Abstract.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Abstract. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
You know what I&#8217;m saying? Out of what two seasons, they may feature one Black woman or person of color.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They had Ralph Gilles in the first season, and then in the second season they had&#8230; Oh God, they had Ian Spalter, who&#8217;s head of Instagram in Japan, and they had Ruth E. Carter, the costumer. They had her.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Right, right. This is just my opinion. I feel like that just an afterthought, like, &#8220;Oh, we got to check a box,&#8221; or whatever. You know what I&#8217;m saying? And Abstract is a great series, but if you go off of that, you would think Black designers don&#8217;t exist. You know what I&#8217;m saying? Don&#8217;t get me wrong, we&#8217;re rare, but it&#8217;s not as rare as how that series made it seem. You know what I&#8217;m saying? There&#8217;s a lot of us. But that&#8217;s what I wanted to show. Yo, we&#8217;re walking in plain sight every day, and we put a lot of things out into the world that you seen but you probably didn&#8217;t know that, hey, I&#8217;m the person behind this right here because&#8230;</p>
<p>And not even to sound the cliche or stereotypical, but whenever you&#8230; A lot of times when they think of basketball courts or sports, you think of a Black man. You know what I&#8217;m saying? When you think of entertainment or whatever, you think of Black people. But what about all these other roles and titles out there that we&#8217;ve contributed a part of, been a part? And I wanted to show this right here. But not show it in a preachy way or like I&#8217;m giving a lecture, I wanted to do it in a way that&#8217;s conversational.</p>
<p>And I credit my man, Brandon Coleman. He&#8217;s a designer. He&#8217;s another one of the first Black designers I ever met when I met Justice at the time. But he gave me the inspiration to go that route because like I said, I never done this before, I never directed anything before. I know what I wanted to see and I know that I want it to look good, I want it to be visually appealing. But he asked me a question early on. He said, &#8220;How do you want tell your message? Do you want to have a lecture or do you want it to be conversational?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, a lecture?&#8221; He was like, &#8220;No, you want to have a conversation. Put yourself back into the 16, 17 year old version of you, TTK. Did you like when people were preaching to you? Or did you like when when people were having a conversation back and forth?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;re going to do it, but think about that whenever you&#8217;re trying to put this story together.</p>
<p>And that helped me with the whole creative direction. Whenever Ben Hype was filming it, I told him, I was like, &#8220;Yo, I want you to show the people, show their hands, show them moving around, show closeups of them.&#8221; I want you to feel like you&#8217;re in the room with these people. I want you to feel like you know them. And even though if you may not know them or whatever, but you konw their work. But I want the people, when they view this, I want them to feel like it&#8217;s an intimate moment, like you&#8217;re close with these people, like you&#8217;re talking to a cousin or someone who&#8217;s a part of your family or a friend that you&#8217;ve known for years. And I think I was able to accomplish that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, the documentary is really great. And we&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes so people can check it out. We&#8217;ve had Julian on the show too. Julian is episode 250, I believe.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. But no, it&#8217;s a great documentary. I hope everybody will get a chance to check it out. When you had the idea and you put it all together, like what we talked about I think before we started recording about you never know how it&#8217;s going to be received. What has the reception been like since the documentary&#8217;s aired?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been good, it&#8217;s been very, very good. It&#8217;s slow, you know what I&#8217;m saying? It&#8217;s slow or whatever. But so far I haven&#8217;t had anyone say anything, &#8220;I wish you could have done it this way or whatever, this and that.&#8221; The response is always the same, &#8220;This is amazing. I never seen anything quite like this before. And it&#8217;s very real, and I feel inspired.&#8221; I did it. That&#8217;s what I wanted to do.<br>
Like I said, when I initially pitched the idea, I said I wanted to make something that&#8217;s meant to educate and inspire. Whatever comes after that is just a extra benefit. I wanted to make something that lives beyond this particular moment in time where if you watch it a year from now, two years, five years, whatever, it&#8217;s the educational piece. And I want people to be inspired by&#8230; I want to hopefully inspire the next generation of Black creatives out there to show, hey, these are people that are alive right now and they&#8217;re doing it versus I&#8217;m hearing about somebody who did some great things back in 1970. I&#8217;m like, wow, I&#8217;m hearing about it from someone else&#8217;s perspective versus hearing it from the person when they&#8217;re alive right now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going off on a rant right now or whatever, but I think about how Cey adams that&#8217;s featured in a documentary, why isn&#8217;t he taught about in schools? You pay this money to go to school for design and everything, you learn about all these other designers, and they&#8217;re great people and they&#8217;ve done great things, man, I love the work, but Cey is on that level of, in my opinion, the Paula Schers and all those other people out there because he&#8217;s done so much stuff that people know. They know his work but unless you&#8217;re into this thing called design, you probably wouldn&#8217;t even know who Cey is. And I feel like he&#8217;s someone who should&#8217;ve probably been on the Abstract series. This man was around in the &#8217;70s, New York, going from graffiti on trains to his work in the &#8217;80s to the &#8217;90s, to being in, what, the National African American Smithsonian Museum. Come on. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m skipping over 40 years worth of work right here because it is too much to talk about that he&#8217;s accomplished in his lifetime. Why isn&#8217;t he taught about in school? And it goes back to what I was saying, when you think of design, they don&#8217;t think of us. And I was like, &#8220;Yo, I&#8217;m not making this to ask for a seat at the table, I want to make this to just educate us and show us, tell these stories from a real perspective versus someone years later to tell the narrative a certain way.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I want you to hear from the people while they&#8217;re alive, people who are heroes to me, people who, whether they know it or not&#8230;&#8221; I took a little bit from all of them to get to this point right here. I want other people to be inspired as well to accomplish things that I didn&#8217;t accomplish or we didn&#8217;t accomplish, but a lot sooner.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel you 100%. I can liken it to what I do with Revision Path, with having folks on here. I&#8217;ve been able to have people on here at different parts of their career journey. There&#8217;s folks who I&#8217;ve had on maybe in 2014 that now I can bring back seven or eight years later and be like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s talk about how things have changed,&#8221; or something. You know?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I totally get that. Actually, I have a funny story. Well, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s funny, but I have a story about Abstract. This was in 2019 I think was when the second season was about to come out. And I had watched the first season. Well, I&#8217;m not going to lie, I watched Ralph Gilles&#8217; episode on Abstract for the first season and that&#8217;s it because I was like, I don&#8217;t want to hear about everybody else. I was like, I&#8217;m going to watch his.</p>
<p>And the place I was working at the startup at the time, and we were looking for design firms for a project that we were going to do, this lifestyle vertical. And so one of the agencies we reached out to was Godfrey Dadich, which is in San Francisco. The Abstract series came from Godfrey being Scott Dadich, who was the former co-founder of Wired. And I didn&#8217;t talk to him directly, but I talked to someone at the agency because I was like,&#8221; Yeah, my name is Maurice Cherry,&#8221; blah blah, blah, yada, yada, yada. And they were like, &#8220;Oh, we know who you are.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Oh, okay.&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t coming to them in a personal capacity, it was a professional capacity. And not even for the show, it was for my employer at the time.</p>
<p>They were talking to me about the second season of Abstract. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh yeah, the second season of Abstract is coming out.&#8221; And they were like, &#8220;I bet you&#8217;re really going to be excited about this because we got two Black designers for this season.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Why would I be excited about that?&#8221; Yay, you found two, but I&#8217;ve found hundreds. I mean, I don&#8217;t know if they were saying it to be solidarity or something. I don&#8217;t know, I just thought that was weird that they brought it up in that way. We ended up not going with them, not for that reason. But I was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll check it out when it airs on Netflix.&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, we managed to find two great Black designers. I&#8217;m like-</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
We managed to find.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, we managed to find, which is funny that they said that, because I was like, one, I&#8217;ve known Ian. Actually, I did an event here in 2017 back when he was&#8230; Well, he still works for Meta and everything with Instagram. But I met him at a live event here in Atlanta for Revision Path. And then Ruth, I don&#8217;t know Ruth, but I&#8217;ve had Ruth&#8217;s goddaughter on the show, Courtney Pinter. She lives in Switzerland. I think at the time she was doing flavor design for this company called Givaudan. Now she works for Fifa. But I&#8217;ve also had Hannah Beachler to give the Black Panther connection. I had her on the show for episode 300.</p>
<p>Your overarching point around the importance of being able to have people give their own history in their own words is super important because when I started Revision Path, and this was almost 10 years ago, that&#8217;s not to say that these stories weren&#8217;t out there, but they were really hard to find. And one of the few places that I found them was at AIGA when I started volunteering there with the diversity and inclusion task force. Because they would do these design journeys things and they would talk about folks. But even the way that they&#8230; The imagery and everything almost memorialized them. And keep in mind, these people are not dead, but they memorialize them in this way like they&#8217;ve gone on to greater things. And I&#8217;m like, these folks are still alive. What are you talking about?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
And they&#8217;re active, too. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, and active. Michelle Washington&#8217;s one of the first people that I had met through that. Her and I are working on the book together. Maurice Woods, who&#8217;s been on the show before, Maurice Woods of the Interact Project. I think he&#8217;s episode 12 or 13. Emery Douglas from the famous former Minister of Culture from the Black Panther Party, AIGA medalist, he&#8217;s been on the show. That was episode 15. But I didn&#8217;t find out about those folks until I volunteered and did that. And the way that even they just put it out there made it seem like these are not living people still doing work, it was almost like in memoriam. Nah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s like when we was putting the pieces together for Lust Like Me, Douglas Davis, he connected me with Cheryl D. Miller. I don&#8217;t know if you know her.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah, oh man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
She&#8217;s episode 248.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I felt like I was sitting with royalty talking to her. You know what I&#8217;m saying? Me and Davis had some questions to ask her. Man, once she started talking, man, the questions just went out the window. She was just dropping so many jewels and so much history and stuff, man. And it&#8217;s like, wow, how come I didn&#8217;t know this woman&#8217;s story? I&#8217;m happy that I spoke to her while she&#8217;s alive saying, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Hear it straight from&#8230; It&#8217;s from the source.</p>
<p>And she said something. Well, I don&#8217;t know if you remember, but at the very end of the documentary, Just Like Me, there&#8217;s a quote from her at the very, very end before the credits. When we were talking, she said something, &#8220;It&#8217;s sad that your generation has to experience the same thing I experienced 50 something years ago around the time when Dr. King died.&#8221; She was like, &#8220;Yo, all these companies had an awakening moment for about a year or two, maybe less than that.&#8221; And she was like, &#8220;And this is what&#8217;s happening right now because of George Floyd. These companies are having an awakening moment, but it&#8217;s going to fizzle out,&#8221; unfortunately, man.</p>
<p>When you say we can have all the different programs, DEI, all this, whatever, if you want to change it, change it. And she said something too. She was like, &#8220;Yo, if they try to tell you that we didn&#8217;t exist, that&#8217;s a lie.&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;I&#8217;m fortunate that I got all of this stuff because I was alive and I archived it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like a magician, she pulls out a issue of Communication Arts from 1970. And I ordered it because of her. She was like, &#8220;This is one of the first&#8230;&#8221; This is what from 50 years ago, she just pulls this magazine out. She was like, &#8220;This right here on page whatever, 90 something or whatever, you see the Black designers right here? This is 1970 right here, so if they try to tell you that the only person that was out doing things is Milton Glazer and all those guys like that,&#8221; she was like, &#8220;nah, he was just the only person that was getting the work. That&#8217;s why you knew about him. But these other people were out here as well. And here, this is their work right here on.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;I got it in the archives right here, so nobody can ever try to pull the wool over my eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>And when I got that issue, I was able to back order it online, and I saw Ms. Dorothy Hayes, she was a Black designer as well. And I used to see she was a professor at City Tech. And I never knew that this woman was one of the first Black designers ever published. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I had no clue. I never had any of her classes, but I would just see her in passing. And I&#8217;m like, wow, there&#8217;s so much history that we have. And that&#8217;s why I feel like we got to tell our stories before&#8230; Tell them in real time and tell them authentic and speak to the people who needs to hear it because you already know how it goes, man, years later, the narrative, it gets switched up and it gets watered down. That&#8217;s not how it really was. Yeah, man, salute to you for what you do, man. I&#8217;m honored to be a part of this right here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Thank you. And yeah, Cheryl is 100% right about that. When I ran across Cheryl, this was in 20&#8230; Now you got me here telling stories. This was 2014, and I had just started doing volunteer stuff with Revision&#8230; Not Revision Path, with AIGA, started doing volunteer stuff. And that&#8217;s when I learned about her thesis that she did in 1985 when she was at Pratt about Black designers and their viability in the industry and how that became this 1987 print article, and then there was this AIGA symposium.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m doing all this research trying to find&#8230; Well, one, doing the research on what happened from that thesis, but then secondly, I wanted to put it into this presentation that I was putting together that I was going to present called Where Are the Black Designers? And I was like, is Cheryl still alive? And I remember asking folks at AIG, and they were like, &#8220;Well, we don&#8217;t know what happened to her.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Let me find her.&#8221;And I found her. How did I find Cheryl? Oh, I know, I found her on Amazon. Wow. She had written a book about her mother. It wasn&#8217;t even about design, it was about her mother and the relationship she had with her mother and everything growing up. I just found her book, eventually did some more searching, found a website, reached out on a whim and was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m Maurice Cherry. I&#8217;m doing this research. I&#8217;m putting this stuff together. I&#8217;d love to talk to you about this kind of stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I first encountered Cheryl, like I said back in 2014, she had put design behind her. She had had her design work and stuff. She had, I wouldn&#8217;t say retired, but she raised a family, became a theologian. She was living a totally different life. And then since then, of course, doing the presentation and then more people finding out about her work, now she&#8217;s Dr. Cheryl Miller and has given lectures across the country and doing all amazing stuff and is still here doing this stuff.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
That&#8217;s beautiful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s beautiful, it&#8217;s beautiful. And so with Provision Path, I&#8217;m certainly fortunate to be able to share that story and to bring more awareness to people in general about what Black folks are doing in design everywhere. I just had this year my first Black designer in South America, which is something I wanted to have for a long time. I was like, I&#8217;m going to hit every continent. Couldn&#8217;t hit Antarctica, but I done talked to a Black designer on every continent so far start with 2022 this year with someone in South America. Yeah, I just want to keep going and keep telling more stories and getting more folks on here to tell their stories so folks know that we did exist.</p>
<p>To that end about the whole black squares thing, in 2020, that summer, I was looking up a bunch of old Ebony and Jet magazines and stuff. I think Google has the full archive, the full digital archive of Ebony Magazine, and so I was looking at issues from when Dr. King was assassinated. And when I tell you it was the exact same thing about companies posting black squares, exact same thing people were doing back then when King died, sometimes even the same verbiage. I&#8217;m like, this is wild, this is wild.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s one thing Ms. Miller was saying, she was like, &#8220;Just change it. You want to make change? Do it.&#8221; These people that have positions to do it, they don&#8217;t want to do it. This right here is a moment in time. Like she said, I&#8217;ve seen it before. I&#8217;m not even thrilled by it. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not thrilled by it at all. Just from her telling me&#8230; Hearing stories that I&#8217;ve never heard before. One day, thankfully, you&#8217;re doing what you&#8217;re doing so people will have,&#8230; We&#8217;re able to control our own narrative more so now. It was great, but at the same time, it&#8217;s bittersweet as well, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right, right.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Because wow, man, I&#8217;m experiencing the same thing my elders experienced. How come I don&#8217;t know about Cheryl Miller, the woman who created the original BET logo? You know what I&#8217;m saying? Something that&#8217;s a part of my childhood. Why more people don&#8217;t know about who this woman is right here?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m honored that I was able to speak with her and basically just sit and listen to her talk, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Just sit and listen to her talk. And to have a quote from her in the documentary, I was like, man, that was a great book end on it. It was a real book end to the project. Like I said, when you watch it, in the very beginning it says how it started, and at the end it says how it&#8217;s going. And you see her quote at the end, someone who&#8217;s been around that predates all of us. She predates even Cey, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Who has 40 something years of work. She predates him. To have someone like a OG basically, a vet, to have her to be a part of the project, man, I&#8217;m thankful. I&#8217;m thankful for everybody that was a part of helping me put this project together, Just Like Me. Man, I&#8217;m thankful for everybody, man. But yeah, Cheryl Miller&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want the next chapter of your legacy to be?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I want to be known as a painter more. I want to be known as that. I want to do gallery shows, more of them. Because in the past where I was just doing art shows myself, and I was just happy if I was able to fill the room with friends and stuff like that and create a memory. I want to sell my work on a high level. I want to work with more brands, but I want to be working with brands because they want to work with me, not because I need a job. I want to bring my personal creativity and my expertise to the table. &#8220;Yo, we want to collab with you. We love your story.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I want another opportunity to make a project, another project like Just Like Me but bigger. I know when you watch the documentary, it looks like it was&#8230; Yeah, it&#8217;s put together very, very well, but oh man, we were building the car while we were driving it, making this thing right here. We were really making something out of nothing, but it looks like it&#8217;s on a high level so I would really like to have a chance to make something maybe&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the same type of topic or something completely different. I wouldn&#8217;t mind directing another project.</p>
<p>All in all, I just want to continue to be creative, continue to make a living, and live comfortable using my imagination, man. I don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s going to go in the next five years, but I&#8217;m speaking into existence right now what I want. And truthfully, I feel like I can&#8217;t even fathom what&#8217;s going to be for me because it&#8217;s going to be something that I&#8217;m not even expecting. You know what I&#8217;m saying? Just this documentary, just like&#8230;</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t mention it, but working on a project for Nas, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Well, I worked on a few project for Nas but having my name and the credits next to Nas and Kanye, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Wow, you can&#8217;t erase my name from this project. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I&#8217;ve worked on this right here. You know what I&#8217;m saying? If you would&#8217;ve told me at the time 15 years ago that, &#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re going to work on this project. You&#8217;re going to be the person who designs and put this thing together,&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;How is that going to happen?&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t&#8230; I&#8217;d imagine it, but I was like, wow, it seemed like a fairytale. But the have, I did it, and it&#8217;s a thing of the past now, I&#8217;m onto something new, wow, that&#8217;s great.</p>
<p>And if you would&#8217;ve told me three years ago that I would direct a documentary, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;How would I do that?&#8221; And that&#8217;s going back to what I was initially saying, five years from now, I just want to be doing something great and making a living and just putting the best stuff out into the world, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Multiple ways. You can check out my site artbyttk.com. That&#8217;s A-R-T-B-Y-T-T-K.com. You can check my IG as well. It&#8217;s instagram.com/gottkgo. You can pretty much find me anywhere online with that, Go TTK Go.</p>
<p>And if you want to watch the documentary, Just Like Me, it&#8217;s on my site as well, man, but it&#8217;s also you can go to the actual micro site. The site is justlikeme-havas, that&#8217;s H-A-V-A-S, .com. jsutlikeme-havas.com. And you can read a little bit about the project, a short description of it and the creation of it. And you can watch the documentary. The documentary&#8217;s only&#8230; It&#8217;s just in the 30 minutes, but it&#8217;s strong. It&#8217;s a very powerful piece that I&#8217;m really proud of. I always say that project is my magnum opus project at the moment. Yeah, that&#8217;s where you can find me at.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
TTK, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show, one, for sharing your story, which again, I hope people will check out the documentary so they can get a chance to see it for themselves, but also just your whole story about perseverance and pursuing your creative passion. I think that&#8217;s something that hopefully a lot of people can get inspired by. And I&#8217;m excited to see what you do next. If this documentary is any indication, I&#8217;m pretty sure what&#8217;s coming up next is going to be great. Thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
No, brother, thank you for having me on here. Thank you. Also want to thank my partner, Chevon, because she was very vigilant about trying to get me on your show. Thank you to Chevon as well, man. And she&#8217;s @chevonmedia on IG and on Twitter. Yeah, thank you to Chevon. I&#8217;m honored to be a part of this. And maybe, I don&#8217;t know, five years from now, maybe you&#8217;ll reach out to me to revisit what&#8217;s going on in my life for whatever project I got going on, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There you go. All right.</p>

<p>Summer is here, and we&#8217;re closing out the month with a conversation with designer and design educator Sabrina Hall. As a senior product design manager at Justworks, Sabrina oversees a creative team dedicated to helping improve the payroll, benefits, and other human resources tasks for a number of businesses.</p>
<p>We started off with Sabrina sharing starting at a new company during a pandemic, as well as some of the intricacies of her role (such as the overlap with strategy). She also talked about growing up in New York City, attending SVA, and her shift from editorial and print design into product. We also discussed teaching, as well as the importance of writing as a designer, and spoke on how she views success at this stage in her career. Thank you Sabrina for helping to usher in the next generation of designers!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Hi, I am Sabrina Hall. I&#8217;m a senior product design manager at Justworks here in New York City.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. How has 2021 been for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
2021 has been a year of challenges and gratefulness. It&#8217;s truly been a year with so many new opportunities, but also just one filled with collective and community grief and finding a balance between that and self care for the past year. So, it&#8217;s been complicated.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What lessons did you learn this past year? How would you say you&#8217;ve grown and improved over the last year or so?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Yeah. Over the last year, a few of the lessons that have really stayed with me is community care and how it&#8217;s so important during a time like this in the pandemic, particularly I was able to really actively advocate and be a part of mutual aid funds and understanding how to give directly to the community and support that. Some of the lessons for me were also identifying where I needed to set boundaries for my own self care, with the idea of putting my oxygen mask on first and being able to then care for others, really continuing to be grateful for my space and for safety and for help, and really seeing how the pandemic impacted so many marginalized communities.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Then also, really just making space for deeper understanding and deeper compassion for folks&#8217;s experiences, as there&#8217;s just been so much collective grief, and so many folks that I know have really gone through a lot of loss in the past year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s so interesting how, with this past year being as honestly as traumatic as it&#8217;s, how much of a rush there is now to almost forget the last year. Not memorialize it or remember it in a way that sort of holds all the loss that we&#8217;ve held, that we&#8217;ve experienced in a sacred place, but just to &#8220;get back to normal.&#8221; I&#8217;m not comfortable with how quickly the push is to make that happen without recognizing what we&#8217;ve been through.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
I really think the concept of getting back to normal is for me, one that I don&#8217;t identify with, because normal was already, in some ways, quite challenging and possibly problematic with just some of the systems, not possibly, but problematic with some of the systems we had in place already, particularly around healthcare, particularly around flexibility from work and working remotely. I don&#8217;t want to go back to a normal. I would like to look forward on creating new futures in new ideas of what a normal even means, and whether that&#8217;s more flexibility, whether that&#8217;s continuing to think inclusively about how we work together and the experiences there for myself.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
I was able to get together with folks who normally I might not have been able to, because it was only in-person activities. I was able to grow a community in a way that I would not have been able to if we were in a normal time and would love to continue doing that work. I think that well, for some folks, they may find comfort in normal. Their normal really just doesn&#8217;t acknowledge or make the space for addressing a lot of the issues of why we were in this space with our work schedules, with health, and I think going back to normal is not really the way I want to go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Normal, I think, as we&#8217;ve all seen and experienced through this time, is highly subjective. One person&#8217;s normal is another person&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know, paradise in some ways, because we&#8217;ve all had to deal with some level of loss or just a curtailing of our regular activities through all of this.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Yes, absolutely. Yes, exactly. That is quite subjective, and really understanding, how do we look to a new normal versus a past normal?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, one of the things you kind of talk about creating new futures, you kind of created your own new future. You started a new job during all of this. How has that been?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been such an exciting time. I got a new job in the midst of the pandemic, so last year I started in August. It was quite a different process, starting remotely, getting to know the team remotely, as there not a remote based company, and understanding, how do I set boundaries as well with working at home? How do I get comfortable and have a space where I can really be productive on a day-to-day basis? Then just building partnerships and relationships remotely, which takes a different type of effort versus running into someone in sort of the, in the kitchen or different communal workspaces, where now it&#8217;s like, okay, intentionally setting up that 20 minute Zoom call to introduce myself to folks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting with the way companies are still, I think, adjusting to it. You mentioned, like with Justworks, it sort of not being a remote-first company. Is it changing now that I guess we&#8217;re sort of starting to emerge from the pandemic, even in just a small way?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Yes. There&#8217;ve been several changes. I would say that around the onboarding and hiring process, we come on as a cohort. So, everyone starts on one day to really make it a streamlined process, thinking about how we share documentation and artifacts and really distributing that in a way that&#8217;s easier and more accessible remotely. Then, also going into the future, how can we be flexible? I believe that currently, they&#8217;re looking at a way to keep partial work from home while still having folks back in the office as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, that&#8217;s nice. That&#8217;s good to hear. What is a typical day like for you?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Yes, a typical day ranges throughout the week. My day on a Monday, like today, is really focused on kicking off our weekly sprint with various groups. I focus on, and I&#8217;m the design, senior design manager for the benefits cluster, which is a large group that focuses on the benefits part of our product and then the growth part as well. My day begins with weekly&#8217;s and kicking off with our sprints meeting with my design team and having those one-on-ones to really identify the unblocked hours for the week and how to best set them up for success. Right now, we&#8217;re in the middle of fiscal year and planning, and attending that with some of my partners, senior product managers, group product managers, working with engineering managers.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
My day is a combination of relationship building, mostly meetings around our next product steps, and then also connecting with the design team through feedback workshops and with my fellow managers and our director as well, looking at our goals for the design team as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me a little bit more about your team. You mentioned designers. Do you have other types of people that are working under you, like researchers or strategists or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. Currently, we have a larger design team. I have three direct reports, one senior designer and two product designers. Currently, their skill sets are really expanding and we focus on, not only the user research, which they lead, but also the visual design and the UI work involved with that as well. So, our designers are very closely working on research, also working on the user experience and partnering with engineers along the way, too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the best part about what you do now?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
The best part about what I do now is partnering with the designers to continue unlocking and advocating for them to reach their highest potential. That is so important because it&#8217;s something that impacts everything, the business, the future of a product, their career growth, their ability to focus as designers, and it really is something that I enjoy and I learn so much from every week.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember back when I was leading teams at &#8230; This was another place I used to work at. I mean, I just remember, first of all, there was always meetings. There were so many meetings, whether there were one-on-ones or leadership meetings, or this, that, and the other, and it never felt like I really got to work on stuff. It was more like I was working, I mean, I don&#8217;t want to say stuff, but I wasn&#8217;t working on the product. It felt like I was just more working with people. It was very much a people management kind of thing. Do you still sort of have the opportunity to work hands-on with the product in any way?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Yeah, there are opportunities to. While I enjoy it, I definitely rely on the experts of our product design team. I believe that the way I work with the product now just differs from the angle of the approach. While I may not be necessarily working very closely on a user flow, I am thinking about it strategically and how best to set our product up for success, thinking of approaches to research, trying to identify inter-department connections that we have, interdependencies. So, it&#8217;s definitely still working on the product, but yes, a little differently than before.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Gotcha. So, you&#8217;re sort of making sure that the team is in the right place to do the actual hands-on work on the product, but you&#8217;re shepherding the team. You&#8217;re, like you said, removing barriers and making sure that they can do the best work that they can do without any sort of obstructions or interruptions.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Gotcha. Now, before this, you were an art director at Scholastic. How is this role at Justworks different from that one?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
My role at Scholastic was quite similar. At Scholastic, the structure of titles was very different there as a company that was focused in the print space and then expanded to digital. So, there are many overlapping part, whether it was managing our team, focusing on the lead of a product, really doing a lot more hands-on work. That was definitely one of the big differences with regards to day-to-day being in the design process. Some of the other differences have been really getting more time and space to be focused on the strategy while not having to also do the IC work.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
But so much of it was also really focused on, what are the two sides of an experience? So, at Scholastic, it was really thinking about the students using the product and the teachers using the product while the school is making the purchase of the product, and similar to some of the work I do now, we think about the admins who are working with Justworks and the employees who use the product as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, just to kind of switch gears here a little bit, I saw when I was looking at your website, you mentioned that you were born and raised in New York City.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me about kind of your early intro to design.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. I was born and raised in the Bronx. My intro to design started in high school. I went to the Bronx High School of Science. I really enjoyed writing. I was convinced I was going to go to Fordham and study journalism. That was one of the first things I wanted to focus on, but I loved art, I&#8217;ve always loved art. Probably just, yeah, as far as I can remember, when I was applying to go to junior high school, I went to Eastside Middle School, I had to take off my shoe and draw it as part of an entry for that school, so I&#8217;ve always loved art. Yeah, I was like, this has got to get me in, and it was such a good experience.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Then, at Bronx Science, I recall enrolling in AP art, and the teacher at the time, Ms. Ash, I remember enjoying it so much. I was doing collage work and I was just enjoying every part of AP art. And she was like, &#8220;This is something you can do as a career.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;What do you mean? I don&#8217;t understand this at all.&#8221; At the time I remember also loving things like Write On, Word Up magazine, and that was the space that I was just really in. And she was like, &#8220;All these magazines that you enjoy, there is a graphic designer doing this and it is something that you can have a career from.&#8221; I was completely shook. I was like, &#8220;What do you mean? How do I do this?&#8221; That shifted everything.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
I made portfolios, I gathered work. I was really fortunate to have parents who supported me at the time. They were not aware of graphic design as a career, and regardless, they were like, okay, if you believe you can do this, we&#8217;re supporting you, and applied to several schools and ended up going to the School of Visual Arts in New York.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s interesting that it&#8217;s magazines that were kind of an entry point. That was like that for me as well. I grew up in the deep south. Getting Vibe Magazine and YSP, I&#8217;m dating myself now, but YSB and Emerge and seeing all of this, and one, these positive representations of blackness, but then two, to know that there were black people behind it that were designing it, was really something that brought me more into the space. Although it was much later, I don&#8217;t want to say much later in my career, but certainly it wasn&#8217;t something I went to school for. Now, you did go to school for design. You went to SVA. What was your time like there?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
My time there was an overall positive experience. I was exposed to just so many different things in the art industry, understanding the challenges within being in that space, understanding being one of few in that space, but I learned so much. I graduated with a bachelor&#8217;s in fine arts with a focus in graphic design, and really understood that this was something that I enjoyed doing and could really thrive at and would be able to &#8230; At the time, really was thinking about how I can put my own mark on design and using it. So, that was one of the biggest learning experiences from it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, SVA, of course, is a well-known school. We&#8217;ve had several SVA alum here on the show. If you could sort of just, I don&#8217;t know, give an endorsement for the school in a way, in what ways did SVA sort of really prepare you for a career as a designer?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
I would say that SVA prepared me for some of the challenges in design around it being a very homogenous industry, but also realistically, it exposed me in the same hand to folks in the industry who had certain networks were able to really identify what the industry is looking for and really empowered me to begin, just the beginning stages of understanding how I could use this as a career. I think, even throughout the process, it was very clear that this was something that I could do as a job, was really important to me with then graduating from any college.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, at first, your design career dealt with a lot of print work. When did you sort of make this transition more into digital design?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Yeah. I joke sometimes, possibly aging myself here, that I feel like I&#8217;m one of the last folks who graduated with a print portfolio that sort of like flew in [inaudible 00:20:50] one of these larger pieces. What I find for myself, as I started to enter the industry, was I loved editorial, gravitated towards that space. Was doing a lot of print work and branding and corporate, but found that things were changing, and things were changing rapidly. From being in a print space, I&#8217;ve always been someone who loves learning and I&#8217;m excited by change. I realized, okay, print is changing, particularly within the editorial space.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Things started moving towards e-publications and understanding how to design for that, and I think at the time, in-design had an add on, I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s called now, that was made specifically for EPUB, and I went in and tried to learn that as much as I could and experimented there. From there, I then also started to teach myself to code, because I felt like so much was moving in that direction with regards to creating blog. There was a specific time where everything was about blogs and wanting to understand that and engage in that space.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
I would say that probably came maybe around 2010, was when that shift started to happen, so I had always begun to like dabble in that space, but then really focused in earnest when I was at the end parts of focusing on editorial and then moving into digital spaces. So, I started building websites in WordPress, started doing my own little front-end work here and there, and then really learning to expand upon that and moving into a focused lens with product design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, with all of this sort of change in focus, I&#8217;m trying to remember, I know back then on the web, certainly there was this big shift from more, almost print-based design, I guess that&#8217;s the sort of the best way I can put it, because we were designing with tables, and then there was the shift from tables to CSS. Then even with CSS, there were shifts into pre-processors, into Flexbox, and all that stuff that sort of came later on. It felt like that change really shifted a lot more people into design. I just remember how hard it was to design around tables back in the day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Largely, it was just based off a print. I mean, even some of the terms that we use for some of the tags are from print terms, like break lines and anchors and things like that. So, it&#8217;s really interesting how those shifts sort of precipitate kind of changes in the industry. Now, sort of in this time, right around then you also started your own design studio kind of alongside your full-time work. What inspired you to sort of branch out in that way?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Yes. I was in a space where I really wanted to continue learning and do a wider breadth of work. I felt like, while I was focused on editorial, I really wanted to try new things, and I started moonlighting with a few folks after hours and on the weekends, working on projects from like, okay, I&#8217;ll build out your WordPress site with a full branding to logo design, to your setting up an app. How can I just help you with the first stage of low fidelity? What I&#8217;ve found during that time was that slowly, it went from my own moonlighting schedule to then word of mouth, that I then realized, I could do this full time.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
It was quite a process. I learned so much in making and working for myself with regards to everything from taxes, hiring folks, partnering, distributing work, and then really understanding how to pitch the work that I do, the value of what I could bring to individuals and companies, and understanding that I was really enjoying the process of solving a business problem together with a small business, or one person who was like, I&#8217;m starting my own website for a book I&#8217;m coming out with, how can you help? That was what really drew me to doing that for so long.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love how with studios, you really get to have that flexibility, not just on like, who you may decide to take on, but also just the kind of work that you do, and even the level of specificity that you want to take on with the project. It&#8217;s funny that you call it moonlighting. I haven&#8217;t heard someone say that in so long, but I get what you mean, just in terms of doing stuff. Now, what? Side projects is the new moonlighting, I guess?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
I think so. Yeah. [crosstalk 00:25:24].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I get what you mean. You&#8217;re kind of working on other stuff during off hours that you probably should be relaxing or whatever, but it&#8217;s such a good way when you have your studio to do that, because you can really dabble in different things, and you can decide sort of the direction you want to go into. You can really be a specialist at stuff if you want to, as opposed to maybe being more of a generalist with things. Studio stuff is great, but yeah, the part about getting really the nuts and bolts stuff down with taxes and accounting and all of that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I tell entrepreneurs all the time or designers that want to be entrepreneurs like, get an accountant. That&#8217;s the first thing you should do is try to get somebody that&#8217;s going to handle the money so you can focus more on the creative stuff, because that other stuff just bogs you down.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Yes. I did not get an accountant for quite a long time. It was definitely lessons learned there and so many other things, even with regards to setting up proposals, understanding how to reply to RFPs, the competition in the market, and then just also understanding the industry where there were years that while I was working on various projects, that I made significant gains and significant losses as well and just really understanding that holistically for running a business and what it meant in my own work-life balance as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, like a few other people that we&#8217;ve had here on the show before, you&#8217;re also a teacher at City Tech, you&#8217;re an adjunct professor there. What made you decide to start teaching?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Yes, so I&#8217;m going to give a very explicit shout out to Douglas. I had always had an interest in teaching. It is connected for me through, for several years, I was a mentor in the AIGA mentoring program, and for several years after that, co-chaired it with one of my closest friends Anjali Menon. Throughout that time, I had always enjoyed partnering with folks who were interested in design community, equity, and really enjoy that space. I had been invited by Douglas to join for a panel event. In having those conversations, he was like, &#8220;There&#8217;s an opportunity here at City Tech. I really think this would be something that would be fantastic.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
I was like, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; I had only done a couple of lectures at that point in time and hadn&#8217;t been fully situated. I was very nervous. How can I teach? In reflecting and saying on this now, I know that it was possibly ingrained, because my mom&#8217;s a teacher, my husband&#8217;s a teacher, so I&#8217;m surrounded by teachers. True to form, I was like, okay, sink or swim. This is the opportunity. Douglas had mentioned it, then a few months later, he was like, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the role?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Well, Douglas, I don&#8217;t know about the hours.&#8221; &#8220;Here&#8217;s the perfect hours.&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know about the day.&#8221; &#8220;Here&#8217;s the perfect day.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Everything lined up, and I was like, &#8220;All right, let&#8217;s do it.&#8221; It has been such a humbling experience, a wonderful experience, and an opportunity to really, I think, disrupt the design industry from a perspective I hadn&#8217;t always considered.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do your students teach you?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
My students teach me how compassion is important. My students remind me that kindness is important and that you can learn with this as a structure. My students teach me that the industry is very subjective in so many ways and very challenging and continues to be challenging for folks to enter into. My students teach me that sometimes, and many times I don&#8217;t know the answer, and my role is to help them figure it out and for myself to learn alongside with them. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you find that with, I guess the pandemic and how that may have distanced you from it, has that changed the way that you teach?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
The pandemic really impacted the way I taught, I believe for the better. One of the things that I felt very strongly about in supporting my students throughout the pandemic is removing the requirement for cameras. City Tech has always been really great about that, but in various educational circles, I&#8217;ve been reading and seeing how some professors are making it mandatory and really just understanding what true engagement means, and that doesn&#8217;t mean someone having a camera on in Zoom. Another thing it has really identified is clarity around teaching, specifically with increased documentation, increased expectations, and then also identifying the boundaries of that as well, particularly with being home and understanding, do I need to be engaged on this email right now after having taught for three hours or can it wait till tomorrow? And resetting the time I need to reset as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say that you&#8217;re obsessed with lately?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Oh, this is such a delightful question. Okay, I&#8217;m currently obsessed with the natural sciences. I have been in this really particular space. I had just finished rereading Emergent Strategy, and just am so intrigued by how the natural sciences and plants and birds and the biomimicry of things and how we can learn from that. I particularly I&#8217;m really into how certain trees grow together and support one another, and how that could be paralleled into team structures. I&#8217;m also really into birds right now. I&#8217;m just enjoying seeing documentaries about birds and how they build things, and just again, learning from the natural sciences is my like head space currently.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We had a designer, oh God, when was he on the show? We had a designer on the show last year. I think it was right around April or May, or so, but it&#8217;s episode 340 with Billy Almon. Billy is &#8230; He called himself a biology inspired storyteller and designer. I mean, a lot of the work that he does is around the natural sciences, like a lot of his design work and such. I first met Billy at Harvard. This was at the Black and Design Conference in 2019. He was on one of the panels there, and he was really talking about how, like you mentioned biomimicry, and that&#8217;s what sort of stuck out to me, is that he really sort of does a lot of what you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He looks at how the natural sciences work in other ways and other applications, and he gave this really great example about ants and how the way that ants build their anthills and stuff, how that social structure can go forth in societies. It was super fascinating, episode 340, if anyone&#8217;s listening and want to check it out with Billy Almon, but it was a really, really great interview. It just sort of got me to thinking about that when you said natural sciences and biomimicry.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
I just made a note of it, and I too will be listening to 340, so I will be following up and anyone else who cares to listen, happy to have that Twitter conversation in regards.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Because the theme, so to go back to, I guess that conference, the whole theme was around creating more equitable futures. Now that I think about it, it&#8217;s the last conference I went to in person prior to the whole pandemic, but the conversations there were around, how can designers use all sorts of things to create more equitable futures? With Billy, it was about like using nature for design and for technology to make equitable futures, like looking at nature and seeing how nature heals and fixes itself and structures itself and think, how can we take that and just apply it to design or apply it to tech, or apply it to social issues or things of that nature. It&#8217;s really, really interesting stuff.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
I am so intrigued. This sounds like really in alignment with what I&#8217;m interested in right now, and I definitely cannot wait to check this out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now. I love that you have, in your bio, that you are a writer. What does writing do for you as a designer? What does that sort of tap into?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Yes. Ooh, writing for me as a designer taps into so many different things. For me, it&#8217;s accountability in a way that I hadn&#8217;t expected, and where I find I&#8217;m able to share information and hold myself accountable for some of the processes that I&#8217;m thinking through for documenting and finding ways to explain myself and continue to practice that as a skillset overall. Also, writing has been really helpful for me with regards to understanding how to build connections and relationships. What I mean by that is something like introducing yourself to a client, writing a proposal, understanding the perspective to take there.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Additionally, writing has been a space also where I&#8217;ve learned so much about my own process with regards to how write out the stories for my portfolio to reflecting on growing as a designer who is introverted and what that meant for social media and understanding that I can write these things down, look at them, reflect, learn from them, and sometimes I almost think of writing as just another version of design in terms of like getting all of the information put into a space that I can then use for reference or share, or just document for my own journey.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Writing as another version of design. I like that. I like that. I was explaining to someone recently about, they had asked me when was the last time that I had designed something, because I mean, people know that I do this show, and then like for my actual day job, I also do some work dabbling in audio, even though I&#8217;m a creative strategist, and they just sort of asked me like, when&#8217;s the last time you designed something? I got what they meant. They meant, when was the last time you sort of, I guess, sat down in Illustrator or Photoshop and visually designed something. But I told them that a lot of what I do now, these days is more along sort of designing processes and designing systems, and I do a fair amount of writing as well. I don&#8217;t know how many designers would consider writing as an element of design, but it totally is. It absolutely is.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Yeah. Even now, this show has designed the organization of how this is put together, the outcome, the way that work has been set up in terms of the research that&#8217;s done. I think of design is now moving out of a space of just like being just that artifact of a product or something in Photoshop or Figma, but more how we can also just apply it to various things with regards to that problem-solving lens and experimenting lens as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you think we can encourage more designers, specifically more black designers or designers of color? How can we encourage them to write more?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
What I have found that encourages me to write as a black designer is the importance and impact of my voice to everything else that is also out there. What I mean by that is, as an industry, there are always articles that tend to be very popular and are written from specifically, which tends to be the case, the majority, a cis white hetero male perspective, and that is one perspective. I have found that in many situations, I&#8217;m unable to find that material fully helpful because of the inability to just relate. By adding my own voice. It really gives a different perspective. I hold myself accountable to that perspective to say, here is my approach to it, and here are the things that I would consider.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
I encourage other folk to share their voice in a way that they feel best identify with their goals and the outcomes that they are looking towards, and really just saying design has many folks and many perspectives and many faces.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I usually also try to, I mean, when I&#8217;m talking to designers and trying to impart the importance of writing, I try to show it to them in a historical sense. Like, say you go into a bookstore, like a Barnes &#038; Noble or something, and you go to the design section, I guess there&#8217;s &#8230; I haven&#8217;t been in a bookstore in like a year or so because of the pandemic, so I don&#8217;t really remember, but I&#8217;m sure there is a arts and design section. I sound like an old person, but I&#8217;m sure that section exists, and you go there and you&#8217;re looking for books, and you&#8217;ll probably notice that most of the books there are not by or from people of color. The importance I see to writing is to put your own words out there to be a part of the historical design corporates.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That may not necessarily be a book. It could be an article, a series of articles. It could be, and even I&#8217;m saying writing in terms of the physical act, but it could be a podcast, it could be videos, it could be Instagram live videos, whatever, but finding another outlet to sort of transmute your thoughts from your head into a medium that other people can enjoy it. I think writing certainly is one way to do that and I think a big way to really spread your words out there more so people can know what it is that you think and what you feel, and the thoughts behind the work that you do, or even just the thoughts about this industry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I see so many people writing up a storm about stuff on Twitter. I am a very sporadic Twitter user. I really kind of only use it as a highlight reel, and I try to save all the stuff that I really want to sort of get out there. Either I make it into a presentation. I&#8217;ll talk about it in the show or I&#8217;ll write about it. I feel like that way, my words can sort of live longer, because tweets are such an ephemeral thing. No matter how many prolific tweet threads you might have, is that really going to like be around in a week or a month or a year or five years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Thinking about it in the historical sense of that, your words carry weight, your words are your thoughts in this other form, and it&#8217;s a way that it can sort of live on past whatever experiences you might have or anything of that nature. It can be just sort of a historical reference in many ways.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. I even found that, I forgot, probably a few years ago, I was just looking to write about black designers and found such limited material on the surface level. There was definitely material, but on the surface level of like a half-hour Google search. There was not much. What the impact of that was, was like, okay, so this is not something that is easily accessible, how can it become more accessible and part of the entire canon or design history as well? So, I absolutely hear you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Who are some of the design mentors or anyone that have really helped you out along your way.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
I have been really fortunate to have some great folks along the way. When I was doing a lot of consultancy work, there was a creative director named John Herr, who really, at the time, continued to create space for me to just grow and advocated for me to lead on different projects. When I was much younger and working in an agency space, there was a professor of mine who was then also our creative director, Terry Koppel, who influenced and impacted my career trajectory. Then a lot of the non-design folk, and what I mean by that are community members with regards to folks who work within the community of design, and that can be folks in research, folks really in creating community spaces, and then a lot of my peers, I would say, have been mentors, probably not actively.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if they would give themselves those titles, but a lot of my peers have pushed the way I&#8217;ve thought have provided so much advice, insights, clarity, and just space for me to ask questions as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Going back to the writing again, if you had to write a book, what would you write about?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
I have been thinking about writing a book and maybe piecing together the concept of writing a book. A couple of topics that come to mind are that connection between the natural sciences and design organizations. I&#8217;m also very interested in sharing about the experiences, my own experiences within the design industry when there is, I feel the time and space to put that together. I&#8217;m also really interested in writing about design education as well and the design of that industry in terms of the funnel of that and how we think about entry points of design and think about design education overall.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Can you, I don&#8217;t know, dive into that a little more about design education? Because you are a design educator yourself, like what would you want to sort of explore there?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Yeah. I believe that a lot of our design education in New York and my own experience that I&#8217;ve had, I can&#8217;t speak to other experiences, but to my own experience, has been very Eurocentric. And there has been so much erasure of the work of other folks who are not Eurocentric, without the Eurocentric lens. What that means is that a lot of work and a lot of the things that I experienced coming into the industry was, I used to really be someone who focused on Swiss design, and that was the aesthetic I went towards. And learning later on that, was that really nature or nurture, from the perspective of like, that was all I was told, yet when I brought about a different design style, that was much more colorful and focused on patterns. It was like that wasn&#8217;t graphic design at the time, that wasn&#8217;t qualified by my teachers in some cases as being like a strong enough graphic design.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
I realized part of that education is because we&#8217;re so limited with regards to only learning about certain names and only learning about certain folks as like the most important folks within this design, and that just continues to perpetuate those norms into the industry, into how we consider what &#8220;good versus bad&#8221; work is. I put those in quotes because that, it&#8217;s just a simple binary of good versus bad, but it&#8217;s not &#8230; The nuances and the gray area. Then also really understanding how that impacts all the way up to who gets hired, who gets access to design education, why is it that design school is so expensive and that the cost for entry is so high? What happens to folks who don&#8217;t have the access, but have every interest in skillset? And just yeah, wanting to dig into that a little deeper.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, that sounds fascinating. I would love to read a book about that. Certainly, it&#8217;s an interesting reflection on sort of where we&#8217;re seeing, at least what I&#8217;m seeing from black design educators, how now they&#8217;re really starting to bring in other sources to, I want to use the word decolonize, only because that&#8217;s the word that sort of has been attached to these conversations, but they&#8217;re really, I think diversifying their sources of just like, where other students can learn about design and it&#8217;s not just from, like you said, the Bauhaus or Swiss style, or German style, and a lot of these are like events, there are conferences, there&#8217;s so much stuff now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Honestly, even from, before when I started this podcast, there were so many more events and opportunities and ways to learn about the history of black people in design now than there were 10 years ago. It&#8217;s amazing. I really want to see where it goes from here.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Yeah. I think it&#8217;s an exciting time. I believe that it&#8217;s really beginning to open up just so many different perspectives with regards to also who teaches design, also, to your point, how we learn about design. So, from your podcast to events where all the black designers, to various slack groups that have come up, to just how there are these micro communities, even through social media as well, where folks are asking one another questions, having conversations about the industry and their employer. And really, I believe also, there is the business side of it. We&#8217;re hand in hand with all of the civic unrest and the specificity of the murder of George Floyd. How that, how all of a sudden, everyone&#8217;s like, oh, we&#8217;re being held accountable as companies, and everyone&#8217;s looking at your board of directors and looking at your staff, at least I am.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
I can&#8217;t speak for everyone, but starting to look at that even closer than I was previously and understanding and seeing, okay, how are these companies defining for or working around it? Because it&#8217;s also aligning with what a lot of folks are asking for, too, for themselves in the industry, I think.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I know when, unfortunately, when his murder occurred last year, and how that one really drove people out into the streets to protest, but it was amazing how so many people were calling on companies, because companies were doing this thing, where they&#8217;re like posting the black squares and saying they stand for racial justice, and everyone else was like, uh-uh, but what about in your industry? Or like, what about this industry? You had so many people that were starting to turn it around and say, well, if you&#8217;re really committed, then why does the industry look like this?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Why does the industry function in this way? What are the real steps that you&#8217;re taking besides just posting a black square? I have been telling folks this year, I was like, Juneteenth is going to be crazy this year, which is on a Saturday. I know last year there were a lot of companies that were saying, yes, we&#8217;re going to make this a day off and we&#8217;re going to start to observe it. I guess maybe they&#8217;ll observe it on Friday now, so three-day weekend in June, I guess. I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m assuming that&#8217;s going to pick up.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
I guess we&#8217;ll see. I think that, for myself, these are some questions I had been asking before, but probably just more so in private. I think that with these conversations happening, there&#8217;s much more room for conversations publicly, not always, but just a little bit more and really understanding and also learning what&#8217;s best for folks. There&#8217;s pros and cons for so many aspects to it, but what are the ways in which it can help folks?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. When you look at where you&#8217;re at now, is this how you imagined yourself when you were a kid?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Oh, no, I don&#8217;t think so. I feel like I would not have imagined this per se. Likely, I thought of myself in some way of doing something creative, but I would not have imagined the ability to, or just the immediate, yeah, the immediate ability to lead a team, to work through teams, to run my own business. I don&#8217;t think I would&#8217;ve necessarily imagined this, but probably felt like I could try different things. I think I&#8217;ve always just had that curiosity, but yeah, I don&#8217;t think I would have imagined this to this, and I wouldn&#8217;t, yeah, I wouldn&#8217;t change it anyway.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
At this point, like where you&#8217;re at in your career with teaching, with what you&#8217;re doing at Justworks, with your writing and everything, how do you now define success?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
I would define success as a few things. The ability to make decisions that I feel much more confident about. I would define success as the impact of continuing to advocate for others and continuing to make space for community work. I would define success as the recognition and understanding of my time and value, and not settling as well. I define success as being able to set boundaries and be able to say no to things as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. It&#8217;s a very layered definition of success.</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in five years, like it&#8217;s 2026, what kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
I would like to be working on projects that care, just continues to care about people in the future, whether that&#8217;s through AR, VR, sound design and interactions there. I think in five years, the mediums and tools that we use will continue to change and being able to be a strategic partner for those things. I could see myself going back to running my own business as it&#8217;s something that I do enjoy and/or continuing to just partnering in the education space as well, and always being able to make a bridge to continue to increase access.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Sabrina Hall:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. You can find me at sabrinahalldesigns.com, or on Twitter @SabrinaHallNYC.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Sabrina Hall, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. One, for just sharing your story and talking about the work that you&#8217;re doing, but also really impressing upon, I think, not just me, but also to the audience, the importance of writing, the importance of really also just like checking in with yourself. Like you said, being able to set those boundaries and using that work to, of course, make yourself better and to make your community better. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
