Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>If you&#8217;ve been listening to the podcast over the past year or two, you know that the use of AI has been a constant thread through nearly every episode. And this week&#8217;s guest, Andr√© Foster, has embraced this new tech as part of his creative practice while still producing top notch motion design and animation work through his studio, <a href="https://firstfight.tv/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">First Fight</a>.</p>
<p>Andr√© gave a rundown on some of the client work and the day-to-day happenings at First Fight, and discussed the importance of perseverance and continuous improvement through difficult social and economic times. The conversation then dives into the use of AI in the creative industry, and from there Andr√© talk about his upbringing in Detroit, the city&#8217;s creative community, and Bond ‚Äî James Bond.</p>
<p>For Andr√©, resilience, adaptability, and personal growth have been the keys to his success!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>My name is Andre Foster. I&#8217;m the co-founder and owner of First Fight, a creative studio and production house based in Detroit, Michigan that helps brands hit above their weight with style and motion. And what that really means is that we use our own unique style of animation, design and live action to bring our clients message to life. For broadcast or for digital, Disney+, Instagram, Fox Sports, StockX, and Dave &#038; Buster&#8217;s are just some of the brands that we&#8217;ve worked with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Impressive. Really impressive.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>How has this year been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>This year has been rough and not just for us, but I think just for a lot of studios as well. I think the economy hasn&#8217;t been that great, so it&#8217;s really caused a lot of our clients to kind of tighten their spending. Layoffs, strikes&#8230;[it&#8217;s] just a lot of uncertainty in the industry. I think that&#8217;s been a part of this whole thing that&#8217;s just part of being a business owner is just going through the highs and lows of it. But I think what&#8217;s been good about it is that it&#8217;s really made us refocus on our brand. Just kind of hone in on the actual service of what we provide. I think we really came to the realization that the creative is just one part of it. It&#8217;s really just how you can network and how you can execute what you do and how you present that to your clients and even to potential clients.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>How would you say &#8212; I mean, aside from just kind of the change like you said in clients and budgets and stuff &#8212; how would you say that you personally have grown over the past year?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it really put me in a space where I had to really just keep going. I think this whole year just showed me that you have to just be strong and just be able to adapt and then just really just keep doing what you&#8217;ve been doing. And then just as I said before, just kind of refocus and make sure that you can just try to just be as good as the service that you&#8217;re trying to provide. I guess that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to say. So it&#8217;s really just, again, just making sure that you hone in on what it is that you do, what you&#8217;re good at and how you&#8217;re different. And then like I said, just keep sending the emails out and just keep promoting yourself and just keep trying to put yourself out there as much as you can and just really just trust in the process while you do that. And then while you do do that, you just make sure that you just concentrate on the craft and just figure out ways how to be better.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, as you said that, it sort of reminded me of that saying people have when they say, &#8220;if you&#8217;re going through hell, keep going.&#8221; Like&#8230;just sort of find a way to persevere. And I mean, you and I &#8212; we talked about this a little bit before we started recording &#8212; but it&#8217;s been tough for, I think, a lot of creatives this year just in terms of budgets and clients and finding work. And it&#8217;s definitely a trying time right now in the creative industry overall. But it sounds like you&#8217;re weathering it pretty well.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m not going to lie, it&#8217;s been extremely rough. But as you said, we&#8217;ve been weathering it and we&#8217;ve just been trying to find work where we can and just again, like I said, just make sure that we trust in the process and just make sure that we keep continue to network and just be able to try to continue to put our brand out there as much as we can.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s help with that. Let&#8217;s talk about First Fight, which you co founded back in 2016 and you just mentioned earlier. Tell me more about it. Tell me more about some of the services and things that you offer.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>We primarily do animation and then we do live action as well. With that, we do a lot of design. We do a lot of illustration work too. Along with that, we also do a lot of strategy when it comes to the digital campaigns that we create the content for. So that&#8217;s really kind of a newer service that we&#8217;ve added onto our team. But really it&#8217;s just really just trying to emphasize the uniqueness of what we do and how we do it. Style, emotion is the thing that we always say that we have that we can owner our clients. But yeah, animation and live action and just make sure that we&#8217;re trying to get our clients message across in a unique way that stands out.</p>
<p>And for me it&#8217;s fun because it&#8217;s always interesting how we can try to do something a little bit different than what&#8217;s been done before. Our clients pretty much are kind of like in the same industry, but it could kind of range. We deal mostly in the entertainment industry, but lately we&#8217;ve been doing a lot of stuff for the self-driving industry, the autonomous, autonomous industry. So it&#8217;s kind of just switching it up and just seeing what&#8217;s out there and how we could try to bring our voice to their message.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I was going to ask you about clients. I mean, you mentioned some earlier that you&#8217;re working with. Of course, you know, being in Detroit, big automotive center here in the U.S. &#8212; Chevy, Ford, Cadillac &#8212; but then you also mentioned Disney+. Dave &#038; Buster&#8217;s is a client of yours, know, just to name a few. What are the best types of clients that you prefer to work with?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>I think the best type of clients are the clients that can trust our expertise and just really just let us go. I mean, that&#8217;s not to say that we don&#8217;t like to collaborate because we definitely like to do that. But having clients that can really trust in what you&#8217;re able to bring to them and just let us go, I think that&#8217;s probably the best type of clients that we like to work with. And then also it helps too that they can pay you like how you should be paid. That&#8217;s a definite know. That&#8217;s something that we look for because we are in a business and we just want to make sure that the value of what we do, we get compensated for. So the Disney Pluses and the Dave &#038; Buster&#8217;s, you know, those type of clients, we really don&#8217;t have issue with that. So it really just allows us to be able to come up with some great work for them and just go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I know you said entertainment was kind of one field that you&#8217;re working in, and then of course, the automotive industry. Are those kind of the two main industries that you prefer to work with?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, pretty much. I mean, we&#8217;ve kind of just fell into that, I think, because we are based in Detroit. So the automotive industry is kind of like right in our backyard. But what&#8217;s interesting is that some of the stuff that we have done when it comes to automotive industry has been kind of cool because it&#8217;s kind of allowed us to be a little bit more creative in terms of showing the car. And actually there&#8217;s been some situations where we haven&#8217;t really shown the car at all. It&#8217;s just been like a lot of lifestyle imagery and stuff like that. So it&#8217;s kind of helped us in terms of just being a little bit more creative and just showing the car itself and just making it a little bit more interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What does your day-to-day work look like at First Fight?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>A lot of emails, sending emails out and just checking behind the status of some projects that we have in-house and then making sure that our animators and that our team, they know what it is that they need to do and just checking behind them. I probably shouldn&#8217;t say checking behind them, just making sure that what they&#8217;re working on is it fits what the project is and what the message is for that project. Just making sure that they understand the assignment, and do it in the brand voice of what First Fight is about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What would you say kind of really sets First Fight apart from other studios?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Well, one, I mean, we&#8217;re one of the few Black-owned agencies &#8212; probably shouldn&#8217;t say agencies &#8212; or creative studios in the industry. So I think that by itself is definitely what they necessarily apart. But I think it&#8217;s really just the foundation of design and illustration. I think that&#8217;s one thing that kind of distinguishes us from other studios because we have such a strong foundation of that. I think that we tap into that with some of most of the work that we do, even though we do a lot of different stuff. We do editing and we do some visual effects, and then, like I said, we do live action. But even with those, there&#8217;s some fundamental things that we put in that that we take from what we learn with design and illustration, whether it&#8217;s compositing or composing a picture and making sure that there&#8217;s enough contrast to get the visual interest of what it is that we&#8217;re trying to show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s say when new work comes in, because you&#8217;re offering all these different services and you said strategy is even, like, something kind of new that you&#8217;re offering. When a new project kind of comes in the door, what does that process look like in terms of getting started and everything?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>We get a request, whether it&#8217;s through email or we may just get a phone call, and the client will come in with a brief and then we read over the brief and then we kind of get a sense of what the vision is that the client is kind of going for. So I think it&#8217;s really the initial brief. And then from that, we just kind of figure out. Like, well, okay, whether or not it&#8217;s going to be 30 seconds long, is it 60 seconds? And then we kind of figure out what is the budget for it, and then we kind of craft a plan from that and then really just kind of get a better understanding of what exactly is the message that the client is trying to say with it within the constraints of the budget that they have. Because sometimes the budget is just not there. Sometimes, like I said, we just try to make sure that we try to do what we can within the budget and make sure that we still are able to give the client what they need to get the message across.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;d imagine with maybe some of the bigger clients, maybe that&#8217;s an easier process. Is that true?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, they kind of just let you go. And the great thing about the bigger clients is that the budget is not really an issue. So it kind of allows us to be able to go for what we know and just have fun with it and then just really just have fun with it and challenge ourselves, because I think we always are trying to do that anyway in terms of how we execute these things for our clients, whether it&#8217;s through animation, video production, and even with the strategy. We&#8217;re always trying to figure out&#8230;what is the different angle that we can take? How can we make this project different than what&#8217;s been done before? And that&#8217;s something that we always try to do. I mean, that&#8217;s kind of the fight that we always go through. And really, sometimes the fight is within ourselves because we&#8217;re trying to fight against what we&#8217;ve seen before. How can we make it different than what was? Because it&#8217;s so hard to come up with something that&#8217;s original nowadays because it&#8217;s so much stuff out there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m glad you said that, because that actually is a good lead into what I wanted to ask about with regards to AI and some of this emerging tech in the creative industry. I think across writing, design, animation, illustration, et cetera, we&#8217;ve started to see a lot more adoption of AI tools, both good and bad. I mean, the tools are often trained on other people&#8217;s work without their consent, so that&#8217;s a bad thing. But then some people are using them or trying to use them, I think, in effective ways. I know back when Disney+ had launched &#8212; not launched, they premiered &#8212; the season of&#8230; </p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Secret Invasion. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Secret invasion. Thank you.</p>
<p>And the whole intro was done with AI. And there was sort of this kind of big negative backlash against it and everything. I&#8217;m curious, are you using AI in any of your work, or do you have any just kind of thoughts around AI and any of these emerging technologies in the field?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. We do use AI. And I think what I&#8217;ve seen is that I think a lot of people are using it the wrong way, because when we started using AI, we kind of took it as a high leve, well, kind of a Pinterest. Like a high level of what a Pinterest would do for you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, like a mood board or something.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. But the only big difference is that you can really customize it to what it is that you&#8217;re trying to do in terms of getting an idea, or even just trying to figure out a different color palette. Because what&#8217;s cool about using AI, because&#8230;I use Midjourney, and what&#8217;s cool about Midjourney is it can give you an idea that you never even really thought about, or, like I said, even a color palette that you didn&#8217;t even think about. We&#8217;re kind of using it in that regard. I don&#8217;t think you should use or present AI as a final image. I think if you don&#8217;t go back in it, if you don&#8217;t try to alter it in some way and then kind of make it ownable to yourself and to what you do, I think that&#8217;s where the problem kind of comes in. But, yeah, I mean, we just use it as kind of like a really high level Pinterest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I would tell people that ways that I&#8217;ve used it before is kind of almost like a decent intern to come up with ideas to bounce things off of. But I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily take what one of these tools like &#8212; say, ChatGPT for example &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily use what they have flat out as my own, and certainly I wouldn&#8217;t pass it off as my own. But it can be inspiration for something else. It could say, &#8220;okay, well, I didn&#8217;t think about this&#8221;, or &#8220;maybe I can reword this in a different way now that I&#8217;ve got a spark of an idea that this AI has generated.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Exactly. Yeah. And I&#8217;m the same way with ChatGPT, because I&#8217;ve used it in the past and I&#8217;ll have it write something, and then I usually have to go back in and just make it sound like myself. But for the most part, it does most of the heavy lifting, and it&#8217;s just really not meant for you to just have it come straight out the box or present it as yourself without even putting yourself in it somehow, some way. I think with Midjourney, there&#8217;s a reason why it&#8217;s called Midjourney. It&#8217;s really just meant to get you halfway there. That&#8217;s the way I took it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I thought you were going to say, because the output is mid, but I get that, too. I like your explanation better.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And I really thought that was the whole point of it. I mean, maybe the developers probably had a different idea of what the name meant. I like to think that that&#8217;s what they wanted it to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s not meant to replace the artist. It&#8217;s just there to get them to a certain point and then have them finish it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, how do you think clients would feel about that? Do you think they&#8217;d think, &#8220;oh, well, if you&#8217;re using AI, I could do that myself&#8221;?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, some clients may think that. I think any edge that you can have in this industry, you should try to take advantage of it. Because in an industry where things are constantly being due the next day and the budgets are getting a little bit shorter, you have to try to find ways to be able to be efficient and to be able to still play in this game. So I think any advantage that you can get, you should try to use it. I really don&#8217;t think that they really care because I think the whole controversy has been just more about what the artists themselves in the industry, I think with the clients themselves, I don&#8217;t think they really care. I think as long as you&#8217;re able to get their message across, make it look good, and it does what it needs to do for them, I think that&#8217;s all what they really care about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I think so, too. I mean, it&#8217;s so interesting. Like, back when I had my studio and I had clients, it would be so interesting to talk with other designers and they go so much into their process, and they use this in Photoshop or they use Sketch or they&#8217;re using Illustrator and all that stuff, and the client doesn&#8217;t care about that. The client just cares about their end result. They really don&#8217;t want to know the nuts and bolts. I mean, some clients do, but as a whole, they&#8217;re not really concerned with how the sausage is made. They just want the sausage.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Exactly. Yeah. I think it&#8217;s kind of a bougie kind of attitude, like some artists take. I kind of get it. Well, when I say that toward using it, and I kind of get it. And I think there is a lot of training that goes into what we do, because I have an illustration major. That&#8217;s what I went to school for, so I understand the fundamentals and the foundations of it. I know it takes a lot of time to be able to get good at that and to understand it.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s interesting is that with AI, what I see nowadays, I feel like everything kind of looks the same. And I can always tell when somebody who doesn&#8217;t have any traditional training, they&#8217;ll just put stuff out just because they think it looks cool. But I can see all the different things that&#8217;s wrong with it, right, because they haven&#8217;t developed that type of taste when it comes to design. Like, you can type in anything into Midjourney and have it spit out something, but if you don&#8217;t know how to filter it out and figure out, like, well, this image doesn&#8217;t look good, or whatever, that kind of goes back to how you&#8217;ve been trained traditionally. But if you&#8217;re just putting stuff out left and right, you&#8217;re kind of giving yourself away, like you really don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing. Just typing in prompts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, it&#8217;s another tool to use as the designer. You have the discernment, you have the eye, you have the experience to be able to kind of know what to look for, and know how to craft it in the right way. I do see&#8230;a lot of the AI art does have the very similar just sort of style to it. Like, you can look at something and just tell, like, &#8220;yep, that&#8217;s AI&#8221;.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s a dead giveaway. It kind of reminds me of when&#8230;and I&#8217;m actually old enough to remember when people used to use airbrush. I remember when airbrush first started coming out and the look of airbrush was so different than, like, a traditional brush painting, and it had kind of that slickness and that real smoothness and stuff like that. And I think there was a lot of people who at least back then, thought that, well, it looks too perfect, it looks too generic, or it looks too whatever. And even back then, people were, like, just getting on airbrush artists like, &#8220;well, why don&#8217;t you just learn how to paint?&#8221; But it&#8217;s funny because I kind of see it happening now with AI, because it kind of has that same thing happening. It feels the same, and it doesn&#8217;t have any soul to it. That&#8217;s why I say I think anything that you use or have come out of Midjourney, you should be able to try to put yourself into it because that&#8217;s where the personality comes in.</p>
<p>Like I said, just make it honorable and make it your own and just enhance on it. Because, again, I can&#8217;t say this enough. It&#8217;s really only meant to get you halfway there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Like I&#8217;ve used ChatGPT. I haven&#8217;t used Midjourney or DALL-E for any of the other sort of image generation ones I have done. Like, I think this might have started a little bit last year when people were getting all of those AI profile pictures made. And it was so funny, the conversation around that at the time, because folks were like&#8230;one, they were astounded that they had to pay for it. They were like, &#8220;what do you mean I have to pay? Like, it&#8217;s $8. You paid $8?&#8221; And, I mean, not even a lot of money.</p>
<p>Like, $8 is not a lot of money. But people were, one, astounded that they had to pay, and then two, the way that they talked about the quality was just sort of weird. Like, some of them, of course, the art looks like the person. Some of them it doesn&#8217;t, because you&#8217;re not working with an artist, you&#8217;re working with an algorithm. So what you get out of it is what you put into it in that aspect. But, yeah, it&#8217;s now hit the mainstream in a way. I haven&#8217;t used any of the larger tools, like I said, DALL-E or Midjourney, but I think I want to try to get started with them just to see what it&#8217;s like.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s fun, don&#8217;t get me wrong, because I think what I have seen is a lot of people who use Midjourney who I think maybe got sidetracked with life, and maybe they weren&#8217;t the best drawer or maybe they weren&#8217;t the best designer. And I think that program allowed them to just really tap back into that creative side. And I can see the excitement behind that, and I really do, because it&#8217;s just ignites that part of them that just kind of went away because they didn&#8217;t think that they were good enough. I think you need to be responsible with it, too, and just understand that it is a tool. It&#8217;s not really meant to replace anybody.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Right, absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So let&#8217;s kind of change it up a little bit here. You mentioned being in Detroit, so I&#8217;d love to just kind of know more about you personally. Are you from Detroit originally?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, born and raised in Detroit. On the west side. West side of Detroit. I got all of my education here in Detroit. It&#8217;s funny because when I go to different places like New York and Chicago, people used to or even on the West Coast, I would tell people I was from Detroit, and they would always kind of give me this &#8220;oh, wow, you from Detroit?&#8221; Like&#8230;and this is pretty much why you still have kind of this negative connotation about Detroit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>So it&#8217;s apparent to me, like, they haven&#8217;t been here, like, how it is now, as opposed to what it was back, like, maybe 20 years ago for something like that, or maybe even ten years ago. Because it&#8217;s different from ten years now. But I&#8217;m proud to be from Detroit. I think I embrace everything that it is to be a Detroiter. I love the swag that we have, the kind of blue collar, hardworking feeling that I think everybody who is from Detroit, they carry with them. So every time when I go out, I just try to represent Detroit the best way that I can.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, growing up in Detroit, were you always kind of interested in design and animation and that kind of stuff?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yes. I owe a lot to my mom because she really was the one that got me involved into&#8230;I think it was Saturday afternoon drawing classes. She saw me drawing a lot, and I was a big comic book collector, too. So what I would do, I would actually trace the panels of the artists that were drawing in these comic books. So she really saw that I love to draw, and then I had just a real passion for it, but she was the one that really just kept on it and kept me going and got me involved in a lot of different after school classes, you know, as I said, Saturday classes, it just kind of kept going. She was also the one that really boosted me up. She was the one that kidn of, and I like to say that, she ordained me to be great. And I think every parent should do that with their kid. You&#8217;re like, you know, &#8220;you are going to be great one day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sometimes when you say that to your kids, they look at you like, &#8220;yeah, whatever.&#8221; They just kind of blow it off. But whether they know it or not, I think subconsciously, when you have somebody that keeps telling you that, it does stick with you; it just really does make you kind of carry yourself in a different way. And it makes you a little bit more&#8230;a little bit more passionate about what it is that you do, because you kind of have this expectation put on you. So I think that what my mom did is she really put that expectation on me. She used to drive people crazy, like, just random strangers. I remember one time she had a guy come by the house to fix, like, the furnace or something like that, and he came in, did this thing, and I remember he was getting ready to leave, and so she said, &#8220;oh, wait a minute, wait, I want to introduce you to my son.&#8221; And so he&#8217;s just looking there, standing there, waiting to get his check.</p>
<p>He said, &#8220;this is my son.&#8221; And then she held her hands out like, &#8220;this is my son, the artist.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>And the guy was&#8230;I remember the guy was like, &#8220;okay, great. Yeah. All right, can I go now?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>No, I love that. I love that mom was bigging you up. That&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Back then, like I said, you really don&#8217;t pay attention to it or almost even kind of annoyed by it. But I&#8217;m really appreciative of her for doing that because even still to this day, I carry that kind of confidence in my ability and just that expectation. Like, I want to be better than what I was yesterday. I want the studio to be better than it was last year or even last month. I carry that with me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, you talked about, you know, also being educated in Detroit. You went to the College for Creative Studies where you studied fine and studio arts. What was your time like there?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>My time there was interesting. I was so focused and so determined to be as good as I could while I was going there. What was interesting, too, is that I was working part-time when I was going there. So I actually went to art school for like nine years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. So it was a long time, and back then, CCS wasn&#8217;t as diverse as what it is now, so it was majority white, and I was really the only Black guy in these classes. It was interesting, but I was focused, but I was also very competitive. I remember thinking that every time I would go into these classrooms with these other students and this is going to sound really bad to say this, but I wanted to destroy everybody in that classroom. I&#8217;m pretty competitive, but when it comes to the craft in a good way, competitive in a good way. But I didn&#8217;t really want to destroy them. I just wanted to show what I can do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, from the numerous people I&#8217;ve had on the show have told me that art school is super competitive. So that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Especially only a Black guy, too. A little bit extra on top of that. It was an interesting time. I think it went by fast even though it was nine years. But I learned a lot. I was able to foster some good relationships from my time there. Actually, one of my mentors, that&#8217;s how I met her, because she was teaching her Laura Parloff. I want to give her some love. But yeah, she was a big influence to me while I was going there. Still to this day, she&#8217;s a big influence. So I was able to pick up a lot of good key relationships from my time there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And I mean, you were also there during a time when I feel like the industry was starting to embrace technology and computers as part of the craft. I feel like that probably definitely was a big part of your time there, right?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. It&#8217;s funny because when I came up, I was right there at that transition where people started using Wacom tablets. And I remember for a long time I didn&#8217;t want to use a Wacom tablet. I didn&#8217;t really want to use a mouse to draw on a computer because, believe it or not, people used to use a mouse to draw on a computer. I would just scan in my drawings and then just take it into Photoshop and try to manipulate them. That way. Before then, I would do storyboards markers. I&#8217;ll be surprised if I know what markers are, but I used to draw with them and know, do it the old fashioned way.</p>
<p>So when I was coming out, when I first started going to CCS, that&#8217;s when that whole big transition started happening. So I was able to have kind of the best of both worlds, that traditional kind of upbringing, and then really just seeing the new beginnings of the new technology happening. So I feel pretty lucky. It&#8217;s funny because I feel like it&#8217;s happening again. It&#8217;s always constantly happening.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, yeah, absolutely. I&#8217;ve talked about this on the show before, how this time right now, when people are getting into using AI tools and the metaverse and all that sort of stuff, reminds me so much of just like, the early Web and people trying to figure out, well, should I even have my business online? And how do I design a web page? And all this sort of stuff. Like, it&#8217;s parallels to it as the technology innovates, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And I remember when I started at Skidmore, when I graduated from CCS, I was the one who was teaching some of the older artists how to draw in painter and photoshop and stuff like that, because they were kind of like from the old guard. They would paint with traditional brushes and use traditional paint to make these beautiful paintings. I think when I first started there, that&#8217;s when they knew that, oh, wow, I got to learn this shit too. I got to learn something new. I spent all these years trying to get as good as I am. Now I got to try to switch gears up a little bit. But, yeah, I feel very fortunate that I did come up the way that I did because, like I said, I was able to kind of experience the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>And I think it allowed me to be open or even just know that nothing stays the same. You can&#8217;t get comfortable. You have to just keep learning. Learning. It&#8217;s just an ongoing thing, right? And you don&#8217;t ever want to be dated and you don&#8217;t want to be me. Just not relevant.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, I think that&#8217;s something now, again, to bring it back to talking about the AI tools and stuff, I&#8217;m starting to get my feet wet using some of it, just because I know that anybody can, I think, look at the news and see how much technology has been implementing all these AI features. So clearly the industry is moving forward with it at a pretty fast rate. So I&#8217;m like, &#8220;well, I need to get on it. I need to see what it&#8217;s like.&#8221; For me, I&#8217;ve started out with just doing ChatGPT and just trying to get really good at using it and prompts and stuff like that. But I want to get into DALL-E and Midjourney and just sort of see what I can come up with. I know that there are some other folks I&#8217;ve seen on LinkedIn that have been posting a lot of their experiments with it and it looks amazing. It looks amazing.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Again, it sparks that creative juice within you. And I think what probably was happening, like some of the tools kind of prevented the creative to keep going. And what I mean by that is, let&#8217;s say, for instance, because I&#8217;m a Maya guy &#8212; so I work in Autodesk Maya, which is like a 3D program &#8212; which anybody who ever uses Maya knows that it is a deep, hard program to get into. The biggest thing that I had to learn is that working, especially in 3D, is that it&#8217;s different in a traditional sense because you have to wait to see the result. There&#8217;s like steps to it in a lot of different ways. It kind of deters the creative because you do have to wait. And I think the creative happens. It really lights fires when you&#8217;re able to just keep going and just keep going at it.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t really have to think about it too much. Yeah, I think that&#8217;s what AI does. It just kind of helps speed the process up and it makes your imagination go wild. You don&#8217;t have to wait on stuff like you used to do or still do in some cases. So I do understand the allure of AI, and AI is not going away. So people should just realize that and accept it. And I don&#8217;t think you definitely don&#8217;t want to be the person who is going to be left behind with that because I think you should understand it enough to where you can use it. You don&#8217;t have to get deep into it.</p>
<p>But again, like I said, you don&#8217;t want to be left behind because it&#8217;s not going away. You just won&#8217;t be able to understand the technology and how to use it for what it is that you do. This already is a big part of our lives and AI really hasn&#8217;t just shown up on the scene. I mean, it&#8217;s been around since the 50s. That&#8217;s what a lot of people don&#8217;t understand. Yeah, there&#8217;s nothing really new. It&#8217;s just a little bit more prominent with some of these newer softwares that they&#8217;ve come out with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, artificial intelligence is a broad field and if you just think about all the different ways it&#8217;s been implemented, I mean, you could say spell check in a way is kind of a form of AI. Or Photoshop, like content-aware fill or anything like that. So as the technology has gotten more advanced, we&#8217;ve just been able to innovate and continue to iterate upon it. So it&#8217;s been here for a long time, I think certainly a lot of people have been using it for research purposes and things like that. But now that it&#8217;s really gotten into the mainstream, people think that it just happened overnight. And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;no, this has been here for a long time.&#8221; Facetune, all that sort of stuff has been here for a long time, which is all parts of AI. It all falls under that umbrella.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s the part that they kind of leave out or they really don&#8217;t say enough. And just going back to Midjourney. When Midjourney first came out, I remember I started messing with it and I started typing in some stuff. And some of the stuff that I would get back blew my mind because it&#8217;s stuff that I would have never thought about doing. Or even if I went on Pinterest to try to search for a certain image, it would never have given me what I was getting out of Midjourney. It actually sparked something in me. Like, there was one time I was getting pretty good at Midjourney, and I started understanding the language and prompts and stuff like that. And the images that it gave me actually sparked an idea for a series, I guess you would call it, like an FX series, like a really kind of hardcore streaming program.</p>
<p>Some images that I got back, it put me in the mind of Frankenstein. I was like, it&#8217;d be cool to have a show based off the story of Frankenstein, but told in a modern way, like set in the 70s, because some of the images that I got back kind of felt like that. So it sparked an idea; it sparked that whole thing. And actually the outcome of that is actually on our website, it&#8217;s called Suture. So if your listeners go to that, they&#8217;ll be able to see some of the images that I got out of Midjourney that sparked the whole idea. And I did like a whole intro for this imaginary show based off the Frankenstein story. Well, it was pretty wild, though.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll make sure that we put a link to that in the show notes so folks can go and check that out.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it was pretty cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, after you graduated from college for Creative Studies from CCS, you kind of went straight to work. You began working at Skidmore Studio, and you were there for 16 years, which is amazing to think about just in terms of tenure. I mean, before we recorded, I was saying how it sort of felt like the second graduation for you in a way. How did you sort of first learn about them and overall, what was your time like there?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Actually, when I first heard about them, it was through my teacher, Laura Parloff, and she actually had owned her own studio. It was called Color Forms back in the day. And she was actually their competition, Skidmore&#8217;s competition. And I actually wanted to go work for her studio because I thought her studio was really cool. She had a pool table; that was a big thing for me. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;wow, they actually got a pool table in the studio.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;I wish I could work here.&#8221; And plus, they had a lot of the great artists working there.</p>
<p>But she told me that I should go to Skidmore because she thought my style was more in par with what they did back then. So that&#8217;s how I really found out about them. And then I did, like, a class trip to Skidmore and did the whole tour thing. After the tour was over, I actually requested to see if I can come back and show my portfolio. I did that, and I showed my portfolio to the owner and a couple of other creatives that worked there. They was very impressed, and they said, well, we think you&#8217;re very talented, and we would love you to join our team. And so it was just that quick. So I was like, &#8220;wow, all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I started working there, I started working in the matte room. For those of you don&#8217;t know what the matte room was&#8230;it was just like an internship type deal. So you&#8217;re not actually working on any real projects just yet. You&#8217;re just framing the work that went out. You&#8217;re doing the packaging, and you&#8217;re going on runs and stuff like that and getting coffee. But again, I was very determined to just try to fit in with these guys and try to be valuable with the studio. So, yeah, I think maybe after probably about a year or so, I got promoted to be on the board of illustrators, which was a big deal for me. I remember just feeling like, &#8220;wow, actually, I have arrived&#8221;, because the artists that I was looking up to, these guys were like, gods, the way they painted.</p>
<p>And mind you, this is nothing on the computer. This is all hand-painted stuff. But some of the images that they did was just beautiful. And I was like, &#8220;Man, I got to learn how to do this and figure out how to learn from this as much as I can.&#8221; Yeah, so I learned as much as I could. I was asking a thousand questions and kept getting better and learning new techniques. So the years flew by and ended up going from ten years to 15 years to 16 years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, clearly you were doing something right and making a real impact there to have been there that long.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I was pretty focused. I think I&#8217;ve always been pretty focused, but I think they saw in me that I was ambitious and that I was talented. And then I was able to contribute to the service that they offer. Because back then, Skidmore worked with a lot of different agencies. So I was able to kind of cut my teeth with the whole industry world just by working through Skidmore and seeing how that whole thing goes. So I did a lot of storyboarding, understood the technique behind that, what makes a good frame, what makes a good composition. I learned a lot from storyboarding. Dave O&#8217;Connell &#8212; I want to give him a shout out because he was my mentor back then at Skidmore. He was like the head storyboard guy. So he kind of took me under his wing, and then he showed me what to do and what not to do and how to make an image sing and make it as good as he can try to make it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Are there any sort of projects in particular that stand out to you during that time? I mean, 16 years? I know you probably worked on a ton of things, but is there anything in particular that you really remember?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I think it was a couple of ones that kind of stood out. I remember doing a illustration for Mazda. It was a campaign called Zoom Zoom. And I don&#8217;t know if you remember that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, I remember that. &#8220;Zoom zoom zoom.&#8221; Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>And I did the illustration of the little &#8220;Zoom Zoom&#8221; kid. Then I had the car flying by him. That was a big thing for me because when I first went to Skidmore, I didn&#8217;t really know how to do cars that well. But when I went there, I feel like every artist there knew how to do a car really well. So I was able to learn from them, and then I was able to apply that to this image. So it kind of stood out to me because that was like one of the first true advertising works that I did that actually that was put out there, that had a car in it that was illustrated and they used it. So that one stood out. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to think of anything else. I&#8217;m pretty sure it was a lot, but just working on storyboards for Blockbuster. Remember Blockbuster with a little&#8230;I don&#8217;t know if it was a hamster or I think it was two hamsters or something, that was right across the street from a Blockbuster Video store? I remember doing storyboards for them for that whole campaign. It was just cool to really work on a lot of big name stuff back then Blockbuster Video and Mazda and a lot of other big brands. But the Mazda one, I think that really kind of sticks out because that was like my first real commercial piece that got featured.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, when you were at Skidmore, again, you were there for 16 years, but when did you get the idea to start your own studio?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>It was something that was kind of always in the back of my mind. The guy that I kind of befriended at Skidmore, who was actually my business partner now, Guy Allen, we would kind of talk about it here and there because I think at that time, skidmore was kind of going in a little bit of a different direction than what we would have liked to be involved in. So it was always kind of rumblings between him and I, like, we should do our own thing. But in 2016, something happened, and it kind of gave us an opportunity to really go about making it happen. I think in February of 2016, we told our boss, &#8220;hey, we were thinking about going on our own.&#8221; That&#8217;s what we did. He didn&#8217;t like it that much. He thought, well, because I was there for such a long time, and he didn&#8217;t want to see us go, but he tried to keep us there, but he know our wishes to try to branch on our own and do our own thing.</p>
<p>So hats off to him. Tim Smith &#8212; may he rest in peace. He actually passed away not too long ago. But, yeah, it was tough, man. It was a big decision because I had been there for so long, it is, like, all I knew, but I knew that if I stayed there, I wouldn&#8217;t have been happy because of the direction that they were going in. I just wanted to just be my own boss. And Guy, he felt the same way, and he said, &#8220;this is our chance to just really craft something or make something on our own, to really just put something out there that we&#8217;re both proud of in terms of the type of work that we want to do.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And now you&#8217;re doing it.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Now we&#8217;re doing it, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What are your plans for First Fight for the future?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>I really want to try to expand our brand and our reach as much as we can more globally. I really want to try to hone in on the service of digital strategy. I think we got the content part down. It&#8217;s just really the execution of the marketing of that idea, and I want to make sure that we were able to offer that to our clients, because I think that&#8217;s a big thing for us. I just want us to be more of a complete studio. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to say the A word &#8212; the agency word &#8212; because I think when you say agency, there&#8217;s kind of not all the time, but there&#8217;s kind of a negative connotation when you say agency just because there&#8217;s so many different layers of different folks that you have to go through, especially when it comes to the client for them to get their message across. So I just want to make sure that we stay as intimate and more hands on with the work for our clients, but also let them know that we can really expand their voice and their messaging, and we have the know how to go about doing it. So I really want to just make sure that we expand on that more and get that more known as far as what First Fight can do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, being from Detroit, born and raised, educated in Detroit, you&#8217;ve built your career in Detroit. How has the city influenced your approach to the work that you do?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&#8217;s an influence because I think Detroit has kind of always been like the underdog to a lot of different places. We were saying earlier, like how when you go out well, at least when I go out of my region here in Detroit, there&#8217;s kind of like an eye raise when I tell them that I&#8217;m from Detroit. But I kind of wear that proudly now because I think I like the idea that we are the underdog and that we&#8217;re always trying to prove ourselves and we&#8217;re surprising people that we do have all this talent here in Detroit. They can do all these amazing know. You may know Detroit, but you really don&#8217;t know Detroit. So I always like to surprise know that way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>How would you describe the city&#8217;s creative community?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, the creative community here in Detroit is really good. I think what you&#8217;re seeing is kind of a renaissance of that. And I think Detroit has always been a pretty creative city anyway. But I think the automotive industry has kind of overshadowed that a little bit. I think people have found other ways to express themselves creatively other than just designing cars and whatnot. The technology also has been used here. The new technology, whether it&#8217;s self-driving cars or if it&#8217;s the half-res well, not the half-res, but the New Labs is what I&#8217;m trying to say. New Labs is a new tech sector here in Detroit that&#8217;s really blowing up.</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s cool about is that the creative community has kind of been driving that because it doesn&#8217;t always have to be automotive based. There&#8217;s other different sectors that you can know express yourself in. The scene here in Detroit has been great. I love it. I love the city now. How it is, what it&#8217;s evolving into right now has been exciting for me to see because I&#8217;ve been here since day one. The last probably last ten years has really just taken off. So I&#8217;m just very excited about what&#8217;s been happening here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What do you wish you would have been told about this industry when you first started?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Patience is a virtue, especially with the motion industry, motion graphics industry. I would have loved somebody to tell me that what you do is cool, but there&#8217;s like 20 other people, or not even 20, like 1000 other people that can do the exact same thing. And it could probably do a little bit better. And I think when I first or when we I should say we when we first got into this, me and my partner, I think we went into it with a little bit of a na√Øvet√© because I think what we thought was really cool to us was groundbreaking. But we found out that that&#8217;s not always the case. It&#8217;s really just understanding that you have to try to figure out how to make yourself different and how do you stand out from the rest. So I wish I would have known that more back when we first started this to really hone in on that. And I think we have honed in on that since then.</p>
<p>What makes us different than other creative studios? Yeah, but I wish somebody would have just told me that you have the talent, you have the ambition, but you really got to hone in what makes you different, because there&#8217;s a lot of noise out there and it&#8217;s hard to really just set yourself apart from the other creators.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Do you have a dream project that you&#8217;d love to do one day?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I would love to do the intro to the next James Bond movie. Yeah, I&#8217;m a big James Bond fan.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I could see that from your photo. I can 100% see that.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. I think in my mind, I&#8217;m kind of like the Black James Bond. They kept talking about getting Idris Elba to do it, but I think I could probably do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What&#8217;s your favorite Bond movie?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Not the one that just came out, but the one before that. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Was that Skyfall? </p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I think it was, but actually, I take that back. I think Casino Royale was probably my favorite one because I like Daniel Craig. I love what he brought to that role. But when I was coming up, Roger Moore was like, that was my James Bond. Because he was, I think, that was back in the 80s, I think. But it was really cool because I felt like with Casino Royale, it kind of got back to that what the genre was really about. It was making him well, also just making him a little bit more human and a little vulnerable.</p>
<p>I thought that was really cool. So I think Daniel Craig was able to kind of pull that, um, when he had the baton.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. I&#8217;m looking it up now. Spectre was the one before; the latest one was No Time to Die. I saw that one. I thought that one was pretty good.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it was kind of interesting because I was like, well, I wasn&#8217;t expecting them to kill off James Bond.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>And I hope I&#8217;m not spoiling it for anybody, but yeah, it was interesting for them to do that. I guess when you think about it, 007 could be anybody. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be that character. So anybody can wear the 007.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>They did. They brought in a new person. They brought in Lashana Lynch. She played 007. I don&#8217;t know if they want to continue having her as Bond. That could be interesting.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>I would love that. That would be interesting. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I would love to see kind of just what they plan to do with it. Because I haven&#8217;t read the books like the books from John le Carr√©, but I feel like Bond has to be of a certain age. I know there were Idris and other folks were kind of being sort of bandied around for that particular role. But Bond is what, maybe like in his 30s, perhaps?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I think so. And what&#8217;s interesting, too, is that any actor who thinks about taking on that role, I think they have to sign a contract that says you&#8217;re basically going to give the studio ten years out of your life to play this character. So it&#8217;s definitely a commitment. And yeah, I think they need to at least have someone who&#8217;s young enough who can kind of age into the role. So they&#8217;re 30 or maybe 40. Even 40 is probably pushing it a little bit. But yeah, that&#8217;s why I think I know. I keep hearing rumblings about Henry Cavill to play him. I keep hearing that his screen test was, like, off the roof.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. They keep talking about how good he was in it. So it&#8217;s going to be really interesting to see what comes from that. It&#8217;s interesting because it would be nice to try go in a little bit of a different direction with the character, whether it&#8217;s a Black woman or even a Black man. It&#8217;d be interesting to see what comes from that, what that will look like.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I think that would be really interesting to see how they plan on sort of pulling that off, especially now with all the technology and stuff that comes with Bond. It feels like they&#8217;re always upgrading him into some new sort of tech or new sort of scenario or environment or something like that. I could see Henry Cavill doing that. And also, he was in the Mission Impossible movie. Not the one that just came out, but the one before that. And he was in The Man From U.N.C.L.E.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, he was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So he&#8217;s done spy stuff. I mean, I could see that. I could see that.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. If they do go with him, I just hope that he&#8217;s able to bring something unique to the character because I think Daniel Craig was able to do that. I mean, for a long time. He&#8217;s probably really the only one that was able to do that to bring something a little extra to that character. So I&#8217;m hoping that if they do go with him, that he&#8217;s able to make it his own and make it different.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, James Bond aside, where do you see yourself in the next five years? Like, what kind of work would you like to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>I want to really become a better business person. What I&#8217;ve realized in the seven years that I&#8217;ve been co-owning First Fight is that there&#8217;s definitely a business component to this thing. And I think the creative is just one part of it. But the business part is something that I really want to get better at.</p>
<p>And I think I have gotten better at it because there&#8217;s definitely a science to it. There&#8217;s the whole networking part of it. There&#8217;s the constant putting yourself. Out there. It&#8217;s a lot to it. So I just want to become a better businessman within the next five years. Then also, hopefully, along with that, as I get better at it, first fight will be better as well, and then we&#8217;ll be able to have more of a bigger reach in terms of what we can offer our clients and even our potential clients. Yeah, just becoming I feel like as I get better, First Fight will get better.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s what I want to try to be in the next five years, just a more complete businessman. I don&#8217;t know if you can say complete businessman, but just definitely better.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I feel you. I mean, I remember when I was starting my studio, I didn&#8217;t know anything about business. I just had this sort of notion. I was like, I&#8217;ve been designing for a few years. I could do this. And there was so much in those first, I&#8217;d say probably in the first five years, that I just was like, I had no clue on how to run a business. I knew how to design. I knew how to make work for clients. But running a business and then having employees and payroll and all this stuff? I was, like, right over my head. I learned it eventually, but it was definitely like a trial by fire process. So I feel you.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s a lot of stuff that pulls at you because I still do the work within the studio. So it&#8217;s always frustrating to me where I&#8217;m constantly getting pulled from that, because either I&#8217;m just trying to pay attention to what this artist is doing, what this checking up on this email, checking up all the status of this project, and constantly doing that on a daily basis. It&#8217;s hard because at the heart of it, I am a creative, and I would really just love to be in a corner and just say, leave me alone. I just want to draw something.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to get any more emails. I don&#8217;t want to get any more phone calls. It&#8217;s a lot. But I&#8217;ve learned to and it sounds kind of funny to say this I&#8217;ve learned to really embrace that, and I&#8217;ve actually liked the challenge of it. So that&#8217;s why I said I want to become better at it and just try to find a real nice balance between that businessman and that creative. I think the payoff is what you&#8217;re always trying to go after, like, wow. And it&#8217;s kind of that hunter-gatherer mentality. Like, if you do go after work, the payoff is that, oh, when they say yes, or if they give you a direct award because you&#8217;ve just been after them for so long.</p>
<p>I do like the rush of that when it does happen. But ask me, like, maybe ten years ago, the same question. I don&#8217;t know if I would have said the same thing. It&#8217;s just funny how you kind of change your perspective on things as you do this, as you go into the business part of it, because as creatives, I think most creatives are introverts for the most part. And I feel like I can be both. I can be extroverted when I need to be, but for the most part, I&#8217;m introverted. I get recharged when I&#8217;m by myself and just working on what I need to work on, but I can flip it. And I think over the years, it&#8217;s kind of changed because I can definitely become that guy, go after work or just do a cold call and say, &#8220;hey, we can do this, we can do that. You should use our studio&#8221;, which in itself is like unheard of, especially for an introvert. But I think when you&#8217;re able to do both, though, I think you have to do that if you&#8217;re going to try to become a businessman in this industry, especially if you&#8217;re going to try to own the studio, because you just have to constantly do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Very true. Very true. Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about the studio and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Your listeners can go to firstfight.tv. You can find our work there. You can also follow us on Instagram and LinkedIn. Just search for First Fight and not First Flight because sometimes we get that a lot. So it&#8217;s First Fight TV, it&#8217;s where you want to go to see our work and go to our site.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, sounds good. Andr√© Foster, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. Thank you for putting Detroit on the map, for helping to put Detroit on the map creatively. Like you said earlier, you&#8217;re the only Black-owned studio that&#8217;s doing this kind of work, and I think it&#8217;s something that more people definitely need to see, especially, I think, at this time when the power of the creative voice is being uplifted in ways like whether we&#8217;re talking about unions or writers or things of that nature, I think people are starting to really see the value of creative work. And it&#8217;s good that you are doing this. You&#8217;ve been doing this now for over 20 years professionally. You&#8217;ve been working with some of the best talent in the business, working with great clients. I hope more people see that, and that really helps to kind of elevate the work that you&#8217;re doing. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Foster:</b></p>
<p>Thank you for having me. And this is awesome. Like you said, I just want to make sure that my story can resonate with someone else who&#8217;s even thinking about becoming a studio owner, and hopefully they can get some inspiration from this. And also, too, because you can&#8217;t become something that you don&#8217;t see, like a Black artist who&#8217;s even thinking about owning a creative studio or even going into animation for motion design. Just know that there are other people of color who are doing, you know, I want to be one of those people that can, you know, we&#8217;re here and you can do it too.</p>
