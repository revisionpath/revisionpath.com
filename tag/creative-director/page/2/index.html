Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>So I&#8217;m Carmelle Kendall. I am a creative director, designer, founder of Neighborly Paper, and illustrator for a children&#8217;s book called &#8220;Your Freedom, Your Power.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I saw the book as I was doing my research, came out with Penguin Random House on July 25, and I&#8217;ll make sure that we put a link to that in the show notes. I&#8217;m curious, are you spending the summer doing a book tour or doing anything with publicizing the book?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not doing a book tour, but I have spoken with the authors, and we kind of have our rollout plans on how we plan on getting the word out there. I&#8217;m super excited about it. This is my first children&#8217;s book ever, so this was a goal of mine for, like, a long term goal. So I was very surprised when they hit me up to do this project. But I&#8217;m super excited about it and just trying to get the word out there any way that I can, because this is a book that is very much needed right now with the current climate in the United States.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. How did you get involved with it? Did the author reach out to you directly?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Actually, the art director at Random House hit me up, saw my work just on the Internet and on Instagram and kind of traced it back to me, hit me up and just know there&#8217;s a new book coming out called &#8220;Your Freedom, Your Power&#8221; and wanted to know if I was interested in learning more about the project. And of course, you know, I said yes. I was over the moon elated about it. And then she, you know, just went into detail about what the book was going to be about. She showed me who the authors were. Allison Matulli is a lawyer, and then Clelia Castro-Malaspina, I believe is how you say her last name, is a writer. And they kind of paired up to write this book. And it&#8217;s really about&#8230;it&#8217;s a middle school level book, and it&#8217;s about how to protest, how to write a letter to your representative, how to write a petition, just everything on how to get your voice out there. I think it&#8217;s a super important book that middle schoolers, you know, adults need. LLike everybody needs [it], but it&#8217;s super fun. It&#8217;s in a way that&#8217;s just, you know, really straightforward and plain for the younger audience. It also talks about previous historic cases throughout the United States history that kind of changed the course of America and learning from those cases and how to implement all of that into today&#8217;s society. So it&#8217;s really important.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I love the idea of a sort of kid / I guess teenager focused book about civics. Cause I mean&#8230;I don&#8217;t have children. But like, I don&#8217;t know if they teach civics in school anymore. That sort of stuff you mentioned with the book, I learned it in civics in seventh grade, but I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s such the case now, especially over the past I would say maybe ten to fifteen years. And we definitely have seen in the news, you know, protests and things where people are really exercising their civic rights. It&#8217;s not really taught as to how you go about doing it, because I think it really crops up around elections because we&#8217;re like, oh, write your congressperson this, that or the other.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>But how do you start that? How do you even make that happen?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And you can do it on such a small level, you know what I mean? It doesn&#8217;t even have to be around presidential elections, but it&#8217;s literally just about anything that you want to change. You have the power to do it. You have the voice to do it. And here are the tools to help you. Yeah. Even I learned a lot from reading the book and illustrating the images. I was just like, &#8220;wow, this is such a needed book right now.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Very cool. We&#8217;ve actually had&#8230;man, I think we&#8217;ve had a few children&#8217;s illustrators on the show fairly recently. I know we had Alleanna Harris. We had Akeem Roberts. We&#8217;ve had a couple of folks on the show recently that have done like children&#8217;s books, illustrations &#8212; kid lit, as they called it. Is that sort of a dream of yours to do more books like that?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>It is. I have so many ideas. I have so many ideas for children&#8217;s books that I want to do. So I&#8217;m hoping that this kick starts just a new line of employment for me because I had a lot of fun doing it. It was a lot of work. I will say this book, it took over a year and a half, I believe total, to do it. The deadline got pushed back a few times. The manuscript changed a few times. So very much a labor of love, for sure. But I love doing it. And I have so many ideas for other children&#8217;s books, so I&#8217;m hoping to get started on those now so that I can keep the momentum going and keep this ball rolling. But yeah, I loved it. I definitely want to continue. For sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Nice. Do you have representation yet?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t. So I am debating on&#8230;I&#8217;ve had people reach out to me for representation, but I have another illustrator friend and she was like, &#8220;don&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, why is that?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>From her experience. She said that she had a representator or representative for her illustrations and that it didn&#8217;t work out because she felt like they weren&#8217;t really pushing her work out there and that they were pretty much just tacking on their percentage for a lot of the work that was coming in. Not from them. Like just people coming in organically to her and then having her representative take a percentage off without really finding the work for her. And so she got into some royalties, like children&#8217;s books that have royalties, and now her representative gets a percentage for life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>She said, so from her experience, she said that she had a representative for her illustrations and that if it didn&#8217;t work out because she felt like they weren&#8217;t really like pushing her work out there. And that they were just pretty much tacking on their percentage for a lot of the work that was coming in not from them. Like, just people coming in organizally to her and then having her representative take a percentage off without really finding the work for her. And so she got into some royalties like children&#8217;s books that have royalties and now her representative gets a percentage for life.  </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>And they didn&#8217;t come to her through the representative, and so she was just telling me, you know, it&#8217;s not worth it and you know, just kind of do it on your own. So I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m a little on the fence about that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow. Yeah. I can understand then why you&#8217;d want to kind of give that some more thought. I know some of the folks that I mentioned that we&#8217;ve had on the show, they are represented. I think one of them in particular is represented by, like I think it&#8217;s either a Black agency or it&#8217;s one that is geared towards Black work, or Black or BIPOC work.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know. I feel kind of like for illustrators, maybe it just makes sense because you don&#8217;t have to do that legwork define work. They kind of just come to you. But then if it&#8217;s a situation like you mentioned with your friend, that sucks because they&#8217;re getting a cut of money for not even really doing the work.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>So the one that I talked to, I asked that question, I was kind of like, &#8220;okay, so if somebody comes to me without you, like, if they see me on Instagram or whatever and hits me up, then do you get that percentage?&#8221; And she said, &#8220;yes, that&#8217;s the way her contracts work.&#8221; And so it made me hesitant. So I said no at that time because I was like, &#8220;well, let me do some more research because I don&#8217;t know about this.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, no, that&#8217;s fair. That makes a lot of sense. Yeah. So aside from the book, what else do you have planned for the summer?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>So, aside from the book, I&#8217;m working a lot on Neighborly Paper, which is my paper company, rolling out new products all through the summer and hoping to get into some more stores come fall so that everybody will be able to purchase Neighborly from a store near them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I will make sure to link to the segment that I saw you on where you were featured on the TODAY show. That&#8217;s big. Talking about Neighborly. I think at the time, it was like, in 2020. Is that, right?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yes, February 2020.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, during Black History Month. I think it mentioned you were in, I think, twenty stores at the time.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Was it only twenty? Oh, my gosh. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Look at you. &#8220;Only twenty. Was it only twenty?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Wow. I don&#8217;t even remember the number at that point, but wow! Yeah, it might have been twenty at that point, but we&#8217;ve definitely grown a lot since being on the TODAY Show, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, let&#8217;s talk about Neighborly. Let&#8217;s get into that. How did you sort of come up with the idea to start that?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>So it was actually my business partner&#8217;s idea. So at that point, we started it in 2016 in New York City. We were both living there in Harlem, and my business partner is actually a childhood friend of mine. We grew up as neighbors in Fayetteville, Georgia. We grew up as neighbors. We ended up living in Harlem together as neighbors again. And so she&#8217;s a writer, and she had the idea of coming up with a greeting card line at that time and asked me was I interested in doing some illustrations for the line. And so I said, well, let me see first what the lines are and what I can bring with the illustrations. I didn&#8217;t say yes immediately because I wanted to just make sure I could actually do this. And she sent me the lines. They were hilarious. I thought it was great, super cute. I spent the weekend just kind of drawing some images to the design, I mean, to the lines. She ended up loving it. And then she said, &#8220;well, I think we should call it Neighborly, since we grew up as neighbors and we&#8217;re neighbors again.&#8221; And I loved that idea, designed the logo and everything. </p>
<p>Initially, we started out our line with holiday starting in 2016. So we had Christmas. We ended up doing some little, at this point it was like October, sSo we did little Halloween postcards that we gave out as freebies so that people could just get our website out there. But yeah, we started out with eight cards for holiday. We completely sold out of those cards. We had a total of 800. We did like 100 each. Completely sold out of those cards. Unexpectedly, we were like, wow, people really love this. And then people were like, &#8220;when are the Valentine&#8217;s cards coming out? When are you going to have birthday cards?&#8221; Initially, I was like, wow. I thought it would just be like a little hobby. Like, I would draw a new card every few months, but now people are like, when are the next cards coming out? Yeah. Then we were like, okay, this is a viable business right now. We actually need to come out with more inventory. So that&#8217;s how it started.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I love the name Neighborly. I love that whole sort of concept of it coming from the fact that you and your business partner were neighbors. That&#8217;s really cute.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, so and now we&#8217;re actually both back in Atlanta. Neighbors again.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Look at that. Yeah, neighbors and business partners &#8212; that&#8217;s dope. So right now you&#8217;re working at an agency now, but before that work, you were at Dagger as an associate creative director and a senior art director. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. So started at Dagger in 2020 as a senior art director, worked on Krystal, which is a fast food restaurant in the southeast; worked on Buffalo Wild Wings; and then got promoted to ACD, which is associate creative director, where I worked on Aflac and a brand called Rent. But, yeah, it was fun. Dagger was great. I learned so much. We did a huge rebranding for Krystal at that time, which was amazing. I got to lead that, which leading a rebrand of that size was just amazing. I loved it. That&#8217;s one of my favorite projects to date just because the client gave us so much freedom. We pretty much changed everything except for the logo, which is like a dream. Not a lot of brands let you do that; let you change the colors and let you explore typography and things like that. So, so much fun. I loved it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a couple of things I sort of know about Dagger. I&#8217;ve heard of it here as a local agency. One of the projects, I think it&#8217;s either from Dagger or maybe Dagger acquired it, I&#8217;m not 100% sure. But ButterATL&#8230;is it part of Dagger? Is it like just a project that they do? Do you know what I&#8217;m talking about?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yes. It started out as a part of Dagger, and then now they&#8217;ve kind of branched out, and Dagger, I think, is just known as, like, an investor at this point, but now it&#8217;s its own entity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay. Yeah. I know about Brandon Butler. Brandon&#8217;s been on the show before. He was actually one of the very first people I had on the show way back in 2013. He was working at Edelman at the time, but I had heard of him because&#8230;I don&#8217;t know if people know that Brandon Butler is kind of something of like an Atlanta like wunderkind. He had a website store in North DeKalb Mall. I want to say it was North DeKalb Mall, where you could literally go into a store in the mall and buy a website. This was well before I think he did Butter, but I remember hearing about Butter, and I know that Brandon was at Dagger, so I wasn&#8217;t sure sort of what that relationship was. </p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Mmhmm. Yeah, Dagger, I guess, helped start it. It started at Dagger, but now it&#8217;s definitely its own.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, nice. I&#8217;m wondering, like&#8230;it probably was really cool to work on with Krystal kind of being such a&#8230;it&#8217;s not an Atlanta, I mean, I guess you could say it&#8217;s a known Atlanta brand. It&#8217;s founded in Tennessee, but it&#8217;s headquartered now here in Atlanta. I bet that was something kind of working on such a well-known Atlanta/Southern brand.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>When I was interviewing and they said that Krystal wanted to do a rebrand &#8212; and they never really done a rebrand, like, ever in history &#8212; that is what made me want to take the job, because what brands have been around that have just never done a rebrand and are just kind of like, we want you to lead this project. It&#8217;s like, wow, that was a dream come true and something that doesn&#8217;t happen very often. And so I definitely took the job for that project because I just was really excited to do a rebrand of that scale.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dive a little bit into that project because you said it was such a grand redesign like that. What did that entail? Like, what did the team look like? How did that process even go?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>The team was so small, it literally was me and another designer. We ended up getting some freelance help because it just was massive. But it didn&#8217;t happen all at once. It happened over the course of, like, a year, I would say. So, yeah. It wasn&#8217;t crazy where we did it in, like, a month or so. We really did take our time with it. But, yeah, like I said, the only rule was don&#8217;t change the logo. So everything else was pretty much sky&#8217;s the limit. So they knew they wanted something more modern, more fresh, just more current. I just feel like everything was kind of looking a little outdated just because they hadn&#8217;t had a rebrand in forever. So we updated the colors. We made it more just popping. Like, we wanted everything to pop. Redid product photography for all of the menu items, which was one of my favorite parts. We wanted the food to look more realistic, you know. We wanted sauce dripping down, some of the ingredients might have fallen onto the plate, things like that. We thought of every little detail that you could think of. Typography, colors, design elements. We did some illustrations for it. We had all new photography, all new models, just everything from start to finish. We did everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow. And like you said, it took over, like, a year to sort of pull it all together.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, when you started out at Dagger, you were an art director, right? And then when you left, you were an associate creative director. Tell me kind of, I guess, one &#8212; and I know this because I hear this either from a lot of freelancers or just from a lot of people &#8212; they kind of use art director and creative director rather interchangeably. Like, to you, what is the difference between the two, and how did you shift from becoming an art director to a creative director?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I see people using them interchangeably as well, and I definitely don&#8217;t think they should be using them interchangeably. For me, art director, you&#8217;re way more in the weeds of the work. You&#8217;re working under the creative director. So for me, the creative director is more so leading the charge. But the art director is kind of implementing what the creative director sets in motion is kind of how I see it. So when I first started at Dagger as a senior art director, I definitely was more in the weeds. And then when I left as associate creative director, I was more so overseeing, like, you&#8217;re managing the teams, you&#8217;re managing the day to day of the teams. You&#8217;re more so delegating the work. You&#8217;re making sure everything is cohesive, of course, and everything kind of fits together. But as art director, you&#8217;re definitely doing the day to day, whereas creative director, you&#8217;re leading the way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I got you. That makes sense. Now that you kind of put it that way, it does seem like something you would sort of organically level up to, because if you&#8217;re in the weeds, then of course you&#8217;re able to be an effective creative director because you know what it&#8217;s like to be at that level where you&#8217;re kind of hands on with the work in that way.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>And you definitely, as a creative director, need to understand what it takes to make the vision come alive. And I feel like understanding what it takes, you have to be as the art director, you have to be as the designer so you can understand, okay, this is going to take this amount of time. This may not be possible, but this is&#8230;you kind of need to know those things, and the only way to know those things is to be in the weeds of the work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>That makes sense. I got you. Now I kind of want to shift gears here a little bit. Of course, we&#8217;ve talked a good bit about your work, but I&#8217;m curious to kind of know more about your journey leading up to all of this. Now, you are one of the rare Atlanta natives I think I&#8217;ve had on this show, which is great, over ten years. Tell me about growing up here.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. So initially, my family is from the southwest of Atlanta. Like, our first house was on Cascade Road.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>And then ended up moving to Fayetteville when I was little, and that&#8217;s mainly where I grew up. I went to private school. I went to Woodward Academy for a long time before transferring, going to public school and high school, where I transferred to Sandy Creek. So that&#8217;s where I graduated from, which is a Fayette County School, and then moved away, where I went to Howard for undergrad.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>How was Howard?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Howard was amazing. I mean, best four years of my life. I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s what all the Howard grads say from at least the ones I know. But, yeah, Howard was amazing. I mean, I highly suggest everybody go there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, when you went there, you were studying marketing. Did you kind of already have that in mind when you went? Like when you graduated high school, you knew you wanted to get into marketing?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>No, absolutely not. I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted. I honestly didn&#8217;t think about it. I wasn&#8217;t the type of person to like&#8230;I don&#8217;t know. When I was growing up, my goal in life, I wanted to be a background dancer. I didn&#8217;t take school and stuff that seriously. And so when I graduated from high school, I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to be at all. I just wanted to go out and party and have a good time. So I just picked it randomly because I just was like, &#8220;oh, business, that sounds cool. Let&#8217;s do it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m laughing not at the choice, but I&#8217;m laughing at the fact that there&#8217;s so much pressure, I think, especially when you&#8217;re in high school and about to graduate on, like, you need to pick the one thing that you&#8217;re going to do for the rest of your life. There&#8217;s a lot of pressure to have that forward thinking in mind. I 100% get what you&#8217;re saying. When I graduated, I wanted to do something with web design, actually, but at the time, it wasn&#8217;t, like, in the curriculum. I graduated in 1999, and so the web was still kind of becoming a thing. The Internet was still becoming a thing. And when you went to school, the closest thing that there was was, like, computer science or computer engineering. There wasn&#8217;t any sort of, like, UX or anything. I don&#8217;t think those terms, at least not in the general knowledge of design, really existed back then. And I took my first semester. It was all this programming stuff. Didn&#8217;t like it at all. I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like this.&#8221; Went to my advisor, told him I wanted to do websites and build stuff for the Internet, and he was like, &#8220;the Internet&#8217;s a fad. You&#8217;re not going to stick around if this is what you want to do. You should change your major.&#8221; And so I changed my major to Math. And I mean, this is partially true, but it&#8217;s also what I tell people. I just changed my major to Math because I liked Math. I didn&#8217;t have any sort of idea of, like, I&#8217;m going to be a mathematician. I&#8217;m going to be a Math teacher. I had no clue what to do with a Math degree. I just liked Math. But also when I did the math on my credits that I had so far, like, stuff I had transferred from high school, I was like, &#8220;wait a minute. I could graduate a semester early if I switch over to Math, and I could still stay at my scholarship program.&#8221; So that&#8217;s what I did.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s important.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Because later, as a working designer, I always get people that are just baffled that I have a Math degree. Like, why? I just&#8230;I like Math. I didn&#8217;t really have any career plans. Also because the scholarship program that I was in was set up where you did two internships at NASA facilities.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And so the goal was, like, you do those two internships, and then when you graduate, you have a job at NASA. And I was like, &#8220;well, I don&#8217;t have to really think about what I have to do. All I have to do is just graduate college, and I got a job waiting for me.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>But 9/11 happened when I was in my junior year, and they changed stuff with the program where the seniors that were graduating in 2002 would still get to go to their NASA assignment or whatever, but not the ones after that. And so I was working at the High Museum at the time, selling tickets at the High. That was the job I had when I graduated because I had nothing lined up at all. I had no sort of career plans even coming out of college because I thought, like, &#8220;oh, I&#8217;m set.&#8221; So I get it. I completely understand not having an idea of what you really want to do. I sort of fell into design because I had it as a hobby. I was still doing it on the side, and then now it&#8217;s what I do. But I had no plan at all. I was just like rolling with the punches.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>But I mean, it&#8217;s absurd to ask somebody that&#8217;s 18 years old what is their plan? You know what I mean? Like, you&#8217;re 18. If you think about it, in high school, you&#8217;re not exploring all these different career paths. You&#8217;re taking geometry and English. I don&#8217;t know. I just feel like to have your whole career planned out as a freshman in college is wild. That&#8217;s bonkers to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>I think everybody should kind of start out undecided, or I think maybe college, your first year, everybody takes classes in all kinds of different things so that sophomore year, maybe you can have some inkling of what you want to do. But freshman year, that&#8217;s crazy. So I didn&#8217;t know. Basically, I just chose it randomly. I was like, yeah, businesswoman. I can be a businesswoman. Sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Or do, like, a gap year or something. Just something to kind of give yourself at that time frame, like, more of an idea of what it is that you want to do. Because also, look, as a freshman, I was out partying, too.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>The clubs used to send buses to campus to pick us up and take us to the club and then bring us back to campus. I told this story on the show before I almost flunked out freshman year because I was partying, almost lost my scholarship. I had to pull it together. I really did.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>I mean&#8230;but you&#8217;re living life. That&#8217;s what you&#8217;re supposed to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. So that&#8217;s what I picked just at random. I mean, Howard was amazing, though. I wouldn&#8217;t change that for the world. But yes, if I could go back now, I would do graphic design or be an art major or something that pertains to what I do now. But at the time, it was random.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, hindsight is 20/20, right? You can always kind of look back and know, &#8220;yeah, this is what I should do, because it will make sense for what I&#8217;m doing now.&#8221; So I get that.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So when you graduated, what kind of work were you doing right after you graduated?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>So, right after I graduated, I had an internship because I knew that I hated marketing, and I knew I didn&#8217;t want to do anything in marketing. And at that time, a friend of mine worked at a fashion PR place in L.A. And so she said, you know, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what your plans are after graduation, but you can come intern with us if you want.&#8221; And at that point, I had no other plans. That was the only thing on the table. So I said, &#8220;yes, I will do that.&#8221; So I lived in L.A. for, like, nine months, I believe, and I interned there. And during that time, I was kind of like, &#8220;okay, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m working towards. Do I want to do fashion? What am I doing?&#8221; Basically, I started realizing that I really like graphic design. I really like art direction. I want to see what this path has to offer. And I remember senior year before graduation, I remember I set up a meeting with my career advisor, and I said, &#8220;who are the people that make ads?&#8221; And she said, &#8220;that&#8217;s called an art director.&#8221; And I remember going home and googling how to be an art director and came up with these schools where you could get a degree in art direction. And so while I was interning in L.A., I just was applying to all of these art direction programs and ended up getting into SCAD. Or no, I ended up getting into Miami Ad [School] and those ad school type places. But it&#8217;s just like a certificate of completion. Like, it&#8217;s not a degree in any way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>And so I realized I wanted to go to SCAD because I could get a degree. And so I applied to SCAD for their grad program, and I ended up not getting in because I didn&#8217;t have an advertising portfolio which is needed for the grad program. I ended up moving back to Atlanta and taking classes at SCAD. Not in the grad program, but just as a regular student. And I took, like, Photoshop, Illustrator, I learned all the programs and then got my professors to write me letters of recommendation for the grad program and then ended up reapplying and getting in the second time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Nice. I think that&#8217;s really something that you still kind of had this vision, but you just sort of found different ways to kind of get to it. I mean, one, taking these courses and getting these certificates, at least you got your feet wet with what it would entail without sort of fully getting in first. But also you use that to help build your portfolio, then you can apply and get into SCAD. Yeah, I like that approach.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>And all of the people in my program, they had had art direction as their majors, as undergrads. They all had been working towards this grad program for years, whereas I had just heard about it my senior year right before graduation on what an art director even was. So I was very much behind everybody. Like, I was just now learning Photoshop, whereas these people knew Photoshop all through college and were designers and things like that. So I definitely felt behind. I will say. But yeah, I mean, my goal was to get into this program and kind of just hunkered down and just learned what I needed to learn and reapplied.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, aside from the curriculum focus, like, how was SCAD different from Howard?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Oh, it&#8217;s different in every way possible, I think. I remember my very first day at SCAD, I walked into the cafeteria, and there was, like, a classic pianist playing classical music on the piano, and I was just like, &#8220;oh, my God, where am I?&#8221; Because at Howard, you&#8217;re like, twerking while you&#8217;re eating the lunch with a DJ. You know what I mean? Like, it&#8217;s a party, and I go to SCAD, and it was like a person playing classical music on the piano, and everybody kind of eating in silence, and I was just like, &#8220;what did I do?&#8221; It was very different, very different. And also, I think art school is just way more competitive. Art is so subjective, and so it&#8217;s just a way more competitive environment, I think, than Howard was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Aside from, I guess that competitivenes, did you find community there? Did you sort of make friends there? Because one thing I&#8217;ve heard from folks that are on the show that will go know, like a SCAD or a MICA or something like that, is that it can be a bit difficult sometimes to kind of find community.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I can see that for sure. Because it&#8217;s so competitive. Like, your classmates are not your friends. You know what I mean? You&#8217;re going against them a lot of times at SCAD; you do group projects because I don&#8217;t know, you just do a lot of group projects. At least in my major, we did a lot of group projects. And it was so competitive because after graduation, you don&#8217;t want the same portfolio as your classmates because you&#8217;re all applying to the same jobs, right? So you want to stand out. So I think in that sense of it, I don&#8217;t know, you&#8217;re just not as friendly, you&#8217;re not as welcoming, because you want to distance yourself from your classmates so that you stand out come graduation time. So I can understand how people say it&#8217;s hard to make friends. I did make one of my best friends at SCAD, and I think I had a handful of friends that are still really close to me that I see all the time. So for me that wasn&#8217;t the case, but I definitely can see how people feel that way. For sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Now did you go to SCAD here in Atlanta or the one in Savannah?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>I went to the Atlanta campus.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay, all right, well, you&#8217;re right there in Midtown then, and you&#8217;re from the city, so I think that probably was a big advantage, at least socially, because you didn&#8217;t have to stay in that bubble of SCAD. Like, you could go see your parents or whatever. You could break out of that and still be in a city that you&#8217;re familiar with.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, but if I was to do it again, I&#8217;d go to Savannah, though.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, really? Why is that?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Because I would have loved to just live in a new city, a different city than one that I was already so familiar with. Like, when I go to visit Savannah, I always think, like, why didn&#8217;t I come? Like, it&#8217;s such a cool city. If I could do it again, I definitely would go to Savannah rather than Atlanta.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay. Now, with Neighborly that you mentioned earlier, did you start Neighborly while you were at SCAD or was it before then?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>No, I started Neighborly in New York when I lived in New York. So right after SCAD&#8217;s graduation, I got hired in New York.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, nice. Yeah, I know. As I did my research, of course. I see that you&#8217;ve worked for quite a few agencies. You did four years at Y&#038;R, which is now as VMLY&#038;R. You did a year at The Integer Group. You did a little over a year at Havas. You were at&#8230;when you were in New York, you were at Havas, right?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>When I was in New York, I was at VMLY&#038;R.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay. VMLY&#038;R. When you look back at those experiences collectively, how do you think they really help prepare you for the kind of work that you do now?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>I think starting out as a junior art director in New York probably was the most enlightening experience as far as learnings. New York has a different work ethic, in my opinion. Like, starting out my career in New York, I was working till 10:00 p.m. every night, and this was pre-COVID, so there&#8217;s no remote working. There&#8217;s no &#8220;I&#8217;m going to take this call from home.&#8221; You know what I mean? You&#8217;re in the office until ten [or] eleven o&#8217;clock at night. I remember there was one time, and this is with hard drives and things like that, so I remember there was one time I had to physically go take a hard drive to one of my boss&#8217;s apartment at like two in the morning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Because they needed this hard drive for a client presentation the next day. It was grueling. You just learn so much. You learn how to talk to clients. It was my first time going on set. It was my first time traveling. Like, I traveled to Uruguay for shooting and things like that. It was like a crash course in advertising, pretty much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>You mentioned the hard drive at 2:00 a.m. That, for some reason, that reminded me of The Devil Wears Prada where Andy has to take the magazine to Miranda&#8217;s apartment, and she&#8217;s like, &#8220;put it on the desk. Don&#8217;t talk to anyone, just put it on the desk.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yes. And as a junior art director, I mean, you&#8217;re the one that&#8217;s going to have to do it you know? Who else is going to do it? Not a senior person. That was the life for four years in New York. It was grueling, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What brought you back down to Atlanta? Just wanted to break out of that.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I was kind of at the point, you know, I love New York. Let me just say that I love New York, but it&#8217;s expensive. I was at the point where I was, you know, I&#8217;m tired of being broke, I&#8217;m tired of not being able to save any money. I&#8217;m tired of working to death, basically, like, just working into the night and things like that. And so to the point where I was just like, &#8220;you know what, I want to come back to Atlanta.&#8221; I put in my notice and I came back to Atlanta, where I freelanced for about a year before moving to Chicago. That year ended up being great. I got to be with my family, be with my friends. But freelance, you have your own struggles with freelance. But at the time, to me, it was better. It was what I needed to do. I needed to just&#8230;yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And I&#8217;d say good on you for recognizing that, because I think sometimes, especially when you&#8217;re really locked into a particular job or a particular pattern, a lot of the popular advice &#8212; I guess you could say it&#8217;s popular advice &#8212; but a lot of the stuff you&#8217;ll hear is that you have to sort of stick with it. You got to pay your dues, et cetera. But if it&#8217;s really weighing on you and it&#8217;s really affecting your day to day, it takes a lot to break out of that.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. I also think now is just a totally different climate than back then. Now I think just a lot of things have slowed down since COVID and now it&#8217;s like hybrid work models or people working from home, and I just think it&#8217;s a lot more laid back than back then.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Do you think it&#8217;s starting to ramp up again?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s starting to ramp up again, but hopefully not to the point where it was then. I was working around the clock.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. It sort of feels like now with companies, we&#8217;re at&#8230;what&#8217;s a good analogy for this? It&#8217;s almost like when you&#8217;re trying to learn how to drive a stick shift and you can&#8217;t sort of get the rhythm between the brake and the clutch and trying to get all that together, and it&#8217;s kind of jerky back and forth. I feel that sort of like feeling is happening right now with companies that are still trying to decide how they&#8217;re going to operate with employees, quote unquote, post pandemic. The country said the pandemic is over. The government&#8217;s like, we&#8217;re not funding, you know, whatever, but COVID is still out there. Some places that have went remote are either continuing to go remote or they&#8217;re deciding on remote or hybrid. They&#8217;re still trying to sort of figure out what the rhythm is. Because before the pandemic, the rhythm kind of was, as you said, kind of just go go go. This is how it is. Now that people see that as another way to work and another way to live and still be able to get work done, companies are like, we still have all this office space. Like, what are we going to do with that? We want people to come in the office two days a week, three days a week. They&#8217;re still trying to figure it out, I think.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely a silent battle right now between the employers and the employees as far as like hybrid versus remote versus two days, three days a week. It&#8217;s definitely a back and forth going on right now. Some agencies are like, we&#8217;re fully remote or work from anywhere. And then some people are like, no, we&#8217;re in the office. Come in the office every day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>The last place where I worked was fully remote. And I think one of the people who worked there really took advantage of that a lot by just traveling to different countries. I mean, we would meet with her and she&#8217;s like, well, this week I&#8217;m in London and this other week I&#8217;m in Paraguay or whatever. And the company eventually had to say, &#8220;okay, you need to stay in one place.&#8221; </p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Oh, really? Well was she getting her work done? </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>She was getting her work done. But the problem is, or I guess the problem that arose, at least that&#8217;s how I heard it was that because she was jumping from country to country with different time zones and stuff, there&#8217;s just certain countries that the business can&#8217;t do business from. So &#8212; and I mean, not like political dissident countries, like she wasn&#8217;t in North Korea or anything like that &#8212; but there were just certain places she was at where they were like, &#8220;OK, we&#8217;re not sure that you can work from there. We need you to kind of stay in one place for a while because it&#8217;s making paying you difficult&#8221; because she&#8217;d be in one place one month, one place somewhere else, just kind of jetsetting around. Because in my mind I was like, she can&#8217;t be getting paid that much to be doing all this jet setting between countries. Maybe she was, I don&#8217;t know. But yeah, eventually they told her, &#8220;okay, you need to stay somewhere for a while.&#8221; And then I think once she did that, she was somewhere maybe for about a month or so. They laid her off.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, they laid all of us off, so we all were kind of in the same boat. But it was so weird because I know that that&#8217;s something that people have done during the pandemic is just take advantage of the fact that you could work remotely. Why not work from anywhere? But the company was like, no, you need to stay somewhere for a while because we can&#8217;t keep track of where you&#8217;re at. And it&#8217;s messing up, I guess, business operations with how we pay you or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Oh, interesting. I wonder if it&#8217;s because of like taxes or something.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I also think they just didn&#8217;t like her. I think that could have been part of it too. We&#8217;re all working, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but if you&#8217;re working hard and then someone else is working hard, but this person is like jetsetting between all these places, I think it might have been a little bit of jealousy. They were like, &#8220;okay, you need to stay your ass in one place and stop doing all this traveling around because I can&#8217;t travel, so why do you get to travel?&#8221; That&#8217;s what I think it was. But they had a more friendly, corporate friendly excuse.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, because if she&#8217;s getting her work done and she&#8217;s&#8230;you know what I mean? That should be what counts. And if she&#8217;s working the hours of everybody else, I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know. But again, it&#8217;s sort of like what I talked about before. Companies are just trying to figure out how to sort of work now in this new environment because this is such a new thing. Like, before you went to the office, you worked your eight hours or whatever and you went home.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Work was that sort of &#8220;other place.&#8221; And now that your work can also be where you live and if you can do that from anywhere, why stay at the place that you&#8217;re at? </p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now with the work that you do with Neighborly, you&#8217;ve got a full time gig and the book&#8230;how do you balance all of that?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m good at it, to be honest. The book was a labor of love. There were nights that I stayed up to like two, three in the morning finishing those drawings because you&#8217;re on a timeline and that timeline generally isn&#8217;t going to move because of you, you know what I mean? Especially if the book comes out on a certain day, that&#8217;s it. You can&#8217;t just say, &#8220;oh, I need another month.&#8221; You have to be on somebody else&#8217;s timeline. So there were nights that I stayed up to like two, three in the morning and then literally woke up at like seven to start my normal workday. So, yeah, not fun. But I knew that doing the book was a long term goal of mine, and not every day you have this opportunity for something that you basically been dreaming about, and the opportunity presents itself. You kind of have to just buckle down and do it. So, yeah. Not fun, but I did it. Neighborly. Right now, we&#8217;re at the point where we fulfill orders, obviously from the orders that come in on our website. But it&#8217;s a lot of just negotiating with buyers right now for those larger wholesale orders. So we have Valentine&#8217;s cards and Urban Outfitters this past Valentine&#8217;s Day. So those orders are the gigantic orders. And if that&#8217;s the case, if we have a big order like for TJ Maxx or Marshall&#8217;s or whatever. That&#8217;s when we hire people to help us out, because those orders could be like, 20,000 cards.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>And if that&#8217;s the case, we hire packagers. We hire people to help us fulfill the order, like put them in boxes and things like that. Ship them out. So those come. Obviously those aren&#8217;t, like, every day that we&#8217;re fulfilling those large orders. So it&#8217;s more manageable. Every once in a while, we get these big orders, and then we hire helpers. So it makes it way more easier for us.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow. I was saying freelance, and not in a pejorative way, but it&#8217;s a business.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Since the TODAY show, we have gotten these huge wholesale orders. We&#8217;ve been in paper stores. We&#8217;ve been in Urban Outfitters. We&#8217;ve been in Marshall&#8217;s, TJ Maxx, Home Goods. So, yeah, with those big orders, you definitely need help. It&#8217;s way more than just me and my business partner can fulfill because they&#8217;re just so large. So, yeah, we have a list of packagers that we hit up that just kind of help out when needed.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So it sounds like the TODAY show was, like, a really big boost for you.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Oh, 100,000% for sure. I don&#8217;t remember. If you&#8217;re saying that we&#8217;re in 20 stores, which could be right. I just don&#8217;t remember before the TODAY show. Now we&#8217;re in thousands because of these large wholesale orders. Like with Home Goods. That was like 800 stores right there with the Home Goods order. So. Yeah, we&#8217;ve got a lot of stores, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s so interesting how creatives that I&#8217;ve had on the show, and it&#8217;s usually ones that do some kind of digital, creative work, like full time, in some capacity, tThey always have a side project or a side business or something that is tactile. Like&#8230;it&#8217;s cards. It&#8217;s home goods. It&#8217;s ceramics. It&#8217;s always something tactile. Is that on purpose, I wonder? I don&#8217;t know. I find that to be interesting.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, you don&#8217;t have clients.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>When it&#8217;s tactile. Nobody telling me what I need to do with the design or the artwork. It&#8217;s no client. You&#8217;re doing it for yourself. Yeah. At least that&#8217;s what I would think it will be. That&#8217;s what it is for me. I knew that if I&#8217;m going to do something on the side, I don&#8217;t want any clients. I want to do what I want to do, do what I like. Do what my business partner likes and that&#8217;s it. We&#8217;re doing what we want to do and that&#8217;s it. I mean, we do do custom cars, which in that case we&#8217;ll have a client, but for the most part it&#8217;s what we want for the line, what we envision for the line, what we want to put out, whether it be notepads or journals or calendars or whatever. We&#8217;re doing what we want to do, pretty much. I mean, we take into account what our audience likes and what our audience wants to see, but there&#8217;s nobody saying &#8220;no, make that blue purple,&#8221; like no, that&#8217;s all me and my business partner.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I got you. That makes a lot of sense then when you put it that way, I like that.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>For the retailers, are you normally just shooting for these larger big box stores or are smaller boutiques also a target?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Oh yeah, we&#8217;re in boutique stores all across the world actually. Now we have some international too, but with the smaller boutique stores, they&#8217;re smaller orders just because they&#8217;re mom and pop shops. So we definitely do reach out to the big box stores as well because that&#8217;s the huge orders that span for 800 stores like in the TJX case or Urban Outfitters and things like that. That&#8217;s where the huge orders come from.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Got you. That makes sense. So with everything that you&#8217;re working on, what do you want to try to accomplish for the rest of the year?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>So, at the beginning of this year I had some goals and I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s already summer and I feel like I haven&#8217;t done many of my goals that I set out to do. One of the goals was to learn 3D software. So I actually start my 3D class tomorrow, so I&#8217;m really excited about that. I&#8217;m going to be learning Cinema 4D which I have been wanting to learn for a while. And then other than that, I want to start working on these other children&#8217;s books ideas that I have. I have so many ideas, so I want to start putting those to pen, to paper. And then with Neighborly, we have a lot of ideas for products, new products that we want to roll out so want to start getting those into stores and on the website so that people can start purchasing those and then just doing know with advertising I want to build up my portfolio more and go on some more shoots and productions. Looking forward to that too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now for someone that is listening to what you&#8217;ve accomplished, they&#8217;re hearing about all your success and they want to kind of follow in that same vein. What kind of advice would you give them?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>I would say to start freelancing, start doing things on the side. A lot of times if you do what you want to do on the side, a lot of times it can become your full time. So if you&#8217;re not getting the work that you want to do in your full time job, just start creating it on the side. I&#8217;ve had side hustles and side projects pretty much since I started in advertising. I realized that I just wanted to spread my wings and not have to do everything for a client. I wanted to sometimes just create for myself. And so I&#8217;ve always just had things going on on the side, whether it be for freelance or just because I wanted to do it. And that has helped me so much in just growing my portfolio and getting other business. So I would say, always just do things on the side. Just do things for yourself, do things just to stay creative because you want to. And it always lead to something. It always will lead to bigger things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>If you could go back and give teenage Carmelle that wanted to be in the video, if you could give her some advice, knowing what you know now, what would you tell her?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>I will probably say, don&#8217;t be afraid to explore. Just art, the art world and things that you think are unattainable. Because when I was growing up, I didn&#8217;t have artists around me. My mom is a doctor and my dad is a lawyer, and so I wasn&#8217;t in the art space. I didn&#8217;t know an artist, I didn&#8217;t know anybody in advertising. This is all something I found out late in life. I always drew and painted and things like that, but I didn&#8217;t think it was attainable. I didn&#8217;t think being an artist was you can make a living off of it. So I would tell myself, just explore those things, like explore what makes me happy without having that fear of am I going to make it in the art world? Just be fearless and explore what makes me happy, basically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Where do you see yourself in the next five years? Like, what&#8217;s the next chapter for Carmelle Kendall?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>I see myself doing more books, having books on the shelves, in stores everywhere, having Neighborly on the shelves in stores everywhere. I see myself just learning new things. I believe that I&#8217;m a student for life, so learning new programs, learning new software. I always just want to stay experimenting with my craft. Hopefully my artwork has evolved in five years. Hopefully it doesn&#8217;t look like it does now. I want to always be continuing to evolve and just being a better artist and designer is what I see for myself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work, about Neighborly? Where can they find that information online?</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, well, they can always go to my website, which is Carmelle.com. The book is called &#8220;Your Freedom, Your Power&#8221;, which is available everywhere books are sold. And then for Neighborly, they can go to neighborlypaper.com and find a list of all the stores that we are in. Or they can just purchase directly from neighborlypaper.com.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, sounds good. Carmelle Kendall, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the know. As I was kind of pulling my research together for this, I kind of always have a thought in my mind about who the person is before I talk to them and what the interview might come to be like. And the main thing I&#8217;m getting from this is like, hometown hero from the a left, did your own thing, came back, you&#8217;ve got this great business, it&#8217;s a fun business, but you&#8217;re also still kind of working in the advertising world as well. And from what I can tell just from talking with you, you&#8217;re keeping it humble. You&#8217;re certainly super proud of the work that you&#8217;ve done and the success that you&#8217;ve accomplished, but you&#8217;re also super humble about it. That&#8217;s a really good quality to have, especially in this world where there&#8217;s just so much like, posturing and clout chasing and all that kind of stuff. I&#8217;m like, I get from you that you are like, the genuine real deal, and I&#8217;m really excited to see where your work goes in the future. So thank you so much for coming on the show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Carmelle Kendall:</b></p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me. Like I said, I&#8217;ve been following you since 2020 when I listened to you on a podcast, so I was very honored.</p>

<p>If you want to be more authentic in your work and life, then this week&#8217;s episode is especially for you. I sat down with Kirk Visola, creative director extraordinaire, and the founder of <a href="https://www.mindthefont.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Mind the Font</a>, a full-service branding and packaging design agency.</p>
<p>We dove right in and I learned about how Kirk approaches design projects while balancing the want for innovation with the need to stay true to a brand&#8217;s established identity. Kirk also spoke about growing up and getting into design and illustration, talked about his podcasting endeavors, and he gave some great advice for aspiring creatives of all stripes. We even nerded out for a bit about comic books and video games! </p>
<p>For Kirk, being himself and sticking to those who encourage and support his creativity has given him a great life, and that&#8217;s a lesson we can all take to heart!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
All right, what&#8217;s up? How you doing, Maurice? Thanks for having me on, man. I&#8217;m Kirk Visola. I&#8217;m the founder and creative director of Mind the Font. It&#8217;s a full service branding and packaging design agency. We try to focus on things in the food and beverage space, mainly CPG, which is consumer products goods. And as much as this sounds like I&#8217;m reading this, I am not. That was off the top of the dome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. How has 2023 been going so far? I know you&#8217;re in California, so y&#8217;all have been getting hammered by the rain.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s not too bad for the most part. I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough, I&#8217;m in Santa Cruz, which is close to Aptos and Capitola, which were both hit pretty heavily on their downtowns, and also SoCal and on the docks, and then next to the ocean. We lost part of our road here, West Cliff, in Santa Cruz, so it&#8217;s been raining pretty heavily. But today it led up and it&#8217;s a beautiful day. That&#8217;s the weather forecast for 2023.</p>
<p>As far as business and just livelihood, I&#8217;m happy to be upright, pushing 50, in my late-forties, and I&#8217;m a Black male in this country and I&#8217;m still alive. So that has to count for something, so I&#8217;m happy about that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I heard that. Amen to that. Let&#8217;s talk about your branding and packaging design agency, Mind the Font. Tell me more about that.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a really, really good question, which is what people always say on podcast, &#8220;Great question,&#8221; because we&#8217;re actually trying to think of a way to answer the question. I&#8217;ve been working in design for a long time. I started in &#8217;98 and I was doing all kinds of things. I was still going to school. I was going to take design classes. And I started working freelance with my wife at the time. And then I was working freelance and I decided to go into the private sector or into corporate sector, however you want to call it. And so starting in 2009, I got a job at Pure Red Creative. If you want to read my resume and when you got off here, that&#8217;s fine too.</p>
<p>But fast forward to 2014, I started working at a company called Shaklee, and it was a great job at the get go. My boss, who&#8217;s still a really good friend, she was very, I&#8217;m trying to think of the best way to put this, very progressive by the means in which people worked. Because I had been freelancing for Lord knows how long, and that was all from my house. It was all via emails when FTP, File Transfer Protocol, first came out, and stuff like that. And I was doing all that stuff and then she left.<br>
No, actually, here&#8217;s what happened. I got absorbed into a different place at the company, and then she left and it just went downhill from there. It was a horrible experience. I guess I can get into that later, but what made me leave was the fact that I couldn&#8217;t handle it anymore. I was stressed out. Half of my face would go numb going into work. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You know what? Fuck this. I&#8217;m going to do my own shit.&#8221;</p>
<p>So my wife and I were on vacation, and I was at the point where I was trying to figure out what I was going to do. And we were in the UK and everything there when you ride on the London Underground is, &#8220;Please, mind the gap.&#8221; It&#8217;s like this repeated person over the intercom saying, &#8220;Please, don&#8217;t forget to mind the gap. Mind the gap.&#8221; And so my wife goes, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just call it Mind the Font?&#8221; And I just was floored. How did I not think of this? How did I not think of this? So I have to credit her with giving me the name for the company.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s just doing stuff I&#8217;ve always done. I&#8217;m really good at what I do, but my main interest and my main focus in regards to design work is branding and packaging. That&#8217;s like my forte. It&#8217;s what I love. And so that&#8217;s what I do at Mind the Font. And clients range from new alcohol products to new baby food products or just food products. And also, I&#8217;m trying to think of stuff I&#8217;ve done, beauty products and perfumes. So we run the gamut on all things that come in a box, and that&#8217;s what Mind the Font does.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious, have you found there to be any sort of big changes in designing for consumer packaged goods over the years?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Oh, absolutely. There&#8217;s always standards that you have to abide by. There are certain things that need to go on packaging that you need to think about. There&#8217;s certain techniques that have evolved over the years, especially in printing. That&#8217;s a big thing. Printing has evolved so much and all of the protocols of companies trying to go greener, and then print companies also keeping up to go greener. The actual programs that you use are advancing, especially with the big AI thing coming out.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve even kind of dabbled with Midjourney. And it&#8217;s weird because people are speaking about how it&#8217;s used to steal their art, but what I&#8217;m doing is I&#8217;m taking art I&#8217;ve done and using that as a prompt to see what it does. So it&#8217;s like my art as a base, but then putting in the prompt is what it does for Midjourney and add texture to this to make it look more like three dimensional. And it does it to my own artwork. So I&#8217;m thinking maybe that&#8217;s something that could possibly be an avenue for people to go.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to replace designers. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to replace artists. But I do think that it&#8217;s a means of weeding out the bad designers and good designers. Like when there was a big real estate boom, there were tons of real estate agents and a lot of them went away, but the ones that were really good at what they did, they&#8217;re still there.</p>
<p>And so there&#8217;s programs that are advancing, and there&#8217;s also different mediums to go about. When I first started, it was basically web and print. This is the late &#8217;90s. There was no real social media. Maybe Facebook started coming out and other things. And all of a sudden, next thing you know, there&#8217;s UX designers, product designers, UI designers, web designers, and there&#8217;s print designers, social media managers, social media content creators. There&#8217;s like this wide gamut of things that people can do now. And so it&#8217;s just advanced with all the stuff that&#8217;s coming out.</p>
<p>And for me, it&#8217;s just too much to keep up with from that standpoint. But in my own field, which is why I specified branding and packaging, it&#8217;s like I feel very comfortable there. And I&#8217;m always trying to learn. I&#8217;m always talking with people. I&#8217;m always getting new ideas and figuring out new ways to handle things and bouncing ideas off of people to see what they think. I have a trusted group of friends who are phenomenal designers I talk to. It&#8217;s always good to do that, man. And so I think I&#8217;m keeping up that way, so I&#8217;m doing all right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s so interesting you mentioned that about Midjourney. I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of playing around with ChatGPT, which is another sort of AI generated tool. Midjourney is more for visuals. I think ChatGPT is more text based. And it&#8217;s funny, I was talking about this with my mentor and we kind of both came to the conclusion that these kinds of tools, they almost feel like you&#8217;re working with a really good intern. They&#8217;re not going to be specific enough to be an artisan or a master and expert at it, but they can get pretty good.</p>
<p>Like how you&#8217;re mentioning with Midjourney, how you feed your own art into it. I&#8217;ve been doing that with ChatGPT, hopefully listeners don&#8217;t get mad at this, but I&#8217;ve been feeding in some past episodes and generates 20 questions based off the transcript of this interview.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it&#8217;ll put the questions out. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, this is pretty good.&#8221; They&#8217;re not perfect, but it&#8217;s a good jumping off point for me to say, okay, &#8220;I can take this out. I can change the words here. I can do that.&#8221; I&#8217;ve even, not for this interview, just to be clear, but I did do it for one interview. I had ChatGPT. I fed them this person&#8217;s bio and said, &#8220;Generate 20 questions as if you&#8217;re doing an in-depth, one hour podcast interview.&#8221; And I knew some of them. Some of them were good, some of them were not. But some of them I was like, &#8220;Okay, this is promising.&#8221; It&#8217;s promising.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
&#8220;If you had a breakfast cereal that you would like to eat, what would it be?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. And with ChatGPT it&#8217;s so interesting because you can even tell it certain books, books that I haven&#8217;t necessarily read, but I could say, &#8220;Give me a 10 point summary of this book by this person.&#8221; And it&#8217;s the best kind of Cliff Notes in a way. I know that there are educators that are like, &#8220;Oh, we got to ban this shit. We can&#8217;t have this in the classroom.&#8221; Because some of this stuff is too&#8230; I don&#8217;t even want to say it&#8217;s necessarily too good, but it&#8217;ll get you there. It&#8217;s not the best, but it&#8217;ll get you there. It&#8217;s good enough.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Right. Here&#8217;s the thing with that, twofold. One, there are actually programs where you can put in someone&#8217;s work or a written book from what I&#8217;m reading, like their actual essay or whatever they&#8217;ve written, and you can plug it into the internet somewhere and decipher if it was written by them or if it was generated by AI. There&#8217;s some type of thing that does that. And two, just because it&#8217;s written by someone doesn&#8217;t necessarily educate them or make them a better writer.</p>
<p>My biggest fear and problem is that all AI is doing is taking stuff we&#8217;ve already done and rehashing it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
And right now the focus is on speed. The focus is on, &#8220;Oh, look how quickly I can do this.&#8221; What if people just stopped making art? What would we be able to choose from? It would have to go back and it&#8217;s just going to repeat the same thing. And the next thing you know, everything is going to start looking the same.</p>
<p>And I noticed that when I put in a prompt in AI, it gives you four images in Midjourney. And the images, they usually have the same colors when you do it, and the type isn&#8217;t right, which is something that&#8217;s going to work through, I&#8217;m sure, but it&#8217;s always relatively the same. And I&#8217;m thinking to myself, &#8220;Man, how can you just sit there and do something up real quick and then use that as your work?&#8221; No.</p>
<p>I can see that what you&#8217;re saying, as a jumping off point or a starting point. It&#8217;s great for that. &#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t have thought of doing that shape.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t have thought of using that pattern or color. Let me build off of that.&#8221; But to just use it as your work? I don&#8217;t know, man. I can&#8217;t fuck with it.</p>
<p>And the other thing too is there&#8217;s been tons of programs that have come out that were supposed to &#8220;destroy&#8221; the art industry and make art more hard for people to get into. Like Canva. Canva came out and you can do your own design work. And it hasn&#8217;t gotten rid of designers. Motion pictures, telephones, the car, everything else is coming out. The only thing I can really say that really hurt people was Netflix. Blockbuster got destroyed.</p>
<p>When there&#8217;s some type of disruption in a field, it&#8217;s good because it forces people to progress. But with the progression, you don&#8217;t want to regress in regards to art and creating art or thought processes. And I think that&#8217;s so critical for any type of field is to have a thought process, is to have some type of critical thinking in regards to what you&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think that&#8217;s being lost with AI because it&#8217;s just pulling from art. It&#8217;s pulling from our shit to create more to shit give back to you. It&#8217;s literally plagiarizing everything that it&#8217;s doing. There&#8217;s no other way around it. People say, &#8220;Oh, well, it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s this, it&#8217;s that. This is the future.&#8221; It&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s plagiarizing. It maybe the future, but it&#8217;s plagiarizing. It&#8217;s literally stealing everything we&#8217;ve already done to recreate something.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s weird. But anyway, enough of that.<br>
But like you said, the art styles do kind of end up looking the same in some instances. And I&#8217;ve heard that argument too from designers and artists that are like, &#8220;Well, this is going to take over my job,&#8221; or something like this. But if someone comes to you, say, a client comes to you and they want you to do some changes or do some design based off AI artwork, you can always just say no. You can say, &#8220;You know what? I don&#8217;t work with that. I&#8217;m not going to work with that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Right. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, binary, non-binary folk, thank you for coming to our AI chat.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you approach a new design project?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Carefully. It&#8217;s interesting because there&#8217;s so many ways to approach a new design project, and it&#8217;s so broad. But I&#8217;ll try to paraphrase and not be as wordy as actually giving you this explanation as to how I&#8217;m not going to be wordy. You get a brief usually of what someone wants to do as far as a design goes. That way the brief&#8217;s more entailed, rather than just saying, &#8220;Just do something and I&#8217;ll let you know when I like it.&#8221; Sorry, I don&#8217;t work that way. And if I am going to work that way, you&#8217;re going to be paying a lot of money for it because I&#8217;m not going to do it for free.</p>
<p>So the way I approach a project is to see exactly what the person wants, see what they have, if they have anything, and then what I&#8217;d like to do, and this is old school, I go pencil and paper, pen and paper, and I just sketch. I sketch and I fill up sheets and sheets of paper with just sketches and ideas and thoughts. And maybe this will work, maybe that won&#8217;t work. And to me, it&#8217;s the best tool you have. It&#8217;s quick and it doesn&#8217;t break. It doesn&#8217;t break down. You can&#8217;t lose files unless you throw it away.</p>
<p>And once I get to a spot where I think it works, I then start going digital, if it&#8217;s supposed to be digital, and I bring it into the computer. This is the way I describe it: Whatever I&#8217;m doing, whatever I&#8217;m making, I do &#8220;high quality comps,&#8221; meaning that I will do something in a manner to where it feels real and looks real, just to give the person who&#8217;s on the other end a better idea of what&#8217;s to come. Like, &#8220;Hey, here are the concepts and here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I explain each concept and I put it into a different bucket or theme. And I explain why it works in this theme. I explain why it works for their business, and I explain how it&#8217;ll work in the space, whatever space they&#8217;re going into, just so they know that I&#8217;m not just doing something because it looks pretty. And I think that&#8217;s important.</p>
<p>Oftentimes people do stuff because it looks pretty, rather than serve as being functional. Being pretty, that shouldn&#8217;t even be in the vocabulary. That shouldn&#8217;t even be a thought. Of course, you&#8217;re going to do something that looks nice, that&#8217;s a given, but does it fit within what you&#8217;re trying to achieve, which is in that certain niche, in that certain area? What are you trying to achieve by making this product? Are you doing what&#8217;s best for the client?</p>
<p>And so I try to approach initially with gathering information with them as much as I can, seeing where it needs to go, wherever space they&#8217;re into, sketch, go digital, put together a thoughtful presentation as far as why I was doing things a certain way and why it will benefit them, and then get feedback and move forward and see how that works.</p>
<p>And honestly, this is a interesting conversation, but I&#8217;ve been doing this for, oh my God, a long time. &#8217;98. So, holy shit. 25 years? Is that right? Is my math right? 25 years? No. &#8220;Was he that old?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds about right.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Oh my God, that is&#8230; Wow. Okay, cool. The point was&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You blew your own mind there.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
I got a lot of my sensibility, I&#8217;ve been doing this so long. The point is I&#8217;ve had maybe six or seven clients in that time who were just disappointed with what I did. And so to me, it makes me feel like, all right, I&#8217;m doing something right, because if I wasn&#8217;t, the list would be a lot longer.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m also realizing too, this is something very important for people who are starting out and doing any type of art or any type of media that is subjective, anything that visually captures your eye, to be judged is subjective, so art, video games, design, packaging, clothing. Whatever is visually perceived is subjective. And that is fact.</p>
<p>So when you&#8217;re designing something, you have to remember that if someone doesn&#8217;t like your work, it&#8217;s subjective. It doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t like you. It doesn&#8217;t mean that your work&#8217;s bad. It&#8217;s just subjective and it doesn&#8217;t fit their taste, or it doesn&#8217;t fit their style. It&#8217;s not on you to make the client like your work, it&#8217;s on you to deliver what&#8217;s best for your client. That&#8217;s your job as a artist, as a designer, as a game developer, you deliver what&#8217;s best. And if they like it, great. If they don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s not personal. So that&#8217;s how you have to view things moving forward.</p>
<p>And I just, man, I&#8217;ve been doing this for 25 years. I&#8217;m so old. But I just realized this a couple years ago, and because my wife told me. She&#8217;s so smart. She said, &#8220;You know what, Kirk? It&#8217;s not they don&#8217;t like you, it&#8217;s just they didn&#8217;t like your design.&#8221; Like, mind blown. Like, &#8220;Damn, you&#8217;re so right.&#8221; For everybody who&#8217;s starting out or who is in the crux of it every day grinding, just remember that it&#8217;s not you, hopefully your work doesn&#8217;t suck, it&#8217;s subjective. That&#8217;s what they&#8217;re judging: your work, not you. So there we go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a great piece of advice, I think, for even folks that have been in the game for a long time. That&#8217;s a good piece of advice to know.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Yeah, and it took my wife, she&#8217;s so wise, to tell me that. Because here&#8217;s the thing, we&#8217;re all emotional creatures. And as designers and as artists, we&#8217;re all a bit egotistical. I&#8217;ll admit it. I am. And when you hear a fresh perspective from somebody and you remove the emotion and you remove the subjectivity, and you look at it objectively, you&#8217;re able to say, &#8220;Oh, well, you&#8217;re right.&#8221; Because everything that you do in the visual world is subjective. So there you go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There you go.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So how do you kind of balance the business side of everything, like the marketing, the finances, the contracts, how do you balance that with the creative aspects of your work?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m still trying to figure that out. The business side of things will work itself out. I do what I&#8217;m supposed to do to get paid. I do what I want to do to stay fresh. So I will do the jobs I have to do and depending on what it is, if it&#8217;s a fun job like branding or packaging, that&#8217;s where I can explore. Sometimes you have to do things like marketing pieces or flyers or graphics for a social media post or design a booth or design a shit-talker for whatever.</p>
<p>And so there&#8217;s just various little things that go into branding and marketing, or whatever, that need to be done and it&#8217;s just more of a production artist or more just a getting it done aspect rather than actually creating things. So for me, what I do if I&#8217;m stuck or want to stay fresh or creative is I draw. I haven&#8217;t been drawing enough. So I try to draw. I do writing, and I try to make up stories and make up characters.</p>
<p>And I also like to play video games. Now, this sounds silly, but video games unlock a lot of creativity for me. And the biggest reason as to why is because my brain literally has to shut off because it has to focus on the game I&#8217;m playing. Like everything else is shut out and so my mind quiets. And when my mind is able to quiet, it actually has a better time thinking. So oftentimes I&#8217;ll play a game for, I don&#8217;t know, 30, 45 minutes, and I&#8217;ll stop playing and be like, &#8220;Oh, damn, I just had an idea,&#8221; because it makes me refocus. And so whatever the idea is, I try to go with it.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the other thing too, is if you have an idea &#8212; and I have several because of the ADHD &#8212; if you have an idea, just start it. Just do it. Just get it out of your head, whatever it is. If you want to paint something, if you want to draw something, if you want to write something, if you want to come up with an idea for a game, if you want to think of an idea for a cocktail you like or a coffee drink, or even a puzzle that you want to do, just do it. I mean, take some time and just do stuff for you. Always mind your deadlines, but also make sure that you do stuff to stimulate you. I always tell people I&#8217;m a very creative person, but my medium of earning for my creativity has always been design.</p>
<p>And growing up, I loved reading comic books. This is in my bio, but growing up, I loved reading comic books. I loved all things comics. I would draw, I would pretend I was a comic book hero. I would make up stories. I would watch Star Wars. I would watch everything. And the one thing I did with comics was I copied how they looked. I would copy the lettering, I would make up my own lettering, I would make up my own stories. And all of that is all design. If you look at a comic book, people are like, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s just a comic book.&#8221; The amount of vocabulary used in those as well as the form and the pictures and the settings and everything else, it really enhances readers, because you get engaged with it. And also, it gives you lessons in layout, and it gives you lessons in hierarchy, in form, in structure and the way things should look on a page with composition.</p>
<p>So, all of that led into what I&#8217;m doing, and I think that people need to realize that you can find creativity in anything, but I think you need to love what you&#8217;re doing in order to do so. You can be creative in any way you want. If you have an idea or whatever, just get it done. And I know I&#8217;m talking too much, so I&#8217;m going to shut up now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, tell me more about these video games. What are you playing?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Oh. See, now we got on a real topic. First of all, let me preface this by saying I&#8217;m older, so we&#8217;re the generation that grew up playing games. We were the generation that had&#8230; And television and the Commodore 64 and Apple and playing Oregon Trail on Atari 2600 and the first Sega and the Sega Genesis and Nintendo 8-bit, and then went to the Super Nintendo. So all this stuff we grew up with. So I love games. I&#8217;ve always loved video games and I just got a PlayStation 5 about six or seven months ago and I just never played it. I thought, &#8220;Why am I not playing it?&#8221; So I broke out Miles Morales and I played that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
I played through it. And then I&#8217;m like, &#8220;All right. Let me try God of War.&#8221; Started it. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I have to dedicate time to this and I don&#8217;t have time.&#8221; The first God of War, Greatest Hits, of course, because it&#8217;s been out forever. I played through that, finished it, and I got Ragnar√∂k, played through that, finished it. Then I replayed Tomb Raider, which Tomb Raider was it? Finished it. Started playing a Ratchet &#038; Clank, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Ah. I can&#8217;t fuck with this.&#8221; It&#8217;s too happy for me. I need to kill people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s not bad to say, that&#8217;s a video game, right?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Oh. This is some crazy shit. So you heard about Jaguar going off, right? She&#8217;s an artist, R&#038;B artist. I can&#8217;t think of her last name, but she&#8217;s &#8220;exposed&#8221;.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
So she&#8217;s talking about things in just really&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s spilling the T or borderline snitching. I&#8217;m not sure which one it is, because sometimes it&#8217;s like she&#8217;s spilling the T on bad things. And sometimes she&#8217;s just snitching thinking, &#8220;Girl, speak your mind. Do what you want to do, but people are going to come at you one way or another.&#8221; But the one thing she said that really bothered me that went back to white racist senators was talking about&#8230; I don&#8217;t blame any of people doing the one thing I don&#8217;t like is GTA six or GTA. GTA is a terrible game. I mean, you sit there and you sit there and you kill people. You do this stuff and do that stuff. And then what&#8217;s going to make you change and do it in real life? What&#8217;s going to make you think you can&#8217;t do it in real life? It&#8217;s like, I can play Uncharted. I can play Max Payne 3, Tomb Raider, Last of Us.</p>
<p>I can play violent video games and never kill anybody or have it come across my mind because I have the ability to separate reality from fantasy. So you can&#8217;t say that someone playing a video game in fracks on their life. I&#8217;m not going to be Spider-Man, I&#8217;m not going to be Batman. It&#8217;s a ridiculous notion. Rather than talking about the environment in which they grow up and the violence that they&#8217;re exposed to outside of their house, and the systemic and cyclical poverty that they&#8217;re exposed to on a day by day basis, especially in poor areas and ghetto&#8230; [inaudible 00:29:01] even say ghetto. That&#8217;s terrible.</p>
<p>Poor areas of black and brown people. You have to think about that before you say it&#8217;s the video game&#8217;s fault. It&#8217;s a silly notion. But anyway, back to video games, I really have to dedicate an hour at a time because I just get swapped in. And once I&#8217;m in a game, if I&#8217;m into it, I got to finish it. It&#8217;s like, I know I can&#8217;t get into it again, because I know I have to finish it. It&#8217;s going to be a big chunk of my time. It&#8217;s going to be a lot of stuff that I do. So that&#8217;s the other problem. But it really does help me shut off. And it&#8217;s a nice stress reliever just thinking about the pattern of the boss that you&#8217;re fighting. Okay, he&#8217;s going to do this, which means I got to dodge which means I got to throw this. It&#8217;s like, so there&#8217;s always a pattern and there&#8217;s always something you can figure out in a video game. That&#8217;s what I like about it. Do you play games?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. Oh yeah. I have a Switch. I have a PS5. It&#8217;s funny, I&#8217;m not a big PlayStation person, but then I look back and I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve actually owned every PlayStation console, even the handheld.&#8221; Even though I haven&#8217;t really played them a lot. I had a PlayStation one when I was in middle school, high school. I played the hell out my PS2. I had the big chunky PS3 that could do backwards compatibility. My PS4 is in my closet. I just got a PS5 last year. And I have a Switch. I have one of the first&#8230; When they came out five years ago or whatever, I&#8217;ve got a Switch. Oh yeah. I&#8217;m a big gamer. Well, let me take that back. I feel like I&#8217;m more of a game collector slash enthusiast because I don&#8217;t play as much as I used to. I&#8217;ve started recently, I guess you could call it a resolution this year. I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to start playing more games this year.&#8221; Because my switch is literally right next to my desk. And I got one of those little&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called a ShadowCast. A Genki ShadowCast, where you can basically connect your Switch or your Xbox or PlayStation, whatever, to any HDMI input. And so I have HDMI on my main computer, which is a gaming PC. So I have my Switch hooked up to my PC, so now I can just have it in another window. Because I have a ultra wide screen monitor. I just have another window and I&#8217;ll play a little Animal Crossing or play some&#8230; I play a lot of play Picross, which I started playing when I was in high school. I think Picross is this Japanese&#8230; It&#8217;s sort of like a crossword puzzle, but you make out a picture instead of doing words. Although I do really crossword puzzles too. And there&#8217;s this company called Jupiter that just keeps cranking out Picross games every six months. There&#8217;s like a new Picross game. So I had all the ones on the Nintendo 3DS Picross E, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, E7.</p>
<p>And now the ones on Switch are Picross S for Switch. So now I&#8217;m currently playing my way through Picross S8. And it&#8217;s very much one of those things where&#8230; Yeah. I can just kind of turn my brain off because I&#8217;ve played it so much that I already know, my hands and brain already know what the controls are to do the things, so I don&#8217;t have to think about it. And it&#8217;s such good&#8230; I actually block out three hours on my calendar at the end of Friday, just to play that. Not all three hours, but I&#8217;ll play it through some of those three hours just to sort of defrag my brain from the week. Like, &#8220;Okay. This is good.&#8221; Calm down time. Turn the phone off. Yeah. [inaudible 00:32:39] games we played with more recent, Kirk. Thanks for tuning in.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Yeah. Man. You mentioned the PS. And there&#8217;s a game that I just&#8230; Honestly, man, it still blows my mind even going back and playing it. It is Metal Gear Solid on the PS. And [inaudible 00:33:00] was at Konami for a long time and he owned&#8230; And he&#8217;s the guy that invented&#8230; He&#8217;s basically the dude that solidified, invented action adventure games. Without him, there wouldn&#8217;t be a Resident Evil. I mean, without him, there wouldn&#8217;t be any of those games, because he invented the idea of sneaking around and figuring about puzzles and collectively trying to collect goods and stay as&#8230; It&#8217;s just brilliant. And you go back and play and it still holds up. This still holds up. The graphics are not great at all, especially on a nice TV. But man, the story play and the cut scenes&#8230; Cut scenes became a thing then it&#8217;s just, oh. Anyway. All right. I know [inaudible 00:33:43] let&#8217;s finish your interview. Shall we?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to go more into your origin story. You&#8217;ve kind of already touched on really being into comics and video games. Tell me more about growing up.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
I grew up in a small town called Modesto, California. And I know you grew up&#8230; We touched about this before we started the podcast. You grew up in Selma, and just because people get a Black president or you live in a certain area, doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that racism goes away. And growing up in an ag heavy city like Modesto, it was very different, for lack of a better term. And I played soccer, I played sports. I had three older brothers. But the one thing I really loved to do was read comics. I mean, let me mention that before, I loved reading comics and I never thought there was an avenue for it. I wanted to be a doctor or a firefighter.</p>
<p>And it wasn&#8217;t until I met my ex-wife that I knew about graphic design. And damn. This was in &#8217;98. I basically started doing design when I first learned about it, just because I was so intrigued by it. Her father, my father outlaw was the head of the creative services department in Modesto, called E&#038;J Gallo Winery. And he was the head there and literally known in very, very wide spaces, especially in the beverage, in wine and spirit space, because of the work he had done. He had been doing it since the sixties, and he invented the E&#038;J brandy bottle, and he invented the New Amsterdam vodka bottle, the shapes. So if you look at those, those are very iconic. So he would sit there and he took me under his wing basically, and told me about design.</p>
<p>So from there, I was intrigued and I started taking classes at the local JC and I went to classes at San Jose State. And the one thing that was very bothersome to me was being accessibility to take more classes there, because at the time before they made it into a BFA, Bachelor of Fine Arts, it was just a BA, you had to qualify for their design program. And I quote-unquote wasn&#8217;t good enough to qualify for their program. And I remember sitting there thinking, looking at designs and critiquing designs, and I found what I was good at. I just understood design, I understood it spoke to me, and it was like I was the duck. I was the duck who had been sitting at the office desk that finally found out that there was water outside and he could fly.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how I felt, right? And from there, I was just able to have mentor. A mentor was the best in the world at doing something and run ideas by him. I still talk to him. I just talked to him three or four days ago. I mean, he&#8217;s my father outlaw, but I still talk to him to get advice and stuff like that. So I look back at that experience and look back at my life, and I just think of all the obstacles that were there that I have no idea how I would&#8217;ve found this job had I not been where I was. I mean, I&#8217;m in Modesto. Modesto&#8217;s known for Scott Peterson, George Lucas, Gallo Wine. Those are our three major claims of fame. And it&#8217;s just a small town. It&#8217;s not a small town. It&#8217;s fairly decent sized town in the Central Valley where it&#8217;s not heavily populated by Black people. There are tons of Latinos, predominantly Mexican, that work on the area there.</p>
<p>But I had no idea what graphic design was or that it was even a possibility. And I still wouldn&#8217;t have had an idea had I not met my ex, I would not be doing what I&#8217;m doing. It&#8217;s all the things that had to happen in order for me to be able to do this is just&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, man. It&#8217;s luck. There&#8217;s no other way to put it. And I&#8217;m not religious. I can&#8217;t be, I guess spiritual, but I don&#8217;t believe in going to church and everything else. I do believe in karma, and I think that my karma was to be a designer. It just was just happened. So I got lucky man. And I started doing design work from there. Worked freelance for a while when I had my kid in 2000. And then see here, in 2009, I started working in the office I was telling you about. And then from there on out, just did design work. And here I am.</p>
<p>And I think the experiences I had and the wide range of dabbling in different designs, being me a better designer, but also having that foundation of the fantastical world of comic books and video games also helped. It just led to this path for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, it sounds like it was also kind of just this constant sense of inspiration too, for you.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Yeah. No doubt. I mean, I can&#8217;t doubt that. I mean, my profile pick on my LinkedIn is me holding a Batman cup, taking a sip. My signature, my professional signature, my actual signature is the bat simple. It&#8217;s on my passport, it&#8217;s on my license. It&#8217;s like that&#8217;s my legit signature. It&#8217;s just kind of part of me. I have on my sloppy ass desk, I have a couple of Grogu figurines, a Boba Fett Star Wars lamp. I have Batman behind me. I&#8217;m just surrounded by it. So it&#8217;s always influencing me and always has. And I&#8217;m thankful I found a career that kind of lets me create.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you were already a working designer when you were studying at San Jose State. How did you balance school and work?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Honestly, I don&#8217;t know. I had a kid at home, young kid, and I was working part-time as well. As well as going to school and having a job, freelancing. I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m not saying that to&#8230; Because I&#8217;m doing a brag or I&#8217;m self glossing. I&#8217;m saying it because, I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s all a blur, basically. From 2000 until 2010 is all a blur for me. During that time, I had gotten married in &#8217;99, and then had our first kid in 2000. And then a set of twins in 2003, my father passed away that year, and then my brother passed away. Or sorry, he didn&#8217;t pass away. He was murdered in jail by cops in 2009. And then 2010, I moved from Modesto. Honestly, dude, that whole decade&#8217;s kind of a blur. So you know how you do things in the moment and you go back and you say, &#8220;How did I do that?&#8221; That&#8217;s the moment for me.</p>
<p>Because my ex was laid up in bed when my twins were born, and so I was taking care of the newborn twins. A three-year-old or soon to be three-year old kid. And then my ex. So the resiliency of the human spirit is truly amazing when it&#8217;s put to the test. You can do a lot. When you set your mind to do something, you really can do a lot. And I had to do it. There was no choice. So that&#8217;s what I remember. I&#8217;m sorry, I can&#8217;t answer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, that&#8217;s real. I think about&#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s necessarily a blank spot, but it&#8217;s definitely a blur. I remember vignettes of things from 2000 to maybe 2006. That&#8217;s my blurry period because I was in college and I remember certain things. I remember where I interned at. I remember getting my first apartment. I remember graduating. I remember graduating because they had the graduation outside in the middle of a thunderstorm. And the person sitting next to me would not share their umbrella with me. So I kept trying to scooch under the umbrella, and they kept moving it back. So how umbrellas are curved. So the water just wow came down. And I had this sad droopy mortar board when I went to go get my degree. I remember vignettes and things, because I know during that time I was working a bunch of jobs and I hated&#8230; I get what you&#8217;re saying. I get what you&#8217;re saying.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&#8217;re so in it that you don&#8217;t really remember the&#8230; You don&#8217;t remember it. Yeah. You were there. But you don&#8217;t have full recall of that time. I even have a pop culture blind spot from 2000 to 2006 or so. People will mention movies and TV, and I&#8217;m like, I kind of know what that is. People will mention stuff about SpongeBob and Harry Potter. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m familiar with it in the cultural zeitgeist.&#8221; But I don&#8217;t really recall being into that because I was in my twenties and just trying to survive. I don&#8217;t really remember it.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Most artists or some artists have a blue period. We had a blurry period. But honestly, man, this is kind of sad but true that more than likely it&#8217;s just severe trauma that we&#8217;ve suffered at that time. And neither one of us know how to deal with it or even comprehend.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And I say it was a blind spot because I had&#8230; And I&#8217;ll ask you about what your time was like at Shaklee, but I know I was working at&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve even mentioned this on the podcast before. I was working at Autotrader as a&#8230; I think I was a dealer concierge or something. I was trying to work my way up to something higher paying or whatever. And at the time, I was also a blogger. I won&#8217;t mention what my blog name was, but I had a blog and I was talking about other stuff. And I never used anyone&#8217;s name. Everyone had a pseudonym or whatever, but they found out about it at work. And they had called me into the office. And they had printed out reams of my blog, which honestly was a little flattered because I fancied myself a writer.</p>
<p>I wrote all through high school and college and stuff. And so I was like, &#8220;Oh, for me?&#8221; I was kind of bit taken and they&#8217;re pointing out stuff that they&#8217;ve highlighted. And then I remembered, I was like, &#8220;How did they find out about this?&#8221; Because I never did it from work. And then I remembered that there was someone at work that I told about it. And that could have been the only way that they found out about it.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Snitch.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Snitch end up in ditches as Paul Bettany said.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so they tried to fire me and I quit before they fired me. And then I remember I was going home that evening. And I was on the phone with my mom, and she was just like, &#8220;What are you going to do with your life? You got this degree, you don&#8217;t want to do this, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.&#8221; And I applied to this job in the back of our [inaudible 00:45:10] weekly here called Creative Loafing. I applied to a electronic media specialist gig. That was where the start of my professional design career actually was doing work for the state of Georgia. But that job was so bad. Oh my God. At the time, I thought I was living large. I was 25, I think? 24, 25, had my own office, had cards. I mean, you wouldn&#8217;t get this shit nowadays because of the way that the industry is.</p>
<p>But I had my own office. I had cards with a door that I could close, and I thought, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m doing pretty good.&#8221; But then there was also all this at the time, this sort of pervading narrative that I kept hearing from people. &#8220;Well, you just have a bachelor&#8217;s degree. Well, the bachelor&#8217;s degree is a new high school diploma. If you really want to get far, you have to get a master&#8217;s degree.&#8221; And I&#8217;m just like, Ugh. And so I was trying to get my master&#8217;s degree at that time and my boss was just the worst. I&#8217;m not going to slander her on this podcast, but she was just a very bad boss to the point where we had to get mediation from the state to come in. And it concluded with me just leaving. I just had to leave. I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to stay here with her any longer.&#8221; It&#8217;s just not going to work out.</p>
<p>So that whole period is kind of a bit of a blur, because I was like, look, I&#8217;m just trying to survive. And also at that time, I had just started my first big design project, which was the Black Weblog Awards. I was working full time, I was doing that, and I was just trying to survive because I didn&#8217;t go to design school. So I didn&#8217;t have any sort of design knowledge of anything. All I had was Photoshop, blends that I made, because I downloaded a cracked version from LimeWire and it didn&#8217;t put a virus on my computer. And I was copying tutorials from books that I&#8230; That I didn&#8217;t buy from books that I just read in Barnes and Noble. And I either took notes or I took pictures with my little Olympus point and shoot camera and took them back to my apartment and was like, &#8220;Okay, so how do I do this?&#8221; So I had to teach myself how to do all this stuff. I was just trying to get by, man. I was trying to make it so I get that blurry period. A hundred percent.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s life. I mean, it&#8217;s one of those things too, because being older and you talking about just reading something, reading up on something and figuring it out, it&#8217;s like, if I really wanted to, I could do that now, but I don&#8217;t want to. I don&#8217;t [inaudible 00:47:42]. I just want to learn TikTok. And I mean, I don&#8217;t want to get on there and start doing stuff. It&#8217;s not hard. I don&#8217;t want to do it. And I don&#8217;t think that the younger generation, they think that we&#8217;re old and we don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;What the fuck. We&#8217;re the ones that invented this shit. We were the ones who were going on Napster and Limewire and everything else to try to figure out how to get stuff.&#8221; That was us. We were the ones who&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Everything else to try to figure out how to get stuff like that was us. We were the ones who saw things go from landlines to mobile phones. We saw it go from VCRs to downloadable HDX files. We&#8217;re the ones that saw that. We&#8217;re the ones that saw the transition. We were the ones that evolved with it. If the apocalypse happened, like the zombie apocalypse happened, have you seen The Last of Us yet?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I haven&#8217;t seen it yet, the first episode.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Have you played the game by chance?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I haven&#8217;t played the game, so that&#8217;s why I haven&#8217;t seen it yet because I don&#8217;t know if I need to play the game to watch the show.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
No, you don&#8217;t, but it&#8217;s just shitty because you can see stuff coming and it&#8217;s just like&#8230; but it&#8217;s so well done. It&#8217;s so well done, but what I&#8217;m thinking is if we were to go back into the zombie apocalypse, and everything had to go back before there was all this technology and digital and everything else, many of us wouldn&#8217;t survive. Many of us wouldn&#8217;t know how to take notes or to do basic things because we&#8217;re so dependent upon electricity, and power, and the internet because I&#8217;m thinking we are in Santa Cruz and the electricity went out and it&#8217;s just pitch black. I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;If it stayed this way, could any of us really figure out how to survive? How long would it be before we started going into full on the Walking Dead Kegan mode? How would that take?&#8221;</p>
<p>And so I think that we would immediately have some better survival skills in the previous generation, but I just don&#8217;t feel like going through that mess, and so hearing you go in and say, &#8220;I read this and read up on it and figured out,&#8221; I&#8217;m like, see, that&#8217;s baller status right there, and I think that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m happy I don&#8217;t have to do, even though I probably should in order to keep up with things, but what are we talking about again?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;re talking about you. We&#8217;re talking about you.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I wanted to ask about your podcasting. I mean, we&#8217;re on a podcast, but you are a pretty prolific podcaster yourself. What made you get into it?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Wow. First of all, I don&#8217;t listen to podcasts. I don&#8217;t even listen to my podcasts except when I&#8217;m editing them. It&#8217;s very odd. I know, but I find them to be a bit pretentious at times. I feel like, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s always so formulated,&#8221; so I feel that way about podcasting, but what made me get into it was, and I&#8217;m so glad you said when we started this, it&#8217;s just going to be a conversation because that&#8217;s what got me into this, was listening to talk radio, and being 13 or 14 years old, I was exposed to talk radio and I was exposed to &#8220;shock jocks.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t listen to a lot of NPR, things like that. I listened to the Don and Mike show. They were out of WJFK in Washington DC. They were syndicated, and I listened to Howard , and I listened to a show called Mark and Bryan.</p>
<p>I listened to this show called The Rise Guys out of Sacramento at KHDK, and then I listened to Carmichael Dave out of KHDK, and then Jim Rome, so I listened to a lot of talk shows, and what I learned is that most of the times when they were doing things and talking, it was just the stream of consciousness. It was just the thought. It was just four guys hanging out, but they made it interesting and they knew how to pivot, and they knew how to keep the topics going. They knew how to really get through things, and there&#8217;s a lot of stuff that they would mention, and say, and do, and just the feel of the show was like you were there hanging out with them, and I really like that about talking. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, I want to bring that to a podcast,&#8221; because I try listening into podcasts and it&#8217;s so boring.</p>
<p>And I want to just bring that to a podcast. I want two guys who understand design, and my good friend Andy Kurtts, K-U-R-T-T-S, Andy is, that&#8217;s my dude. He is so cool, man. He&#8217;s cool. He always knows what to say, and he&#8217;s a good designer, and I love the guy, and it&#8217;s like, I couldn&#8217;t do this design show with anyone else really, and I met him on a whim when I was doing something with startup CPG, which is a foundation that helps up-and-coming CPG brands, and we were both on a Pictionary thing, and that&#8217;s how I met him. We just did this online Pictionary during a holiday party, and like, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s do some stuff,&#8221; so we started doing stuff on Clubhouse, and then we started doing stuff finally on Buzz Sprout, I think it&#8217;s called, where you just do podcasts.</p>
<p>And so our idea was let&#8217;s just do a packaging podcast, so we go on to talk about all the specifics of packaging, what&#8217;s important to put on the front of the pack? What&#8217;s important to put on the back of the pack? Do you know about your nutritional labels? Do you know about all the contents that go in? And then we started having people on, and we would have people who actually worked in the industry who owned their own brands, rather designers, and then we realized that it went past that, and we just started talking about design, strictly about design, and that&#8217;s how I got into it with Andy, and we have people on every week, and it&#8217;s just grown into this fun little sit down and chat with people, and I love it. I love that aspect of it.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the old talk radio I used to listen to, but now I&#8217;m actually doing, and only have to do it for an hour instead of three or four. I don&#8217;t know how those people do that. That&#8217;s so impressive. Three or four hours on the air just talking and talking. I hate hearing myself talk, and which is why I probably don&#8217;t listen to my own podcasts, but that&#8217;s one thing, and then I did another one called Jerks with my friend Jeremy Smith, and I had to stop that one just because I was doing two a week, and when we did Jerks, it was mainly, it was an honest approach to things, but I felt it took a lot of me emotionally and to do the edits because we were talking about real shit, and then I have to the edits and things like that, and it was just like a lot, and I said, &#8220;I have to cut one out,&#8221; and I thought, &#8220;which one&#8217;s going to be better beneficial to me as far as my business goes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And as far as really promoting that,&#8221; it had to be Kirk and Kurtts, but Jeremy and I would get on and we&#8217;d talk about shows we watch, we&#8217;d talk about laws that were made. We&#8217;d talk about people that were doing stupid shit, and it would be Donald Trump or Kanye West or whatever was the topic that week we would talk about, and it was good, but it just took so much from me, and I wanted to get back into my own podcast because what I was doing was just having anybody on and talking to them about what they liked, talking about stuff that I liked, but then I&#8217;m realizing it&#8217;s just so much work and I just am not willing to put in that work. Whereas if I&#8217;m doing it with Andy, it&#8217;s twofold.</p>
<p>I get a chat with Andy and we get a catch up on work and we get a catch up on life, and then the other thing is that it holds me accountable that someone else is dependent upon me to actually do my shit, so that&#8217;s the thing, and it&#8217;s not as emotionally draining as Jerks was because it was frustrating, uplifting, happy, and sad. It was just this bag of bittersweet, mixed emotion the entire time, so it was very taxing, and I love Journey Man. Dude&#8217;s cool. I still keep in touch with them. Really nice guy, really great guy, but it was just a little too much for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
What made you get in the podcasting?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve done this for a long-ass time.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
The OG.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What made me get into podcasting? I started back in 2005, again, back with this blog that I had mentioned before. I started, I bought a $10 mic from CVS, like the CVS up the street from me. It was like this little GE mic that you just stick into one of the ports on the back of your computer and you just start talking. Back then, at least when I started, podcasting wasn&#8217;t a big thing. I actually don&#8217;t even remember if it was really called podcasting back then because podcasting is like a portmanteau of iPod and broadcast, and I know the iPod came out in &#8217;03, but I don&#8217;t think podcast was a big word in general back then.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know audio blogging was because the precursor to Twitter was this website called Odio that I used to use to just record snippets of stuff and would send it to friends because a lot of my friends lived either in New York or they lived in California. They didn&#8217;t live in Atlanta, so we would just do audio blogs and stuff back and forth, and on the side, I would just do a&#8230; I called it a blogcast, but I would just kind of record an episode, and maybe I&#8217;d have a guest on using Skype. I would have a guest on, and we would talk about just whatever&#8217;s in the news and whatnot, and I was learning how to edit. I was doing editing myself with Audacity or whatever, and then I fell into this group of other people in Atlanta that were doing podcasting, and I met this couple, Amber and Rusty, who were doing&#8230;</p>
<p>They basically created this organization called the Georgia Podcast Network, and it was mostly Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, the Tri-State area, and we would have semi-regular meetups. There was a website. I think they even put on a few pod camp conferences using the camp style of conferences, which they called an un-conference back then because the attendees are the ones that set the itinerary and got into the podcast community, then met some people, just kind of other folks that were doing shows, and then I kind of fell out of favor from doing it for a while because, I mean, this was around the time also, YouTube started to become big, so people were really starting to get into doing video. Blogging itself was dying out a bit. More people were going towards video.</p>
<p>Audio was still something that largely in terms of distribution was more in the arena of big media entities, so a New York Times or an NPR or something would do a radio show, and then they release it later that day as an MP3 or something because I would listen to that stuff at work or whatever, and so that&#8217;s how I first got into it, and there just wasn&#8217;t, at least around the time with the Georgia Podcast network, outside of them, really a big community for it. I call that the first wave of podcasting, and then the second wave really came in the mid 2010s with Cereal. Like Cereal came, and then they had that famous ad with the woman mispronouncing MaleChimp, and that seemed to just take off wildfire in terms of people just being like, you can listen to audio on this device that I hold in my hand that has a headphone jack that I&#8217;ve been listening to music?</p>
<p>Yes, you can. You can do that. It wasn&#8217;t a big, big push.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Right. Sometimes the most obvious answers aren&#8217;t obvious.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, but people started to see, I think, the possibility in it because even though Sarah Koenig is a journalist, and she was doing this independently at first, people saw like, &#8220;Oh, wait. I can make a show about anything,&#8221; and the way that the podcasting industry has, honestly, expanded and grown in the past 10 years is phenomenal, just in terms of the availability and the the suaveness of hardware, the availability of software. I mean, if you have a Spotify account, you can record a podcast. There&#8217;s so easy now, and so the learning curve has gotten much, much flatter for people to try to get into it, which I think for better or for worse, has been something for the industry.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to say it&#8217;s been good or bad, but now, because so many people can do it, everyone can do it, and so there&#8217;s just so many different shows out there, but I wanted, at least with Revision Path, I wanted to establish the lane fairly early because I had been listening to other design podcasts, and there were no Black people. And I would ask them, &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you talking to any Black designers? I know Black designers,&#8221; and sometimes I would get a response, which would usually be negative, but most of the times they would never even respond, and so I started Revision Path, not as a podcast at first, it was just going to be an online magazine because a friend of mine, this woman named Deedee Sutton had a really successful online magazine that she created called Clutch Online, or Clutch Mag Online, I think is what she called it, but she had a really super successful online magazine.</p>
<p>I was like, &#8220;I want to do something like that with, but around design at Revision Path,&#8221; because by this point in time in 2013 when I started the show, I had quit my job at AT&#038;T five years ago, started my studio, and then I had been in my studio now, and it was successful for five years, so I was like, &#8220;Oh, I have the time and the space to actually do this,&#8221; and so that&#8217;s how Revision Path was born, and I recorded my first podcast in June of that year. We started in February in terms of interviews, but the first recorded podcast was in June of that year, and then in 2014 is when we started to do it on a fairly regular weekly basis in terms of audio interviews, and it just kind of took off from there.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
That&#8217;s dope. That&#8217;s so cool to hear because I&#8217;m in the process now on our show of interviewing more Black designers because I told Andy, he&#8217;s a North Carolinian white dude from North Carolina, and he&#8217;s just, he&#8217;s super cool man, and he is definitely an ally. He understands things. He is very encouraging. I keep telling him, &#8220;I want this person on,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, yeah, and he&#8217;s feeding me people that I&#8217;d never even met before seen because he&#8217;s more in that space for knowing people than I am as far as designers, and so it&#8217;s good to see, and so I&#8217;m starting to get more people of color, all colors on our show, but mainly Black people because there was a survey, and I&#8217;ve mentioned this before on other places where I&#8217;ve talked, I think it&#8217;s called Design census.org or design census.com, and they interviewed 9,450, so for arguments sake, let&#8217;s just say 10,000 people.</p>
<p>And only 3% of the people interviewed design wise were Black because that was the space, and then it was like 13% Asian other, but it was 71% white male were designers, 71%, and you look at agencies and you look at the about us, and you go through the headshots and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Wow, there it is right there. This is exactly it.&#8221; Okay, and you go to the next agency. &#8220;Oh, there you go. This is exactly it,&#8221; and that&#8217;s how it is, and it&#8217;s understandable, but there&#8217;s so much talent being missed out on, just even basically from seeing things from a different perspective, being Black and understanding different ideas and stuff.</p>
<p>It was like, for instance, I think also two companies don&#8217;t even really try to be creative anymore. I&#8217;m serious. I&#8217;m serious. Think about the last cool Apple ad you&#8217;ve seen, and so I thought Apple&#8217;s always, like they had this weird thing where they were showing they did this weird for shortening of people holding up their phones. And then they were small silhouettes in the back and it&#8217;s now bigger, and I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Oh, my God, that&#8217;s terrible.&#8221; Here&#8217;s my idea for the perfect Apple ad, apple iPhone, iPhone, if you&#8217;re listening or this service goes back to you, I want my royalties on this shit.</p>
<p>What you do, all you do is you show a phone with a screen off, and you just show the phone screen off on a desk, and I want the desk to be a real desk, not like this perfect pristine thing. I want to see a takeout menu. I mean, real life shit, everything kind of just normal, and then I want to hear two people in the background. You hear a show in the background, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Nah, now I&#8217;m telling you, that&#8217;s the dude.&#8221; This is how it starts. &#8220;&#8216;s the dude from the last night or Night Quest.&#8221; &#8220;No, it&#8217;s not. No, it&#8217;s not.&#8221; &#8220;Yeah, it is.&#8221; It&#8217;s an argument going on and finally you here, &#8220;Hey, Siri?&#8221; &#8220;Yes?&#8221; &#8220;Who was this person then?&#8221; And then it just comes up, it says, &#8220;iPhone,&#8221; and then phones scratched out. It says, &#8220;I want to win this bet,&#8221; so every scenario&#8217;s like that, and then you go do another one, and it&#8217;s in the car in the holder. The phone&#8217;s in the car, in the holder, right?</p>
<p>And you see traffic in the background. It&#8217;s kind of blurry. It&#8217;s nighttime, and you hear two people talking about, &#8220;I&#8217;m telling you the Tacoria is right here.&#8221; And then it&#8217;s like iPhone and Scratcho says, &#8220;I want to find that restaurant.&#8221; Right? Focus on what it does rather than what it is. That was Steve Job&#8217;s big thing, focus on the product, the actual benefits of the product rather than the product itself. So why wouldn&#8217;t they do that? Why wouldn&#8217;t they found a way to push it? Because everybody knows what iPhone is, right? It&#8217;s not a phone. It&#8217;s a mini do wall in your pocket, and so why not focus on that?</p>
<p>And I hardly, and this is no joke, I maybe talk on my phone two times a month, maybe actually talk on my phone two times a month because people know I don&#8217;t like talking on the phone and they&#8217;ll text me, so it&#8217;s like, you can have anything now. I want to win this bet. I want to find a restaurant. I want to see what time that movie starts. It&#8217;s like it does everything for you, so why not mention that and make it fun? People know what it does. People know why they&#8217;re buying an iPhone. You don&#8217;t have to show the camera on the back and how it&#8217;s like, who cares? We all know it has a camera. We all know it takes good pictures. That&#8217;s the given. Just saying that when you design something, it&#8217;s going to look good.</p>
<p>What is a solution you&#8217;re trying to find? What are you trying to do with that solution? And so for me, being a creative person, I&#8217;m always thinking of shit like this, how to solve for a real thing. What would I want to see on a commercial? Anytime I see a commercial and I see a iPhone commercial, it&#8217;s Lily, right? She&#8217;s talking about AT&#038;T and how you can get a free iPhone. I like her. I love that character because it&#8217;s just kind of silly and it&#8217;s fun. It&#8217;s like a nice counter to the Verizon can you hear me now, guy? So that&#8217;s one thing, but it doesn&#8217;t speak about the phone itself. It speaks about AT&#038;T services, so have something that does something to do with the phone, but anyway, I think they&#8217;re missing that because they narrow their search to what looks good on paper rather than what performs well in real life. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
People can present really well on paper, but not be that great in real life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Apple also snaps up a lot of really good designers and art directors, and I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing with them. I mean, I would imagine they work on many of the other parts of the Apple ecosystem. For example, I&#8217;ve never been able to interview anyone that worked at Apple or that, I&#8217;m sorry, that currently works at Apple because they don&#8217;t let their employees do interviews, so it&#8217;s I&#8217;ve interviewed X Apple people when they&#8217;ve told me what they can about it, but I don&#8217;t know what goes on inside that large Taurus building in Cupertino, but that&#8217;s some ironclad NDA action right there.</p>
<p>Whatever is going on. I don&#8217;t know if the creativity necessarily is making its way out to people because I think even with the last iPhone, with the iPhone 14, a lot of people have been like, it&#8217;s not that much of an improvement over the 13, and granted, that&#8217;s probably supply issues and things of that nature too, just in terms of the camera and stuff, but yeah, I don&#8217;t know if Apple is the innovator like it used to be in that aspect.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
No, and also, too, I&#8217;m still rocking my old iPhone 7 plus.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
I&#8217;m still rocking that and I love it. Honestly, I wish they would go back to the four size, the size of the iPhone four. It was just a little bit bigger than a business card. That&#8217;s what I don&#8217;t want. I&#8217;m tired of these phones getting so big. I don&#8217;t want to carry around an iPad. I want to carry around a phone, like the old flip phones. I think Samsung, they had the flip phone, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. The Galaxy Flip or Galaxy Fold or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s pretty cool. I see some problems with the screens possibly being messed up because of all the opening and closing, but I like the idea. How fun was it? Remember how fun it was to end a call just by closing it, closing it shut, like end of the call. Now you have to just push a button violently in order to make sure people know you hung up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
A violent tap, a long press.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
You want to give them those three beeps. You know when they hang up beep, beep, beep?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Okay. That&#8217;s the end of the call. It used to just be slam and that was it. Call over, so that&#8217;s the one thing that phone brings back, which would also be a fun aspect for a marketing standpoint. With this phone, you could now end calls properly. It shows a dude just like, &#8220;Bye,&#8221; slamming the phone.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
I think, yeah, but anyway, tangent.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious with the podcast, and as we talked about little earlier, has that helped you become a better designer now that you&#8217;re able to really speak with other designers in congress on a regular basis about stuff? Has that helped you out?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Oh, I don&#8217;t talk to anybody in Congress or in the Senate at all.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, no, no.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
I know what you said. Not necessarily a better designer, but a better-informed designer. I&#8217;m able to see perspectives in a different way from people who&#8217;ve done certain things, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s helped me be a better designer, just helped me understand where people are coming from and just more exposure. More exposure to anything definitely increases knowledge of something in regards to your field, but I don&#8217;t know if it necessarily makes you better equipped design wise, although it might, I don&#8217;t know. I haven&#8217;t really seen a big uptick in my design skills. Maybe I should just keep interviewing people in the hope that it will rub off via telekinesis because osmosis, you need water, so people say, &#8220;oh, you&#8217;re going to get that osmosis.&#8221; You always need a water source, so you can&#8217;t get it through osmosis, but through telekinesis, possibly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
My mother is a biologist. She tells me that same thing, that exact same thing. People can&#8217;t get stuff through osmosis. I get it. I get it. I get it.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
So you need to have areas of high concentration to low concentration or to living proper in order to have&#8230; Okay, Mom, sorry,</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I get what you mean about being a better-informed designer. Even as I&#8217;ve done this show and I&#8217;ve talked to people all over the world, it lets me know what our differences are, what our similarities are. I feel like a lot of designers have the same issues regardless of where they are, whether it&#8217;s their work or finding work or finding purpose and things like that, but then you see how different it is in parts of Africa versus in the UK versus here in the States, even from the rural areas of the states to big cities and things like that. It has, I think, made me, I get what you mean about it, making you better informed. Just hearing more people&#8217;s perspectives helps you to see a lot farther than what you just might in your own kind of narrow field of vision.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Right. Yeah, exactly, and that&#8217;s exactly what&#8230; You said it so much better.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What kind of advice would you have for any&#8230; Like people are listening to this conversation. They&#8217;re hearing you. They&#8217;re hearing your story. What advice would you give to people that want to follow in your footsteps, they want to have the career that you have?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
First of all&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They want to have the career that you have.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
First of all, I think it&#8217;s good to understand, like I said before, not everybody&#8217;s going to like your work. Right? Everybody&#8217;s not going to like your work, and so you can&#8217;t take it personally. I also think that it&#8217;s good to find a designer whose style you like in different fields, and find multiple influences to help your thought process. I also think it&#8217;s good to find a mentor if you can, someone you trust that will be honest with you. And by honest, I don&#8217;t mean absolutely mean, but I do think you should find someone who&#8217;s not going to bullshit you.</p>
<p>And last, and this is the most important thing that I&#8217;ve found, is just be yourself. Just be yourself. Be unapologetically you. Now granted, there are, and you and I both know this from working with people in the corporate space, you have to figure out a way to tone back a little bit at times, because especially if you&#8217;re a person of color, black, brown, you have to figure out a way to tone back sometimes, because then you&#8217;re seen as being aggressive. You&#8217;re seen as being loud, you&#8217;re seen as being abrupt. You&#8217;re seen as being a disruption. But you can set boundaries by your actions, not answering emails, being cordial [inaudible 01:13:31] people, being firm, and then setting those boundaries. But try your hardest to be yourself because people who will fuck with you will understand you 100%. It&#8217;s not going to be, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve never seen this side of you before.&#8221; That should never come out of anybody&#8217;s mouth who you&#8217;re talking to.</p>
<p>And I say this all the time, that whoever I&#8217;m talking to, I talk to the same way. I talk to six-year-olds this way I&#8217;m talking to you. I&#8217;ll cuss around them because that&#8217;s me. I&#8217;m not going to blatantly go out on my way to cuss, but if something comes up, I will cuss. And it&#8217;s just because that&#8217;s who I am. I&#8217;m not trying to be rude. I&#8217;m not trying to be edgy. I&#8217;m just trying being me. And if that happens, it happens. And at times I realize I&#8217;ve said something and it&#8217;s like, oh, it doesn&#8217;t work the best around my two-year-old nephew, because he&#8217;s a parrot and repeats verbatim with incredible syntax, vernacular and diction, exactly what you&#8217;ve said, so I have to watch that. But be unapologetically you as the biggest takeaway, I would say. But know when to. And this is a horrible thing to say. So it&#8217;s like good advice and bad advice, because you shouldn&#8217;t have to shrink for anybody. But there&#8217;s times in order to get ahead, you kind of have to make sure you do, which is terrible to say.</p>
<p>And if people don&#8217;t like you and they don&#8217;t fuck with you, then you don&#8217;t want to work with them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have there been times in your career where that&#8217;s come back to bite in some way?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Yeah, it has. And we didn&#8217;t mention Shaklee earlier, where I worked, but I basically had a target on my back after speaking back to the VP at some point. And here&#8217;s a fun story, and other people who&#8217;ve heard me on other stuff will probably say, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard this a thousand times.&#8221; When I was working there, there were one, two, three, four, five, like six black people that worked there, maybe seven. And one of the women that worked in a different department that I worked with, she was walking by the VP&#8217;s desk. And the VP, she sat in the middle of the office in it&#8217;s an open office, which for those of you who are listening, open office plans, they&#8217;re terrible for everybody. But anyway, she was walking through [inaudible 01:15:57] open office, and she walks by and she says, and I&#8217;m going to call her Sarah for the conversation, &#8220;Sarah, how are you coming along on that action brochure?&#8221;</p>
<p>The action brochure was a brochure that I was working on that was due for a global conference, which Shaklee holds every year. And last time they did it was in Vegas I think, but I haven&#8217;t thought about that shit for four years. But anyway, &#8220;So where are we on that action brochure for the global conference?&#8221; And Sarah looks at her and says, &#8220;Oh, well, I have it back with creative, and they&#8217;re making changes to it.&#8221; Mind you, I am literally 20, 25 feet from the VP in an open office. And she says, &#8220;Oh, well what can I do to help you? How can I help you?&#8221; The VP says to Sarah. Sarah looks at her confused and says, &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure exactly how you can help. I mean, it&#8217;s with creative right now.&#8221; Being incredibly calm, as Black women have to be in the workplace, or they are assumed to be combative. So that&#8217;s another thing.</p>
<p>And then she says, &#8220;You know what? Forget it.&#8221; The VP, &#8220;Forget it. You go do your thing. And I&#8217;m going to sit here and do my thing. Okay?&#8221; [inaudible 01:17:09] So I hear this and I&#8217;m thinking, this bitch. So I get up and I walk over to my project manager who sits even closer to the VP. And I walk up to her and I say in this exact tone, in this exact voice, &#8220;Was that about the fucking action brochure?&#8221; And she looks at me. And the project manager and I, she&#8217;s dope. I love her. She&#8217;s at a different company now and whatever, but she&#8217;s so cool. She was basically a mom to all of us. And she wasn&#8217;t that much older, but she just had that caring and very organized nature about her. And she goes, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; And I go, &#8220;Tell them if they would stop changing shit, then I&#8217;d be able to get it done.&#8221; And I said it loud enough so the VP would hear it.</p>
<p>And so I started walking back to my desk and the VP does this. &#8220;Oh, oh, oh, I&#8217;m sorry, Kirk, what did you say?&#8221; And I turned to her and I say, &#8220;If you would stop changing shit, then I could get it done.&#8221; So this is what she does. Puts her hands up, like the entire hands up, shoulders back, like, &#8220;Whoa, whoa, whoa, we&#8217;re all on the same team.&#8221; And I said to her, &#8220;Mm-hmm, yeah, right.&#8221; And I went back to my desk.</p>
<p>After that moment, it was like a bullseye was on me. Everybody was like, &#8220;Kirk is leaving early to go do something,&#8221; which I had established because I was leaving early on certain days to get my kids from school and spend time with them, because I was going through a fucked up divorce and custody battle. So I needed every moment with my kids. And then it was like, &#8220;Kirk isn&#8217;t doing his work, or getting work done, or asking for more work.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I was like, &#8220;Motherfuckers.&#8221; So I got called into the office after that one day, or into HR. And I go in there and the first thing I ask is, &#8220;Am I fired?&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, okay, then let&#8217;s talk, because here&#8217;s the thing, if you&#8217;re going to fire me, just fire me. I don&#8217;t want to lecture. I don&#8217;t need to hear anything. Just fire me.&#8221; So they sit down and all these things come up. You&#8217;ve been leaving early. And I said, &#8220;Well, I told you I was going to leave early because it was my supervisor and the HR lady.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I told you I was going to leave early.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Well, what do you do when you get your work done?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, predominantly, I probably either surf the internet or I catch up on other work than I&#8217;m doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>And they go, &#8220;You don&#8217;t ask for more work?&#8221; I say, &#8220;No, why should I? Why should I ask for more work?&#8221; See, Kirk did quiet quitting before quiet quitting was cool. And I said, &#8220;Why should I ask for more work?&#8221; And they go, &#8220;Well, you know [inaudible 01:19:49].&#8221; And I said, &#8220;No.&#8221; They said, &#8220;Well, people have come up to you and you&#8217;ve had your headphones on, and you put boxes up on your desk.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yeah, because I need to get work done and I&#8217;m right next to the bathroom. And people know that I&#8217;m friendly and they want to talk to me, and I don&#8217;t have time to talk sometimes, so I put the headphones in and get stuff done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People have also said that you&#8217;re unapproachable,&#8221; and we all know what that&#8217;s code for. You&#8217;re Black and scary. People-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Or that you&#8217;re just Black.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Right? And so I said, well, I don&#8217;t understand that. And I look at my supervisor and they go, &#8220;Yeah, because you might be hurting people&#8217;s feelings.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay, well,&#8221; I look at my supervisor and I say, &#8220;hey, have I ever given you any flack for a job?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I ever done a bad job?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever been displeased with anything that I&#8217;ve done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see what the problem is though.&#8221; I said, &#8220;My job is to do the best I can in the time allotted, with the information that I have. That is my job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You [inaudible 01:20:51] hurt people&#8217;s feelings.&#8221;</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t give a fuck about people&#8217;s feelings. That&#8217;s not my job.&#8221; And I knew I wasn&#8217;t hurting anybody&#8217;s feelings because I would have people come back to me repeatedly, specifically asking for me to do work for them. I think it&#8217;s a combination of jealousy and other people in my department who I worked with who were fucking busters.</p>
<p>And I think it&#8217;s also the fact that I didn&#8217;t march to their drum. I didn&#8217;t do everything that they said. So they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, well how can you do this?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Nah.&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; And then the HR lady asked, &#8220;Kirk, do you like working here?&#8221; I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Bitch, what the fuck you talking about? How can you ask me that? You already know the answer. You&#8217;re asking me a rhetorical question. You already know the fucking answer.&#8221; Like, &#8220;Dude, you know the answer.&#8221; So I sit there and I look at her dead in the eyes and I say, &#8220;I really like who I work with.&#8221; And that was it. I didn&#8217;t say anything else. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;You really think I&#8217;m going to dig the hole with a shovel you gave me so you can knock me in it, so you can shoot me and put me in it like a damn gangster movie?&#8221; No, I&#8217;m not digging a hole. I&#8217;m going to say what I have to say and it&#8217;s going to be honest. I did the people I work with there.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, man, this is the biggest thing other people can remember too. Working with people is about relationships. And when you have a good relationship with someone, your work is going to be better than it would be if you have a bad relationship with someone. That&#8217;s just, that&#8217;s everyday life. That&#8217;s a job. That&#8217;s a marriage. That&#8217;s a basketball team, that&#8217;s a baseball team, that&#8217;s sports, whatever, it&#8217;s everywhere. So I have people, and I can think of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven people who I used to work with at Shaklee that have left Shaklee and have come to me for work, to help them do things.</p>
<p>Now, if I was that bad of an employee or that bad of a person, they wouldn&#8217;t want to work with me. They wouldn&#8217;t seek me out afterwards. It&#8217;s like that&#8217;s the thing that I measure from being not only a good designer but a decent person to work with. And that&#8217;s important to me. So just realize that people at work aren&#8217;t your friends, but there are people who can become friends when you get to a certain point. And there&#8217;s several people who I work with from there that I really enjoy working with and love. And so there were people that I loved there. But I couldn&#8217;t say that I actually liked working there. I would have half of my face go numb going into work. I would have headaches. I would have terrible anxiety. I would sit in my car at times. I would start around 8:30 and I would get to work at about 8:20 and sit there until 8:50 or 9:00, just not wanting to go into the office. That&#8217;s how bad it was.</p>
<p>And the day my wife said to me, &#8220;You know what? You should look into seeing if you can get time off for stress relief.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay, cool, bet.&#8221; So I talked to the Kaiser Permanente psychiatry department, which is non-existent. It&#8217;s terrible. And I talked to the dude and then either in person or over the phone or whatever, I don&#8217;t remember. But he said, &#8220;You know what, they normally only give out two.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to give you three weeks.&#8221; And I thought, as soon as he said, I&#8217;m giving you three weeks from work, this weight had been lifted. I mean, right now talking about it, my face is kind of going numb. That&#8217;s how stressful and traumatic it was being at that fucking work environment. And when the three weeks was almost up, I started having the same fucking symptoms coming up.</p>
<p>Same shit would happen at home, knowing I had to go back in. And my wife said to me, &#8220;Just quit.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Really?&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; And the moment she said yeah, it&#8217;s like the weight had been lifted. I felt like Atlas finally could stop holding up the world. Like, &#8220;This is someone else&#8217;s job. And ain&#8217;t my job.&#8221; There was that much stress and pressure on me. And when people were talking about, &#8220;Oh, you quit because you were mentally not there,&#8221; or whatever, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;You&#8217;re fucking right I did, because it was killing me.&#8221; It was literally killing me to be in that environment. And I don&#8217;t think people understand the amount of shit that other people can&#8217;t escape from. There&#8217;s people who can&#8217;t do what I do. I was lucky. I was fortunate to have a supportive partner and to have someone who cared enough about my mental health, as well as my physical health to say, &#8220;You need to quit that fucking job.&#8221;</p>
<p>And my former boss who was working at a different company was just telling me like, oh, I need to stick it out. [inaudible 01:25:40] said, &#8220;No, you need to quit. Since you started working here, this, this, this and this have happened to you. All these physical things have happened to you based upon your job. The stress is killing you.&#8221; So finally she quit and she said she feels so much better already. She&#8217;s getting back into a rhythm. She&#8217;s starting to exercise. She&#8217;s sleeping better. And it&#8217;s like, yes. And I don&#8217;t think people realize the importance of A, working in a hostile work environment, but B, working in a hostile environment by being a marginalized person, i.e. not a cis white male. And it&#8217;s tough. It&#8217;s tough and it&#8217;s tougher for other people in certain situations. So yeah, that&#8217;s the reason why it left. That&#8217;s my experience there. Overall, I learned a lot while being there and I met some nice people. But I can honestly say I would not work there again.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds a lot my time working at AT&#038;T. It was just, oh my God, not great, not great. AT&#038;T at least at the time when I was about to quit, I thought I had had Crohn&#8217;s disease or something. Every time I thought about going in or had to go in, I would automatically get sick. I would automatically have stomach issues. I thought I had IBS or something. And then once I quit, it all just cleared up. It just like, poof, vanished. It was gone. So yeah, working in those stressful environments can definitely do a toll on you mentally, physically. Yeah, I know what that&#8217;s like.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Yeah. And I&#8217;m sorry you had to go through that. It&#8217;s not a good experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
It&#8217;s difficult. See, you empathize and you sympathize and it&#8217;s hard for people to understand it if they haven&#8217;t gone through it. How can you let that happen? Actually, dude that used to work there at Shaklee went somewhere else. And all the shit was happening to him from an abusive narcissistic boss. And he said, &#8220;Oh, I have to quit.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I remember criticizing you for quitting Shaklee.&#8221; But he said, &#8220;Now I understand. I apologize because I had no idea before.&#8221; Like, &#8220;Yeah, man, it&#8217;s real. It&#8217;s real.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
As much as I don&#8217;t like Kanye West, one of these great lyrics from one of his songs, he said, and I&#8217;m paraphrasing because I don&#8217;t know the exact words, because it&#8217;s Kanye, he said, &#8220;Where do you want to be when you&#8217;re 25? She turned around, looked at me, and she said, alive.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Damn, that&#8217;s kind of how I feel. I would like to say I want to be retired in Hawaii, sipping on pina coladas and mai tais and watching the turtles. But reality, I just want to be around. I mean, I want to be somewhat healthy, doing stuff with my wife, chilling, working, just enjoying life.</p>
<p>As far as career goals, I really would&#8217;ve liked to finish a script I&#8217;m working on, finish a video game idea, finish a graphic novel. I just want to finish something, because I have all these ideas and they all kind of go around and sync up. Oh, here&#8217;s something too. See, the ADHD brain is working. I&#8217;m working on a project right now that has a certain character I meet up. And so this is what I was thinking. I hadn&#8217;t seen it done before and I think it would be kind of fun. I was going to start a character and the first thing [inaudible 01:29:07] do was write a little brief book intro about him. And the second thing I wanted to do was write a or design a video game that picks up where the book left off. And that&#8217;s the only media it&#8217;s available in. It&#8217;s not going to be in a book, it&#8217;s not going to be online. It&#8217;s just going to be only the game.</p>
<p>And then after the game, I want to make an animated movie or show where that picks off and pick up from there. So it crosses three different media, but it continues one story. And I hadn&#8217;t seen that before. And I was thinking maybe because it&#8217;s not as big of a deal or it&#8217;s too hard to do, but just different things too. And I want the video game to be able to transfer, like when you&#8217;re playing it from a 2D scroller to a 3D sandbox. I want them to interact that way, where you can just pause it, change settings, and then go to a 2D scroller. Think of Rayman versus Batman Arkham Knights or any game like that, God of War or Tomb Raider. So you go from that to a 2D scroller, like Kung-Fu or a Rayman or whatever, or Kung-Fu Master, that was my idea behind that.</p>
<p>But I want to do something along those lines from my personal, not personal, but just for my creative zeal. But mainly just in five years, I want to be able to chill and probably have some better relationships with my sons, my twins. We go deep when we talk. This is always me. So I&#8217;d probably like to have a better relationship with them too in five years. But we&#8217;ll see what happens.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So just to wrap things up, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where could they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
You know what? Just to wrap it up, thank you so much for asking me that question Maurice. I&#8217;m putting on my podcast voice. I want to tell you about [inaudible 01:31:09] &#8230; No, people can find my agency work at Mind the Font dot com, so it&#8217;s like M-I-N-D-T-H-E-F-O-N-T dot com. And then I have something else I do, just kind of my own weird personal thing. It&#8217;s called Vsla Brand, but it&#8217;s V as in victory, S-L-A brand dot com. And on there, it&#8217;s just kind of my own personal stuff. I do have some swag that I sell on there, like hoodies and a T-shirt. I also have a thing called Thought Spot on there, where I write down random stuff that I&#8217;ve been thinking or what I&#8217;m going through at the time. And I date it, so you can read that. It kind of like is just me unfiltered. And I think that&#8217;s it. And also if you look up Kirk Visola, you&#8217;re going to find me, which is everything.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty weird. You can find podcasts I&#8217;ve done, old pictures of me from newspapers when I had dreads. Yeah, Kirk Visola, that&#8217;s me. Just type it in, you&#8217;ll find me. And also too, anybody listening to this, please seriously reach out to me, and if you want any questions or ideas or thoughts or anything, reach out to me, because we don&#8217;t communicate enough, especially other Black designers, other Black creatives, we should be communicating with each other. Maurice and I were talking about this beforehand. And I told him to call me anytime he wants to vent or talk or chat or whatever, because we need to lean on each other in order to make each other strong. So reach out to me anytime y&#8217;all. And Maurice, thank you so much for having me on. That&#8217;s it for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, no, this was a really great conversation. Kirk Visola, thank you again so much for coming on the show. Really I think, if there&#8217;s anything that&#8217;s come across in this conversation, it is your just unfiltered, complete authenticity about yourself and your work, and your attitude to the work and everything. I hope that that&#8217;s something that as people certainly look at what they want to accomplish this year, they can sort of follow in your stead about being yourself, and knowing that by doing that and by being themselves, that they can succeed as well. So thank you so much again for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Kirk Visola:</b><br>
Thank you, Maurice.</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Well, number one, thank you for having me on, Maurice. My name is George McCalman. I am an artist and creative director based in San Francisco. I live part-time in the Caribbean, the country of Grenada. And I run a design studio, which affords me the privilege of doing a lot of creative things at the same time. And I&#8217;m also a fine and commercial artist, and I&#8217;m often the artist of projects that I am designing and am the creative director on. I do a lot of other things, but that&#8217;s it for right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, first off, happy New Year to you.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Happy New Year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;re recording this right near the start of 2023. How have things been going so far?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been great. I&#8217;m in a very different realm than I was even a few weeks ago. I just had a couple weeks of a break from a book tour that I have been on and a press tour in support of my book Illustrated Black History: Honoring the Iconic and the Unseen. And so I&#8217;ve had a little bit of a reprieve, and so for the first time in many months, I have had the opportunity to really synthesize and make sense of the whirlwind that has come from the second half of this year of this book being out and me going out on a book tour and a national book tour. So I&#8217;ve just been really reflective for the last couple of weeks, and so this conversation is really timed well because I&#8217;ve been just thinking a lot about my experience of being a published author and people interacting with this book and having their responses and what I have learned from their response to this book. It&#8217;s been really incredible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I know you&#8217;re currently recording in Grenada. I would imagine having a Caribbean paradise at the finish line of a book tour is a pretty good motivation.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s actually just a reprieve. I start back on the book tour in February. So this is actually not even the midpoint. I&#8217;m going to be on tour for this book most likely another year just because I feel really passionately that this subject matter should be revered every day of the year and not just localized to a month or a period of time. So I am taking the message of that to the streets.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. When you look back at last year, is there anything that you want to try to change for 2023?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yeah. Expansive. I don&#8217;t know that I would use the word change for myself. It&#8217;s expand. I learned a lot and I was involved in all aspects of the making of this book, which is a really unique place to be. Most authors are not involved with all of the backend, the making and the design and the marketing. And so it&#8217;s been a really comprehensive experience too. And if I would say any adjustment, it would just be more, basically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ll make sure that we have a link to the book in the show notes. Yeah, let&#8217;s dive more into it. Tell me about the book. I think the name is self-explanatory, but tell me more about the book, what was your idea behind it, all of that.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
The book came from the word &#8230; The first sentence of the introduction of this book is I had a curiosity, and that is the very simple truth. I was just curious to know more about black pioneers. And I was just coming to a point where I started realizing that there was an artist inside of me, and so I decided to merge these twin curiosities of, I want to test out the parameters of me as an artist after basically not making art since I graduated from college 20 years before. So I&#8217;m a classically trained artist. I&#8217;m a painter and a drafts person and a sculptor and a photographer. But when I went out into the professional landscape of being a magazine art and creative director, I didn&#8217;t think there was any room for me to be a fine artist. And at the time, there just weren&#8217;t people who looked like me in this realm.</p>
<p>And so I knew that would be a hard road, and I decided to go with the convention of working in the corporate world just to establish myself financially and it was an adult decision. But I came to a point a few years ago where I started realizing that there was more that I was interested in. It felt like there was an ocean that I had not touched. And I decided in a flash of inspiration to make this project my first assignment as an artist. And so I researched and wrote and painted a different black history pioneer every day for a month of February, and it just started ballooning. I think that&#8217;s the right word. It started expanding from there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How did you go about researching and selecting the people to feature in the book? Because as I&#8217;ve looked through the book, I have the book actually, you have a wide range of people that you feature.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I really know that the person that I am personally and professionally has really been framed by my time working at magazines because it&#8217;s basically, I got both military and library training at the same time, if that makes sense. There&#8217;s a rigor to when you are working under deadline, you have to really be sharp, you have to have your focus, you have to know what the context is of what you&#8217;re doing. You have to be really communicative with the people around you. And you have to make sure that what you&#8217;re writing is all the time. And so it really trained me to know some of the shortcuts of researching and trusting my instincts around that. And for me, I was interested in people I didn&#8217;t know that much about. Even if I knew their name, even if I knew some of their story, there&#8217;s always more to learn.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the thing that I&#8217;ve learned in my 15 years as a magazine person before I opened my studio, that even when you think you know everything about a public figure, there is always more. And so it was a trust in the information I was learning, but it was also a trust in myself. And so I was always just looking at the periphery, looking at the fringes, asking myself questions. Who is Edna Lewis? What was Gordon Parks thinking as he was moving through the world? I found myself asking intimate questions to myself of the people I was researching. And so I found myself drawn to aspects of their story, and I was always looking for not just their accomplishments, but their personality. So many of our pioneers were always looking through a contemporary lens, but life was just so much harder then.</p>
<p>And so I can&#8217;t imagine what Gordon Parks&#8217; everyday life was. He was always the representative, and there&#8217;s always a burden placed on black people in America that we have to represent our community. And I can&#8217;t imagine what that was like 50 years ago, what that was like 75 years ago, 150 years ago. How much harder it was to be seen as an individual when your community is always being judged against the majority white community. And so it&#8217;s always this push, it&#8217;s always this burden, it&#8217;s always this pressure. But then you look at these accomplishments and so many of these people, publicly anyway, were really graceful. And so you have to develop this superpower when you&#8217;re out in the world. And I found myself thinking, what did these people have to compromise? What did they have to give up? Who did they have to be to be the people that we know and sometimes take for granted?</p>
<p>I was always looking for the hidden messages of who these people actually were, and that just always sparked my interest. It just made me hungry and curious. And even as I was painting them, I found myself drawn to nuances of personality. Gordon Parks was really charming, and so the portrait that I did of him, there&#8217;s a twinkle in his eye. I was looking to bring out the anger and the jokingness and the sadness and the power and the force. I really wanted to capture human personality in these paintings and really individualize them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Aside from just how poetic that is, that is extremely profound of you as an artist to want to approach it in that way. Even as you mentioned that, I&#8217;m thinking of my personal experience, but I&#8217;d say maybe a couple of years ago, this was right around the summer of 2020, I was doing a lot of research looking at old issues of Ebony Magazine and Jet Magazine from the &#8217;50s and the &#8217;60s. And one thing that stuck out to me that I thought was really interesting, I saw an ad for &#8230; It was some kind of alcohol, maybe gin or something like that. But it was Langston Hughes.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Langston Hughes was selling alcohol. And I don&#8217;t know why that broke my brain for a second because in a way you think of, oh, Langston Hughes, Harlem Renaissance, profound poet. Why is he selling alcohol in Ebony Magazine?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes. We don&#8217;t often think of our pioneers as whole people. People who have made mistakes and people who have had different lives and weren&#8217;t always doing the things that we focus and categorize them in terms of their professional accomplishments. And you start seeing people are just flawed. Every human being is flawed. We have complicated relationships with our icons in that we have to place them on a pedestal to basically show ourselves and to show the larger community how great we are. And so we always have to work harder to show these things. And then when you see Langston Hughes out of context, it&#8217;s confusing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It caused me to pause for a minute. Not so much the why behind it, but it made me think &#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I wouldn&#8217;t think of him as a spokesperson for an alcohol company. I&#8217;m thinking of him as the poet. And not even thinking of like, oh, well, what are the circumstances that brought him to do this? Because I&#8217;m not looking at him being in Ebony in that way as a negative, but it just surprised me to go through the pages and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, Langston Hughes is selling gin.&#8221; It was gin or something. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Because Langston Hughes had to pay his bills too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly. Exactly.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Homie had to pay his bills, and so lots of people did lots of different things to survive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What would you say is the most interesting or surprising thing you learned while doing this research? Aside from what you just mentioned, which I said is extremely profound.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Oh gosh. I learned so many things it&#8217;s hard for me to pull out. If anything, it just broadened my fascination with basically how we think of our cultural figures. Back to your point of the kind of artist I was at the beginning of this process that I was looking to render a kind of wholeness of people. I was just always interested in the emotional language of portraiture and even how we as black people render each other is going through a current renaissance because we have not always &#8230; We haven&#8217;t been given the room and encouragement frankly, to render ourselves. And so I knew it was maverick of me to basically not flatten everyone and not render the same style. That would&#8217;ve been easy for me to do, but I knew that that was not the right thing for me to do for this project. I really wanted to make sure that I was showing the complexity of who these people were and I was also trying to show the humanity and make that as important as the historical details. That I was basically equating the emotional parts with the historical facts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you hope people take away from the book? I mean, aside from buying a copy, what do you want people to take away from it?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Well, I honestly think, Maurice, that we&#8217;re super casual about this subject. Not that we don&#8217;t know how important it is, but at the time that I started this project, I realized that there wasn&#8217;t a book like this and that I wanted people to have it because I thought that we all deserved to have something like this, that we deserve to have this resource. Even though we as black people, we carry our history in our bodies and we have a very particular way of an oral history of passing information down to each other that has survived the ravages of time and racism. This book in and of itself, I didn&#8217;t feel comfortable thinking about it until after the book came out and several people have told me that this book is in and of itself a pioneer. Because we just don&#8217;t have this information accessible in this way. That there wasn&#8217;t a book outside of historical, academic and children&#8217;s categorization, that there wasn&#8217;t an accessible book just to buy and share about American black history. And so that&#8217;s what I want people to know, that this is still a rarefied thing. This is not an everyday thing. This is a pretty amazing resource that we now have. And I made this book for myself as much as for anyone else. I wanted a book like this. And so that&#8217;s partially why I did it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I also love that the typography that&#8217;s in the book for the titles as well as on the cover is from a black typographer.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
There are two black typographers in this book. And because I&#8217;m the designer of the book, I was clear that that aspect had to be represented. That I didn&#8217;t just want to talk about it, I wanted to show it. It was more important that people knew that that sensibility &#8230; There&#8217;s this reductive conversation that came up during 2020 again that was like, where are all the black designers? And I was like, &#8220;Screw you all. There are plenty of us around. You just need to stop being lazy and do your research to find them because we&#8217;re all here.&#8221; And I know tons of black designers, and so that&#8217;s not a thing. There should be more of us, certainly. But this idea that somehow everyone just woke up and started looking for us, I was genuine. I was like, &#8220;Fuck you.&#8221; I wanted to know. The two black typographers, one has been in the game for over 30 years, Joshua Darden, and he has a very successful &#8230; Which he sold a number of years ago.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Darden Studio.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Darden Studio. And the other one is a more recent designer and typographer by the name of Trey Shields. A vocal type. And Trey&#8217;s hook, and it was a hook that he has just expanded beautifully, was to honor the civil rights protest signs and digitize them and make them accessible to everyday people. And so the book is filled with typefaces. There&#8217;re three or four typefaces in this book that both Trey and Josh designed.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Yeah, Trey&#8217;s the homie. I&#8217;ve had him on the show before.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
He&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
He&#8217;s amazing. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit and learn more about you. Learn more about your origin story. Are you originally from Grenada? Is that where you grew up?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes. I was born and raised here. The first decade of my life I lived here, and then my mother and I moved to Brooklyn. I grew up in East Flatbush in a West Indian neighborhood. And all my formal education was in New York. I went to Marine Park in Brooklyn and then Midwood High School, which was a medical science high school. Webster attended Midwood High School. That&#8217;s my one celebrity, useless factoid. And then I went to St. John&#8217;s University and graduated and then started working in the publishing field.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you always have an interest in illustration and design growing up?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Always. I was that kid who drew in the margins of every page of every notebook I&#8217;ve ever had in my entire life. And it was just raw. It just came out. I had no formal training until college, but I was just obsessively drawing. And I drew superheroes and I made up characters and it was all very detailed, and I would just create these worlds and I would be lost in them to the eternal frustration of my mother. And it just came from me. It came from me and it came for me. But I had no encouragement into this world, and I didn&#8217;t know enough of it to realize that I could make a career out of being an artist. I saw no road into it. And so it made sense to me to just walk away from it when I graduated from college.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s talk about college. You mentioned going to St. John&#8217;s University. We had another guest on recently, Sharon Burton, who also told me about her time there. Yeah. What was it like for you?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
My college education was a dysmorphic experience. I didn&#8217;t know what I had until it was in the rear view mirror, as is perfect parable of youth. We have no context to know what it is that we&#8217;re learning until life crashes into you when you have something to compare it to. And for me, I had an education that I was constantly frustrated with because it felt that it was out of step with the cool art schools that were in Manhattan. Number one, I was in Queens, which felt so far removed from the center of the art world, which was Manhattan at the time. And so I&#8217;d go into all these galleries in Manhattan, and I had friends who were at Parsons and SBA and Pratt, and it just felt like I was at this Catholic university that had a tiny fine art and graphic design department, and I just felt like my education sucked.</p>
<p>And it wasn&#8217;t until I graduated school and started working, I realized how amazing my education actually was and how unique it was in the landscape of how people are taught fine art and graphic design. And one of the main things that differentiated my education is that I learned philosophy and theology alongside art history, fine art and graphic design. It was one of the most comprehensive educations I could have received. And it took me a few years to realize that I was actually ahead of the curve and I&#8217;m actually really happy that I did not go to a more prototypical fine arts school. I got a fantastic education at St. John&#8217;s.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. How&#8217;s that saying go? Hindsight is 2020?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
It sure is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve heard that personally because I didn&#8217;t even study design. I went to a liberal arts private college. I went to Morehouse. And I initially went there because I wanted to &#8230; And this was late &#8217;90s, early 2000s. Because I wanted to be a web designer. I had started learning HTML in high school. I taught myself HTML in high school and learned Photoshop. I designed my high school&#8217;s yearbook and the paper, and I really wanted to go into it but the scholarships that I got weren&#8217;t for art school. I actually never even applied to an art school. And then I got to Morehouse, majored in computer science. And in my mind I&#8217;m thinking, oh, well, it&#8217;s all the same, right? It&#8217;s all computers and design. It&#8217;s all the same. And I quickly realized after the first semester, it was not. I switched my major to math, which is what I got my degree in. But I know what you mean about looking back at the education and seeing how it served you versus the time that you&#8217;re there and you have this comparison on what your peers are doing, on what others are doing or what you think they&#8217;re doing that you feel like you should be getting at that formative stage.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So after you graduated, you talk about going and becoming an art director. Did you go right into that right after you graduated?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I did. It&#8217;s pretty common now, but it was a little more unconventional back then. This was the mid &#8217;90s. St. John&#8217;s had a internship requirement that your final year of school was spent in the field the entire semester as if you worked. And so the entire semester, I ended up having three options. I remember being going to interview at these three distinctly different locations, and it was kind of a sliding doors. And even then I knew that I was basically deciding my path with these three. One was an ad agency, one was a magazine, and the other was a small boutique design firm. And I remember being confused about which direction I was going to go in. I really did not know. And I walked into the Office of Money magazine, which is where I ended up interning. There was just a vitality. The office was a newsroom and there were people walking around and talking and gossiping and stuff being put up, and I could see layouts, and it just felt alive. It felt like an organism. And in my early 20s, I was just kind of like, yes, I think this is the environment that I need to be in. And I didn&#8217;t know anything about magazine design at that point, but it just felt like I needed to be there. And so I said yes to it, and I think it was one of my first really adult decisions.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s really interesting that senior year you got to have that choice. That&#8217;s something that I know that a lot of students now don&#8217;t get. They don&#8217;t get to see the working world-</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
They really don&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Before they graduate like that.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
They don&#8217;t. Yeah. Because I teach also. I&#8217;m a professor of graphic design. And one of the big issues I have &#8230; And it&#8217;s not an easy problem to solve. I am critical of it while knowing that I don&#8217;t have the answers myself. One of the fallacies of school is that it doesn&#8217;t really prepare you for the real world. It&#8217;s like one of the last bastions of this purity of education. And it often is counter to how the process of the professional world runs. I quickly learned when I started Money Magazine that there was no graphic design class I had that prepared me for how the magazine world worked and how the design process actually worked. I realized how luxurious school is. It&#8217;s a place where you can sit and think and talk and show your work, and there&#8217;s no real disruption. There are no real crises. There&#8217;s nothing for you to solve outside of the assignment that has been given to you that you have months to ponder and to ruminate on.</p>
<p>And so the idea of instinct is just absent in the school diaspora. And so when I teach now, I teach differently than I learned, and I try to infuse as much of a real life sensibility. The other issue with schools is that a lot of people who teach don&#8217;t practice. And so you have a completely different and often very dissonant where the education is rigorous and it is really valid, but it is outside of basically the professional norms of how you would actually solve problems. But then the people who are in the field don&#8217;t have time to teach because they&#8217;re working. And even for me, teaching was a really difficult thing for me to do with the entrenched deadlines of my studio process. And so I understand that it is a very difficult thing to do. I recently took part in a review of students at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard a few weeks ago at the end of the semester in December.</p>
<p>And this was an active conversation that I was one of six jurors, and we were all in different strata of the professional world, and we were really debating and having this conversation about how what best serves the students. If you&#8217;re only learning from people who are not practicing, I&#8217;m sorry, the education is only so valuable. But then if you&#8217;re only learning from people in the field, you don&#8217;t learn what being spacious in your thinking and being intellectual and being academic, you don&#8217;t learn the value of that in the design process also. And so the answer seems to be a balance between the two, but that is not always the case depending on where the school is and at what stage the professors are and where the students are. So it&#8217;s a very complicated metric to figure out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting you say that because I&#8217;ve certainly encountered that even with some &#8230; Honestly, some schools that have interacted with Provision Path in different ways. You name a top design school in this country, they&#8217;ve reached out to me in some capacity about the show. Which is great. They like what the show is about. It&#8217;s filling a gap in their curriculum in some way that they&#8217;re not. But then if it comes down to me lecturing or teaching or something, it always seems to boil down to the fact that I don&#8217;t have a design degree. That they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, but &#8230;&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, stop wasting my time.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Stop wasting my time. And those kind of rules and terms don&#8217;t really serve anyone anymore. I mean, just the landscape has changed and design, because of technology, is just so accessible. And I know lots of brilliant designers who did not go to art school, and I don&#8217;t believe that you need to have a design degree to be brilliant at what you do. There are lots of people who have defied the convention of formal education and produced really entrancing, relevant, resonant work. And to me, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about. And so I don&#8217;t subscribe to this hierarchy of academia. I mean 30 years ago it was used to be exclusive and keep a lot of people out, and that was seen as a value, but I don&#8217;t think it serves anyone right now. Culture has changed and education has changed. And because of technology, everything is just more accessible. And so it&#8217;s really about what you are doing with the technology. It has nothing to do with did you go to school or not? That&#8217;s just such a reductive argument.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I agree. I agree. This actually is making me think of a question that I do want to explore more on the show this year. And since you&#8217;re one of the first guests on this year, I&#8217;ll ask you. I&#8217;m curious what you think about the future of the art and design industry and how it&#8217;s going to be impacted by technology. I think we&#8217;ve seen in at least the past year, maybe two years, talk about web three and NFTs and most recently AI generated art and things like that. How do you think these industries are going to be impacted by tech?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I think it already has been. What we call entrepreneurship is actually just hustlers. That&#8217;s what technology has given us. It&#8217;s given smart hustlers who are pulling and stretching and tweaking and bending the rigidity of so many of our institutions and our disciplines. The word I use a lot is it has expanded the notion of what design is, who it&#8217;s for, who it&#8217;s not for. And technology has brought so many things to people who would not otherwise have them. It just brings an aspect of the world to your doorstep. Technology for me, because I grew up outside of it and I was an adult &#8230; People who were born into technology, that&#8217;s what they know. That&#8217;s the real world. To me, it&#8217;s not the real world. It&#8217;s an aspect of the real world. And so I think of social media as tools.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think of it as real life. I think it&#8217;s a facsimile of real life. And so the language of how I talk about it has given me clarity in that I&#8217;m not confused about its place in my life. I started learning graphic design before we got our computer labs. And so I had two years of playing with typography, playing with a lot of the conventions of what is now basically archivable materials because nobody does it that way anymore. But because I learned design with my hands, that is how I continue to interface with it. I still draw out everything I do first. And that dexterity, frankly, has made me a better designer. I don&#8217;t rely on technology as a starting point for anything that I design. I bring it in to help move the process forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Good answer. I like that. You started talking about tech and that question just popped into my mind to ask you about that. But to go back to your career as an art director, you have a very storied history as an art director for several magazines. You mentioned Money Magazine, but you&#8217;ve also been an art director at Entertainment Weekly, at Mother Jones, at ReadyMade, just to name a few. When you look back at that time being a director for all these magazines, what stands out to you the most?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I can&#8217;t give just a simple answer. I can give a collective answer. Because I learned a lot. I learned a lot of things. And I don&#8217;t think in terms of best or worse because I think life is too complex for that. But what I did learn was agency. The word agency. Meaning that I am not stuck when I don&#8217;t know how to solve a problem. That there are ways and there are many paths to telling a story, and there&#8217;s no one way to do anything. And depending on the context of what you&#8217;re doing, I learned how to be a better communicator. Because when you&#8217;re working with a lot of people who are reliant on you, you learn that you are a cog in a wheel, but that your role, nobody else working with you has that. So everyone is really important to the process at different times.</p>
<p>And so you learn the economy of collaboration. That collaboration can be a really beautiful thing. And that there&#8217;s an excitement when you are working with people who are really good at what they do and that want to tell stories as well as possible. And that telling stories is one of the most unique aspects of being a human being. And that that is basically how we thrive and survive as people. We share information and we share stories with each other. And that&#8217;s where I learned that. I&#8217;m not sure I would answer this question in this way if I hadn&#8217;t worked at magazines. And I utilize magazines also to learn. And I did. I used them for two things within myself. To learn the process of what I was doing. And I moved around a lot.</p>
<p>I never worked at a magazine more than two years because I always wanted to learn what I was doing through a different landscape. There are lots of people that get a job and stay there for decades. I am someone who I learn what I need to learn and then I move on. I have always been that way. And so for me, it was what can I learn about the subject matter? I learned about the financial world, honestly, working in Money Magazine. I learned about the inner workings of celebrity culture, working at Entertainment Weekly. I learned about the wellness world at Health Magazine. I learned about technology working at Wired, working at ReadyMade, working at Afar. I really immerse myself in the subject matter to learn more about how these stories focused on this particular field. What was the combination, what was the metrics, what was the engineering of the subject matter? And so I was always kind of process nerd, if that makes sense. And that&#8217;s what I was always looking for. And with magazines, the process can become repetitive because you&#8217;re doing the same combination of things. And so the first year I was learning about the magazine and the second year I was learning about the subject matter. And then like clockwork, I&#8217;d come to the end of the two years and I&#8217;d move on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, was this sense of agency the inspiration behind you starting your studio?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes. I reached a point where I realized I wasn&#8217;t learning anything more. I wasn&#8217;t learning anything new. And I had all these skills that I wanted to apply in a different way. And it was working at ReadyMade that gave me the inspiration to open up my own studio, which was the second to last corporate magazine job that I had. And ReadyMade was a magazine about do-it-yourself design. It&#8217;s basically recycling. What we now call upcycling. It&#8217;s taking something that is at the end of its road as it&#8217;s being used and refashioning it for something else where it has an entirely new shelf life and you can use those things. And it was really just clever. It was just really clever design solutions. It&#8217;s taking cloths and making a kite out of it, or taking old jeans and turning it into place mats. Just stuff like that that is seen as quaint now, but was really at the vanguard of this recycling movement that is just more every day and more common.</p>
<p>It was recycling before recycling, even in California, was as ubiquitous as it is now. And I got to work with a lot of makers. People who just made things and who were just passionately, quietly &#8230; And not starting businesses, but just people who were making things for their own edification, for their homes. And I was honestly just really inspired. And I was just kind of like, oh, I know a lot of people who are working for themselves. And when I started thinking about it, I would talk to friends and contemporaries and professional acquaintances and everyone said, &#8220;Do it, do it. Do it. When you work for yourself, you will never go back to the corporate world.&#8221; And they were right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are the best types of clients for you to work with?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
It has both changed and remained the same. My interest is in culture. The identity of culture. And so I have coined a phrase just internally in my professional world that I am interested in culture clients. And in the early days it was &#8230; I live in San Francisco, so there are lots of artisans. There are people who are making small batches of things. There are restaurant owners. I was always working with clients who were working for themselves and needed help with the language and the messaging around branding. And so I worked with restaurants and I designed products and chocolates and tea, but I was really kind of more comprehensive. It was less me coming in to just design a package and it was basically working on the whole branding from the logo to the identity to the strategy to the messaging to the website, just the whole thing. And I realized that I was drawing on my editorial background to tell the whole story.</p>
<p>And so it expanded to &#8230; I started working with the tech world and then quickly stopped. Because I realized that they &#8230; I remember having a meeting with Uber. This was like 10 years ago. I was working with TripAdvisor and Uber. And these are big names, big clients at the time. I can tell you, TripAdvisor, I consulted with them for almost two years. They didn&#8217;t know how to assign photography. And so I worked with them comprehensively working with a photo editor to basically get them a library of photographers, come up with a system of rate assignments. Just basically the basics that one of the largest companies in the travel world had no awareness of. With Uber, it was they had been focused on the service for so long and they were starting to atrophy some of their customers because there was no story. There was nothing.</p>
<p>And the people who started Uber did not think that that was important until suddenly it was. And I remember having a meeting with them where I was like, &#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re just taking my ideas. I&#8217;m just here speaking to them.&#8221; And I was like, I don&#8217;t trust this field. I don&#8217;t want to have my intellectual property just ripped off and I&#8217;m not on the inside, so they&#8217;re not going to value what I&#8217;m doing. They&#8217;re going to treat me like a vendor, and I&#8217;m not anyone&#8217;s vendor. And I was really clear about my value to myself. And so I stopped working with the tech world for a few years and really just focused more on the one-on-one. And I worked with larger companies, but it was still where I had direct access to the founders and the CEOs so that I could thread continuity between what I was doing. I didn&#8217;t want to work with any intermediary people, so I had to be conscious of the scale that I was working in just to make sure that the projects didn&#8217;t get away from me. And I was also clear with myself that I wanted to keep my studio small, because I wanted to keep it manageable and basically control and frame the quality of the work that I was doing. I didn&#8217;t want to be embarrassed by anything that I was doing if it got too corporate.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I like that idea of culture clients because yeah, working with tech companies, they will just relegate you to vendor status and-</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
And they will just steal your shit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, they&#8217;ll steal it.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
No compunction about it. And it&#8217;s the people who don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing that want to steal your shit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I know in my instance, when I have worked with tech clients, it felt like &#8230; Or at least I entered into it thinking it would be more of a partnership. We would maybe bounce ideas off of each other or things like this. And in some instances, they just wanted to just cut the check, which I mean, look, I&#8217;ll take your money. I don&#8217;t have a problem with that. But I was really thinking that it would be more based on how the initial conversations went, why you sought me out, et cetera. And then it just ends up not being that. They just want to have it to be a bullet point on a DEI presentation.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
It is rarely that. And this is even before DEI so there was no representative of that. And that was the other reason. That I was often the only black person. And I was like, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want to do this.&#8221; I left publishing because I was tired of being the only black person. And for me, the tech industry has just become the new media publishing industry. I can see the corollaries and a lot of the people, a lot of my contemporaries have gone over and taken our playbook into the tech world. I mean, Apple very much has snapped up a lot of the most prominent magazine editorial art directors in the field in the United States. And so many of their campaigns, I&#8217;m looking and I can see the editorial strata of how these stories are shot and presented. It&#8217;s all going in that direction. And it should, because it&#8217;s the best form of storytelling. Advertising as a medium, as a typical form, I think is not very good at storytelling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, they are not. In addition to the work that you do through your studio, and you alluded to this earlier in the interview, you&#8217;re a columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle. How did that come about?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Well, it came about the year that I started the original 29 day project of Illustrated Black History. I tell you, Maurice, it was just a year where I just lost my mind and just began drawing and painting obsessively, just everything. I was just manic for it. And it was like it had been bottled up and it all just came out. And so that year I took a sabbatical, which means that I stopped taking on work. And when I tell you that I had no money, I mean I had no money. I was just living off of my savings. It was a really reckless thing to do, and I&#8217;m a pretty cautious person. And I knew that it was the right thing because it just came so easily to me. I fired all my clients and just started everything from scratch. And so I gave myself the time to do that, and I was also trying to figure out how to make a living with it.</p>
<p>And so I ended up doing a series. A series of series. And that is also a playbook from my magazine days. You tell a story in multiple images, threading a narrative and a continuity from beginning, middle to end. And so I did several series on my family, on Illustrated Black History, and then I started documenting the visual identity of San Francisco. And I was really fascinated by the human ecosystem of the Bay Area. And I&#8217;d been working on another series about how the tech industry started in the Bay Area and how it could not really have started anywhere else and just all of these threads were coming together. And I had this epiphany one day where I knew that I wanted to do a culture column on the makeup, on the genetic makeup of San Francisco and the Bay Area.</p>
<p>And I had been inspired by a morbid thing. It was when Bill Cunningham, who used to be a columnist for the New York Times, and he was a style photographer and he documented black style in Brooklyn and Harlem, and he equated black style with high fashion, which is something the fashion industry did not do and still does not do, even though they think they do. I was just like, &#8220;Oh, I think this is what I should do.&#8221; And I remember writing a pitch and deciding whether I was going to send it to the New York Times or the San Francisco Chronicle. And because of my magazine background, I outlined everything to myself and I wrote a pro and con list about the San Francisco Chronicle versus the New York Times and how much creative freedom I was going to have. And the whole idea for the column was that I would be writing, illustrating and designing this column, documenting various events that gave you a larger sense of what the Bay Area was all about and what made it unique and special and also frustrating and just all of the things that just brought all the complexities in.</p>
<p>And I sent that to the woman who became my editor, and she wrote back immediately and she said, &#8220;This is brilliant. We&#8217;re going to do this.&#8221; And I remember thinking at the time, &#8220;Holy shit. I didn&#8217;t think she&#8217;d respond this quickly, and now I have to do this on a monthly basis.&#8221; And it was one of the best experiences I&#8217;ve ever had. I would go out to cultural events several nights a week, and I just became this man about town for years. And I would show up as a reporter with my notebook and my pens, and sometimes I would live draw and sometimes I would draw later on and I just drew this column every month and designed it for the style section of the Chronicle, and I did that for years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. When it comes to work between what you do in your studio and what you do for the newspaper, is your approach different for each one?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I work in parallel lines, as I&#8217;m sure my answers are starting to illustrate. I&#8217;m always on the inside and outside of what I do, and I&#8217;m looking at both sides of it at the same time. And I think I developed that skill as a magazine person because there&#8217;s not just the story that you&#8217;re working on, it&#8217;s the process of how the story is being made that is as important as the story that you&#8217;re making. And as a designer, you are at the intersection of words and images, and so you&#8217;re never just looking at one aspect of anything. And it has just expanded my brain, I think, where now I can&#8217;t help but think of everything through this parallel thread of thinking. And so in terms of making this column for years, I knew that I was training myself to do basically all aspects of what I was doing.</p>
<p>I was always an art director, so I would have been the designer of the column, but I would&#8217;ve been working with a writer and working with an illustrator. But in combining all of those skills, I was sharpening my capabilities, but I was also training myself for this kind of repetitive monthly grind where it just became less of a grind. I remember the first year I was just stressed out all the time, and then suddenly it settled and it was not a stress anymore. And the column used to take me several days to do. And towards the end of that initial run, it would take me 24 hours to do the whole thing. And it just became a little more fine tuned. I really was able to pace myself. I knew what I needed to do. I knew what I needed to accomplish. And so you just anticipate what you need and then you do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you say your artistic style has evolved over the years?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
To answer your previous question, I do &#8230; And I&#8217;m answering both at the same time. I think I have developed a way of backing into the style. I often don&#8217;t know what style I&#8217;m going to do when I start something, and this book is evidence of that. I really just feel my way into what I was doing. The original column had a lot of different styles, but I basically invented a newspaper style because I wanted it to be stylized. I had to do things quickly, it had to be out of a economy of time. So I developed a shortcut of illustrating that for the longest time my contemporaries thought was my style. And then when I started working on the book, even close friends were like, &#8220;Oh, this is totally different from what you have been doing with the Chronicle.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I was like, &#8220;Yeah, this book is actually what my work is actually.&#8221; But I&#8217;ve been doing this shorter version of it for a while and it has just become what I&#8217;ve been known for. But the truth is I tend to start from scratch every single time, and I do it in my design world and whether I&#8217;m designing something, whether I am illustrating it, fine art, it is a brand new thing every time I&#8217;m sitting to do it, even if I&#8217;ve done it before. And so I&#8217;m considering all of the layers. I was like, what is best going to serve this story? Is it something that&#8217;s in pencil? Is it something that is in paint? Is it typography? I just think freshly about everything that I&#8217;m doing, and I throw out what has come before. I honor what has come before, but I don&#8217;t get stuck in the nostalgia of what I&#8217;m doing. I will throw everything out and start it up again if I think that that is the right thing to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the people that have really helped motivate and inspire you over the years?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
There are so many hidden figures in my life. The truth is, it&#8217;s not a lot of artists. The artists who inspire my work are not contemporary artists. They&#8217;re people that I grew up admiring. And where I find my inspiration is not really in other people, it&#8217;s in nature. The natural world really provides a lot of my motivation. But in terms of the people who have inspired they&#8217;re close family friends, they&#8217;re people I consider mentors in my life that have just always been many times the last few years where I&#8217;ve just admitted to my internal community, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing. I&#8217;m just literally making this up. And there have been many times, there were many times that first year of launching out as an artist where there wasn&#8217;t a month that went by that I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think this is going to work. I think I need to stop doing this. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to figure out how to make a living. I don&#8217;t think this is working.&#8221;</p>
<p>And no one person would let me do that. Everyone was just like, &#8220;Nope, nope, nope. Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.&#8221; And I&#8217;m grateful for that because that the first year I was absolutely flabbergasted how I was going to make this thing work. And I could see the talent and I could see that there was something there, but how all the pieces fit together in terms of continuity and financial stability, I didn&#8217;t see it. And then I got the column and the column I didn&#8217;t give the context for. I started six months after I started being an artist. And that was the first light bulb where I was like, oh, I think I know how to package this work.</p>
<p>And then I started getting more assignments and then it just picked up from there. And there were many stages of the process where something else would happen and I&#8217;d think, &#8220;Oh, okay, yes, that&#8217;s how this fits in.&#8221; And, &#8220;Oh, right. And then I can do that.&#8221; And then when I got my book deal, I realized that my column had been training me to do this book and that I had certainly designed lots of books, but this was the first time that I was all things and that I&#8217;d been doing a version of that for the last few years. And so I had been prepping myself for this larger project that I think it would&#8217;ve been much harder to do if I had not been doing it. So I just started seeing how all the pieces were fitting together.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you appreciate the most about your life right now?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
That I get to do what I love. I am happy. I am as happy as a pig in shit. I feel really fortunate that I am passionately in love with the creative world that I&#8217;ve given myself. I get to work with all of the things and the skills that I&#8217;ve been given. And there&#8217;s so much I&#8217;ve learned over the years that I get to relearn and apply in a different way. And I&#8217;ve learned that I get bored really easily and I&#8217;m not bored by anything that I do right now, which tells me that I&#8217;m doing the right thing. Learning is an absolute essential part of what I do, and I place myself on the ground floor of everything that I do because I see myself as a student also. And so I remain energized by what I do. I have a genuine love of what I get to do on a daily basis.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing? What kind of projects do you want to work on? Where do you see yourself in the near future?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I have to say I&#8217;m already doing what I see myself doing in another five years. I&#8217;m going to be making a lot of books. I&#8217;m designing a lot of books. I am making a lot of books. My next book is actually on the publishing industry. And I&#8217;m also starting to expand into three-dimensional spaces. I&#8217;m finishing up my first stint as an exhibition designer. I&#8217;m designing a museum show that is premiering in another few weeks in California and it&#8217;s a major show for a major artist by the name of Mike Henderson, as a black artist who is having a renaissance right now and he requested a black designer specifically. And the cultural aspects of design is something I&#8217;m really keyed to and always representing the black perspective so the people know that design is not neutral. I went to school and grew up hearing this fallacy that design is objective and neutral, and I know that it is not.</p>
<p>And so I teach in that way, I design in that way, I educate in that way, I work in that way. And so I just see more three-dimensional spaces. I see designing interiors, I see designing fully comprehensive experiences where you can see the two dimensionality of the design process in terms of type and art on the walls, but also the three dimensional aspect. The mood and the tone and the feeling of what you should be feeling, of what the average person can walk into a space and experience. That is what I&#8217;m going to be doing a lot of in coming days and weeks and years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, your work, the book? Of course, we&#8217;ll put the book in the show notes, but where can people find out more information about you if they want to follow you?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Well, the book itself, the book was published in late September of 2022, so it is everywhere. And the book, I&#8217;m really happy to share, has gone into its second printing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you so much. The response has just been &#8230; It has been a very emotional few months as people &#8230; Because you make a thing as you know as a designer, but then you don&#8217;t really know how people are going to respond to it. And so I have just been amazed and rendered mute many times by the messages that I&#8217;ve received and the responses of the people that I&#8217;ve met out on the tour. And so this book is everywhere. You can get it at any bookstore, anywhere, all over the country. Of course, I always tell people to support their independent bookstores, so if you are buying it, you don&#8217;t have to buy it from the devil, Amazon. There are lots of local bookstores that would love to have your support. And as far as just my social media feed, all of it is the same, whether on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. It is McCalman.co. M-C-C-A-L-M-A-N-C-O, McCalman.co.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, George McCalman, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show for-</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Thank you so much. Thank you, Maurice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. One, for just sharing your story of how you come into art and really studied it and then going on as an art director, but then also the process of the book. And I think to me, what is probably most important about this conversation is how you&#8217;ve taken that flame of creativity and found a way to really expand it out as far as you can into as many different places as possible. Like you&#8217;re teaching, you&#8217;re doing client work, you&#8217;ve got the book, you&#8217;re a columnist, and now I feel like this expansion into 3D space, even as you mentioned, definitely seems like the inevitable next step for where you&#8217;re going. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Your questions were incredibly thoughtful. I&#8217;m really grateful for your interest in talking to me, and thank you. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m going to say. Thank you so much.</p>

<p>How will you pursue your passions in 2023? If you&#8217;re anything like this week&#8217;s guest, Chris Charles, then you&#8217;ve probably already got some great plans in motion. Chris is a true multihyphenate &#8212; a creative director, a film maker, a visual artist, a photographer, and more &#8212; and he&#8217;s blazing his own trail while staying 100% authentic to himself.</p>
<p>We caught up recently and talked about some of his plans for this year with his studio, and he shared his process for approaching new projects while also discussing how he balances the business and creative sides of his work. Chris also spoke about growing up in Brooklyn, joining and serving in the Army for over a decade, and talked about how his style has evolved over the years. He even shared the one project that he&#8217;s the most proud of out of his impressive body of work. Chris is a true example of how staying adaptable and building great relationships can be a recipe for success!</p>

All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Hey, first, thank you for having me, Maurice. Really been digging the platform since I&#8217;ve been introduced to it. Once again, thank you for having me, man. My name is Chris Charles. I am a photographer, creative director, designer. I just try to bundle it all up into&#8230; As a creative designer or art director.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. How are things going so far? I know it&#8217;s just the start of the new year, but how are things going for you?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, so far so good. I was very intentional about taking some time off leading into the new year, so I can kind of rest a little bit, spend time with family. So, thankful I have been able to get that time in and spend time with the kids and the fam. But yeah, so far so good. It&#8217;s kind of taken me a day or so to still get into the flow again of work, and consistently checking emails and communicating again. But yeah, I&#8217;m ready to get it popping.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I told myself this year that I&#8217;m going to start turning my phone off one day of the week. So I&#8217;ll turn it off Saturday night, turn it back on Monday morning. And I tried that, actually, a few days ago, just so people know we&#8217;re recording this at the top of the year, but I did it over New Years. It was so peaceful. That Sunday was so extremely peaceful. Monday was super productive, and it was so peaceful that I didn&#8217;t remember to turn my phone on until Monday afternoon or evening. And I turned it on, and I mean the flood of notifications. People were like, &#8220;Are you all right? Is everything&#8230;&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m fine. I just turned my phone off for 36 hours.&#8221; It&#8217;s good, the world can wait.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
You are much better than me. So I have measures implemented to where my phone isn&#8217;t as invasive as I know people who have all the alerts on, the lock screen thing. And so what I&#8217;ve done is I turned off notifications on my lock screen, the one that kills the battery. I keep my phone on silent with the exception of a few key numbers; my mom, my partner, my daughter, people who they will need to get to me just in case something happens. Other than that&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know if I can just turn my phone off. I think for me, it&#8217;s easier to just have it readily available so people can reach me in the event that they have an emergency. But kudos to you, man. I don&#8217;t know how you did it, but you did it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s an experiment. I just tried it once. So we&#8217;ll see if it sticks.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I&#8217;d have to send a mass email or text message to everyone to let them know, hey, I&#8217;m out the loop. I&#8217;m not communicating for X amount of time, so don&#8217;t expect a response but in the event of emergency, call this other number. I have to have an emergency contact person in place just for that, but.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I might end up doing that too because certainly I turned my phone back on, and I guess the way that my phone is set up too, I can get text messages on my computer, I can get some notifications, but it just wasn&#8217;t on my phone. And so I still was able to do some things, I just couldn&#8217;t or didn&#8217;t respond back to people right away and stuff. But let&#8217;s just say I&#8217;m paying for that today. I&#8217;m having to do a lot of catch up today.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, a long day of responding to folks, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But that Sunday was so peaceful. I was like, I&#8217;m doing this again. I can&#8217;t stress how no pings or nothing. That whole Sunday, I cooked breakfast, I listened to some jazz, I was chill all Sunday. I&#8217;m like, I want that feeling every week. I&#8217;m going to try to see if I can stick to it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I think you can do it. I think you can do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at last year, what do you want to change bringing into this year? You mentioned taking some time for rest.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m part Jamaican so I don&#8217;t know any other thing than to work all the time. Running my business but also working another job across town, and I just left that job before the new year, just because it just didn&#8217;t make sense commuting that far several times a week. But yeah, I think for me, working smarter not harder for 2023. I think 2022&#8230; And most of my career, I spent a lot of it doing all of the heavy lifting. I&#8217;ve had assistants in the past who helped manage communications and emails and I&#8217;ve worked with tons of young artists who volunteer their time, and some I&#8217;ve actually mentored and was able to get them going with their businesses. But I think it&#8217;s time to build a team. And I think it&#8217;s time to start delegating versus me being the lead communicator, the lead invoice generator and the lead key artist on set and then the key editor. Time is so much more important to me, I&#8217;m realizing, especially now that I have a young baby, six months old.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow. Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you, thank you. His name is Cerulean Amir, and he&#8217;s amazing. But yeah, I think moving into 2023 I definitely want to facilitate me being more present, and the way these knees are set up, doing all the squatting and getting all the angles, I would rather be able to guide that process through other people who are under the umbrella of my business.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hear you.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the goal.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s talk more about your work in your studio, Chris Charles Co., which you&#8217;ve ran now for 15 years, so congratulations on that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me a little bit more about it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So, ultimately, and this kind of plays into the vision for this year and moving forward. I&#8217;ve always kind of been a multidisciplinary artist, I mean with roots in obviously photography, design, music. I produce music as well. I&#8217;ve worked with a few artists and I&#8217;ve always felt that the three words that I&#8217;ve used to encompass my business are style, creativity and soul. And for me, that&#8217;s kind of the type of person when it comes to aesthetic that I always wanted to be. Even when I was a kid, I just wanted to be cool. And that being influenced by music and jazz and seeing how cool those people were.</p>
<p>I always wanted to have whatever business I ran encompass those kind of things. Just like a cool energy, a cool vibe, some fly music going on, some fly art, whatever it is. So yeah, I think my business, while I also focused on trying to strive to be technically proficient, but it was also about creating a vibe or a feeling to the point where whatever I put out in the universe via the internet, it&#8217;s a reflection of those three things, style, creativity and soul. So I&#8217;ve just kind of ran with it and it seems to have helped me find my voice over these years. So that&#8217;s pretty much&#8230; Be it design, photography, music, show-making, those are the things that I&#8217;ve really pushed to have come to the forefront.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So given all of that, what are the best types of clients for you to work with? I know you mentioned musicians, but are there other types of clients that you find you work best with?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Honestly, I work just other artists in general. DJs, musicians, visual artists. I&#8217;ve worked with other photographers doing portraits and collaborating with them, painters and also high-level business people. For some reason, it&#8217;s more like a, wow, this person is amazing. I could learn so much from them, and they hired me to do this work. You know what I mean? So it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s feeding my desire to learn more and have goals based off of what I&#8217;m seeing this person has done, and I&#8217;m actually doing what I love to do while learning. So yeah, I would say anyone in the arts, like I said, high-level business people. I&#8217;ve worked with district court judges, I&#8217;ve worked with mayors, mayoral candidates, city council people, attorneys, high-end real estate folks, and all of these people have great lessons that I can pull from to use at some point in my business. So this is great. I love that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So given that variety, how do you approach creating a new project or working on a new design project? Because I would imagine with each of those types of clients, the setup might be a little different, I&#8217;m guessing.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah. One thing I used to struggle with&#8230; Well, I won&#8217;t say I struggled with it, but one thing I had to really understand was find a way to maintain whatever vision or artistic integrity I had while still fulfilling my clients&#8217; needs. And sometimes those things don&#8217;t always align, and I&#8217;ve had to adapt and adjust in order to facilitate my client being happy and just doing the work. But yeah, I think for me, I just like to assume that people who have hired me, it&#8217;s not like sight unseen. They&#8217;ve seen examples of my work and they&#8217;ve seen&#8230; Or other people who I&#8217;ve worked with and they&#8217;re like, hey, I want that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve had some clients who have no&#8230; Whatever I do, whatever they want was the opposite. So that I think has been a big challenge over the years. But ultimately, it&#8217;s just about adapting and adjusting, interjecting those three things, style, creativity and soul while still keeping whatever format my client wants to maintain their brand and push their image forward. So it&#8217;s a lot of, I&#8217;d say, adjustment. I don&#8217;t want to say shape-shifting, but it&#8217;s more like a, yeah, I can do this, but I can still slide some of these elements that I always kind of hearken to for this person.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like that&#8217;s a common thing with multidisciplinary folks. It&#8217;s like we know that we can do a lot of different things, and sometimes the client is aware of that and sometimes they just want the one thing that they want, but it is a lot of adjusting to try to make sure you&#8217;re fitting in with the scope of the project, their involvement in terms of how things are going. It is a lot of&#8230; It&#8217;s a constant adjustment, I find.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, it is. And I don&#8217;t know, I think by nature, just based off of my travels, even as a child I&#8217;ve always been very adaptable, but I&#8217;ve always tried to stick to a certain thing that, okay, well I&#8217;m going to do this but I&#8217;m going to do it this way. And it kind of made me a rebel. When I say that, I mean I&#8217;ll follow the rules but up to a certain point that I&#8217;m just going to just do it this other way because I think it&#8217;s more efficient. I kind of relate that to working with clients and just adapting. And yeah, I hear what you&#8217;re saying. I know you want the logo with the money, the dollar signs raining and all of that, but maybe we can simplify it a little bit. Here, let me show you this. So I found using examples of other brands within that person&#8217;s market helps kind of dial those things in for me too, so I don&#8217;t have to really have too much conflict.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you handle the business side of everything? Because the work definitely is the creative part. That&#8217;s what you specialize in. But, when it comes to marketing and contracts and finance, how do you balance that with the more creative aspects of your work?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It took me a while to actually find a rhythm with managing all the things outside of the art and creating, but eventually I was able to figure out a way to say, for example, automate my booking process so I don&#8217;t have to have these conversations and these email threads that just lead to dead ends. Usually if someone clicks and books, they&#8217;ve already made their mind that they want book me. So that saved me so much time. I&#8217;d also, say, having an assistant, I had a really great assistant and then she moved on to greater things. But I really learned to appreciate how&#8230; For one, she was really good at what she does, and she actually is based in Atlanta, so she was working virtually. But that type of communication, I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;m a horrible communicator, but sometimes I&#8217;m too busy out working to communicate in a timely manner.</p>
<p>And having someone who that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re doing for me made it so much easier. But other than that, it&#8217;s just kind of trial and error. It&#8217;s like, hey, I&#8217;ve gone through so many phases with trying this invoicing system or trying this business bank account to see that works in payment gateways and figuring out the most seamless, easiest way for a customer to pay a deposit and then book it online without having to have conversation, after conversation, after conversation. So yeah, it&#8217;s been a journey. It&#8217;s definitely been a journey, but I&#8217;ve been able to figure it out just based off of trial and error and kind of doing what works, but also evolving, being open to evolve. There&#8217;s a few things I want to add into the mix this year. Definitely want to get someone to do the actual books and have an accountant, or someone who I can contract to have to do the accounting. Because I&#8217;m pretty much doing it all of that myself as well, so.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now outside of that, being in the arts and being self-employed, that&#8217;s a lot to balance, I think particularly with just the way that our attention economy kind of works. What are some of the biggest challenges that you&#8217;ve had to face staying independent and doing this for as long as you have?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Dealing with the economy. I think managing&#8230; Be sustainable, which is every business during economic downturns, and that&#8217;s another challenge. I&#8217;d say just dealing with the ebb and flow. My business is a cash flow-based business, and most businesses that, but fortunately I don&#8217;t have much overhead, so that makes it a lot easier. I&#8217;m not producing a physical product that requires me to buy inventory and surplus. So that in itself has really helped me manage the challenges of an economic downturn and keeping clients and being able to have clients who just keep coming back. And some of my best clients are those repeat clients. But ultimately also over-saturation. Over-saturation. When I started doing photography professionally, there were just maybe a handful of really, really great photographers in my area who I looked upon for inspiration, and I saw they had things established. They did great work.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now, it&#8217;s like you can just close your eyes and point your finger one direction, and you&#8217;re probably pointing at a photographer. You know what I mean? So staying relevant, being open to new ideas is kind of, like a lot of artists, I think specifically more with musicians and kind of trying to grow their art and their craft while still maintaining that voice that put them on in the first place. So for me, I don&#8217;t want to look at it as competition. However, it is somewhat of a competition. This is a free market. So if I want to be competitive in this market, I have to pay attention to what other people who are 20 years younger than me are doing. And if I have a client and suddenly I see my client shooting with this 20-something year old, I&#8217;m like, oh okay, great. Yay. But also, I&#8217;m like, huh, how&#8217;d that happen? What do I need to do to where I can keep this particular client or clients? So yeah, it&#8217;s a few challenges.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know when I was actively having clients and doing client work, one of the biggest challenges, aside from what you mentioned, is just making sure that they still keep you sort of top of mind with what they do. Because I think, like you said, there&#8217;s over-saturation sometimes in the market and there&#8217;s a number of different people that folks could choose from to do kind of the same work. And so I think it&#8217;s really important also to just have those relationships. The relationship building part is so important with so many other people out there, because the benefit I think that we have, you and I, and probably others of our age group, is being able to build those relationships as opposed to just putting out whatever the newest, hottest, latest, fastest tool or product is that can get the job done.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it&#8217;s about relationships. You mentioned one of the clients you&#8217;ve had has been a mayoral candidate. I did a mayoral race back in 2009. The person didn&#8217;t win, the candidate didn&#8217;t win, but she ended up working then for a nonprofit organization and I had that organization a retainer for five or six years. And then every place that she ended up going, I kind of followed her in some aspect in terms of like, oh yeah, I could do this work, I could do this work. Or just keeping top of mind so they know, oh, well I know someone who could use you. So then that relationship building really comes into play because your name gets mentioned in rooms and other places that you&#8217;re not necessarily available.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Exactly, exactly. And yeah, I think I&#8217;ve definitely been fortunate to have had several of those types of clients where I&#8217;m talking about 10, and you mentioned the foreign exchange. It&#8217;s almost like 10 years we&#8217;ve been working together. And then of course, with Nikolai individually and with Phonte individually, it&#8217;s been like I&#8217;ve been their go-to guy, and I appreciate that. I have some clients who, once again, are in the political scene and some musicians who, there&#8217;s no question they will call me, and I don&#8217;t take that for granted. But also it&#8217;s because we can sit down and kick it after we do a long shoot. We go grab some food, we have a couple of beers, and we kick it for a little while and just decompress and catch up. I value that.</p>
<p>Because to me, that&#8217;s connection. And for me, especially when it comes to doing portrait work and photographing people, it&#8217;s important that I established that rapport, which could potentially lead to a cool relationship and friendship. But I can&#8217;t get a good picture of someone if we&#8217;re doing a session, if we haven&#8217;t had a conversation that kind of face-to-face, and that way we can feel each other out. I can see where I need to go, how I need to handle this particular photo shoot. Yeah, I&#8217;ve been able to, like I said, make some really great, great friends because of that relationship aspect that you mentioned.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I just started back doing some client work through my studio now, and one thing I&#8217;ve been doing is going back through my old contact list of clients. And the first of the year, best time to do it, best time to restart a dormant relationship or a dormant former communication. Just hit them up, Happy New Year, how are things going? This is what I&#8217;m doing. Because people just kind of have that energy at the top of the year to want to do something new, try something new. So it&#8217;s a good time now to make those relationships happen or to try to at least begin to forge them.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Absolutely. Yeah. Just before Christmas, I sent out some tests, newsletters with some things just to see, once again, updating that client list and seeing do I need to remove or add some things and change and seeing the response and looking at the numbers. So yeah, you nailed it, man. Definitely going to be doing the same this year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to get more into your work and some of the clients that you work with. Of course, you mentioned foreign exchange, which we&#8217;ll talk about later, but I want to hear more about your origin story. I know you&#8217;re in North Carolina now. Is that where you&#8217;re from? Is that where you grew up?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
No, I actually grew up in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. ell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Spent my formative years in Brooklyn, but also going back and forth between Brooklyn and Jamaica. We usually go every summer, or every other summer. And Brooklyn is a melting pot of West Indian and Caribbean culture, anyway. So yeah, growing up in New York was such a great experience for me. I think I tell people I grew up, I think in during the best era to grow up, which was the late &#8217;70s going into the &#8217;80s. Because once again, I literally would&#8217;ve had a Irish neighbor across the street. Their neighbor was Italian, who was my first babysitter. We had a Puerto Rican family on the corner. We had the Haitian family right there. You had my family, which was a mixed ethnicity. You had people from Aruba, people from Barbados. It was such a melting pot of culture. So I was exposed to a lot of different languages and a lot of different foods and energies. And thankfully, my parents and I, we traveled.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d get on a plane and go somewhere, go to LA, go to Jamaica, and my dad had family in Pennsylvania, so we&#8217;d be in the mountains. Just being in that type of environment or those types of environments where I&#8217;m surrounded by so many different things, it influenced me and grew up in a very musical household and very artistic household. And I played guitar, took formal guitar lessons for years, and my household was the type of household that always had music playing, be it jazz or reggae music. So my parents loved to dance. We do the New Year&#8217;s Eve party at our Puerto Rican friends&#8217; home, and they&#8217;d be dancing salsa all night. So I just love music and culture. So, I couldn&#8217;t help but be influenced by all of that growing up during that time in New York. So went to high school, did that. Played football in high school, actually. So I wound up going to college initially at a Kentucky Wesley College with a partial scholarship to play football. And that was a disaster because that was my kind of first time away from home.</p>
<p>Being in Kentucky as a New York dude was kind of different for me. I made it through football camp, and I was like yeah, I&#8217;m not feeling this, and I went back home. So I had to regroup, and my parents were looking at me like, okay, so what are we going to do? You can&#8217;t just be laying around here. You know what I mean? You got to do something. So I said, okay. Always loved architecture, always loved art and clean lines and drafting. I took drafting in high school, so I pursued a degree in architectural engineering, the New York Institute of Technology in Farmingdale, it&#8217;s a [inaudible 00:24:32] entity, and that was great. But I also have a military family. All my uncles were in the military. My dad was a Marine, my brother was in the army, and that&#8217;s also something I always knew I wanted to do. I was a boy scout and I loved wearing a uniform. I was one weird kids who just loved putting on a uniform and being fresh. So yeah, I did college and then immediately joined the Army.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So this is, what, &#8217;93, &#8217;94. And wound up getting a job doing surveying, but it was for artillery. So I kind of got hoodwinked. I kind of got made switch with you have engineering background. Yeah, this could be a great job for you. But I&#8217;m sitting next to a [inaudible 00:25:18] blowing up stuff, you know what I mean? But ultimately, it was good. I had a good time, did a couple of overseas tours, and I made sergeant. And so now I had to manage a team, and that kind of taught me leadership and politics when it came to, not just the military, but corporate, I came to find out later.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s where corporate gets it from, so that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Structures, politics of it all. They parallel each other. So anyway, I decided maybe I want to change jobs. So in the military, they have what you can do as reclassifying. So I reclassified as a communication specialist, and more specifically a network switchboard engineer. So like an internet guy, basically. And that was great because it basically helped me transition out of the military eventually with those same skillset sets. And I was able to apply them. But meanwhile, I was also a paratrooper, so I was jumping out of airplanes and went to jump master school. So I was jump master qualified. I was aero [inaudible 00:26:16] qualified.</p>
<p>So I was propelling out of helicopter, jumping out of airplanes, doing all the cool stuff, even though I had these technical jobs, because that was kind of that guy who just wanted to do the hard stuff as much as possible while I still had the young legs. So yeah, eventually 2003, after my last deployment in Iraq&#8230; Well, 2004 is when I began&#8230; I came back, I think April, and put in my paperwork to get out the military because I just felt it was time. My daughter was very young at the time. She&#8217;s 21 now. But I just didn&#8217;t want to be away from her and missing her grow and potentially not being able to see her again, not making it back from the deployment is very real.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Especially right around that time in the early 2000s. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah. 2003, 2004, maybe going in 2005, &#8217;06 was a rough one because the warfare over there with the IEDs&#8230; And it was really bad at one point. And I was there for that when you never knew if you were going to get blown up in a convo at some point. And that hit me. That was real, that was real to me. I said I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m a smart guy, I think I&#8217;ll be able to figure something out, especially with the skillsets that I gained in the military. And that&#8217;s what I did. So I got out of the military in November, 2004, and haven&#8217;t looked back since. I transitioned almost immediately into a corporate IT job.</p>
<p>And that was great. I did that for about five years. And then 2009, the 2008, the bubble burst and the economy tanked, and I wound up getting laid off. So here I am, had a corporate job, great benefits, great pay, and now I got laid off. Never happened to me before. I didn&#8217;t know what that felt like. And it was horrible being called into the operation manager&#8217;s office with all of us who got laid off. It wasn&#8217;t just myself, walking back to your desk and you see all your stuff packed up in a box on the table with a security guy waiting to walk you out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It was embarrassing. You feel powerless, you just feel like, wow, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing? Wound up getting laid off. And I had to really, really sit on it for a minute. And then I realized that was a universe kind of pushing me in the direction of becoming an artist full-time. Now keep in mind, when I was working at this particular company, I became good friends with the art director there, and he knew I was kind of dabbling in photography, and he invited me to drive to Boston to shoot a wedding because I guess he&#8217;d seen some of the work I was doing just for free. And he thought I had an eye. So he took me, and that was the first paid gig I ever had as a photographer shooting that wedding. And that&#8217;s when also the light bulb clicked.</p>
<p>Was kind of already getting over the job, it was very stressful as far as just the IT and networking, dealing with clients, having to take the blame for other people&#8217;s mistakes or whatever. So when he says, hey man, I&#8217;m going to cut you a check for $1500, just drive to Boston in my Audi. I was like, oh shit. Okay, let&#8217;s go. Hey, maybe I can just keep doing this. And then a few months later, I wound up getting laid off. So it was all serendipitous how it happened, even though I wasn&#8217;t seeing that at the time. But it definitely helped guide me into the direction I kind of eventually went. So I took my GI bill and took a little bit of time off. Because I did get a bit of a pension, not a pension, but a severance day. So I was able to survive and pay my bills, but eventually enrolled back into college and wound up getting a degree in graphic design while slowly building my business and getting to know the community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So that was a very big transformative time for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And in hindsight, like you said, it worked out in the end. Something I want to just touch on, you mentioned though that time between, I would say roughly the mid 2000s, 2004 to 2008, 2009, that was such a&#8230; And I can&#8217;t stress this enough for designers that were not around during that time. That was such a wild time in terms of just design, I guess you could lump tech in with it, but particularly web design, graphic design. So many things were changing in that just five-year span that you were lucky if you could stay at the same place for that long because the technology was changing, the browsers were changing, the actual hardware itself was changing, the software was changing. There were so many changes that took place that it would be hard to keep up with everything that&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. And I don&#8217;t know, for me I think what helped me was being in school&#8230; And at the time I was still using Windows, for example, but we had iMac Labs where I was able to kind of&#8230; I was like, oh, this is nice. Okay, cool, cool, cool. But not only the technology, but I guess you said the design language, right? Like I said, I loved architecture, I loved clean lines. I loved a certain minimalist aesthetic. And I started noticing design shifting to that versus heavy drop shadow and beveled fonts. And a lot of overly-designed things that have, and I attribute that to Apple, actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I think Apple&#8217;s brand pretty much influenced the design world when it came to aesthetic and minimalism. Being able to be able to sell something and tell a story as cleanly as simply as possible and maybe using really great imagery overlay with text. So that whole look&#8230; Like when I started seeing that and I realized that that&#8217;s kind of how I love that, that&#8217;s what it was for me. So it made my transition fairly easy. Because I just wanted to stick to that aesthetic. It was just, like you said, learning the technology and learning in Design and Illustrator and all those things. I was pretty good in Photoshop already. But those other Adobe products, they were kicking my butt for a while. But I think I got a handle of them now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember the macro media stuff when it switched over to Adobe. I used Fireworks a lot in one of my old jobs. And then Fireworks pretty much became obsolete. Adobe bought Macromedia and changed a bunch of stuff over. And then I was a web designer at the time. There was the whole switch from table-based layouts to CSS-based layouts. Which then changed the browser because the browser then was less about just display and it became more of a canvas. It became more of somewhere you can create things just on there and not have to transpose. I remember cutting up tables in Dream Weaver and exporting them over and making sure everything was right. But now you could use CSS and you could float things and create divs&#8230;</p>
<p>And it was just such a big shift&#8230; It was a really seismic shift, I think, in design online during that time. And yeah, also the switch from the nineties style of design, especially with tables and things like that because they borrowed a lot from print, to more clean lines. Because it&#8217;s just based on what the browser did, because the browsers then had to catch up. This is after the whole browser wars of the late &#8217;90s and stuff. But browsers became less about, oh, this is just a place you can view a website. It&#8217;s like, no, this is a place where you can build a website. There&#8217;s technologies, there&#8217;s like a stack in the browser where you can make things. It was just such a&#8230; I look back at that time fondly, but also in hindsight, there was a lot going on.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t think&#8230; for me, I wasn&#8217;t aware of it at the time. I was just like, oh, okay. This is cool. Oh, this is&#8230; Okay, cool. This is cool. That&#8217;s cool. I even look at&#8230; I use Photoshop a lot, for example, and I look at Photoshop from back then to now and how much I can do that I really couldn&#8217;t do without having to download a plugin or something. And the same thing with everything in the Adobe Suite. I was using Premiere for a while and I just couldn&#8217;t, didn&#8217;t jive with me. So even now transitioning over to Da Vinci Resolve has been like, my head explodes every time I use it. So it&#8217;s so phenomenal. And it doesn&#8217;t bog down my CPU. I don&#8217;t have to open up a whole nother program to do as much. I can do it all in here. I can do audio the same time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
This is awesome. For 300 bucks, I don&#8217;t have to do a subscription, a yearly subscription. I [inaudible 00:34:48] with it. So I&#8217;m just really thankful for it. I love technology, so I&#8217;m thankful for technology. I&#8217;m kind of a computer nerd. I was as a kid, backtracking real quick, I used to write programs on the old&#8230; Gosh, it wasn&#8217;t an IBM computer. It was a Commodore.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, the Commodore 64?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. Definitely showing our age. Because that one [inaudible 00:35:12]. Yeah, I&#8217;d go to the library and rent and take out these coding books and you&#8217;d spend three hours writing code just to make the colors on the screen. And that was fascinating to me. Just learning syntax. And anyway, so it helped me, even in corporate. When I was working in corporate, I had to&#8230; The company I was working for, it was a proprietary voiceover IP network, one of the first in the country. So I would have to be able to trace a call from London to California, and I could literally look at the numbers on the screen and see the nodes as the signal is&#8230; Well, the communication is traveling and seeing where it breaks. And that always remind me of when I was a kid. Wow, this looks just like when I was programming my Commodore 64. But yeah, I&#8217;m just nerding out a little bit on the tech. But it&#8217;s a great timing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it was. Even visually with&#8230; Flash was just everywhere. Flash was such a huge component of creating experiences online. And now in 2023, really years prior to that, I&#8217;d say probably as early as maybe 2020 or so, Flash is just a distant memory.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
During that transitional phase when I was going to school, I actually gig doing graphic design and marketing for a local recording studio. And I had to do Flash. And I was like, what the hell is this? I&#8217;d never really had much experience with Flash and I thought it was kind of an antiquated technology, even back then. But they insisted on using it for their banner ads and whatever. But me being at that job was also a big turning point for me because of just where I was. And then being around musicians and kind of transitioning into connecting with artists who needed photography and design. You know what I mean? So yeah, that was a good time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s bring it back to your studio, then. So you had that spark to start your studio then after doing that photography gig, you&#8217;ve kept it going now for 15 years, and your client list is extremely impressive. Just some of a few, I&#8217;ll name off here. Moleskine, which are the notebooks, the Italian leather notebooks, Apple Music, Spike Lee. And of course, musicians, The Foreign Exchange. They&#8217;re one of my absolute favorite groups. I&#8217;ve been a fan since Connected. I&#8217;ve been such a fan. This is complete fanboy moment at this point. How did you get involved with them?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of a funny story. So back in late 2009, I was kind of slowly making a name for myself as a photographer. I&#8217;m a music nerd, and I was dating someone at the time, time who knew Phonte.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Actually, I think they dated years before she and I met. But anyway I was also on&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if you remember the Okayplayer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, I remember them.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I was on Okayplayer, and I go into the, what do they call it, the rooms or whatever, the chat rooms, I guess, and just nerd out on music. And at the time that&#8217;s pretty much how the product exchange met on Okayplayer. And they recorded their whole album by just sending tracks and vocals across the ocean, because Nicolay was in the Netherlands at the time, living there. So anyway, so it was cool being able to connect with these artists like Little Brother and Questlove, and kind of just being involved in conversations and casts happen about music. And the person I was dating at the time would randomly post my photography into the forums. Like hey, my boyfriend did this picture, blah, blah, blah. And apparently Phonte was paying attention. So one winter, like I said, I think late 2009, we went to a gig.</p>
<p>It was a Red Bull event, and it was a battle of the bands featuring The Foreign Exchange and a punk rock band. And it was brilliant because what they had to do was play each other&#8217;s music and interpreted however they saw fit based off of the genre. Right? So it was cool hearing The Foreign Exchange&#8217;s band, which was amazing, playing these compositions that the punk rock band made. And then vice versa, you know what I mean? Really good time. Of course, I brought my camera, took some really cool photos of the bands. And then as we were leaving, I hear someone calling me and it&#8217;s Phonte. He and I had never met, but he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey man, you Chris Charles? I saw you coming you up here. We got a new album coming out, man.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Word? Okay. Hit me up, man.&#8221; And that was it. That was the beginning of that relationship. I just loved the process. So I worked with almost all the artists under the, not just The Foreign Exchange, but their record label.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So Median when he was on the label, just finished working with, well last year, last summer. BeMyFiasco, who is Phonte&#8217;s prot√©g√©, musically. And yeah, pretty much have done every project after Leave It All Behind.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So did all the photography, the design. Think the first one was Love in Flying Colors. That was the one. And yeah, did all the pre-flight, the layout, the photography, excuse me, and then yeah, all the way up to their last one. So it&#8217;s been a great journey with those guys. And we just did a photo shoot a few months ago, actually. Because they have some things that they&#8217;re going to be doing here. So it was good reconnecting with those guys again. But yeah, it was just, once again, those types of circumstances that the relationship building aspect of it is what&#8217;s important. And we&#8217;ve always had a great relationship. Really great guys. So yeah, those guys are cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m trying to think how I first found out&#8230; I think I found out about Foreign Exchange either through&#8230; It was one or two ways. One, there&#8217;s a music store here in Atlanta called Moods Music.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, I know it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, Darryl.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a hot spot, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s the spot. That&#8217;s the spot. I&#8217;m gatekeeping a little bit now that I&#8217;ve told the whole world on the podcast, but that&#8217;s the spot though. That&#8217;s the hot music spot in Atlanta. But I either found out about them. It was either through there or through this website that a couple of friends of mine founded called SoulBounce. I can&#8217;t remember if it was through one of the two. It was one of those two that I remember first hearing about it, because like I said, I&#8217;ve been listening. I&#8217;ve been a fan since Connected. Leave It All Behind, still gets rotation in this house to this day. &#8220;House of Cards,&#8221; oh my god, love that group. And even all the other stuff that Phonte did. I know Phonte and Zo! did this &#8217;80s cover album. That was really good.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It was Percy Miracle, and I forget the other name. But yeah, Phonte had the Jerry Curl wig on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, they did Stepping Out. They did Africa from Toto. Yeah. That was&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Those guys are so talented, man. Even now with&#8230; What&#8217;s that show? I know Zo! and Phonte been writing a lot for this new kind of musical skit comedy show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, is it Sherman&#8217;s Showcase?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Sherman&#8217;s Showcase, yes. And then of course, I designed the Eric Robeson Phonte record, Tigallerro. I did Phonte&#8217;s last single. Any visuals that came out pretty much revolving around the phone exchange or Nicolay&#8217;s or Phonte individual projects, I also had the privilege of working on. So, such a good time, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, man. I think of all that. You mentioned Eric Roberson and now I&#8217;m thinking of all the soul music that was also just kind of in and around during that time. That was such a&#8230; When I think on that time, that was late 2000s early 2010s. That was such, for me, that was just such a pivotal time. I think I was just turning 30 right around then, too. I was like, oh man. Such good music. And that&#8217;s so cool that you were just a part of all of that. And you get to work on it all. Do all that stuff.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It&#8217;s still surreal. It&#8217;s still surreal. Whenever I see&#8230; When President Obama had one of their songs on his yearly playlist, I&#8217;m like, what? I&#8217;m looking at a photograph and design I did and now President Obama saw that, word? I mean, that&#8217;s cool. It&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Can you give me a sneak peek on whether or not they have a new album coming out?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I&#8217;m sworn to secrecy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. All right.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s just say we did a&#8230;.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You mentioned a photo shoot, I thought I would ask.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m sorry, that&#8217;s all I can say. But yeah, stay tuned, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;re talking about Foreign Exchange and Phonte too, but Nicolay is super talented as producer. I have some of his solo albums, too. One of them&#8230; I forget what it&#8217;s called. Something with Shibuya in it, I&#8217;m not remembering&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, no. The City Lights. City Lights Volume II. Oh man. That&#8217;s one of my favorite, favorite just chill out albums. One of the songs on there is&#8230; I forget the&#8230; I have to go back and remember the name. Because I know the song when I hear it, I can&#8217;t necessarily think of the name of it, but it&#8217;s like some song. I don&#8217;t know. I call it my getting home from the club song. When you get home super late and the sun&#8217;s about to Rise, it&#8217;s like that kind of song.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I forget the name of it. But they&#8217;re all super talented. That whole clique is super talented</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
And super nice. Whenever I get to catch up with Nicolay. The guy&#8217;s really, really smart. He has a degree in musicology. He&#8217;s not just like self-taught. He&#8217;s really formally trained, but also humble and tall. The guy&#8217;s like seven feet tall. He&#8217;s like about six foot seven. He&#8217;s huge. But just the nicest guy. Same thing with City of Lights Volume too. Those guys are always gracious whenever we connect. What&#8217;s another one I did? Not the Shibuya one. I did the next one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Soweto.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yes. I did the graphics for that one as well, as well for [inaudible 00:45:08].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve been lucky, man. I&#8217;ve been lucky.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you do to stay motivated and productive with your work?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Just constantly evolving, actually, as far as what I do. For me, sometimes it&#8217;s just if I&#8217;m editing photos, I run into a creative block with where to go with a certain edit. I&#8217;ll put it down and I&#8217;ll step away and indulge in another media, be it a short film or looking at some art books that I have. But I know for me, staying inspired revolved around kind of exploring the balance between what&#8217;s in my head and what I see that catches my eye out in the world. And also music. A lot of my photography and design, I feel it&#8217;s so connected to musical energy. And at least to me, I always like to think of a song whenever I present a certain edit or if I do a print.</p>
<p>So for me, sometimes I&#8217;ll be inspired by music, or if I&#8217;m producing music and coming up with a theme and a rhythm, and I&#8217;ll start to see colors and I&#8217;ll start to say, oh, okay, maybe I think that&#8217;s rare. Then I go back to the edit and it&#8217;s like yeah, I add that touch of red to it. So, it varies. But mostly I&#8217;d say music and using contrasting mediums to kind of offset each other. So if I&#8217;m doing design, I&#8217;ll stop and do some photography or look at photography. If I&#8217;m doing photography, I&#8217;ll listen to music. It&#8217;s weird. I kind of traverse these different medium when I need inspiration from something else, from another place. So yeah, that&#8217;s one of the ways I use medium.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you say your artistic style has evolved over the years?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
When I first started doing photography, especially when I was in design school, I was implementing design elements within my photography a lot. And it was just how I saw things. I would do a portrait and find a creative way to add text to it or add texture to it using overlays. I think as I&#8217;ve evolved as an artist, I think my style has&#8230; It&#8217;s gotten a lot simpler. So I&#8217;ve simplified it. I&#8217;ve been able to deconstruct it in a way that there might be some texture, or I&#8217;ll just use a textured backdrop or a textured setting, versus actually adding the texture in post.</p>
<p>But also just kind of continuing to try to master fighting in the technical aspects of photography. And then getting into filmmaking and learning that technology and learning how to edit and just being a one-stop shop. Because I just love all those mediums, so why not learn how to do them? And then eventually that became another aspect of my business. So I think expanding, going from this photography, to design and photography, to dabbling in web design. And then, oh, short films, and then doing promo spots for clients and doing commercials for schools and things of that nature. So yeah, learning new technology is pretty much how I think I&#8217;ll be evolved over the years, specifically</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Overall, is there a piece of art or a specific project or something that you&#8217;ve done that you&#8217;re particularly proud of? Like the crown jewel in your portfolio, or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
There are a couple, actually. I think most recently I got commissioned by a really amazing local candle making company, Black-owned, to design a signature candle to be distributed through the NBA, the NBA 75th Anniversary candle series. And they gave me full autonomy to design it within the specs of the candle. And with that, I was given access to seeing what the candle kind of smelled like, and taking hints from the notes of the candle and then implementing that into the design. That to me was very exciting, very exciting. And for that to be connected to the NBA was just mind-blowing. I&#8217;d say another one is probably the Spike Lee project that between&#8230; It was joint project between Spike Lee and Moleskine where they were doing these cheap, got-to-have-it books, Moleskine books. So that&#8217;s where that connection happened.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh!</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I was able to connect with Spike Lee and his team and come up with a&#8230; I had to shoot a short film of a local artist, a Black woman artist who embodied the whole image, the vibe of Nola Darling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nola Darling, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It was cool because Spike Lee, huge inspiration for me. One of my favorite movies is near all of them, but I say from an aesthetic standpoint, [inaudible 00:49:37] blues, the way he used colors and contrasting colors to point out personality differences, and music and jazz. I think another fun time was shooting Martin Lawrence and his daughters&#8217; graduation party. And that was interesting and totally random. One of actually, it so happened that his daughter, her hairdresser was my client. They needed a photographer. And she graduated from Duke University. And I&#8217;ll never forget this, this was Mother&#8217;s Day a few years ago. And I remember going to brunch with my mom and then having to leave and drive to Duke University to their private banquet thing, golf club. And I&#8217;m looking at Martin Lawrence and his family. Oh, and Emmett Smith. Because they&#8217;re all connected. Emmett Smith, who&#8217;s one of my favorite running backs of all times for the NFL is Martin&#8217;s ex-wife&#8217;s new husband.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m looking at Martin Lawrence and his family, the kids, Emmett Smith, and I&#8217;m just there to take pictures and you&#8217;re paying me to do this. Are you kidding me? It&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s living the dream. So yeah, I&#8217;ve had some really amazing&#8230; Gosh, I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s times like these, and I&#8217;m thankful for you to these great questions because it really makes me think about&#8230; For one, if there was any time where I didn&#8217;t, or if any people didn&#8217;t respect the craft of image-making, be it photography or design, and the times that I&#8217;ve doubted it as well. Like oh yeah, people don&#8217;t take this stuff seriously. But then one day I&#8217;m in Venice Italy, because I was commissioned to be there by a client. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s like, wow, I said that but I&#8217;m actually overseas right now, and my whole job is to just be cool and take fly pictures. So yeah, I&#8217;ve had a few instances of really amazing experiences and being in rooms and work and opportunities. So yeah, I have a few, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying, I just can&#8217;t pick one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think once again, all of that really speaks to the power of relationships.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It really speaks to being able to know who, not just know who certain people are, but to maintain those relationships enough where people are advocates or sponsors for you in places where you&#8217;re not available. Especially with what you just mentioned with shooting Martin Lawrence&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s graduation, like you said her hairdresser is one of your clients, and so that&#8217;s how that all happened. They could have picked any photographer. Martin&#8217;s a celebrity. They could have picked any photographer.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
What&#8217;s so funny about that, she just called me randomly and she was like, &#8220;Hey, I got a gig for you. Just say yes.&#8221; I was like, what? She wouldn&#8217;t tell me who it was until the day before. She was like, oh, by the way, this is the Lawrence family and Smith family. Like, &#8220;Lawrence who?&#8221; [inaudible 00:52:29] I was like, oh, okay. Yeah. Relationships, knowing people and doing good work in this treating well manner.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And the Spike Lee Moleskine, I have the Spike Lee Moleskine. It&#8217;s still in the plastic. I refuse to open it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Oh, nice. Yeah, that&#8217;s definitely a collectors&#8217; item. Definitely a collectors&#8217; item.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve had a few people on the show that have done work with Spike, either presently or in the past and stuff. It&#8217;s amazing how he pulls in other Black designers to work on his projects, whether it&#8217;s like Art Sims doing projects, whether it&#8217;s you on this notebook project. I think most recently he did some work with this black typographer I had on the show, Tre Seals for his book, like design the font for the book and everything. Spike is really good about pulling in other Black creatives into his work, which I really appreciate that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
And I honestly believe, I think it should be like that. It&#8217;s always great to see and I always appreciate it. But how else are we going to continue to spread and learn about each other&#8217;s talents without actually giving each other shots and [inaudible 00:53:34] opportunities?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I love to see it. Love to see it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice do you have for aspiring creative directors or artists out there, particularly those that want to be self-employed like you are and be able to kind of forge their own path?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;d say do your homework. And when I say that it&#8217;s great to go out with passion and present it, but you have to have a plan. And that could be, do you want to be a generalist? This could be applied to a couple of different mediums, of course. But yeah, do I want to be a specialist? Do I want to be a generalist? I&#8217;ve gone back and forth between that as well. For me, it&#8217;s about also diversifying, right? I don&#8217;t just solely rely on photography or I don&#8217;t just solely rely on consulting or design, or filmmaking. It&#8217;s about building a brand based on those three words. Like I said, style, creativity, and soul. And thinking about how you want your clients to feel when they work with you and after they&#8217;re done working with you, and will that make them want to work with you again? So it&#8217;s like a lot of soft skill stuff. I mean, of course, being technically skilled and talented, those are all great things, but if people don&#8217;t like you, you&#8217;re not going to go very far.</p>
<p>So I think learning how to maintain or establish and maintain relationships with people who align with the vision that you want to sell your artwork to, present your work to, and being able to manage that and navigate that and be in spaces and present yourself well, I think that&#8217;s really important. And then also, of course, the more technical stuff about managing business, establishing an LLC, your contracts, delivering, over-delivering at times, under-promising versus the vice versa. Because people will call you out. You said we were going to get 30 pictures, you only delivered 29. It&#8217;s like, oh, okay. Gotcha. But if I say I&#8217;m delivering 15 and I deliver 30, guess what? Now I&#8217;m a rockstar. And a lot of creatives take that for granted. And I also understand that there&#8217;s time and money involved with creating and running a business. So be mindful of that. Don&#8217;t kill yourself. Rest. Take your time to step away from it and reevaluate, reassess, learn, and then ask for mentorship from people who are already doing it that are in the game.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing, like future stuff or continuation of what you&#8217;re currently on? Where do you see yourself?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, ultimately five years&#8230; It&#8217;s funny because I&#8217;ve been actually writing out my tenure plan. And in the next five years, couple things. I definitely want to have a new physical space to run a shop and have a team, a dedicated team on payroll to where I can manage and be lead creative or a principal for projects that are being done by people that are working for me. But also, I have a really big passion for veterans&#8217; affairs. So I&#8217;ve been researching ways that I can somehow participate in helping veterans, be it they&#8217;re transitioning or trying to find their way out in the workforce. Or if they&#8217;re trying to start a business, there are so many benefits out there available to veterans who they don&#8217;t know they&#8217;re there and they&#8217;re just out here flapping and trying to work, but also might have some disabilities or issues that their workplace or workplaces are required to accommodate. So yeah, that&#8217;s a huge passion of mine honestly, in helping veterans, especially veterans of color, transition and live good lives after having lived through some really potentially horrible situations because of war. But yeah, having a shop and helping veterans.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Sure. So my main website is chrischarles.co. That&#8217;s chrischarles.co, not dot-com. The person who owns that domain name refuses to give it up, so I&#8217;m stuck with the dot-co and that&#8217;s no problem. That&#8217;s fine. So that has pretty much leads you to all of the other work that I do. I have a separate photography website, which you can also find once you go to chrischarles.co. But for people who are specifically interested in photography, it&#8217;s my full name, christophercharlesphotography.com. I have a Facebook business page, it&#8217;s Chris Charles Photo. My Instagram handle is the_chrischarles, so the, underscore symbol, Chris Charles. Those are the main places to find me. I&#8217;m there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Sounds good. Well Chris Charles, I want to thank you so much for coming on this show. I think certainly everything that you have talked about speaks to two key things that I think folks should kind of take in mind, particularly as we go into the new year. One is about being adaptable, and the second is about building relationships. I think everything that you&#8217;ve described about your career to date has been a testament to both of those abilities, and you&#8217;ve been able to craft and use both of those to be able to build a career for yourself, build a life for yourself, and continue to do great work out there in the community. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Thank you so much for having me, man. This is really fun. Enjoyed talking with you, Maurice. And yeah, anything you need from me, just let me know.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re wrapping up 2022 by sitting down with the immensely talented Shakeil Greeley. I love that his portfolio consists of all kinds of creative projects, including fine art and writing. Who says design has to be all about visuals?</p>
<p>Shakeil and I started off talking about his work as an art director at Splice, as well as his new role at Spring Health. He also talked about growing up between Portland and Philly, studying at the University of Pennsylvania&#8217;s Visual Studies program, and then landing at GQ doing digital art direction and editorial strategy. Shakeil also spoke about the <a href="https://imaginaryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Imaginary School</a> and the <a href="https://www.aroko.coop/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">&Agrave;r&ograve;ko Cooperative</a> (formerly Design to Divest), and shared how both projects are important to him in terms of community building.</p>
<p>There are so many opportunities to use design to make the world a better place, and I&#8217;m glad that there are designers like Shakeil Greeley who are using their skills to make that happen.</p>
<p>From all of us here at Revision Path, thank you for all your support this year. Next year marks our 10th anniversary, so stick around for what&#8217;s coming up in 2023!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Hey there. My name is Shakeil Greeley. I am a creative director and designer based in Brooklyn, New York. And I use design, strategy, and art to create more equitable, open, and imaginative worlds.</p>
<p>So in my day job, I&#8217;m an art director at a music company called Splice. Although I&#8217;m soon to be moving on to a new role as creative director of a mental healthcare company. In addition to that, I&#8217;m on the leadership teams of two organizations in particular. √Är√≤ko Cooperative, which is a Black owned design cooperative. And The Imaginary School, which is an online learning community and platform.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, that&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
It is. I stay very busy, and that&#8217;s not including any of the freelance work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, how was 2022 for you?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
2022 was frankly not the best year. I think it was a lot of time to just kind of process a lot of things that had gone on. Obviously, 2020 was very hectic for many reasons, as was 2021. And I think 2022, I definitely felt a lot of the emotional burnout from just the large existential events that were happening in the pandemic, and racial uprisings, and geopolitical developments, and such.</p>
<p>But also from just working a lot over the last 10 years basically. I&#8217;m one of those people who always has multiple side projects running and I think I&#8217;ve probably had three or four large side projects running at all times since I was a junior in college. And I think that really caught up to me after a while coming into this year. So it&#8217;s been a year of just rest, and reflection, and de-stressing, and unplugging that has definitely been productive. But I&#8217;m really looking forward to the things that are going to come in the next year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of that, is there anything from this year that you want to carry over into the next year?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I think one of the biggest things is my work with √Är√≤ko, because that has been an ongoing project for a number of years now, and we&#8217;re really getting to a spot where I think going into next year we&#8217;re going to be able to have folks working on that project for the first time. So all of the work we&#8217;ve been doing to kind of reposition because we were formally known as Design to Divest. So coming up with a mew name, new brand direction, and new strategy, all of that work has been really fruitful. And I&#8217;m really excited for that stuff to carry on into the new year, in particular in my kind of design practice and work practice.</p>
<p>But on a more personal note, I think just continuing to be reflective and really take time for myself. Those are two things that I&#8217;m really prioritizing the next year to not overwhelm myself with work, and just maintain a nice steady output while giving myself plenty of time to just relax and enjoy the fruits of my labor a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I heard that from a lot of people this year that I&#8217;ve had on the show that this year has kind of been a bit of almost a rebuilding year in some ways. And I think it&#8217;s because 2020 for a lot of us was just very hectic, aside from the racial reckoning, and the protest, and things that happened during the year. But just the pandemic on top of that with also not being able to travel and congregate and stuff. 2020 was really stressful for a lot of people. 2021, I think we were trying to emerge from it. And now this year, especially with boosters and with mandates becoming lax and things of that nature, we&#8217;re just trying to get back to some semblance of normalcy. Which I think for a lot of people this year that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s been. It&#8217;s been about trying to find ways to move forward when take the lessons that we&#8217;ve learned from the past couple of years on how to live in a more equitable kind of holistic sort of way.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Definitely. Yeah, I definitely feel that. So much has happened, and even heard in a couple of your recent interviews folks talking about the influx of things like clients, and new projects, and all of that after 2020. I know even on our end, we&#8217;re really having time to take stock and be like, &#8220;Okay, what are the kind of clients we actually really want to be taking on, and what are the kind of principles we want to be adhering to when we accept new projects?&#8221; And even for my own personal work I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Okay, I have limited time. I have limited energy, and I have a very specific set of goals I&#8217;m looking to accomplish in the world. What are the actual side projects I should be working on and doing at any given time?&#8221; And the conclusion has been maybe only one instead of the suite that I had been operating with previously.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now I know you mentioned that you are about to leave Splice. But you&#8217;ve served there as art director roughly for about what the past four years or so now. Talk to me about your work there.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So Splice has been a really interesting journey. I joined in February of 2019 and worked primarily on all their editorial and content marketing channels. So that includes the Splice blog, that includes Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, Reels. I also assist on things like video thumbnails and video ideas, and also focus onto things like content planning and content strategy. In addition to that, obviously there&#8217;s a whole art direction side. So that includes doing art direction for brand photo shoots where we are going to go cast 10 musicians from around New York City and shoot them in their own spaces and places, to shooting more kind of advertising focused shoots with sets, and set designers, and things that are a little more formalized.</p>
<p>So my work has really spanned a lot of different stuff in my time at Splice. I even was interviewing artists at one point for the blog, and I&#8217;ve worked with the product team on implementing stuff on the marketplace. So it&#8217;s a wide range of projects. And I think the core thing that&#8217;s interesting that ties it all together is Splice for those who don&#8217;t know is a music technology company. And Splice&#8217;s core offering is a marketplace of samples. So we&#8217;re really a creator-forward and creator-first company, which makes it fun as a creator myself to make work for people who have a creative eye, and have things like taste and know what they think is cool, and what they&#8217;re interested in. And might be working on their own album covers, or music videos, or social media strategies for themselves. So yeah, it&#8217;s been a really interesting journey and I&#8217;m excited to talk more about some of the individual specific pieces.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean it sounds like you were doing a lot outside of Art direction. I mean it sounds like it&#8217;s art direction, it&#8217;s creative strategy, it&#8217;s content strategy. It&#8217;s kind of a lot wrapped up under one title.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Definitely. And I think that&#8217;s part of the startup lifestyle. There&#8217;s always more to be done. And I think that also is tied into our team structure across both the creative organization, but also the content marketing team I&#8217;ve been working with. Where everyone&#8217;s very collaborative and very open to new ideas, which kind of led all of us to flex onto different stuff. So I worked with content strategists who were also making beats and were writers. And I&#8217;ve worked with writers who come up with their own content ideas and whole video franchises and things of that nature. So a lot of things going on, and a small amount of people working on them across the organization. But a really creative team, which is fun always.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me more about the team. What did that look like? You mentioned content strategist doing a lot also.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So the way our team is set up is my creative director, Meg V√°zquez is at the head of the brand organization. And then there&#8217;s kind of a flat structure that sits underneath her. So I am art direction. So that includes all content marketing basically, as well as these larger special projects. We have three designers on the team who all have their own areas of expertise, one of whom focuses on motion graphics and kind of brand design. One of them is a really strong brand owner and ensures that the Splice brand across services from employee merchandise to landing pages all feel consistent. And then there&#8217;s a designer who focuses primarily on growth marketing, and in addition to that we also have a copywriter.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s kind of a core creative team. In addition to that, there are two folks who work primarily on video. And then our sister team is the content marketing team in a lot of ways, where we work really closely with folks who do social media strategy for things like Twitter and TikTok. We have some folks who are really specific into one person runs the blog and is the editor energy for the blog. Someone is really specialized in music education and looking at how we can create different curriculums for people to learn music. I think it&#8217;s about eight or so people on each of those teams. And we support initiatives from across the rest of the organization as many content marketing and creative groups do. So we&#8217;ll take in work from things that we obviously generate on our own in our own editorial initiatives. But we also work with other teams around the company to tell the public and tell Splice users about new features, new pack releases, and just new projects that we&#8217;re working on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the most challenging part about working at Splice?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
This is an interesting question. Because I think there&#8217;s two things that are challenging. One of them is a palindrome almost if you will, of a challenge. But I think the first one is just that it is a startup still, and Splice is still figuring out just where it&#8217;s going to go and what it&#8217;s going to be in the future. And that&#8217;s always something that can be difficult for any organization, especially in the creative side. Because you&#8217;re having to deal with new projects coming up, or things getting deprioritized, or new initiatives getting spun up, and potential for wider company directions to change. So just being really adaptable. That&#8217;s been a challenge that I think I&#8217;ve personally grown from, and I know several people that have also really grown from that as well. But it&#8217;s never easy to have to change what you&#8217;re working on and change your focus with that level of frequency.</p>
<p>And I think the other thing that&#8217;s challenging about Splice but is also I think my favorite part about working at Splice is it&#8217;s a music company first and foremost, and people tend to be very passionate about music. And so naturally, we have a lot of people on staff who are super passionate about music making. Whether they are avid listeners or concept goers, or musicians themselves. And that means you have a lot of buy-in from folks and a lot of personal attachment to the work. And that&#8217;s great, but it can also cause friction at times when people are so personally invested in the work that they&#8217;re doing. So it&#8217;s a challenge, but I think it&#8217;s one that when we can unlock, it and when we can solve it, and when we can really work together in cool ways, it&#8217;s a huge benefit and makes working there really pleasurable. But it&#8217;s kind of a push and pull always there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I have to say, even as you&#8217;re describing it being the startup and then also being something that is really for music lovers and people who love music because it&#8217;s a music company, I would love something like that. I would love to work at a place that&#8217;s passionate about music, but then it&#8217;s also tech oriented, and design oriented. How big is Splice actually? Rough count.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I think somewhere between 200 and 250 if I&#8217;m not mistaken right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, that&#8217;s not too bad. I&#8217;ve mostly worked at startups that have been in that 50 to 60 person range, and that&#8217;s when stuff really starts getting really thorny. Because the old stalwarts that have been there like yourself that have been there for multiple years, and then you&#8217;ve got newer hires that expect a culture that&#8217;s another way. And you&#8217;re trying to do all this together in this kind of fast-paced environment. So for me, it sounds like something I&#8217;d be interested in, but that&#8217;s because I really like music. I was a musician myself for a lot of years. But especially during the past few years we&#8217;ve had, I could see how that could take its toll.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
And I think like I said, it&#8217;s a great problem to have where you have people who are really passionate about the work. But again, I think that that super deep level of passion and emotional investment when tied together with the trappings of a startup and things shifting. And priorities being not in flux all the time, but they do change naturally. I think it can just be a little difficult to make sure that everyone&#8217;s on the same page about where we&#8217;re all going.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s a challenge. But I think if you&#8217;re kind of ready to accept that ambiguity and really be open to flexing and taking on all these different things that you can really learn from and grow from, it&#8217;s an environment that I know I&#8217;ve learned and gained a lot from.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say has been the most rewarding part of working there?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I&#8217;m a real fan of my creative director, Meg V√°zquez. We worked together at GQ as well. And being able to work under her and really see what a good creative director looks like in action has been such a pleasure and an honor. And I think all the lessons I&#8217;ve learned from her and just how to manage a team, and empower people, and solve problems, and ensure creative integrity and all these things are a lot of lessons I know I&#8217;m going to be taking with me for the rest of my career. That&#8217;s been a real pleasure to work with her. And then also it just extends into the rest of the people that I&#8217;ve been able to work with. I think the people at Splice have just been such a pleasure, and we&#8217;ve been able to do some really cool stuff.</p>
<p>One of my close colleagues who&#8217;s a content strategist, his name&#8217;s Ken Herman, he&#8217;s Japanese American. Important context because we were both basically the leads on all social media at the time in 2020. Him being the strategist, me being the designer. And obviously, Splice is a music company. But we are also an American music company, which means that if you&#8217;re reading between the lines, we are a Black music company, whether the staffing reflects that or not. We are a music company that primarily prophets in Black created genres.</p>
<p>So Ken and I were like, &#8220;I think we need to make this a little clearer for everyone here and particular for all of our audience.&#8221; And not that our audience was pushing back on that idea a lot, but we really wanted to make it clear where Splice stood on these issues, and make it clear that we understood the responsibility we had.</p>
<p>So we got to come together and work on a series called As Told By that actually went and became Webby nominated. It was just a small social franchise where we took a specific social issue, whether it was something like the Iran-Contra scandal, or Rockefeller Laws, and went through and found a bunch of textual evidence of all kinds of hip hop artists kind of talking about these issues in their music. And really making an effort to not just&#8230; I think there&#8217;s a misconception for a lot of probably non-Black folks, but Black folks as well around what &#8216;conscious&#8217; rap can be. And folks like Jim Jones talk about the Rockefeller laws. It&#8217;s not just bound by those kind of genre constraints.</p>
<p>So having someone in my team that was super down to work on a project like that, and just do it together, and collaborate on the story, and the design. That kind of working environment I think is a great example of why I love working at Splice and love the people at Splice so much. Just really passionate, really intelligent, and really just down to collaborate and get into the weeds and work really closely together on stuff that they may not know front to back, but are really down to learn and figure it out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds really dope. Actually taking a look at the series now. You covered stuff like the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, the crack epidemic, the Rockefeller drug laws, United States of America versus Billie Holiday, assassination of Fred Hampton, the Iran-Contra affair, the war on drugs. And it&#8217;s all through the lyrics of musicians. Yeah, this is really cool. I have to check this out. This is really cool.</p>
<p>So I want to learn more about your background. I mean, of course we&#8217;re hearing about the creative work, and we&#8217;ll get into what you&#8217;re doing with √Är√≤ko Cooperative and The Imaginary School. But let&#8217;s start with your origin story.</p>
<p>On your website you mentioned that you&#8217;re born in Seattle, but you said you grew up between Portland and Philly, which feels like two wide ends of a spectrum in terms of culture. Portland, Oregon, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah, so I think a lot of my upbringing is a key theme being between different cultures. Because I&#8217;m biracial. My dad, he&#8217;s a white guy from the Pacific Northwest. And my mom grew up in Jamaica until she was about 18.</p>
<p>So they met in the Pacific Northwest and moved to Seattle. So I was born there, lived there for a couple of years. And then we moved to Portland, Oregon and lived a couple of years there. They split up, and then my mom moved to Philadelphia where my grandfather was living with his second wife and a lot of her family. So even over there, that&#8217;s Black Jamaicans, but also Black American side. And then I would spend basically my school time in Philadelphia. And then any vacation time, I would go spend with my dad in Portland. And it&#8217;s two really different places to be sure. Philadelphia, one of the Blackest big cities in America. And Portland, one of the whitest big cities in America.</p>
<p>I just learned a lot. I&#8217;m one of those kids who&#8217;s been drawing my whole life. I&#8217;ve always been interested in art. I think when I first realized that jobs were a thing you had to have, I either wanted to make comic books, or test video games. And I think making comic books or graphic design, not really that different. But those have always been interested of mine.</p>
<p>So I learned a lot from A, being around both really family at the end of the day because my grandmother on my mom&#8217;s side, she&#8217;s a prolific quilter. I&#8217;ve learned a lot about just color and pattern from her. My grandma on my dad&#8217;s side, she is just a broad crafts woman. She loves to do collage, and watercolors, and all this stuff. But neither of them ever did any of this professionally, just purely as hobbies.</p>
<p>And my mom, she&#8217;s a doctor. She&#8217;s an anesthesiologist. And she never really did any of this stuff but has always been really interested in clothing, and home d√©cor, and design. And then my dad is kind of an IT worker. He does all kinds of different IT stuff, but he is also a very passionate DJ. And I think my first kind of real introduction to design was meeting one of my dad&#8217;s friends who was making his mixtape cover art. And he was like, &#8220;Yeah, this is the designer who&#8217;s making my mixtape cover art.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I got introduced to the field really young, but didn&#8217;t really think it was something I would do full-time until much, much later. I spent a lot of time just as any kid does in my age group watching things like Toonami. Part of my upbringing in Portland actually was going to a Japanese magnet school, which is another really key piece of my story. So half the day was taught in English, and half the day was taught in Japanese. And this was right around the big Japan and anime boom of the &#8217;90s. So it was like kids in my second grade class were coming to school with Pokemon cards, and no one had ever seen them before. And the next year, Pokemon, the cartoon went up on WB. And obviously the rest is history.</p>
<p>So Japanese culture and video games, anime, things like that entered into my lexicon really early, and have been a really big source of inspiration since then. So my whole upbringing has just been a real hodgepodge mix of getting introduced to Japanese culture really early, being super interested in mixtape culture, dance hall culture, hip hop culture from a really young age, especially for my dad. And just holding records, and meeting his friends who made flyers, and helping him burn CDs, and things of that nature.</p>
<p>And then I think especially as I went to high school, I really got more into English, and drama, and history, and just writing more so. And I think that whole side of me that&#8217;s more analytical, and research focused, and all about communication merged with my early interests in Japanese culture, and dance hall culture, and all of these things to lead me into at least my adult design career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, that&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
A lot of pieces.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The Japanese magnet school in particular really interests me. I mean one, because you&#8217;re learning about just a different culture. Both language and the Japanese culture. But then to get it at such a young age, especially at the time when in America, Japanese animation was really starting to pop off. Wow, that must have been a wild time as a kid to be a part of that.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
It was really interesting. And the older I get and the more I look back on it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wow.&#8221; It was a public school too. And that&#8217;s a common thing in Portland. There&#8217;s a lot of magnet schools. Looking back on it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Geez, what an insanely foundational and formative experience that was.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because I had lots of friends who had older brothers who were into hacking, and modding their PCs, and importing game consoles, and all of these things that I think are super mainstream now. But I didn&#8217;t really understand at the time just how lucky I was to kind of get a front row seat to a lot of this stuff, right as it was coming out because people were going to Japan with their families for the holidays, and bringing stuff back. It was fascinating. It was a very fascinating experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So it sounds like overall growing up you really were exposed to a lot of creative things. And then eventually you went to the University of Pennsylvania, and you studied there as part of their visual studies program. Tell me about that time. What was your time like there?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So I got to thank my mom for even finding that program in the first place, because I was really kind of torn between how do I do creative stuff and make money. I think the eternal question of any kid whose parents don&#8217;t know what the design industry is. And I didn&#8217;t either at the time. So I was really debating do I do marketing and just do a business program, or do I go to an ad school or advertising school? Or do I go to just a full-on art school and do that? And my mom found this program, which is an amazing program that is basically a hybrid between several different disciplines. Those disciplines being biology, and psychology of sight, and seeing. So how do your rods and cones work? How do images get processed in the brain? These really foundational, biological things are practice.</p>
<p>Our practice, so obviously taking practical art classes like draft design, or painting, or sculpture, things of that nature. And then psychology and philosophy. So really looking at the thinking behind perception, and vision, and the real kind of heady stuff.</p>
<p>And you kind of choose one to focus in. So you take a majority of your classes in a specific area. I focused in fine art practice, specifically design. And then you just get this really interesting and well-rounded experience I think for an academic experience in particular, where you&#8217;re getting to learn a lot of different things that are all tightly related to each other, but are very different formally. I think each person, if you were to just focus on one of those things, that&#8217;s a whole field in and of itself. But we were having a really interesting time learning about the anatomy of your eye, and then having to go into a fine arts class and actually figure out a way to translate that into something visual. Or taking a historical image, and creating a sculpture that reflects the character of the image, as well as communicates the initial meaning.</p>
<p>So it was a really interesting education. And especially as someone who didn&#8217;t take any formal art classes in high school or anything like that, it was pretty wild to be dropped into the real deep end of design, and design theory, and all of these things right as I started school. But it provided me, especially someone with a lot of different interests and someone who is pretty flexible I think, a ton of freedom to just do what I wanted to do and learn about things that I wanted to do.</p>
<p>And I was basically able to do two thesis projects at the end of my time there, just from the fact that I was able to come to the program early. I finished my requirements early. I got a good sense of the things I was interested in, and got to take some graduate classes in my final semester. So it was a really, really great time. Academically. So yeah, very interesting program that I recommend to anyone who&#8217;s really interested in the whole ecosystem of visual image making as a whole entity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now, does Penn still have that program?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
It does, yeah. I believe the head of the program, his name is Ian Verstegen. He was my senior thesis advisor. So shout out to you, Ian.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean that sounds like a really great program. Especially like you said, you have all these different interests. And visual studies may sort of help you find a way to channel that into something.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. And I think the key thing it really taught me was to never make something without thinking about it first. Especially when it comes to design in particular. And always kind of have a thought of what you want something to do or what it needs to accomplish, or the response you wanted to elicit in someone, before you go into actually making the thing. That was a big thing I learned from that program.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you graduated from there in 2015. And one of your first jobs out of college, you were working for GQ Magazine. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So just sung the praises of this program. But it sounds complicated. And two prospective people who wanted to hire, they also I think thought it was complicated, because I could not find a job for a pretty long time. But I was really lucky enough to find this opportunity at GQ Magazine.</p>
<p>So if this was about seven months after I graduated, and I found this opportunity. And it was a web producer job. So it&#8217;s not a design title, not a designer, not a creative anything. It was just kind of a go between for all things within the website. At that time I was still living at home. I was doing some light freelance work, but I was like, &#8220;No, I want to move to New York. I want to get my career started. I&#8217;m going to go and take this job, and I&#8217;m going to go meet the art director first day, and tell them that I want to be a designer, and we&#8217;ll see how it goes from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I was at GQ for three years, three years total. And in that three years, I had four different titles. So I started as web producer, then became a visual designer. Then I was a visual editor. Then I was an art director and manager. And I worked on a bunch of different stuff while I was there. So in my first year, I was hand transcribing stories from old magazines so they could be published on the website. And helping my boss, who was the editor of the website, do her expenses, and keep track of contracts for writers that were doing regular columns and things like that. And I just kind of kept my head down and just kept working on these things, and kept bothering people to give me more stuff to do. So eventually, I started making some small illustrations for e-commerce stories, and then able to do some more big illustrations.</p>
<p>And I think a big moment for me when I was in that first year is I got to make a piece of art for the editor and the chief&#8230; The editor&#8217;s letter? Yeah, the editor&#8217;s letter. And it was about, I think this was in 2016. So it was in the throes of the election and all this stuff.</p>
<p>And it was a piece about Barack Obama, and I just cut together a found image of his bust that I think had maybe been 3D printed by the Smithsonian or something, and Abe Lincoln&#8217;s statue. And that piece went super viral. Definitely the copy was great, but I do think the image had a lot to do with it. And that was kind of a turning point where people really started like, &#8220;This kid knows what he is doing. He knows how to make a brief. He knows how to think through the stuff. We could use him on the design side.&#8221;</p>
<p>So after that, I kind of really started pushing into more of the design world. Eventually they were able to make some space for me over there. And then I spent the latter half of my time at GQ working on Snapchat Discover, which for again, those who don&#8217;t know is, I mean I think it still is active. But it was a bit huge initiative that Snapchat was doing to kind of partner with a lot of legacy publications, and just making moving animated magazines for a younger audience. So I did that for two years, partly as an editor as part of a team. And then I took over the team in my third year.</p>
<p>And in addition to doing a lot of design, illustration, content planning, content strategy, I also got to do a lot of writing at GQ, which is I think pretty unique for a lot of designers. So I had the first interview with Daniel Kaluuya after Out came out with any major publication. And that was a big moment, that was really one I&#8217;m really proud of. And I got to interview a number of musicians like Christian Scott, and [inaudible 00:34:40] and Lil Tracy, and all these people. So it was a really wild ride to be at such a large legacy publication at a time when the money was visibly drying up day by day. So I think it worked for me in the fact that there was not enough staff around, where I was able to just grab stuff and people would just be happy to have someone do it, no matter what their title was. So it really worked out for me in that way. But it was a really interesting time just crashing into that world and having no background in fashion or New York media, and just getting the whole wave washing over me.</p>
<p>But I learned a ton there, met a lot of really interesting people. And really, I think especially going back to my kind of academic background, I taught myself a lot of design stuff even while I was in school. And GQ was the time when I really learned what type design and type setting really meant, and how to really apply that stuff. So I kind of cut my teeth both in the world of multitasking and doing a lot of different stuff at once, but also really getting those hard design skills that I had been lacking in my academic education and self-taught practice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you get a chance to work on any video while you were there?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I did, yeah. I did a number of video projects. I did some design for an Issa Rae video when she was on the Man of the Year issue. And some other stuff with Travis Scott, Kylie Jenner. And I got to do both creating graphics for videos, as well as producing and interviewing people for video too. So I got a whole spectrum of experience in that area.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s some Conde Nast video Style Bible, but all of the videos that I watched out of GQ, Vanity Fair, etc., are so well done. It&#8217;s some of the really good video content. I&#8217;d say even now in this kind of, I don&#8217;t know, short video age when people look at Reels, and TikTok, and stuff like that. GQ is doing some of the best long form, and when I say long form, I&#8217;m thinking, I don&#8217;t know what. 10 minutes or more I guess. But they&#8217;re doing some of the best long form video content out there. It&#8217;s really good stuff.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
And I think actually two of the dudes who I worked with when I was there years ago I think are still there pushing a lot of that stuff forward. So they do some really awesome stuff. And it was a real pleasure to both be able to collaborate with that team, and also just watch them and see how they work. And I think that was something I really just did a lot of at GQ was just watching people, and just seeing how all these people move through the world, and did their work, and how people would just stroll into places they owned it, and were always going to think that they could get access to a certain person or anything. And that was really inspiring to me. I was like, &#8220;Oh wow, I guess I can just go do stuff. If I have GQ in my email, people will just answer my emails back. So I should just try to take advantage of that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I imagine that helps a lot.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. I still get emails to this day of people asking me to feature their X artist in GQ. But yeah, those days are behind me now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now along with what you just talked about with Splice, with GQ, and everything. You&#8217;re on the leadership teams of two organizations, √Är√≤ko Cooperative and The Imaginary School. Let&#8217;s talk about the √Är√≤ko Cooperative first. Because we&#8217;ve talked about it on the show before. As you mentioned earlier, it used to be known as Design to Divest. And we&#8217;ve had some folks on the show from Design to Divest. We had Michael Collette, we had Azeez, we had Zariah. What was behind the decision to change its name?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m actually super excited to talk about this because Design to Divest was this really impromptu gathering when we really came together initially. [inaudible 00:38:46] who was kind of the seed planter who put up the first Instagram post, even when we all came together for the first time, they were like, &#8220;We could change the name and maybe the logo could look different.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know. I just wanted to get people together. And I think that name and that group made sense for a while. And I think we retained a lot of the folks who kind of joined really early. And that felt good to kind of keep the momentum going.</p>
<p>But especially going into this year as we&#8217;re coming I guess&#8230; Yeah, we&#8217;re over two years old now. We had really started to gel a smaller, specific, dedicated team of folks that was just this core group of eight who had been consistently coming to stuff. The steering committee had had as many as 30 members at certain points.</p>
<p>So after a while and really working together week over week, we kind of gelled down this specific group. And once we kind of landed on that core group, we really started to ask ourselves, what do we actually want to do together? And what do we want to do here? And that led us to thinking about questions of what is the right name? Is Design to Divest, a project within our kind of wider umbrella of things that we like to do? We determined that it was.</p>
<p>So basically where we landed was Design to Divest is the first large scale project completed by √Är√≤ko Cooperative. And √Är√≤ko Cooperative is going to be kind of an umbrella organization for a variety of different initiatives that we&#8217;re going to be doing moving forward. So Design to Divest being one of them. And that sits within our core offerings of things like zines, or merchandise, and publishing. We are also going to be doing some consulting work. So we actually just completed our first client project very recently. So there&#8217;ll be case studies about that probably up on our website by the time this interview is up.</p>
<p>And then we&#8217;re going to be doubling down on a lot of community initiatives. So we&#8217;re going to be doing quarterly events that are for Black designers specifically, that are free. We&#8217;ll probably be doing some more open events for the wider design community that&#8217;ll be paid for. And then we have a Discord server, which is kind of just a little bit more impromptu place for Black designers to congregate.</p>
<p>So we really just took stock of all that stuff and determined let&#8217;s put Design to Divest in its own box that allows all of the work that&#8217;s been done by people who are not active in the group anymore to be really properly archived, and separated, and celebrated. And then gives this new kind of smaller group full license to create what we want this thing to be for ourselves, and really just not be bound by any historical things, or previous projects, or any of that.</p>
<p>And just really go from the ground up, working together to come up with a new name, and new brand, and new direction, and all of that together. So it was really just a chance to celebrate some old work and give ourselves a fresh start looking into the years to come for the rest of the cooperative.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Sounds like it was a massive change than just the name. It really sort of changed a lot with just even the purpose. I mean, not so much the purpose behind why you came together. But how do you keep the group moving forward? What are the new goals and things of that nature? Are there other things that have changed over the years now that you&#8217;ve been doing this?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. I think the biggest honor of my design career so far to build this group with these folks. And we&#8217;ve gone through all kinds of changes, whether it&#8217;s going from using Zoom for our meetings and Slack, to moving to Discord, and using that as a primary surface for all meetings, and events, and planning, and all that stuff. To getting a better sense of what our actual deliverables and our offerings. The offerings we want to actually put out for our clients, and determining that maybe we want to do X thing and this thing, but maybe not this thing even, if we have the capacity and capability to do it.</p>
<p>And I think the biggest change too is we&#8217;ve all gotten paid this year for the first time. That&#8217;s a big change. We&#8217;ve been doing it for free for two years, and we were able to get some clients, and get some funds raised. Everyone was able to get a check this year I think. I&#8217;m excited to see my own tax return from the work that we completed this year.</p>
<p>And I think another big change too has just been getting a lot closer to each other as a group, to where we feel really good about just moving forward on new projects without having to have everyone touching everything at the same time. I think that&#8217;s been a big learning development for us is that we have a really wide set of skills in our core group of now nine. And we can divide and thrive. We don&#8217;t need to have eight people on a certain project. We can just have two people on a project, and they&#8217;re going to run it great. And that means three people over here can go and do something else.</p>
<p>So that process of just figuring out our working norms, and how do we operate as a non-hierarchical design entity, and just really figuring out how we can make this thing sustainable for the long term in a way that feels really good has been a series of ongoing changes for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now let&#8217;s talk about The Imaginary School. The Imaginary School on the website is described as, &#8220;An eye on our present, past, and future.&#8221; Where did the idea to start that come from?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So The Imaginary School I think, at least for me in my own practice. √Är√≤ko is kind of the group activity that I really spent a lot of my time with. And it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re going to be doing consulting and making new projects and all this stuff. And Imaginary School is kind of my personal just personal passion project, which is really about education.</p>
<p>So the actual idea of The Imaginary School started back in college with a couple of my friends who were all a bunch of creative folks as well, and we just kind of came up with the name as an umbrella for any collaborations we were going to do amongst ourselves. And we put out one project, and didn&#8217;t really put out any other formal projects after that. We all continued to stay friends, and we&#8217;ve all worked on different projects and stuff together. But nothing really formalized.</p>
<p>And I really wanted to take that, and revive it, and bring some life back to it in the form of more open collaboration with people all over the world, and different interests, and people that we didn&#8217;t have personal connections to.</p>
<p>So in 2019 actually, I spent a lot of time thinking about what the new iteration of this thing could be. And that was spurned by some conversations I had with another friend who was in grad school and who was continuously being like, &#8220;Hey Shak, you got to read this PDF of Saidiya Hartman,&#8221; who I&#8217;d never heard of at the time. I was like, &#8220;Oh yeah, that&#8217;d be great.&#8221; And then, Hey Shak, you got to check out this great PDF by Fred Moten, and you got to check out this from da, da, da, da.&#8221; And after a while I was like, &#8220;You know Isaac, is there a way we can just share this knowledge more widely? Because there&#8217;s so many of these things that are becoming really foundational to my thinking and design process, and I never would&#8217;ve learned about them had you not shared that PDF with me.&#8221; And we were like, &#8220;Yeah, I think we could figure something out.&#8221;</p>
<p>So we really took the idea of The Imaginary School of that open collaboration, and wanted to figure out a way to just open source it basically and make it accessible to everyone. And also something that other people could replicate.</p>
<p>So right now, it is a two-part kind of operation. We have an arena page, which just houses all kinds of resources from across the internet in fields as disparate as video games, to the environment, to Palestine, to parenting and sexuality and relationships. We just have a ton of different information that&#8217;s just kind of crowdsourced and crowd collected. And then there&#8217;s a Discord server which is attached to it where someone can go and find someone to chat about with if they have questions about a particular topic or they found something really interesting and just are looking for someone to chat to.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s this two-pronged approach. And it&#8217;s pretty chill, for lack of a better word. I don&#8217;t spend a ton of time trying to curate stuff and push for engagement on it. I just really want it to be something that&#8217;s easy for people to get into and use as they please. But that&#8217;s an ongoing project for me. And I&#8217;m always looking for new ways to grow it and activate it. So I&#8217;ll be doing probably more of that into the new year as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I see on the website you have some of these discussions that you mentioned. Does doing The Imaginary School and √Är√≤ko Cooperative, do they share similar goals? Do you see there being some overlap between those two?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Definitely. I think any project that I work on ideally shares some goals. And I think in those two projects, just that idea of having a more open and equitable kind of design world is a big one for me. I mean, the most popular channel of our Imaginary School channels is one that is specifically decentering whiteness in design.</p>
<p>So I think there&#8217;s a lot of overlap in the goals of those two projects. I think √Är√≤ko is a bit doing it a bit more active way, whereas Imaginary School is more passive and just trying to get people information so they can reach conclusions and do their projects on their own. But definitely a lot of overlap in the long-term goals of both of those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In recent years, what would you say the biggest lesson is that you&#8217;ve learned about yourself?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I think the biggest lesson I have learned about myself in recent years is that I do not have the energy that I thought I had, is the biggest one. I think even when I was younger and would work all day, and commute, and then come home and work for five or six hours at night into the wee hours of the morning on freelance projects or side stuff, I think I was kidding myself that I could keep that going for as long as I did.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s really the biggest thing is that for me to do my best work and especially do my best work with other people, I need time to unplug, and de-stress, and just not think about design or any of the large issues that are constantly weighing on my head. I need time to just decompress and really give myself time to recover in between really digging into these projects.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think the older we get, our energy levels in some ways kind of naturally wane. But I definitely get what you mean about that, it&#8217;s more about what you put your energy towards, I think also.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think when you&#8217;re younger, there&#8217;s a lot of stuff that you try to do all the things because you have the time, and the capacity, and the space to do all of that. And then as you get older, you just become just more intentional about what it is that you actually want to put your energy towards, what you want to put your name on. That sort of thing, what you want to be affiliated with. It&#8217;s less about doing all the things, and more about trying to do the right things for you.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yep. I completely agree. And as someone who had a traditional education in a lot of ways but didn&#8217;t have a traditional design education, I spent a lot of my twenties&#8230; I turn 30 next year. I spent a lot of my twenties just saying yes to anything I could get my hands on, because I felt like I needed to prove my skills. And also I wanted to develop my skills. And that got very old after a while, especially when you&#8217;re still dealing with commitments that are maybe multiple years old or something like this from when you were younger and a different person.</p>
<p>So yeah, definitely something as I move on is going to be just probably saying no to almost everything. And really allowing myself to just focus on the things that I think are going to make the most impact for myself and for the world. So √Är√≤ko and Imaginary School are two big ones.</p>
<p>I also would love to have a little time to just do stuff for fun. Again, I think I spent a lot of my last 10 years of my design career doing projects for people and with people and always serving as that creative liaison, or designer, or creative director or whatever. But it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve done something that was just for me. And I&#8217;d love to get back to the ideas I had when I was a kid of making a comic book. So hopefully that&#8217;s the next actual personal project I do I complete in some indeterminable amount of time, maybe in the next five years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me about the comic book. Because that&#8217;s an idea that I&#8217;ve had for a very long time. I&#8217;ve always wanted to do some type of a comic book, or a graphic novel, or something. I&#8217;ve sort of done print design at different times throughout my career. But I&#8217;d say roughly within the past year and a half or so, I actually started working with printers. Because I was working at a company, and we made a print magazine. So I got to really see behind the scenes with paper types and all that stuff.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s a lot less expensive than I thought it was. I think at the time that I was doing it also, there was just this massive paper shortage. Because I would think with masks and with just all the other stuff happening with the pandemic and things like that, everything was in a shortage. There were supply chain issues and stuff. But it&#8217;s actually a lot cheaper to print say 100 copies of a comic book if you just want to test it out. Lot cheaper than you think, or a lot cheaper than I thought at least. I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not a lot of money at all. I could do that.&#8221; I just now need to write it, maybe find somebody to draw it color, and get all that sort of stuff</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I mentioned earlier I&#8217;m hugely influenced by video games, manga, anime, all that stuff. So this also ties into my last thing about taking more time and rest and all that. I&#8217;ve just been trying to a lot more time just playing video games and reading comic books over the last couple years. Because basically in the end of 2019, I was just so burned out and just had totally ran myself dry. And I realized, &#8220;When was the last time I just played a video game for two hours?&#8221; And it had been basically since my senior year of college. So I was like, &#8220;All right, let me take some more time to do these fun things.&#8221; And so I&#8217;ve been reading a lot more comic books and all that.</p>
<p>And the idea I have, and I&#8217;m happy to share this with you right now, is basically make it a traditional kind of battle anime style, where everyone has a superpower, and they fight a big villain, and there&#8217;s big fight scenes and all that stuff. But have it all be based around a community organization that helps their local community by day, and fights the US government&#8217;s secret agents by night. And all of that happens in their dreams. So it&#8217;s all kind of about astral projection. I think it allows for a lot of fun ideas to roam free. With the core idea of this is a group that&#8217;s been fighting the government for years, and this government agency has been suppressing social unrest in people&#8217;s dreams for hundreds of years or something like that. So that&#8217;s the loose idea that I&#8217;m working with, and I really do want to put it to paper sometime soon, because I think it&#8217;s certainly something I would be really happy to read at the very least.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I like that. I like that a lot. That&#8217;s a really good idea. Who are some of the mentors, or colleagues, or people that have helped you get to this point in your career?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I think there&#8217;s one person in particular who is absolutely the most influential. And I mentioned her already, but Meg V√°zquez. She&#8217;s just been so huge for me, I think, and really getting that serious design education. So she&#8217;s my boss at GQ. So we worked together at GQ for two years. We&#8217;ve worked together at Splice for almost four years. And Meg was a part of the Hillary for America design team. So she cut her teeth on all that stuff. And she&#8217;s just been a huge figure for me in just in terms of just getting to know design better, and knowing how to operate, and how to just do design in a professional setting. So really, really could not have done it without her.</p>
<p>And then in addition to her, Charles Hall is another one who&#8217;s really important for me in terms of my creative growth and expression. And he was a TA of mine at Penn in the graduate seminar I mentioned early in our interview. And he&#8217;s an amazing designer, creative director in his own write. He wrote Michael Jordan&#8217;s retirement letter, and just has an amazing way with words and communication. And we&#8217;ve worked on a couple projects together. And he&#8217;s taught me a ton about the industry, and really pushed me as a designer to I think embrace my experiences a lot, and really lean on the things that I know better than other people. So those folks are super crucial.</p>
<p>But I also have to give a really big shout out to just my whole √Är√≤ko Cooperative team. I&#8217;ve learned so much from working with those people. And it&#8217;s hard to put into words I think the amount of knowledge we&#8217;ve been able to build just amongst ourselves in the last couple years. And I think I&#8217;ve learned as much from that group in two and a half years than I have in my four years of Ivy League education. So those folks are all really foundational for me, and I could not have gotten to where I am or done any of this stuff where I&#8217;m at now without the help of the Meg, Charles, and my √Är√≤ko squad.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you want to change in 2023?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
In 2023, I want to just be really deliberate and intentional with how I&#8217;m spending my time. I want to be spending my time when I have to be working and making money, doing something that is directly making people&#8217;s lives better. So I&#8217;m excited about joining this mental health company to do that.</p>
<p>And then also in my time out of the office, I want to make sure that anytime I&#8217;m spending doing additional work, it&#8217;s stuff that&#8217;s really important to me and really is serving me in the world. And then just having plenty of time to just relax. So really just making sure that I&#8217;m not spreading myself too thin. In fact, doing the opposite and giving myself a lot of time to just learn, and read, and mess with this comic book, and just chill out a little bit. I think I&#8217;ve earned it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to still be doing? What kind of new work do you want to do? Anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. I think in the next five years, I would ideally be working full-time for myself or in collaboration with some of the folks I&#8217;ve mentioned before. I&#8217;m really excited about this new gig, and I have no idea where that&#8217;s going to take me. But I really have the long term goal of being able to run my my own studio, either by myself or in collaboration with other folks. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m really hoping for is getting the chance to just do that, and have a lot more freedom to go and just build the things that I think the world needs to have out in the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything, your projects you mentioned? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So the best place to find me is just at my website. It&#8217;s shakeil.com. S-H-A-K-E-I-L.com. You&#8217;re going to find everything there. I&#8217;m really active on Arena, so if you&#8217;re looking for a little bit more of a social atmosphere, you can find me at Arena/shakeilgreeley. And then for √Är√≤ko, you can find us at aroko.coop. So A-R-O-K-O.coop. And that&#8217;s a great place to go and get a full sense of what we&#8217;re working on. We have a really large project, which is our design manifesto that&#8217;ll be coming out probably by the time this interview airs. So definitely go check that out. You&#8217;re going to get some really interesting stuff, I&#8217;ll tell you that much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well Shakeil Greeley, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I feel like this interview was a great way to kind of close out the year. One, I think just to hear about the great things that you&#8217;re doing around something that we&#8217;ve mentioned on the show over the past two years, which is Design to Divest, that&#8217;s now the √Är√≤ko Cooperative. But seeing how you are working with something like that and then taking that to move forward into a bigger, grander future, I think that&#8217;s something that we all of course want to see, but something that we all need as well. And I&#8217;m just glad you were able to come on the show, and share your story. And I&#8217;m really excited to see what you do next. So thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Thank you so much for having me, Maurice. It&#8217;s been such a pleasure and a real honor to be on the show. It&#8217;s an amazing way for me to close my ear up.</p>
