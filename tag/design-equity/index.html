Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Hi everyone. My name is Zariah Cameron. I am a senior graphic design student at North Carolina A&#038;T State University. Within the past two years, I&#8217;ve been independently studying UX design, which is now the space that I&#8217;m in. And I&#8217;m now evolving into a UX equity strategist. It&#8217;s now my evolving role.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. How has the summer been going for you?</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
This particular summer is definitely been an unexpected turn of events in the best of ways I could say. Of course, just the opportunities of being able to speak and be in spaces where I definitely feel supported by my black community, specifically Black Designers has been great, but it has been hectic. I&#8217;ve been working my internship as a UX designer and then preparing for my last semester of school and just with my program and all the things we&#8217;re gearing up for. So it&#8217;s been a very busy summer. I&#8217;m trying to find ways to prevent burnout and exhaustion, especially again in the middle of pandemic. I&#8217;m currently home. I haven&#8217;t really gone anywhere in a year and a half, so I think that mental exhaustion is hitting me a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. This whole year, I mean, especially I think this summer in particular, it is probably harder than last summer, well for two reasons. One, we have a vaccine. And two, people aren&#8217;t taking it. COVID rates are going back up. And so, I really feel for, I mean, not just parents right now that have unvaccinated children, but also students right now. This is such a pivotal time in your development right now, from 18 to 21, 22-ish, you don&#8217;t really get this time back. And for it to be take in place during such a very stressful time in the world right now is really tough. But I mean, given all of that, what are you kind of doing for self care? How are you maintaining yourself while taking on all these responsibilities?</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Yeah, I feel like I always tell people sometimes it&#8217;s not enough time in the day, but I&#8217;ve been trying to force myself to implement that time and schedule that time because for a lot of people that do know me, I am a scheduler. If it&#8217;s not on my calendar, it pretty much doesn&#8217;t happen. So I&#8217;ve been trying to schedule in that time, whether it be through writing, whether it be through even binge watching. Just to have some mindless TV to just get my mind away from all the other responsibilities that I have. Going outside for a walk. I love hiking and going in nature whenever I can. And also, just journaling has been another way of me kind of releasing and relaxing from everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you say you&#8217;ve changed over the past year?</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Gosh, I&#8217;ve changed a lot, but I really didn&#8217;t think that I&#8217;d change within a year being in the same exact place that I have been since March of 2020. But it&#8217;s surprising what a year will do. And within a year, I feel like I&#8217;ve gained so much confidence within myself and been able to really vocalize a lot of the things that I was maybe apprehensive or scared or anxious to express, whether it was me as an individual designer, as a person, as a community leader now. Those types of roles, I never really saw myself being a part of a year ago. And now, I&#8217;m leading the community. I&#8217;m advocating for other black design students. I&#8217;m being able to speak on that work through various different speaking engagements, which, one, I never at all saw myself as being that person to kind of go up and speak. But now I&#8217;ve just definitely seen myself evolved with being more authentically myself and being able to be comfortable doing that even if other people may have their own negative opinions towards that, and also being okay with that as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, speaking of opportunities, you spoke at this year at Where are the Black Designers Conference that they had back in June. I mean, that was a pretty stacked panel that you were on. The panel was called Navigating Different Design Professions and Levels as a Black Designer. And you&#8217;re on there with people that have been on Revision Path before; Kevin Bethune, Timothy Bardlavens, Gabrielle Smith, Raja Schaar, who I think is a professor at&#8230; I think she&#8217;s at either at Temple or Drexel.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Drexel.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One of the two. I get the-</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Yeah, at Drexel.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
At Drexel. I get the E in Temple and Drexel mixed up, but yeah, she&#8217;s at Drexel. And then moderated by Omari Souza, who someone else has been on the show. I mean, you held your own in that panel. Those were some really heavy hitters. I mean, to be able to really speak about the work that you&#8217;re doing and you&#8217;re still a college student is great. I mean, I think that&#8217;s wonderful.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Yeah. One, they&#8217;re all amazing people. Raja, I&#8217;m very close with. And so, to just be on the panel with her was just amazing, and just having that community. And I tell people being able to speak at the Where are the Black Designers Conference was really a full circle for me because I was an audience member just last year watching that. And so to be able to have that opportunity to speak on that panel and speak about my experiences was definitely an honor.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you mentioned this internship that you were doing, or you just finished up. That was at Ally Bank. How was that experience?</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
It&#8217;s definitely a surprising experience. I did not know what to expect. I mean, I had gotten accustomed to&#8230; Well, I got a feel for the culture of the company with a few of events that I had been able to participate through my university and just Ally being a connected company. But I really didn&#8217;t know how that experience was going to be virtually. And from my past experiences, I kind of mixed the idea of interning or working at another financial institution. And so, I really wasn&#8217;t sure what this experience would be like.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
I had expressed to my recruiter before I even accepted the offer and even when I accepted the offer that I really want to focus on inclusion work, equity work within the design space. Honestly, I really wasn&#8217;t sure how I was going to do that in a bank and what that would even look like, but I definitely had a really good experience and just being able to not only connect with other interns that look like me, that went to other HBCUs and even non-HBCU students and just the closest we had together in that virtual space, but also having like, I realized how important it is to have a manager that really supports you in your growth and your goals. And so I was very grateful to have a manager that did that. He kind of helped me to maneuver through that summer. And through that, I was able to get connected to this inclusive design team that was actually just starting up within our design organization.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
And so, being able to be a part of that and lead a lot of discussions that I believe needed to happen, it allowed me to kind of realize or see what role I fit best within design, and also to see the importance of how design fits into helping marginalized communities reach that economic mobility and financial freedom. And so, it was definitely a great moment for me, and also just to have people that were supportive with me during that process too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting how financial institutions are starting to become sort of the vanguard of that kind of equity center design. We&#8217;ve had several people on the show before from Capital One. That&#8217;s such a huge part of their design ethos, is making sure that as you&#8217;re saying about underrepresented or marginalized communities have that financial freedom, but just the level of care that they put into all of their interactions to make sure that equity is part of the goal from conversation design, to even how they sort of lay out the physical layout of their banks and everything. It&#8217;s really interesting how that sector has been sort of a forefront when it comes to that.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Yeah, I definitely agree. I think I was able to see that from a financial lens and being able to have those conversations of like, &#8220;Hey, we really need to focus on the culture of our customers and focusing on working with our communities&#8221; and being able to provide this assistance, or, &#8220;Who are we actually excluding in these conversations?&#8221; and uncovering what our biases are or our assumptions are of our customers, or even people who could be potential customers of our bank and being able to create that organic relationship because we are an online bank. And so we have to be able to foster some type of connection to them, especially if we&#8217;re not going to be face-to-face.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). I mean, look, my money is at Ally. So I trust that they&#8217;re doing the right thing. They&#8217;re doing something right. Let&#8217;s talk about the AEI Design Program. I first heard of this actually at the Where are the Black Designers Conference this year when you were speaking about it. But tell me more about the project. I mean, you started this while you were still a student. I mean, you&#8217;re still a student now, but you started this while you were at North Carolina A&#038;T, right?</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Yeah, I did. I started this right after actually Where are the Black Designers last year, and I was just very empowered and inspired by [inaudible 00:13:45]. I was able to connect with so many different black designers and have that support in that community. But unfortunately, I realized that a lot of what I was seeing, they were professionals. And I wanted something where there was a space just for us as students. Looking at my own journey, I realized that there were so many gaps that I was missing, and not just within my own education, but just the support whether it be mentorship, sponsorship, things like that, that were hindering me from really fully being successful or having access to certain resources or just knowledge in general that would help me get myself in that door of even just landing my first internship.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
I realized there was a lot of other students, whether they went to a PWI or an HBCU, were experiencing those same challenges and they really didn&#8217;t have any type of community. No matter where they were, they didn&#8217;t feel any sense of belonging. And I wanted to bring that element to this space. And of course, there are tons of design student communities that were out there, but I wanted there to be a community just for us. And so we&#8217;ve evolved. I&#8217;ve evolved ever since then. I think AEI has definitely helped me to evolve into a leader that I never expected. I&#8217;ve always wanted to be some form of a leader, I just didn&#8217;t know what. And being able to have this program outside of just school has allowed me to flourish and have my own space and create a freedom to put all of these things out here with our programs, our events, all those different things. And also to be able to reach a larger audience than just the students that are within my school.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
And so I was leading a team of three other students. And now we&#8217;re growing. We just added a few more team members to our group. And so I&#8217;m really excited of what we&#8217;ll be able to accomplish this upcoming school year too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, as far as when you&#8217;re doing all this organizing and you&#8217;re getting students and stuff together, are events kind of part of this as well? Are you staging any sort of virtual events?</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Yeah. All of our events are virtual because I realized, again, there was that access component, and I want students to be able to access us even beyond this pandemic if we get out of it, and just being able to have access to those resources whether you&#8217;re in our state, whether you go to our school or you&#8217;re not. And that&#8217;s what I want to be, provide through this program. Actually, within the next few weeks, we&#8217;ll be actually launching our Fall Design Bootcamp where students will be able to work with our company partners and create a design solution based on their stated problem. And so I&#8217;m really excited for this because it not only gives an opportunity for students to connect with each other, with other black students, but also for them to connect with companies and for them to see firsthand on a more personal level of how these companies operate, what their processes are like, and to ask those hard questions and for the companies to just see that talent that&#8217;s there. So I&#8217;m really excited for this, in particular for this year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you like to see AEI continue to grow? I mean, it sounds like you&#8217;re already on a good path right now.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m really excited. I mean, of course, I&#8217;m hoping to have more company partnerships of course. But I mean just this year, this year in January, three or four of my students got landed their very first design internships. I think two of them are at Facebook right now. One of them&#8217;s at Spotify, and one of them landed a full time gig at Allscripts. I basically help them to transition through their interview process. And so, to see them land those interviews and land that offer was so thrilling for me. That&#8217;s one of my goals that I want to do this school year, as well as to continue to allow students to receive those offers and find a place where they feel comfortable and safe.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
I also want within this next year to transition into our mental health initiative. A lot of students, especially during this pandemic, have definitely had burnout, have had several different experiences where their mental health has been at risk. Especially as a creative, I feel like we sometimes burn ourselves out even more because we&#8217;re exhausting so much creative energy. And so, I think one of my goals is to really start implementing different sessions or conversations around the importance of mental health and just finding that joy in our lives as black people and helping to separate ourselves from all the trauma that we have to endure and see and experience. And then I think my final thing is I&#8217;m in the process of making us an official nonprofit. So our main goal is the bootcamp, this mental health initiative, and leading into our nonprofit status.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s amazing. I mean, I&#8217;d take my hat off to you for being able to accomplish all of that even while you&#8217;re in school and doing these internships. I mean, that&#8217;s really admirable. I mean, I have to say you&#8217;re getting your career off to such a fantastic start right now, like you said, just helping out with community, it&#8217;s one thing to be able&#8230; Of course, you&#8217;re doing internships and being able to speak and stuff like that, but then to also give back to that community at the same time is, I mean, that&#8217;s really admirable.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Thank you. I definitely appreciate it. I think the reason why I wanted to start this out while I was in school is because I can see it from the lens of the student and I understand what those struggles are and what I&#8217;ve experienced. And I&#8217;m able to really advocate for what is a need. And not that people who are outside of school or far moved from school can&#8217;t advocate for those things, but I think within my current generation and just being within in the know of what really is going on and the realities of these educational institutions, I&#8217;m able to really speak on those gaps, those issues, and what solutions need to be implemented to move forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, that makes sense. Students know what students need, you know? I mean, I couldn&#8217;t possibly guess what students now would want. I&#8217;m 20 something years removed from that so I couldn&#8217;t tell you. I mean, to be able to do it from that perspective is also a really added benefit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Just to kind of switch gears a little bit here, because I&#8217;m curious where that spirit of volunteerism and everything sort of comes from. Tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
I grew up about&#8230; I always say I&#8217;m from Atlanta, Georgia, because a lot of people, when you say somewhere else, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;What? Where are you from?&#8221; So I&#8217;m about 30 minutes on the south side out from the city of Atlanta.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Design was never really a thought in my mind, that I would ever major in design. I&#8217;ve always seen myself as creative with writing, being an outlet, whether it be poetry, things like that, or even just expressing myself in a lot of different ways, but never really saw myself going into design. Because I was such a strong writer, I actually had in my mind all the way until my senior year that I was going to be a journalism major. That&#8217;s what I wanted to do. Everyone was always telling me that I was a strong writer and that was the direction that I was going to take.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
But I was very fortunate enough to have the opportunity, for those that don&#8217;t know me, I went to a year-round school. That allowed me to have breaks in between the year when other students were in school. During that time, I was able to be around my dad who works in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech. And I was submerged in technology. I was just completely at awe by computer science and how tech was able to just change and impact lives. And through that, just being around there, I was able to work with Black Girls CODE and work with students and teach them and volunteer in those different ways. I think through that, it was like, &#8220;Wow, I&#8217;ve really liked doing this type of work.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m going to do it or what I&#8217;m going to do, but I really do like the space. And I also really love working with children and teaching them in some capacity because I love just when their eyes light up when they&#8217;ve learned something new, especially when it relates to technology.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
And so at the time, design really wasn&#8217;t this great big&#8230; Especially UX design, it was not this great big buzz word or exciting space to be in that people were talking about, especially within academia. And so everyone was like, &#8220;Okay, if you want to be in technology, go into computer science. That&#8217;s the only way. That&#8217;s the only possible way you&#8217;re going to be in technology if you want to impact tech.&#8221; And so I was like, &#8220;Okay, well I guess this is the path that I want to go into.&#8221; And I always tell this part of the story because I think it&#8217;s important for students and anybody else to know and understand the path is not going to be perfect. It&#8217;s definitely not going to be linear. And just because you get one rejection doesn&#8217;t mean that is end of your journey.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
And so, I applied to our Computer Science Program at my school, and I got rejected. I thought it was the end of the world and that I was not going to be able to make the impact that I wanted. But I&#8217;m very glad that I did get that rejection because I don&#8217;t think I would be where I am right now in my journey. My school has a Graphic Design department which explores elements of game design and obviously the foundational elements of graphic design. We learn a little bit of CAD and modeling and all these different areas. I decided to kind of go into that space because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, well I can go into design, and maybe still somewhat have an impact in technology.&#8221; Through that, I was able to transition into UX design very easily through just like me researching, doing things on my own.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
UX design isn&#8217;t offered a part of our curriculum. But through that foundation that I did have through my school and just the support of my teachers, specifically my black teachers, they were able to kind of help me and guide me into this new space that I am now in, which is UX design. Like I said, this path was definitely not linear. It took me a long time to figure out what exactly I wanted to do. But I think with UX design, it allows me to get the best of both worlds of working in tech if I want to and being able to still be in that design space while also just being able to understand people and implement their stories and understand who they are to implement within the experience. I think that&#8217;s probably one of my favorite parts about UX is, it&#8217;s really is all about people. And I think being a writer, I&#8217;m a natural storyteller. And so I think it always resonates with me when I&#8217;m able to connect someone&#8217;s story to the experience that we&#8217;re creating within design and tech.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a really great way to sort of tie those two concepts together. For a while, Revision Path had a kind of this writing initiative, we called it Recognize, where it was sort of like an essay submission sort of thing. People would submit essays around a certain theme, but they would have to be designed focused. For last year for example, the theme was Fresh. And so you would write design essays that sort of in some way encompass the theme of Fresh. My goal with it is actually kind of the goal of what you were sort of alluding to. It&#8217;s about using writing and using texts and using storytelling as a way to kind of also put forth these certain design concepts or things like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Unfortunately, Recognize was not super successful. We have to kind of shut it down this year. I hope to bring it back at some point in the future. But I like how you&#8217;re able to kind of tie into what writing does for you as a designer and how that storytelling ties into what you do with UX design. I think that&#8217;s a really powerful connection to make.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Yeah. Like I said, I think I finally found my space. Just because I think even within computer science, there is that level of strategy and critical thinking that I had the knack for. And now to be able to kind of have that skill set or mindset and implement that ideology within design has been just really great for me. I think now I&#8217;ve definitely seen myself evolve from just an individual contributor, like an individual design contributor, to this person that is really being able to lead conversations about how we think about design, in again as I mentioned before, that inclusion equity space.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me more about the program at A&#038;T. I think when folks look at HBCU and then they think about design, I&#8217;m not sure of North Carolina A&#038;T is a school that they may readily think about. But can you just tell us like a little bit about the program and sort of what you&#8217;re going to remember the most from being at A&#038;T? Because you&#8217;re about to graduate this semester.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Yeah. I wish that our program was a little bit more marketable. I wish they marketed us a little bit better, because I think a lot of students would benefit from just having black teachers that really want you to succeed and do well. And I think also, I wish that our particular department sat in a different space because I think sometimes we can get overlooked. So we sit within the College of Science and Technology. And so when a lot of people think of science and technology, you think of biology, chemistry, mathematics sits within that space too. And then you&#8217;ve got IT, informational systems, all those things like that. So you&#8217;ve got all these other majors, and then we have graphic design. And so, a lot of people whenever they think about the College of Science and Technology, they don&#8217;t think about that graphic design technology space being an option for them to major in especially because North Carolina A&#038;T is especially known for agriculture, in the name, Engineering especially is one of the largest areas that we&#8217;re known for.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
So again, design is really second priority. But I wish that it wasn&#8217;t, because again, like I said, I&#8217;ve had really great professors that have really helped me grow as a designer. Some definite tough love that&#8217;s been given to me and brief anecdote. I had a professor. I failed his class in my first year. I really just didn&#8217;t do well and had to retake it. And the second time, I got a B+. He had written and I told him, I was like, &#8220;Thank you. Thank you for helping me to get to this point.&#8221; And he was like, &#8220;I already knew you could do it. You just have to really prove to people that you can do it and you have the capability because I know it&#8217;s already in there.&#8221; And just him really believing in me and giving me that tough love that I needed, just helped me to appreciate not only him more but the space that I&#8217;m in, and really been able to push myself that much harder and see what I can achieve.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
I think having those people in your corner that are looking out for you in that way is one of the best experiences. Now, reflecting and looking back, now that I&#8217;m getting ready to graduate, it&#8217;s something that I definitely love and will miss. Yeah, I have some more thoughts, but I&#8217;ll stop talking [inaudible 00:31:10].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, I have to say that&#8217;s one thing about HBCUs that&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. You just don&#8217;t get that at other schools. The professors really do care. And that&#8217;s not to say that at PWIs and at other schools, other professors don&#8217;t care. But I mean I can only speak from my experience also going to an HBCU. I went to Morehouse. I mean, there&#8217;s just a certain different level of care. They&#8217;re really looking out for you in ways that you may not even really be considering. I mean, don&#8217;t get me wrong. There&#8217;s some professors that are like, &#8220;You&#8217;re just another student, just another number, et cetera.&#8221; But I think once you get into your degree program, you&#8217;d be surprised just how much the professors are really rooting for you and wanting to make sure that you succeed, because it looks good on them if they have graduates that come out of the program. So it makes sense that at HBCUs that they would just be more open to that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then of course, it&#8217;s just as black people helping black people. I&#8217;ve had several other folks on the show that when they talk about their time at other design institutions that I won&#8217;t name, but they&#8217;re not HBCU, but at other design institutions, it&#8217;s rough. Their educational experience is rough. There&#8217;s no mercy. And certainly not anywhere their having black professors or even really able to design towards their culture in the work that they do. I mean, you have all these different inherent benefits that come with being able to study at an HBCU. And just from what you&#8217;re sharing about the program, sounds like it&#8217;s a really great program. I mean, NC A&#038;T overall is a great school. I think it&#8217;s one of the biggest research institutions in North Carolina. I&#8217;m guessing probably second to UNC.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Yeah, [inaudible 00:32:59]. I mean, of course, every school has it&#8217;s&#8230; I really had to advocate for myself and try to reach out to certain people and do certain things that I was like, &#8220;Hey.&#8221; That I actually saw everything that these companies had to offer, the realities of what things were, and being able to kind of bring that back to the students within my program and show that like, &#8220;Hey, there actually is great black designer talent that needs to be sought after.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Duke is the other school that I was thinking about.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Folks that went to Duke don&#8217;t kill me, I was like&#8230; But I know that North Carolina A&#038;T though, is one of the big research institutions in the state. So that&#8217;s good to know. And also while you were at A&#038;T, you worked at a number of internships. I mean, you mentioned Ally. But you worked at what? Like two or three other companies while you were there, right?</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Yeah, I did. I worked for Wells Fargo last summer. It&#8217;s kind of weird because all my internships that I&#8217;ve had have all been virtual so I have no idea what this corporate world will look like once we go back in person. That&#8217;s going to be a whole another, I guess, hill or road we&#8217;ll have to cross to get there. But yeah, I interned at Wells Fargo. I wasn&#8217;t a designer, but it gave me the perspective of just how things work, how systems work, how corporate space work, how financial institutions are run, and in some ways being that fly on the wall of seeing the realities of what things were. But it gave me perspective of not just&#8230; Even though I wasn&#8217;t a designer for that particular role, I was a QA, I was a quality assurance analyst. And so that role taught me how to really pay attention to the details, the importance of how things work and how things function within a platform, a tool, and pointing out those shortcomings of how we can really better improve those products for the user.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
And so, that really helped me to analyze a lot things better when it came to actually designing. And then recently what this is, I worked for a startup. It was really small. That was really catered to black women&#8217;s hair and finding the right hair regimen for them. And that was a really great experience to kind of work on it from the ground up and being able to work with other black women that had natural hair and just pouring my own experience, my own stories, and other people&#8217;s research and hair journeys into that. So that was a really fun experience. It&#8217;s also challenging in that quick, fast paced type of environment.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
And then recently, before Ally I worked at PepsiCo as sort of a UX, UI designer, which I focus more on UI. And so, I realized I&#8217;m a better UX designer than a UI designer. I think people definitely should understand the difference because I think sometimes we group it together, but they definitely are separate things and have their own responsibilities. And I think people are stronger or, I guess, weaker in certain spaces. I definitely saw myself as more of a UX designer. But through that experience, I learned so much. I learned about the responsibilities and the job of a UI designer and how much work it takes in the input and all the different intricacies that you have to think about when developing certain things.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
So that was a really good experience as well. And then I think just as I&#8217;ve grown, I&#8217;ve evolved and figured out what&#8217;s the best space for me to be in through all these different internship opportunities that I&#8217;ve had, and just where do I not only feel the most supported but also safe because I&#8217;ve definitely thought a lot about myself as a black designer. I&#8217;m not just a designer working at a company. But really just caring about the impact that I make. And does that company actually, or the people really care about my wellbeing and not just my individual contribution to the product?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you say all these internships that you&#8217;ve done have been virtual. What is that like? What is a virtual internship like? Just kind of give a brief example of what that&#8217;s like.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not going to just say, oh my gosh, it sucks, but it is a lot harder. Because, one, with PepsiCo for example, I was working or having to interact with working on a project with a physical product. And so it was a lot harder because it was like, &#8220;Okay. I&#8217;m designing for a physical product that I can not see, feel, touch anything. I can&#8217;t interact with to see how it functions to better make improvements on it.&#8221; And so it was more or less like, &#8220;Okay, well I have to watch videos. And I have to figure out, watch customer reviews on this product to see what are their pain points without me actually being able to physically interact with it myself, which was definitely harder.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
I think if I was in the office, I could just go to that room, look at the product, be like, &#8220;Okay, this is what&#8217;s wrong.&#8221; And I think it&#8217;s even more crucial for black people because you do want to make sure that this is a safe and healthy space for you. I heard a lot of people have very toxic experiences from companies. I think that&#8217;s the one big fear because you can easily hide behind a screen and you don&#8217;t really know what that culture is like, and they could be portraying something that may not even be realistic. And then you get in the office and it&#8217;s something completely different.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting. The conversation in tech over the past, I don&#8217;t know, maybe like six or seven years has been around, of course, making sure that these tech companies and design focused companies are safe spaces for black people and people of color to work in. And now with the pandemic and it&#8217;s driving people to have to work from home, how do you make sure that that same feeling is also existing in the virtual space? I mean, I just know from the past few places where I&#8217;ve worked at that have been sort of a hybrid of remote and even in the office, and then of course with the pandemic driving it to be fully remote, it&#8217;s amazing how different sort of microaggressions can kind of pop up or just different sort of ways that you can feel left out in a way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I think that&#8217;s something that companies are still going to have to deal with and try to figure out as it looks like this is not abating anytime soon. We&#8217;re still going to be on this kind of hybrid/fully remote sort of workforce thing. But how do you make sure that those digital spaces are also going to be safe and accommodating for your workers that are people of color? That&#8217;s the best way to put it.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
I definitely agree. I think working with Ally is probably one of the best [inaudible 00:40:36] so far, just because, like I said, I&#8217;ve never been able to connect with other interns in this way. I think that was a big thing. The way that they&#8217;re recruiting was&#8230; I don&#8217;t even know how they did it, but they just chose a really good intern class that reflected the culture of the company that they were really trying to promote. Of course, again like I said, every company has its shortcomings and things like that, but I believe like from the top down, everyone was welcoming and really wanting to promote that culture where you can email an executive and they would reach out to you and they would meet with you and answer your questions or talk to you and have a brief conversation.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
I think that openness is something that you don&#8217;t always get a chance to have and get exposure to. And so, I think not only having a intern class but also having your recruiters really just help you have that personal experience as best as you can in this virtual space. Again, like I said, it was hard not being able to be in the office and collaborate. Especially as designer, it&#8217;s so hard. You&#8217;ve got to find all these alternative ways to collaborate together to design, to communicate virtually, that it can make things a little bit more difficult. But I mean, if the people are good, I think the collaboration will kind of fall in line with that energy and that team chemistry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Right now is your&#8230; I mean, again, you&#8217;re at this very pivotal point in your educational career as well as just your professional career, about to get out there in the working world. Do you feel supported as a black designer?</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
There&#8217;s many different ways we can take that. I want to say yes, but I feel like yes is such a short answer. I think depending on what area of my life that I am a black designer, it could go yes, or maybe, or even no. I think with my Black Designers community, I&#8217;ve been able to find amazing mentors/friends who have really supported me and been like, &#8220;Hey, if you want to take a break, it&#8217;s okay if you want to take a break. We&#8217;re still going to be here when you come back and we&#8217;re going to be holding down the fort till you get back while you&#8217;re gone.&#8221; And being able to be comfortable and also vulnerable with these people has been such a privilege because I know a lot of people don&#8217;t get a chance to do that or don&#8217;t feel comfortable enough to.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
So I think in that way, this community like Where are the Black Designers, my Black Ignite community, those people have really allowed me to be comfortable being my authentic self and also being vulnerable enough to express certain concerns or issues that I may have that&#8217;s going on in my life, whether it be personal or within my career. So I think in that way, I feel supported. I think in a corporate setting, I&#8217;m still navigating through that. I would say yes from certain people, but of course, I&#8217;m still getting a feel for what that is and what people&#8217;s intentions are. I think for the most part, I would say yes.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
But then again, it&#8217;s just been something I&#8217;ve been thinking about. Even looking at Simone Biles and her deciding to leave the Olympics because of her mental health. And people just giving so much backlash to her making that decision because she was prioritizing her mental health and just the exhaustion energy that she was giving out and probably just how tired she was. And just seeing how people only appreciate your skill and the value you bring over your actual health and you as a person. I think that&#8217;s the biggest thing that I&#8217;m concerned about is like, &#8220;Are you really caring about me and my self as a human being? Or is it just the value that I bring to this company? The value that I bring to this community? The value I bring to this school?&#8221; or whatever it may look like. That&#8217;s where I&#8217;m trying to find what that balance is, and who are those people that I should have in my corner, and who are those people that will have access to those versions or sides of me. So that&#8217;s kind of where I am.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s really tricky now. I mean, I say that as someone that&#8217;s been in the industry for a while. I mean, certainly within the past 10 to 12 years or so, we&#8217;ve seen a dramatic increase in really just black spaces at design. There&#8217;s podcasts like this, but there&#8217;s conferences, there&#8217;s meetups, there&#8217;s initiatives like what you&#8217;re doing with AEI Design Program. A lot of that stuff really didn&#8217;t exist 10 years ago. It was hard to find. And so it can be interesting now, especially if you exist among different identities. Like, if you&#8217;re just like a cis black man, and there may be one thing. But what if you&#8217;re a woman? What if you&#8217;re a member of the LGBT community? What if you identify a different part of the gender spectrum? The level of support that you would get as a black designer can even vary within all of those spaces and so. It&#8217;s still evolving like you said, I think. It&#8217;s a big question with a not so simple answer. So I feel you there.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s kind of where I&#8217;m at with all of this. It&#8217;s like in certain places I could say, yes, that I do feel supported. In other spaces, it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re on the fence and you&#8217;re not really completely sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
You still have to only give one element of you. I guess that&#8217;s where code switching comes in. But even then, it&#8217;s like code switching is this element of losing a sense of your identity. That&#8217;s a whole another thing that I&#8217;m trying to navigate through.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What are you obsessed with right now?</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
In terms of personal life?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I was going to say you can answer that any way you like. Personal, professional, whatever.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
I would say&#8230; What am I obsessed right now? I think right now it&#8217;s maybe a weird answer, but I&#8217;m honestly obsessed with the friendships that I&#8217;ve gotten to have over this past year. It&#8217;s very overwhelming. I&#8217;ve never had friend group of black designers or even designers that have really been so overwhelmingly loving to me, not only my career but just me as a person, and really being that support system that I needed. I think for so long&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
I mean, even the people that are like, &#8220;Oh, well you go to HBCU. Of course, you have support.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yes, but even within that HBCU, there are groups.&#8221; There are groups. And so, sometimes you don&#8217;t always fit into those groups. Or even within those groups that you may be a part of, you still don&#8217;t completely feel a sense of belonging. And so to be able to go in a space, be around people that care about me and love me for just who I am and whether I change or evolve or whatever phase of my life that I&#8217;m growing into, that they&#8217;re there to support me and guide me through those different shifts, those different transitions.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
And I know, like I said, weird answer in terms of being obsessed. But I think, like I have my own podcast with Heatherlee who&#8217;s the founder of Black Ignite, and just how our lives cross within a year, I would have never imagined for our friendship to be where it is, going from professional relationship to this very personal friendship that I value very deeply and to be able to work on this podcast with her and hear her story and how much our stories literally are parallel to each other. And so being able to have people like her and other people like Mitzi, like my Design to Divest Community as well. Having them in my corner is something I&#8217;m truly become obsessed with and want to continue to be around and want to just have that energy around me, that healthy energy. Because sometimes being around your own people still isn&#8217;t healthy, so having those people in those relationships has been really great for me within this past year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Aside from those friendships, have you had any mentors or anyone that have really kind of helped you out either over this past year or just along the way in your journey as a designer?</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ve had a lot of different people, some that I&#8217;m very, very fortunate and very grateful to have in my life. And they&#8217;re all for different reasons. At first, at the start of my career or even school experience, I thought that I could really only have one said mentor, and that&#8217;s what it is. But as I&#8217;m evolving, I realized I need different mentors for different things, different spaces in my life. And so, I&#8217;ve had mentors that have taught me about just how to run my program, guiding me answering those questions as we&#8217;re moving into becoming a nonprofit, understanding elements of brand strategy for our program. Then I have mentors that who I now can call friends as well, who have helped me, guide me as a person and just where I need to go on my life.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
And then of course, I have two of my really close professors. One in particular that has become a very good mentor to me, that actually was the one who got me into UX design that just I go for not only personal advice, but of course career advice as well. So I think over this past year, I&#8217;ve definitely had some great champions and mentors in my corner that are designated to different areas of my life to help me to flourish.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work would you like to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Getting my PhD.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
I mean, yes, that is a goal of mine. I&#8217;ve expressed I will not&#8230; a lot of people have told me like, &#8220;Oh, why don&#8217;t you just go ahead and get your PhD now?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m exhausted. I&#8217;m tired. I do not want to go through school again at the moment.&#8221; But I think eventually, right now I currently see myself leading a community, wherever that may be in, whether that be in the corporate space, I definitely see myself leading those conversations surrounding equity within the design space and growing in that, because that is a space that I want to continue to be in, in various different areas, whether it&#8217;s like I said, in the corporate space, leading my community, or even teaching. I think eventually I want to get my PhD within this element of design and psychology in understanding people. And to be able to eventually [inaudible 00:53:17] down the line teach to students, teach to that next generation college students that are coming in.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
I think by then I already have that experience of being in the corporate world myself, and I can be able to instill that wisdom and have those connections to people through my community to be able to give back to those students that I&#8217;m teaching. That&#8217;s eventually where I want to evolve myself into.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you, and your work, and everything you&#8217;re doing online?</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
Yeah, one, they can find me on Medium, in terms of my writing. By the way, an article will be coming out, not through my Medium, but through the Ally Tech Blog on inclusive design being more than a buzz word. So definitely look out for that. And then you can find me on LinkedIn. I&#8217;m very active on there, and it&#8217;s of course just my name. And then you can find me at Instagram. It&#8217;s just my name, zariah.cameron. And then of course our program, our program&#8217;s Instagram, aeidesign_. You can find me active on all of those. Definitely feel free to follow me and stay connected, especially those who want to get plugged into my community, my program, and even companies wanting to work with us, and just people just wanting to connect and definitely open to that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Zariah Cameron, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show, for taking time to come out on the show. Like I said, it&#8217;s been a while since we&#8217;ve had a design student on the show, particularly one from an HBCU. But when I first heard about you at Where are the Black Designers and heard you speak and everything, I was like, &#8220;I got to get her on the show just to have her talk about what she&#8217;s doing.&#8221; I mean, just the fact that you&#8217;re accomplishing this much as a student, I think bodes so well for your future career. I&#8217;m really excited to see what you&#8217;re able to accomplish once you graduated and really got out there in the design world, and are able to make an even bigger impact. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Zariah Cameron:</b><br>
No, thank you. It&#8217;s been such an honor, and thank you for asking such great questions. I love being able to share my story with you and the audience.</p>
