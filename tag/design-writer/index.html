Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>We&#8217;re ending out the month of November with the second part of my conversation with the one and only Phillip J. Clayton. (If you missed the first part of this interview, <a href="/phillip-j-clayton-part-1-of-2" data-wpel-link="internal">check it out here</a>.)</p>
<p>After sharing his thoughts on brand purpose, we started discussing our experiences with art and education, and he spoke about facing limitations in school due to dyslexia and feeling misunderstood by teachers and other authority figures. Phillip also talked about his experiences working with renowned brands (including PepsiCo), judging creative work, the evolving nature of packaging design, the need for a holistic view of design.</p>
<p>Big thanks to Phillip for such a wide-ranging conversation!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, so we&#8217;ve spent a lot of know time, you know, talking about the work that you do through your studio; a lot of your brand identity work and such. But I want to kind of shift the conversation so we can learn more about you. Like, what&#8217;s the Phillip J. Clayton origin story? So&#8230;you&#8217;re originally from Jamaica, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Yes. Born and grew here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>How would you describe growing up there?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>I grew up on a high point of a mountain &#8212; like a cold area. A cold part of the country, in a parish. So I grew up in a small town where it was a lot of mostly religion. So for me, I grew up in religion, Christianity specifically. There&#8217;s this traditional kind of way of doing things, and I felt kind of trapped inside myself. That&#8217;s what it was like for me, artistically, creatively, it&#8217;s more traditional for me. It was very frustrating growing up, honestly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, your father, from doing my research, your father was in advertising, and he was also sort of a fine artist. Was that kind of a bit of a dichotomy between this sort of difficult growing up?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Part of my childhood, I think, was spent trying to be this great artist like my father, then learning about his profession in advertising, trying to become that as well. A little pressure I guess, I placed on myself. That was an outlet, for sure. Spending time with him in his office and watching him do what he does and then mimicking him. It was an outlet where I could express everything. </p>
<p>Then he started teaching me how to do. My first lesson in art was drawing was a tonal scale. So he taught me how to use one pencil to create from dark to light. It&#8217;s a gray scale, basically. So that&#8217;s where I started. And, oh, music. He&#8217;s also a classical guitar player, so I learned that as well, each day with practice. So I had my outlets. My mother did embroidery, so I was surrounded by art books and design. And my sister, she also was a great writer. So I got all of this stuff around me. So they were in the house. It was great. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s when I left the house, that&#8217;s when I had my challenges. I wasn&#8217;t like most of the children I knew, my cousins included. So I guess I had this big dream of what my childhood should be. But I was still on a massive property. But at the same time, I wanted to maybe a lot more creatively. I wasn&#8217;t really into games and stuff like that. I just cared about being really good at art and design. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s the summary of my childhood, really. Everything I did was in art or design. Sports didn&#8217;t really work out for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So you had this, really, sounds like super creative home life. Did that kind of influence you once you went off to college?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Yes. When I got to college, that was interesting. I felt like I knew so much already. That might be ego, but when I got there, it was definitely because of my childhood. And at that time, I still didn&#8217;t know if I wanted to be an artist or not. I was just doing it. It was a question of whether I was conditioned to do&#8230;to be creative or am I really someone who likes creating? So college was that journey for me, but I was mostly bored there because it was like, again, I want more. And what I was doing is what I did at home.</p>
<p>I learned techniques. I won&#8217;t put it all down. I learned new techniques, but it was too academic for me. It didn&#8217;t feel like a creative environment. It felt more academic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What all sort of things were you doing there?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>After my first year? You do everything in the first year and then you choose second year. I went into painting, and then I moved from that to sculpting. And then&#8230;what do you call them? Not majors, like your secondaries. I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re called. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Your minors?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, like minors. So I did photography, printmaking. I did not get to do graphic design. I was not even allowed in the class because I guess the teacher didn&#8217;t see me as a graphic designer. But ironically, though&#8230;so it was all fine art. It was photography, sculpting, painting, and printmaking.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>The teacher didn&#8217;t let you in the class? Like, you couldn&#8217;t even enroll?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, they give you this test, and to this day I hate that. And when I was&#8230;any job I went to and they said, &#8220;there&#8217;s a test&#8221;, I turned it down and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not interested in that.&#8221; Because of that experience, most people saw my work that I did for this test, and they said, &#8220;but you&#8217;re really good at this!&#8221; But whatever the reason was&#8230;this lecturer there, he didn&#8217;t see me as a valid candidate or something. And the same thing happened with architecture. For me, in terms of high school, I&#8217;ve been experiencing these kind of things, so again, I&#8217;ve been forced into art.</p>
<p>So I had to really decide what I like, but I wasn&#8217;t allowed to do anything technical for some reason. I don&#8217;t know if it caused my dyslexia, or I don&#8217;t know if I was presenting myself the right way. So I can never be sure, but I was turned down essentially, so I just stuck to art. Design was something I was really in love with as well, but for some reason, I just couldn&#8217;t get into design. Architecture is something I love, but again, I wasn&#8217;t in high school, I wasn&#8217;t allowed to do the technical drawing class, whatever the reason was. I do not know to this day. Industrial design, all these things fascinated me. But the art school didn&#8217;t have that.</p>
<p>It was art and graphic design, and I found it quite mundane. I was like, where&#8217;s the intrigue?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>So that was the experience for me. It didn&#8217;t work out well in the end. It&#8217;s a joke around my friends that I was asked to leave the art school. So, I think I can conform well &#8212; I think that was it, actually. Yes, I remember that statement. I think he asked me a question. He said that, the graphic design teacher. He said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t appear to be the student that will do what he asks.&#8221; So that was my experience constantly.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think they knew how to relate to me or relate or engage me. I was very dyslexic, and I have a lot of other cognitive stuff going on, and I guess I just didn&#8217;t fit into that mold that they wanted. So my entire college experience was me always feeling challenged to live up to some expectation, which I couldn&#8217;t because it&#8217;s not in my personality to do that. But I wasn&#8217;t being rude or anything. I just couldn&#8217;t fit into what they wanted. I was very expressive. My fine artwork was very dark as well, so there&#8217;s some personal stuff there. And I guess they couldn&#8217;t see beyond that.</p>
<p>But I did all my work. But if I may share this on here &#8212; when I was asked to leave, I don&#8217;t know why, but I found out some years later that it was for drug abuse and being a threat to the school. I was told all this is false, and I never did any of that there. There&#8217;s a lot of details to that whole process, so it was very insulting. I felt demotivated after that for a while, but today, it&#8217;s not true. Just want to make that record clear. I don&#8217;t know where it came from, but nobody asked my opinion on it. They just asked me to leave the school. So that was that college experience. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>You know, as you describe that, that reminds me so much of my own high school and college experience in a different way, but I think in the same feelings of authority, not being able to know what to do with someone like you. And so because they don&#8217;t know how to handle &#8212; handle is probably not the right word &#8212; they don&#8217;t know what to do! That&#8217;s kind of just the best example that I can give. </p>
<p>I mean, when I was in high school, my teachers &#8212; especially my senior year &#8212; my teachers, my guidance counselor were like, actively not only trying to fail me because I was set up to be valedictorian, and they didn&#8217;t want that. This was a whole race thing in the South. There&#8217;s that. But then also my guidance counselor not allowing me to get certain applications to schools or to get application fee waivers, saying things like, &#8220;well, why don&#8217;t you&#8230;have you thought about learning a trade? Have you thought about going to the community college and learning HVAC or welding or something like that?&#8221; </p>
<p>And then in college, I mean, it wasn&#8217;t as similar as to what your experience is, but certainly&#8230;I started out in computer science, and didn&#8217;t like it because I wanted to be a web designer. My advisor literally telling me, &#8220;if you want to go into the Internet, that&#8217;s just a fad. So if you want to do that, you should probably change your major&#8221;&#8230;which I did. I changed it to Math, and I kind of sailed through on that. But it sounds like it&#8217;s just this textbook case of authority not knowing what to do with someone who doesn&#8217;t fit into their kind of rigid standards. And I feel like &#8212; and maybe I&#8217;m grossly generalizing here, please stop me if I am &#8212; but I wonder if part of it also was the fact that you said you grew up in this really religious environment, and that there&#8217;s sort of this kind of staid structure that comes with that. I mean, I grew up in a really religious town, too, so I know what that&#8217;s like.</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Well, I mean, according to things I&#8217;ve heard in my own family, not my parents, like my relatives, I&#8217;m the only person like me in the entire generation. And we go way back. Chinese and European mix. Right? But everything you said is actually all my academic experiences. It&#8217;s everything you just said. And are you familiar with Frederick Nietzsche? </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. </p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Right. So the will to power, which Hitler misused grossly, is what, in my adult age, that I discovered that, hey, this is the problem. And I love Jamaica, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but how I speak about [the] country professionally and academically, a lot of people don&#8217;t like it.</p>
<p>Well, I won&#8217;t say if you agree, but if you understand the concept of replacing managers with employees who want to be managers, was something I heard, that no employee hates the manager. They hate that the manager is doing what they&#8217;re doing to them. So basically they want to be the manager so they can do it to somebody else. </p>
<p>Jamaica for me, is very prudish, and that&#8217;s what I think leads to the academic experience we do have. High standards in terms of other courses or disciplines in the academic area. A lot of people do very well because we have this; I think we&#8217;re in Cambridge or something, I can&#8217;t remember. But at the same time, when you get into the professional space or the creative space, what my perception of it was, oh, you just replaced the Europeans with yourselves. So [you] use the same rules, same approach, same everything. Nothing&#8217;s changed. </p>
<p>The managers have changed. They&#8217;re now Black Jamaicans, and Jamaican is not even race. It&#8217;s an ethnicity. So you just replace the managers. It&#8217;s the same rules. So I&#8217;m supposed to not live up to my true potential by Frederick Nietzsche. I think it wasn&#8217;t even his originally. But anyway, the will to power, where the philosophy or the belief that society limits great thinkers from living up to their full potential. I was considered a rude child in my early school days, or not rude, or not paying attention, one of those two, because of my dyslexia and that knowledge of what dyslexia was, I guess, wasn&#8217;t that common back then.</p>
<p>So, yeah, the entire education experience was not great for me. I&#8217;ve helped put schools on the map regarding competitions I entered. I either won them or came second or something. I usually get one of three; first, secnd, or third, but the school was proud of that. And I&#8217;m not saying a lot of people&#8230;I&#8217;m not saying I was treated horribly by teachers or anything, but in terms of learning, they didn&#8217;t know how to teach me. And I&#8217;m probably one in the whole class that has this problem, or maybe more, or they didn&#8217;t know. So it was like, if you didn&#8217;t fit into this thing, you&#8217;re on the outside. And we know all the stories of successful people who have the same stories of teachers berating them, and they literally coming out in the exact opposite of what a teacher said they would be.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had that experience, and I guess that&#8217;s what my journey is on. But, yeah, everything you said about what you experienced is my entire education experience. And I had to leave to discover who I am and all that. Because sometimes these things come in disguise, right? So being kicked from college wasn&#8217;t&#8230;at first, it was demotivating, and I felt I didn&#8217;t feel valuable, which was a common problem with my childhood as well, not feeling smart, intelligent and valuable. I think all the experiences I&#8217;ve had forced me to discover myself and my strengths. So I guess there are blessings in disguise in spite of how horrible the experiences were.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, as you tell me all of this. It starts to make perfect sense as to why you started your own studio back in 2001. If all of this is going on and you know in your mind that you can do this and you strike out on your own and do it, it makes perfect sense.</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And then keep in mind that I&#8217;m only starting with the little knowledge I knew then, right? I&#8217;m trying to sell a creative service or my talents. And without the business knowledge I have now, it wasn&#8217;t as great, but, yeah, I had to. I was like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t be these people. I can&#8217;t be that good student, that good employee, that anything. I need to show my value.&#8221; And that&#8217;s what I did. As you rightly said, I was forced to do that.</p>
<p>But it did help me get 9-to-5 jobs after, when I needed my sustainability sorted out. It was the freelance work that I did that got me the jobs, not my qualifications.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t go to design school. I got my degree in Math, and I worked jobs after I graduated, and I couldn&#8217;t get anything with a Math degree. I mean, one of my jobs &#8211;actually, I was still in school, but this was right after I graduated. I was working at the local symphony and art museum and stuff, like selling tickets. And I remember the day that I graduated. I had to go to work that evening. I still had an evening shift. And they had taken the calculator away from my station, because they have these little stations where people come in lanes and that&#8217;s where you sell tickets at. And they took my calculator away, and my manager was like, &#8220;well, you got a Math degree now, so you don&#8217;t need this.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, just rub the salt deeper into the wound. </p>
<p>And the jobs I had after that were all, like, customer service type jobs. I did telemarketing for the opera. I was a customer service agent for AutoTrader, which is sort of like this used car marketplace kind of thing. And I was doing design stuff on the side. Like, I was going to the local Barnes and Noble bookstore and taking pictures because I couldn&#8217;t afford to buy the books because they were too expensive. I was, like, taking pictures in the books and then taking them back home and using my cracked version of Photoshop to try to teach myself how to make gradients. You know what I&#8217;m saying? How to do all this stuff. And my first design job was off of that. It wasn&#8217;t because I went to school for it or anything. </p>
<p>Yeah, it takes a lot of guts to strike out on your own like that. Especially that young. So my hat goes off to you for that.</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>I appreciate that. And just like you, I sort of learned design through jobs or freelancing because my father didn&#8217;t grow up in a time of&#8230;didn&#8217;t do work in a time of computers. So the first time I got a computer, I didn&#8217;t think Photoshop was even out yet. But when Photoshop came out, I dove right in. And this is the artistic knowledge that helped me with design. My knowledge of lighting and shadows and stuff like that. It helps me with design. </p>
<p>Some of the best designers actually studied art first. Whether they graduated or not is irrelevant, but they studied art first or they knew art first. But like you, it&#8217;s something I learned as well in my teen years, and said, put the best foot forward. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar with that. So what you&#8217;re doing in terms of jobs, I consider that survival. But what you put up front when you get the opportunity is, I&#8217;m a designer, and that&#8217;s kind of what I did. </p>
<p>How I got into professionally doing design is like, yes, art, I&#8217;ll do whatever I need to do to survive. But when I&#8217;m really selling? I&#8217;ll never tell people I&#8217;m trying to work with that I&#8217;m an artist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now. You&#8217;ve worked with a ton of different clients, I&#8217;m sure, over the years. I mean, starting in 2001, you&#8217;ve worked with, I&#8217;m sure, dozens to hundreds of different clients. What are some of the projects that you&#8217;re the most proud of?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>When I was in production entertainment, that was the first time I understood management, because the team left me in charge of an entire comedy tour for three days, meaning there&#8217;s no other management person there. They said they have to do another show, so they trusted me to do this one, and I did it. That was my first time, and I felt really proud of that because&#8230;I don&#8217;t know if you know Red Stripe Light, not the original red Stripe beer. They had created this light beer, and they were promoting it through this comedy tour. So I was literally traveling around with all the people that worked on the show, and I&#8217;m representing the creative side, the art team. So the set design, all of that, I had to ensure we had our plans and everything. I had to follow that three times, morning and evening. So set up, pull down for three days. I had to ensure that that show went on not just for live performance, but for television as well. So that was my first time. </p>
<p>My second one, which I think I&#8217;m most proud of, is how I got into brand design, was I helped to relaunch&#8230;I was one of the people that helped to relaunch the PepsiCo identity. 2008, Arnold Group Identity, here in Jamaica. I believe Guatemala had got the ownership at that time, so it was on their directive. But I left printing and went right into relaunching this new identity for PepsiCo America through PepsiCo Jamaica. And at first I was like, &#8220;can I actually do this? It&#8217;s intimidating.&#8221; But I was working with an agent, a small design house at a time, so the director there got a contract and we launched it off. But then I became the key person to maintain the brand standards, to make sure that everything went out. So now I&#8217;m learning about brand and understanding the value, financial value, and the value to the company, the importance of the brand. And we also rebranded a local Pepsi Jamaica water brand here. It was a full stack, like nine years. Whole nine years, we did it all. And that was the first time I really embraced this idea of brand design.</p>
<p>I was all around brands, but that&#8217;s when it moved from graphic design and, &#8220;oh, this thing is here, this is interesting&#8221; kind of thing. That was kind of the experience for me. So that&#8217;s my most proud career moment, I would say. It was a big responsibility and we did achieve the objectives. Yeah, to this day it still looks, when you look back at the work, it looks really good. And just to be part of that, I think just to say I worked on that, that&#8217;s something we&#8217;re proud of. Being in Kingston, Jamaica, that I actually worked on something, an international brand like that. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll only mention one more. There are a few others. I can&#8217;t remember them all, there&#8217;s so many because I don&#8217;t have favorites. By the way, it&#8217;s very difficult to pick a favorite. My idea of favorites is that it&#8217;s too partial, I think, because every project I worked on, if I&#8217;m going to pick something that was really proud of, it had to be on the value and impact it had. So that&#8217;s why Pepsi is one of those. But every product I&#8217;ve worked on, when the solution comes together, that&#8217;s great for me. And I think they&#8217;re all great products, but in terms of magnitude, PepsiCo is one of those. The Guinness, I don&#8217;t know what year anniversary we had to wrap an entire entertainment location for the Guinness anniversary some years ago, so we wrapped it all in black with the gold logo, standing out and curated experience for the guest. From the dishes all the way up to the music. That&#8217;s another impactful project. But I guess more on the event side, less on the consumer experience side. But, yeah, PepsiCo is one that stands out to me this day. I think it was the launching pad for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Red Stripe. PepsiCo. I mean, those are two huge brands. It really sounds like those helped to&#8230;I think whenever you get a really big project or you get a really sort of visible project, it really cements personally that you&#8217;re on the right path. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. It&#8217;s an acknowledgement that you are capable or you&#8217;re knowledgeable about this thing. And the fact that they even spoke to me or asked me, was something &#8212; was acknowledgment that I can actually help them. And I think that&#8217;s the most important part of any profession, is that you are not needed as much. So much so you&#8217;re wanted. I think wanted even in your personal relationships, when you&#8217;re wanted, is way better than being needed. And that&#8217;s what happened, is I was introduced. I&#8217;m often recommended for stuff. So that was a recommendation as well. I didn&#8217;t apply for it. I wasn&#8217;t looking for it. I didn&#8217;t know it even was happening. I was recommended for the project. So that was a great feeling for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Nice. Now, it&#8217;s funny you mentioned that about sort of how it&#8217;s this kind of validating thing, because now what you&#8217;re doing is probably a lot of validation for other creatives and creatives teams, which is you&#8217;re judging. You&#8217;re a brand and a marketing judge with PAc Global for their Leadership Awards. How did you first get involved with them?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>I was invited; again, another form of acknowledgment. I was invited through LinkedIn by the CEO, actually, in 2018, I believe, which is also happening this year. Again, I think I mentioned that off. I&#8217;m currently judging designs right now, but I was invited. Interestingly, I wasn&#8217;t thinking about being a judge, but I used to give my own critiques. I didn&#8217;t want to share things on any social media platform alone. I wanted to actually give my view on it, and I started to do that so I&#8217;d write my review of the thing I shared. Whether it&#8217;s a package design or brand identity, I actually write my perspective on what was done, the goods, anywhere that fell short.</p>
<p>I think just because I did that consistently and still doing it today, is that it got his attention. And I think we connected before, sometime before. And he invited me to be part of the commission, which is a global commission, and PAC has been around since 1950. I&#8217;m the only Jamaican on there, by the way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m the youngest. I&#8217;ll be 41 in December, so I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m the youngest, but I&#8217;m the only Jamaican on there. And I guess in many ways, everyone there is one person from their own countries as well. But because of the context of design and art in Jamaica, where it&#8217;s either traditional, there are some great people here, but you don&#8217;t really see it because everything dominates it. So being the only Jamaican in there, a small Caribbean island that&#8217;s really business-oriented, if I&#8217;m being honest with you, we&#8217;re known to be creative, but we&#8217;re mostly business. I think it&#8217;s a great stage for me to be on. Most Jamaicans don&#8217;t know that I have them on international stage just by being a member there. It&#8217;s a very proud moment.</p>
<p>I was invited on and I accepted, and it&#8217;s just been a great journey. But you learn from it. You have to be very objective. And I like to make sure that creative people understand that when you&#8217;re looking at design or art, you have to be. Critiques are supposed to be objective. Your subjective parts are there, but it&#8217;s really supposed to be an objective view. And that&#8217;s what the judging experience is, because you&#8217;d see something really amazing. And if you&#8217;re not careful, you end up giving that particular project really high marks, and then you realize &#8220;but then this other thing is here.&#8221;</p>
<p>So how do you judge these two things? They&#8217;re both great. So you have to really get into the objectivity of the design and the purpose behind it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I was just about to ask this. It sounds like you&#8217;re kind of segueing into it. I&#8217;m also an awards judge, and I don&#8217;t think a lot of judges really talk about how they approach judging creative work. So I&#8217;m glad that you mentioned that objectivity. When you&#8217;re looking at work, especially now, since you&#8217;re in the middle of this judging process, how do you approach it? Do you have like a rubric, or are there certain things that you take into account as you&#8217;re judging creative work?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, generally as a professional courtesy, it also helps you with client work as well. There are criteria that you have in mind of what makes this project a great product or this design a great solution. The good thing is PAC, and I&#8217;m sure other judging commissions, they have their criteria listed out as well. And you&#8217;re really looking for these projects that meet. They&#8217;ve already narrowed down the entries anyway, so you&#8217;re judging what you&#8217;re given and you&#8217;re going to basically see if these projects meet these criteria. Outside of that, you also have to use your own judgment on how they meet the criteria. You&#8217;re allowed to write your review of the project so you can rationalize the decision in the context of maybe it met one criteria, it didn&#8217;t meet the other one, or maybe it did in a way that is not as upfront, but it actually meets the criteria. It&#8217;s actually achieving the objective it stated it was supposed to achieve.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s always approaching it based on, for me personally, it&#8217;s about the design. For me, it&#8217;s function and then aesthetics is part of design, but it&#8217;s more on what I call emotional responses. The aesthetics is used to wrap up a design solution to make it appealing the human response, but the design has to function as intended. Or unlike art, where it&#8217;s subjective, design has to actually work. If it doesn&#8217;t work, then it just failed. So I use that as one of my criteria. </p>
<p>In terms of packaging design, I always look for shelf positioning. That&#8217;s the first point of contact a consumer has with the design is before they even touch it, what got their attention, what will get them to go and interact with this design. So I look for shelf positioning in terms of packaging design. And I guess you could translate that into other forms of design where&#8230;how do you get people to interact with this? I always look for the function. I understand things like simplicity is often misunderstood with minimalism, but it&#8217;s not. Minimalism is a philosophy, a way of thinking, and simplicity is the functional side. So my favorite types of designs are the ones that are the simplest. If they&#8217;re really simple and have great impact. I love that one. I actually use the word love, not in my critique, but I&#8217;m saying it here. The simpler design with a greater impact, that&#8217;s a great design for me. So I look for those things. But the commission has its own criteria that we use.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What do you gain from being an awards judge?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Professionally, the learning never ends, and I&#8217;m always looking to learn more, add more knowledge to what I have already. But there&#8217;s also a professional status with it. The fact that you&#8217;re judging designs mean that you&#8217;re somebody worth talking to. I think it&#8217;s a big responsibility that you should never take for granted. I mean, anybody that&#8217;s put in charge of judging anything should never take that for granted. But it should also mean that you are a worthy conversation regarding knowledge and teaching, passing on that knowledge. </p>
<p>The lessons in judging design is you have to separate yourself. Detachment is a great thing that you can learn from design, from judging. You have to detach yourself, your personal assumptions. It&#8217;s invaluable regarding your client work. The same experience of judging can be applied to client work, and that&#8217;s how it has helped me in a lot of ways. I can detach myself from my assumptions or what I like. I can also speak to the client differently. I can listen more, to listen and observe before and respond appropriately. I know this is the right way and this is how you should do this and do that. But when you&#8217;re judging things, none of that really comes into play.</p>
<p>Because now it&#8217;s not about you. And in your client work, it&#8217;s not about you. It&#8217;s about understanding what the intent of the client is regarding speaking to you. And they have to trust that you are somebody who can help them. You don&#8217;t have to know all the answers, but you should be able to, in a very short space of time, through a conversation, be viewed as an expert, a professional that can actually solve problems, that you learn that a lot from judging other people&#8217;s work. That comes from art school as well. Judging art, critiquing art is the same process. When you&#8217;re critiquing art, it&#8217;s not about what you like or don&#8217;t like.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always about objectivity. And I think a lot of that&#8217;s missing from the client process. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve definitely gained from know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting that you mentioned that about objectivity, because sometimes what will happen, and I don&#8217;t know if this is such the case with PAC Global, but sometimes awards are just sort of an extension of marketing for companies. Like they&#8217;ll just build it into their budget. Like whatever project they&#8217;ve got going on, they&#8217;ll just automatically submit them, not necessarily whether or not they fit within a particular category or they meet a certain standard level or things like that. </p>
<p>I often find that when I am &#8212; it depends on the competition I&#8217;m judging &#8212; but I&#8217;ll always see the same studios producing the same work, and then sometimes I&#8217;ll know the studio just from viewing the work. Like, I won&#8217;t even have to look at who it&#8217;s from. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;oh, this is from such and such because they use this exact same template with four different clients.&#8221; They just did a color swap and switched out typography or what have you. So, yeah, it helps to try to be objective about it, even when you can see what looks just like a lot of repetition, because for companies, they may not even be looking at the acclaim that they get from awards as something that has any other merit aside from just getting them more business.</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. One of the reasons that I absolutely love packaging design is that it&#8217;s an extension of the brand, and it&#8217;s often one of the first point of contact for consumers. The unboxing experience for consumers is also a very tangible part of that whole design process. Technology, and I guess molds and stuff like that, can limit your packaging design capability, but creativity is found in the limitations, right? So if this is what you have to work with, then you find a creative way to leverage what you have. And that&#8217;s what packaging design. Well, great packaging design.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what it does. It finds ways of making this mundane thing very interesting. It can be little changes, whether it&#8217;s the actual graphic design on it or is the type of cap, but it&#8217;s the same bottle. You can use the same container and do amazing things. And I know exactly what you&#8217;re talking about regarding templates because I&#8217;ve seen it outside of packaging. I don&#8217;t know all the judging. I&#8217;ve never been part of anyone. But in terms of designs that are shared on social media or case studies, there are some agencies that stand out, or some designers, because you cannot be so unique.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t look like anything you&#8217;ve seen before, or they&#8217;ve leveraged something you&#8217;ve seen before in a much more interesting way. Packaging design with PAC, the submissions are always unique in that context of being unique, and that&#8217;s one of the best parts about it for me. The agencies, the clients &#8212; even clients submit their own packaging designs, or the agency submits it on behalf of them. So you get a diverse group of people submitting designs. We do have the big brands, obviously, and they may improve on something they already have out there. And you judge that, and that&#8217;s also a very valuable thing. But in terms of&#8230;my favorite part is either improvements on existing packaging designs from established brands or new products being launched from smaller agencies. They are very experimental on that side because they&#8217;re not as known as the big brands, but they submit some really interesting designs and it&#8217;s just exciting to see what they&#8217;ve done. Like, &#8220;oh, I didn&#8217;t know you could do that with this thing.&#8221; </p>
<p>And then we&#8217;re in an age of technology now, right? Packaging design is changing. We have the brand extensions moving beyond the package itself. What&#8217;s the consumer shopping experience like? So the ultimate goal in the end is to have the consumer have a great experience. So packaging design, for me is a great place to understand a lot about design, a lot about art, a lot about craftsmanship. </p>
<p>I only say this because you&#8217;ve mentioned that some of these agencies, the templates, you can tell who they are. Because if you have a style in design, I think you have a problem, because every strategy is supposed to be different, right? So if you have a style, it kind of means that you haven&#8217;t really giving different clients the same thing, doesn&#8217;t it? So, yeah, I like packaging design because it&#8217;s very difficult to be the same there. It&#8217;s just more difficult to stand out, more challenging. I don&#8217;t like saying hard. Difficult is a better word because hard probably means it&#8217;s never going to happen, but difficult means there&#8217;s a challenge to overcome there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, I think you also just have more opportunities for innovation with packaging design than you do for the web. For what it&#8217;s worth, it&#8217;s a kind of staid medium. That&#8217;s not to say that there isn&#8217;t innovation that exists, but I judge the PRINT Awards from PRINT Magazine. And I am amazed every year &#8212;</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>I love PRINT.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>&#8212; at the new stuff that comes through. I mean, things that I never would have thought about in terms of how people have packaged certain things. And the good thing with PRINT is that it&#8217;s not just packaging design, but it&#8217;s also experiential design. So you can see how people have designed spaces like a gym or an office building.</p>
<p>And to me&#8230;I just really love it. I also judge podcasts, and if you want to talk about repetition and podcasting, I&#8217;m not going to say any names, but there&#8217;s a certain company that rhymes with &#8220;water bowl&#8221; that sweeps every year, and I&#8217;m just like, it&#8217;s the same stuff over and over. You got some celebrity to get behind the microphone and interview other celebrities. Like, where&#8217;s the innovation?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping to get into podcasts at some point. Maybe I&#8217;ll do something innovative there. But I love PRINT Magazine, by the way. That&#8217;s such a great experience to have. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an opportunity to just see what other people are doing outside of, I think, you know, what people&#8230;. It&#8217;s interesting because design in and of itself is such a broad field, but depending on who you talk to, they may have a very narrow view of it. Like, if I tell people I&#8217;m a designer, it depends, I could ask five different people. I could tell that I&#8217;m a designer. They&#8217;ll think five different things. For a long time, when I would tell people I&#8217;m a designer, they thought it meant, &#8220;oh, so you do UX?&#8221; &#8220;No, yeah, I don&#8217;t do UX. I&#8217;m not a UX designer.&#8221; Like, I have to sort of qualify that, what that means to me, because I&#8217;ve dabbled in so many different types of design, and it&#8217;s all design, but the viewpoint is skewed, I think sometimes.</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>I think you need, I think, I hope I have it because I support it or advocate for it. A holistic view on design is required. A wider perspective, and then you narrow it down based on the purpose that you need it for. That&#8217;s when you get graphic design and UX design all these things. A graphic designer, for example, should have the understanding of animation as much as they do stills. I guess what you&#8217;re hired for is completely different, but you pay a graphic designer well who understands those two things. They&#8217;ll do it.</p>
<p>But if you want somebody who does animation specifically, hire an animator. But for some reason, when you say design, you&#8217;re a graphic designer. Everything on the two-dimensional plane comes to you, and it&#8217;s unfathomable to say, &#8220;oh, I don&#8217;t know how to do that.&#8221; Right? And it&#8217;s okay to not to know how to do that. It would be nice if you did. But design is, it&#8217;s a plugin. Most people see it as a plugin.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like, let&#8217;s get something and plug it in here. So let&#8217;s get the graphic designer to do these ten things, because they are a designer, and design is a process. What makes a difference is the purpose, the intended purpose of going to a design process. Evidently, if you&#8217;re doing print, you want a graphic designer. Or if you&#8217;re on the execution side, you might want a print technician, but that technician might not be a designer. But they may understand design, and they may do a lot of why I like print, by the way, which is why I&#8217;m such a big fan. I worked in printing as well, is that the things I used to do, because of my artistic knowledge and design knowledge, I didn&#8217;t print nothing amazing. That&#8217;s all over the top.</p>
<p>But there are little things that I learned about the machines and ink levels and the pigments that I was able to achieve when I&#8217;m printing. And then the experimental side of it is like, how about we just not do it the way it&#8217;s supposed to be done, for example? Well, you don&#8217;t damage a machine. But what if I could turn something off here? And I did that and I got different results. So, of course, my dream at the time was to have my own machine so I could go experiment at home, right? But it&#8217;s pricey. But it was like, yeah, printing machine is supposed to print this and print that, but how do we use it in a creative way? What if I wanted to do an entire exhibition and printing? How can I make it interesting? That&#8217;s how my brain works. So the machine, I was always trying to experiment with it. What happens if I&#8230;because some machines actually recognize the layers in Illustrator, for example. So you get a different result depending on how much percentage of ink you put on it. </p>
<p>Because the machine that I was using anyway, it automatically printed layers and layers of color depending on what I have on the artwork itself. And then if you print a rastered image, like a JPEG or a TIFF file, it would do something completely different because the colors are not layered anymore, which was amazing to me. I&#8217;m like, how does a machine know that difference? By understanding those things, it&#8217;s an advantage, I think, in design, and that helps me. And I&#8217;m sure with your knowledge as well, even your customer service experience, you can actually do marketing. A lot of people started in door-to-door sales, like David Ogilvy, and then now he has his own agency. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s three, four things I look for is business, authority, opportunity, and time value. Four things, right? Yeah, I said four. Those I learned from a business, from somebody who does business. And I apply to my creative development as well and processes. It has to be a business. You have to have authority of it, and there must be an opportunity, and then you don&#8217;t want to waste your time on something that doesn&#8217;t meet those three things. So for me, design is just a holistic thing of value, process and impact. That&#8217;s how I look at it anyway.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So on your website, you mentioned &#8212; and I thought this was really interesting, especially given how this conversation has went. You said that you&#8217;re not a self made man. Who are some of the people that have kind of helped you reach your current level of success?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Oh, wow. It&#8217;s a very long list, but I can think of some key people. My very first professional experience while freelancing was when I went into production entertainment. My friend, she worked in the entertainment. She&#8217;s an architect, but she started a production company, and she used her knowledge in architecture to execute some brilliant event projects, and she became popular for it. What I learned from her was work ethic. She&#8217;s very meticulous about process, and I fell in love with process because of her. And I think my work ethic to this day, I would always give to her by working with her.</p>
<p>I learned from her other people. My last agency boss &#8212; or he&#8217;s a CEO now. I know his father&#8217;s around. At the time, I don&#8217;t remember his position, but he was essentially my boss. I learned from him how agencies are managed and how to handle client conversations. </p>
<p>And then there are the people that I never worked with, but just being around them. Michael Beirut said something. I think that&#8217;s why I did what I did was he said &#8220;hijack your mentors.&#8221; Because honestly, if I&#8217;m being honest, I didn&#8217;t know who to go to to get mentorship from, because what I was seeing was not anything that I wanted to necessarily learn from people. But when I got into the older I got, I realized I need to understand a lot of things, a lot about business and how agencies work. And I started hanging around people. A lot of my friends are way older than me because I learned from them, whether they&#8217;re bosses or project managers, that I was a part of a project. I learned from people like that. I learned from clients. I learned from going to unknown territory with clients, learning about their industry, learning how they manage their employees, learning how to have the client conversations with their clients. So I observed them talking to their clients. You learn from different people. It&#8217;s just that we don&#8217;t often don&#8217;t pay attention to it. And everybody goes to this self-made thing. I just one day said, &#8220;well, that doesn&#8217;t make any sense.&#8221; You can&#8217;t really be self made. You may put a lot of effort in yourself. Yes, because nobody&#8217;s there. You&#8217;re doing the work.</p>
<p>But what happened to me was that I said I don&#8217;t think I would be anywhere I am and where I&#8217;m going without the people that I worked with or the relationships that I&#8217;ve made over the years. When I looked at the value that I&#8217;ve learned from all these people, I said, there&#8217;s no way I can be a self made man. And I started to detest that statement. I guess I can&#8217;t say for sure if there&#8217;s actually no one out there who&#8217;s self made. I don&#8217;t know. But I think even entrepreneurs get help along the way. And I guess that help isn&#8217;t acknowledged. But I believe that you cannot be self made.</p>
<p>And I guess I just applied it to myself. My website is a bit of satire in terms of narcissism. It&#8217;s not seriously narcissistic, but at the same time, I wanted to have people understand how I perceive the professional space and my knowledge. So I put it up there. But it was mostly people I&#8217;ve worked with. That&#8217;s why I said that. </p>
<p>And I obviously put my father in there. My mother, I learned from both of them. My mother was the one who really gave me that drive that I have now. I think she is a trooper. She&#8217;s not somebody who gives up easily. So she taught me as well about discipline. And she told me, any job I&#8217;m doing, I should always do my best, even if it&#8217;s a horrible job, because you never know who&#8217;s watching. So stuff like that stuck with me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny, when I saw that on your site, it reminded me of&#8230;this was way back in high school. I had a&#8230;I guess it&#8217;s like a senior book. Like, there would be these organizations like Jostens or whatever, right? They try to sell you all this stuff leading up to graduation. Like, buy these invitations, buy this tassel. But I have a senior book, and I went back and looked through it recently, and I was&#8230;God, I was so angsty in high school. But there was a quote that I had in there that was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m a self-made man. Who else would help?&#8221; Or something like that. So when I saw that on your site, I was like, &#8220;you&#8217;re not a self made man. What&#8217;s that about?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>When we&#8217;re in the challenge, or the journey? It&#8217;s easy to say that because I deal with depression. And I&#8217;m only saying that to create and illustrate something. When you have an episode of any mental challenges, mental health issues that you may have when you&#8217;re in an episode, it&#8217;s not that you don&#8217;t know what to do. You just can&#8217;t seem to find that will or ability to get up and do what you need to do to get out of it. So no matter how somebody tells you to do something: &#8220;You need to start doing this. When you&#8217;re depressed, try these things.&#8221; All these things take practice. But no matter how much they tell you, you just can&#8217;t do it until you make the first move to do it and you start to do it. And what happens is that over a period of time of learning things and doing them and becoming proficient at them, you cheer yourself because it was difficult, right? And in your context, I&#8217;m assuming in high school, that being great, your great experience, you probably wrote that because you had to do a lot of stuff yourself.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s what happens. And we tend to block out the external forces, whether good or bad. Even some bad experiences contribute to your progressive movement. Right. It&#8217;s at least, at very best, it tells you, oh, I don&#8217;t want that experience. So you make different decisions, right? So I look at everything. I look at the good and bad. I don&#8217;t believe in trying to kill fair. I think that&#8217;s illogical. I think negative and positive energies are supposed to be balanced. You can&#8217;t really get rid of one or the other. When one is given more power or energy, it throws off the balance. So these things is what I think about. So I was like, there&#8217;s no way it&#8217;s after a maturity. Of course, this is something that you need as well. So I guess my maturity came into play here and I said, &#8220;what does it mean to be self made?&#8221; And you started to process that and you started to think and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;yeah, I got help with that thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Should I be grateful for the jobs I had? Would I be here? I don&#8217;t know. I think about these things all the time. But I have to kind of&#8230;should contextualize it because you just said something that, yeah, when you&#8217;re in high school or along your journey, especially when you&#8217;re younger, you&#8217;re probably putting a lot of effort in trying to get what you want out of this world. So it does feel like you&#8217;re self made because sometimes people don&#8217;t see your vision and what you&#8217;re trying to do. But at the same time, I believe in being fair. And life isn&#8217;t fair, unfair: it&#8217;s indifferent, or it just is. But we can decide the fairness of that experience. And I think to be fair, we would have to start acknowledging all the people that has helped us along the way.</p>
<p>They may not have helped us build our companies or build our careers, but even my college experience, it was great. But I did learn some things from it. I have to be fair about that. I learned how to critique, for example, I never learned critiquing at home. I think it&#8217;s giving the chair to the things that help you to get where you are. And I&#8217;d go too extreme and say, on a bad day, if a store was open on a public holiday and I was able to buy something that cheered on my day, I&#8217;m going to thank that person.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. So what keeps you motivated and inspired these days?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Reading philosophy. Gratitude. Each morning I wake up, I always make an effort to spend a few minutes with my mind, whether it&#8217;s meditating or a prayer of some kind. I think it&#8217;s just a tone for the day. My mind goes into a place where I can deal with any challenges that show up. And it&#8217;s always easy but it&#8217;s really starting each day with gratitude. I&#8217;m reading a lot of books on&#8230;I guess I could call them the schematics of living. So I found this balance where it&#8217;s setting a vision. That&#8217;s what drives me.</p>
<p>I have a vision of what I want to achieve each day and the months in the years and so forth. So I think setting three goals at least each day, is what I do, and that motivates me to get things done because it induces fulfillment, I think. Is it a Chinese philosophy somewhere there? I can&#8217;t remember the exact philosophy, but it&#8217;s something about not trying to do everything all at once and setting smaller objectives, not try to achieve the big ones unless you can. </p>
<p>So reading is part of my objective each day, to read at least a chapter of something, to review work, to have a conversation with somebody, just setting daily objectives, waking up gratitude, setting daily objectives. And the reading definitely helps. I&#8217;m motivated by my vision mostly though, that&#8217;s my biggest drive, is I would endure great pains to achieve it, I think.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What do you think you would be doing if you weren&#8217;t doing this kind of work? </p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Wow. I&#8217;d love to have been in the sciences because I did pretty well in it. I like developing theories and experimenting with things, understanding how they work. I would hope that if I was able to be in the sciences, particularly biology or neuroscience, I&#8217;m an explorer. Archaeology was on the list at one point too. Yeah, my first desired job was as a child was to work with a Red Cross actually, but I didn&#8217;t know how to even do that. And I think I found out that you had to fund yourself part of it. I don&#8217;t remember. But yeah, I would like to be doing something that has impact on our society, I guess. Or humans.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping design is doing that in some way, but yeah, science in some way or some humanitarian thing, as long as I can sustain myself. I like to definitely be involved in something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>To that end, where do you see yourself in the next five years? Like, what do you want the next chapter of the Phillip J. Clayton story to look like?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to be recognized or acknowledged as an authority in my disciplines or the field that I&#8217;m in. I&#8217;d like to know that I&#8217;ve had great impact through that discipline, whether it&#8217;s our society, whether through technology or something I&#8217;ve written just being conversations that are larger, that are beyond my skill sets. I like my thinking to be beyond everything that I do because I think that&#8217;s the ultimate point of self awareness and enlightenment is to be someone that people recognize as some kind of philosopher. I guess I would say I just want to be an authority in my field. I don&#8217;t know if authority sounds very aggressive. I&#8217;m not trying to say like this egotistical authority. What I mean by authority is that I have contributed something as an expert to the industry that&#8217;s worth something to a lot of people, that they would also come to me as a source of voice, of knowledge or something. What that means, obviously, is not just, I&#8217;m not going to go sit on a chair and counsel people.</p>
<p>What I mean is being an authority means that even my work should be reflecting that in a different way in five years. The type of work I do, type of conversations I have, I think being an authority establishes your prowess, professional prowess, in any industry you&#8217;re in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I hear that. I mean, I think it&#8217;s certainly something where&#8230;and it&#8217;s funny, I think you definitely are at that point already. Like I&#8217;m wondering because you&#8217;re judging and you&#8217;re doing all this work, what do you think it would take for you to reach that sort of level of authority that you&#8217;re talking about?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Definitely through the work. I&#8217;m trying to do different types of work now, work with different type of clients. You&#8217;re right. I&#8217;ve been told that I am in an authoritative position at the moment. My value is strong and high. I guess it&#8217;s what Bruce Lee said: &#8220;be happy, but don&#8217;t be satisfied&#8221;&#8230;or something like that. Meaning that you should always deserve to be greater than you are, but be happy with what you have. I guess that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m coming from. It&#8217;s not greed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like, as long as I&#8217;m alive even if&#8230;I have a question. You asked about what else would I be doing if I wasn&#8217;t doing this. I make statements like this, and I don&#8217;t mean to be extreme, but I do make statements like this to my friends. And anybody that asks, is that if I can&#8217;t get to do what I want to do, I&#8217;d rather be dead. And I don&#8217;t mean that from a&#8230;I hope I&#8217;m not putting the wrong words out there. It&#8217;s not that if I can&#8217;t do it, I&#8217;m going to go die. It&#8217;s just, what is the point? If I&#8217;m not doing this, if I&#8217;m not doing what I&#8217;m doing, then why live? So it&#8217;s kind of like, be useful.</p>
<p>I think every human being desires to be useful in some way. And then when they don&#8217;t have that use or purpose, it&#8217;s hard to live. You start figuring out how to survive and you just never leave that place of survival. It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re always trying to find a reason to live. And I think purpose gives you that reason to live. So that&#8217;s my purpose, is to achieve that kind of level of authority where I don&#8217;t even have to go look for clients anymore. I would like to be in innovation, some R&#038;D kind of process. If NASA had a creative department, for example, I&#8217;d probably want to be there.</p>
<p>I guess I would say this professionally. I like to be in a place where there&#8217;s a seamless process of innovation, R&#038;D and innovation that leads into the brand design process and ultimately contributing to advertising and marketing output, adding meaning to the consumer &#8212; the consumer experience; people &#8212; the experience people have shopping or engaging in government services or anything. I like to innovate those things because the end user for me is always something important in our process. That&#8217;s who we&#8217;re creating for. Design is supposed to be having positive impacts on the lives of people. No matter what form is in. The only reason you&#8217;re doing it is because you&#8217;re trying to change something for an end user somewhere. And I guess that&#8217;s the kind of authority I want, is where I can develop something that changes the industry also, I guess, in how we work with people, I&#8217;ve been told, actually I&#8217;m a thought leader.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not really clear on that definition yet, because I hear it used a lot. I think of myself as a practicing philosopher more than a thought leader, but maybe it&#8217;s the same thing, I don&#8217;t know. But somebody once called me a thought leader.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I think the difference between that and this may be something that you&#8217;re already doing, but if you&#8217;re thinking of how to take the next steps to try to get there, it&#8217;s really all about &#8212; and this is, I mean, from a design standpoint, it sounds silly &#8212; but it&#8217;s all about writing and sharing your work.</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s so&#8230;that&#8217;s well said.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Like people&#8230;I think of folks like Frank Chimero, Steven Heller, etc. I mean, they&#8217;re well known as designers, but they&#8217;re also well known as sort of just writing and talking about the craft. You know, Mike Montero is another one, for example. That sort of&#8230;I think to me, when I think of thought leader, and I think also just in terms of how your work spreads beyond the visual medium, how it spreads beyond, you know, a campaign or some sort of a visual project: writing is the way that I think that happens.</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>That is absolutely correct. I think even Blair Enns &#8212; not think, I know even Blair Enns shares that. He actually says in his book that the expert should write. And I started writing. I&#8217;m sure you think I probably shared that with you. You see them on my website. I&#8217;ve written articles and I&#8217;ve written other things, but writing, being somebody dyslexic, I didn&#8217;t see myself writing this much or reading this many books.</p>
<p>I used to detest both of those things growing up, but it was because I didn&#8217;t think I was smart enough to do it. But now I buy so many books and read them, and I don&#8217;t just read them, I actually put them into practice and I write. And you&#8217;re absolutely correct on that. We should write. That&#8217;s what professionals should be doing. That&#8217;s how you establish yourself. That&#8217;s absolutely correct. You have to write a thesis or theory or opinion we should be writing.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why I like to do case studies. I like to write out the experience. Everything else that follows that really is just the know, oh, we developed this philosophy, and here is the brand identity from that philosophy, that kind of thing. So you&#8217;re absolutely correct in that we should write.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, Phillip, where can our audience find out more information about you, your work, your writing? Like, where can they find all that online?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>So the first place, I guess I&#8217;d say, because I have all the social media links I believe on there is pjclayton.com, my primary website. Outside of that, you can go directly to LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. And it&#8217;s always Phillip J. Clayton. Phillip with two L&#8217;s. J. Clayton. And I think if you hashtag it too, somewhere there, I have hashtags for them too. PJClayton. Phillip J. Clayton. P-J-C.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, sounds good. </p>
<p>Phillip J. Clayton. Thank you for&#8230;I mean, such a wide-ranging and expansive interview. I feel like we went in like a dozen different places from your first interview, talking about branding, to this interview, which is certainly more just kind of personal about you and your upbringing and how you got to where you are now. I really do feel like that level of thought leader that you&#8217;re talking about. I think you&#8217;re already there, and I hope that this interview will help to elevate you to get further to that, because I really think that with everything that you&#8217;ve talked about, with everything that you&#8217;ve done, you&#8217;ve got all the components. Like, you put in the work. I think we&#8217;re right around the same age. You said you&#8217;re 41, right?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;ll be 41 in December.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m 42 now. So we&#8217;re right around the same age. So I know the work that goes into it to sustain yourself this long in this creative industry. And you said one thing before we started recording, that you have sort of these six rules for a quality life experience. You were like: disciplined, patient, kind, acceptance, forgiveness, and letting go. Look, that can be your philosophical bent to taking yourself to that thought leader status. But I&#8217;m really excited to see what else you come up with in the future, man. So thank you so much for coming on the podcast. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Thank you so much. I enjoyed it. It was, I think, my deepest conversation on a podcast. Most of it&#8217;s really about work, so I really enjoyed it. I appreciate the compliments and the chair. I do look forward to what&#8217;s next. And likewise, same to you. This is a&#8230;I don&#8217;t know if a lot of people know it, but since you&#8217;ve shared it with me through the invitation, being part of the Smithsonian Archives is a brilliant position to be in from a content perspective. I never knew that was something that could happen, and I want to celebrate you for that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Thank you. I appreciate that.</p>

<p>Phillip J. Clayton is a design voice that you need to know. The Kingston-based creative is a strategic advisor, an international design judge, and an expert on branding. We talked for hours about his career and his philosophies on branding and life, so I split this episode into two parts just to make sure nothing got lost. If you&#8217;re interested in branding, then get ready for a masterclass!</p>
<p>Our conversation started off with a check-in on this year, and then Phillip shared his goals about being seen as a facilitator and about tackling complex problems and making a meaningful impact. We also talked about how he started his own company <a href="https://www.pjclayton.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">PJClayton &#038; Co.</a>, the client-vendor relationship, and Phillip dropped a ton of knowledge about his creative process, brand purpose, and the power of extracting valuable information from conversations. (Kind of like what you&#8217;re doing with this episode!)</p>
<p>Tune in next week for Part 2! Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m Phillip J. Clayton and I&#8217;m a brand consultant, a strategic advisor and an international design judge. I focus on brand design and development. I&#8217;m a writer. I write articles, copywriting, etc. I focus on art and design holistically as a foundation for advertising and marketing. And I&#8217;m usually hired as a creative director. I do have a consulting company called PJClayton and Company.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay, we&#8217;ll talk about all of that, certainly. But if you could use three words to sum up what this year has been for you so far, what would those words be?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>So&#8230;agony is definitely part of that. I did agony&#8230;awareness. And enlightenment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Agony, awareness, and enlightenment. That sounds like the hero&#8217;s journey.</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, well, I&#8217;m hoping it will be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Have you given thought to what you want to accomplish next year?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Yes, I have. That&#8217;s the awareness part. I&#8217;ve discovered things about myself personally and professionally. So next year I would like to actually be more focused on becoming what I label a fixer, not necessarily a facilitator. I went into consulting for that reason. I would like to be more on the consulting side and looking at complex problems. They&#8217;re usually very impactful. So I like to focus on complex problems with larger corporations, I guess.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is the impact it can have both in this, like in their specific industries or on a societal level, regarding the thinking and the approach to sustainability and marketing behind that internal change. Right? I&#8217;d like to focus more on that regarding innovation &#8212; R&#038;D &#8212; there are a lot of things out there, and the unsolved. Most of them that I can think of, they&#8217;re unsolved. They&#8217;re worth a lot of money as well. So it does benefit me to sustain that focus if I&#8217;m able to sustain myself doing it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>In your eyes, how is a consultant different from a facilitator then? Because you really sort of try to make that shift. </p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>For me, a facilitator? Well, generally, to my knowledge, a facilitator would normally broker two parties together. I guess the ideal between two parties or to facilitate one party to another, or they find a way to accommodate something else, to align it with another thing. The consultant to me is more of a fixer. And that was something. The word fixer in this context I learned years ago, I think it was on a movie or something. But it intrigued me because I always had this desire to be someone so important that I&#8217;m only called when I&#8217;m needed. And it&#8217;s usually for something that nobody can solve. No, I&#8217;m not the only one, obviously, on the planet, but it&#8217;s kind of like that being the only one kind of thinking behind it, where you get called in because you are the only person who can fix this problem.</p>
<p>And a consultant, to me, is that because consulting is a form of therapy, in my opinion,  where we have to&#8230;the execution is the last step of everything. The consultant listens to people, a client I guess you could say, and they have to diagnose a problem and make a prescription to that problem or symptom. A facilitator doesn&#8217;t really do that. The consultant&#8230;actually, this is why the time is so important that they spend with each client. That&#8217;s why if you&#8217;re really narrow in your focus, you probably don&#8217;t have as many clients as a company that&#8217;s serving a wider market. You&#8217;re probably working with very few clients. But those clients are really valuable, not just in the work they do, but also in the financial gain that you get from it and they get from you helping them. It&#8217;s really a form of therapy because a lot of times the problems that they come to you with are not what is not what they say it is by listening to them and allowing them to speak and asking specific questions, great questions that lead to answers, because we don&#8217;t always know the answers either. It&#8217;s just the information that we can extract from the conversation that builds trust. And then the client reveals themselves to you and you realize, &#8220;oh, there&#8217;s either a personal issue here or there&#8217;s actually a deeper company problem here.&#8221; And what most company owners will do is because there is this cliched response, especially in brand. Our brand is a solution, is that they will come with a list of requests that they believe will solve the problem for their company. And this could be anything from a little new logo or website or rebrand, something aesthetic or surface level, I call it. But those things are results of deeper processes.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s kind of how I view the consultant regarding a fixer as opposed to a facilitator.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I want to talk about your company, which you mentioned earlier, PJ Clayton &#038; Co. And I think it&#8217;s important to note that you started that 22 years ago, which is fascinating. My hats off to you for your longevity of keeping it going all this time. What made you decide to start your own company?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Irony is the life experience. I actually didn&#8217;t want the company. I just wanted to be recognized when I was younger. </p>
<p>Well, let me rephrase it. In my mind, a company requires employees. That&#8217;s what I knew back then. I didn&#8217;t really want that, but I said, I need to be respected as a professional, and I need a name for that. And during my college years, which started in 2001 &#8212; if remember I that correctly&#8230;yeah, 2001 &#8212; I was freelancing before college. You&#8217;re doing side projects. I just left high school like a year before, and I&#8217;m just getting hired by people who knew I could do graphic design or art or anything creative that I could do. People are hiring me to help them. These were really small jobs, but I always had this thing growing up in the house I grew up in, which was with my father being my first door to the world on design and all that. </p>
<p>At a very young age, I had this image of myself, even at that age I fell in love with, like, movies and advertising, or anybody, if it is an advertising agency, or architecture or some kind of design firm. I was fascinated with that thing, not necessarily the movie itself. And I always had this perception of myself that I wanted to become someone so valuable.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s where it started. I said, &#8220;well, one day I would like to have a global firm.&#8221; I think my name, PJ &#8212; the J &#8212; is important. That&#8217;s how people find me. So I added the J in there. I&#8217;m talking like twelve years old here. I&#8217;m writing. My first logo was done around that age, too, which was hand drawn, because what, my father? That&#8217;s the era he&#8217;s from. Everything was hand done, not computers. I learned from him. I didn&#8217;t know what a logo was. I didn&#8217;t know what graphic design was. I just saw him doing stuff, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;he&#8217;s getting paid. This is fun.&#8221; And I started at that age, sketching out my logo, which was PJC. I didn&#8217;t think about the Phillip J. Clayton part of it yet. I was just like, &#8220;PJC represents me. That&#8217;s my name, my acronym.&#8221; What&#8217;s that word for that again? It&#8217;s not an acronym. What do you call it? Yeah, no, something more language related, I can&#8217;t remember. Initials. Is that what we call it? Initials?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, we can call it initials.</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Right. So that&#8217;s what I knew growing up. My initials. I didn&#8217;t know what a logo was. My father used to sign his work with PJC or PJ Clayton as well. He has a J as well. But he&#8217;s Paul and I&#8217;m Phillip, so we had the same initials.</p>
<p>As I got older, I started to discover all these things about design. And then Letraset. He had Letraset books, art history books. And I&#8217;m just reading through &#8212; being dyslexic, when I say &#8220;reading through&#8221;, I&#8217;m really looking at what I can understand. And I realized that there is the typography and this thing called advertising. And he used to do mockups that he presented to clients by hand. He&#8217;d build the actual billboards, miniature versions of them, and he understood color separation, for example. That was a manual process back then. And I just started falling in love, and I said, &#8220;I want to be the person who knows all of this stuff.&#8221; </p>
<p>I wanted to become an admin. This is before I even knew about David Ogilvy. I said I want to be an admin. I want to be some kind of&#8230;I don&#8217;t remember if I used the word &#8220;consultant&#8221; at that age. And by the time I was in my teens going to college, that&#8217;s when I started to freelance, I guess you&#8217;d say, officially, while I&#8217;m in college under Phillip, it used to be Phillip Clayton. And I added the J because I said, I need to stand out a little bit here. The more I got involved in projects, I started to have this awareness of how the world works. And I said, &#8220;I need to have a company.&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t a company at the time. It was just Phillip J. Clayton Creative. I think I had it at the time. And it was short of PJ Clayton Creative and worked with that for a while. </p>
<p>And then this one that you&#8217;re currently looking at, Phillip J. Clayton. I mean, PJ Clayton and company. That one happened last year when I was pivoting myself. When I finally said, &#8220;this is it&#8221;. I think I know who I am now and what I want to focus on. And so PJ Clayton and company is the newest iteration of that.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s always been PJC. It&#8217;s always been something of that. I have logos. I have, like, I think six versions of this logo. This is the most current and pleasing one for me. I wanted to have something that represented me professionally, and I still wanted to maintain my individuality as a person, where I should be able to walk into meetings in corporate offices without having to become what people expect me to become, I guess, for those meetings. So it wasn&#8217;t very important that I maintained Phillip in some way. </p>
<p>And I think it was like five years ago, someone saw that name that Phillip J. Clinton on LinkedIn, actually. And they said, &#8220;oh, that&#8217;s a very prestigious name.&#8221; And that&#8217;s when I said, &#8220;oh, I&#8217;m changing this company. He&#8217;s going to be PJ Clayton &#038; Company now.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Hey, other companies do it all the time. They change up logos, they change their names around. So it sounds like you already sort of had that foresight.</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, from childhood, like I said, I was always thought highly of myself, but I was dyslexic. So even thinking of myself as smart and intelligent was not my strongest attribute. I guess the self confidence, well, externally was low, but in my head I was very confident, and I knew what I wanted from a very young age. It was &#8220;you&#8217;re going to be a famous artist or you&#8217;re going to be in advertising&#8221; &#8212; that much I knew. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What were those early days of the company like? I mean, you started back in 2001. You were still in school. What were you doing?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>It was just me. I had no concept of hiring people for help at that time. It was just me and some friends of mine. They work in production, the production entertainment industry, and I started working with them. It was mostly on our art direction and set design. I basically helped them with the graphic side of things. I get paid for that. And then I slowly worked my way into becoming into the management side where they start asking me to manage a whole production by myself: stage, set up, everything. Making sure everything looks good for either the TV screen or a concert. Also worked on music videos. So there&#8217;s a lot of art and graphic applications from my side. That&#8217;s why they wanted me to work with them. </p>
<p>I was doing all of that as myself, and that&#8217;s really the foundation of the company where I was known as, or I was dubbed as, a great graphic designer or an artist. So it was a lot of projects like that. It was either logo work or some kind of art consulting thing where I would use my artistic knowledge to help on something. On a visual. As a visual component.</p>
<p>Yeah. So that was the early days, but as a starting point of my official professional career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, if you look from then to now, what are some ways &#8212; and I mean, you&#8217;ve sort of already talked about your personal journey growing as a creative &#8212; but what are some ways that the company has kind of changed from then to now?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a dramatic change. I have partners now. I&#8217;ve narrowed myself into brand consulting. The clients are different. I mean, I&#8217;m between corporate startups and the industries are diverse. It&#8217;s fintech. So I&#8217;m actually solving business problems now. That&#8217;s a big difference there, as opposed to then being a creative service, as opposed to a company that has a creative service. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s flipped around now. What&#8217;s happened over the years is that I now focus on actual business problems. So I&#8217;m a business that offers creative services, but I align it all to a business objective or problem. So it has more impact now as a company and myself as a professional. The partners that I have, or people&#8230;clients that I work with, are way more, I guess, grown up. You&#8217;d say there&#8217;s an adult version of the company now where we&#8217;re having serious conversations, having fun about with what we do. Yes, but it&#8217;s really trying to have that impact on someone&#8217;s company who&#8217;s asking for help becoming an industry voice.</p>
<p>As someone once said, I&#8217;m speaking on behalf of the company when I communicate anything online. And now there&#8217;s this responsibility. It&#8217;s like you feel responsible now in regarding or accountable for anything that you say and do. There&#8217;s this thing behind me that I need to protect. And I guess that&#8217;s the big difference now from then, back then it was, &#8220;oh, I want to be creative and make a lot of money&#8221; and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say like you have a new project that&#8217;s coming into you, like a new branding project. What does your creative process look like? Because I imagine there might be steps that you have to take to sort of transform that client&#8217;s vision into a brand identity.</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Oh, absolutely. This is a diagnosis, part of the whole process that, well, once anyone engages me of interest, I have to ensure that one: I can actually help them. I can actually solve, or at least I have a process of how to solve it and then I have to align myself if it&#8217;s something that is where we are good fit. But once that happens, let&#8217;s say it goes well and we are actually going to work together. That process starts with assessing the company, the business development, product development and management. There&#8217;s usually probably a brand audit as well where they are in the market and are they okay in the market, should we point them in a different direction? But we have to start with assessing the company and what it offers. And process mapping is part of that, where we identify what happens when a customer is engaged on what happens at that point and then when the engagement ends, what happens after. So you identify these points, pain points or points of leverage. And a lot of times the process of helping that client is not necessarily always going to be on branding.</p>
<p>They may come for that, but it turns out that they need to redo their marketing or we need to do their business management. But in terms of creative process, it&#8217;s going to start with. I try not to, first of all, do research until I&#8217;ve been given the information or because I don&#8217;t want to taint that perception. And then once I have that, I observe that thing, whether it&#8217;s a product or the company itself, whatever I receive, I try to observe that from an ignorant place where I have no idea what this is, but who would buy it kind of thing or what&#8217;s the value of this thing that I&#8217;m looking at. So you have to understand how it works. And this is why I look at a company, you have to understand how the company works. Then you can go into the strategy of how to represent that value and leverage it as on the brand side. So the process is usually going to start with business.</p>
<p>It has to, in my opinion&#8230;I always start there. There&#8217;s conversation therapy. That&#8217;s the part where I am&#8230;it&#8217;s where I sit with the client and we have these conversations that lead into the development process. I mean, of course, you have to make sure your agreement is mutual regarding timelines and objectives. And I tend to ask this, by the way, I learned from my lawyer, &#8220;what&#8217;s your pain threshold&#8221; and &#8220;what&#8217;s the results you&#8217;re looking for?&#8221; Those two questions are really very good questions to start with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Your pain threshold. Yeah, talk to me a little bit about that. What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a way of identifying what that client is willing to do to get the result they&#8217;re looking for. Because a lot of times people try to charm me for some reason. You know what I mean? They try to impress you with how much money they have or money is not an issue, or &#8220;we want to be different and bold.&#8221; Oh, I love that one. They always come with that one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Everybody wants to be bold. Everybody. Every client wants that.</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And there&#8217;s this unique thing and it&#8217;s like, what I&#8217;ve learned is that no matter how complex a problem is or how unique it is to the client, it&#8217;s not that unique on a wider viewpoint or industry viewpoint, but it&#8217;s unique to that client. No matter how similar, it&#8217;s always going to be unique to that client and that company. But bold and different, distinctiveness, differentiation, fine. But when they say they want to be bold and different, it&#8217;s not a well thought through statement, because there&#8217;s risk to that. And unless you&#8217;re willing to take that risk, you can only be so unique in this sea of sameness, right? But you can definitely stand out with distinctive marketing and branding and all that, or how you represent yourself. If you have something different about a product in a competitive market space, then, yeah, you can differentiate that, but it&#8217;s to be bold.</p>
<p>Boldness. I love boldness. It goes against fair, which is different from being brave. I think bravery is a product of boldness. But when they come to me like that and I look at the company, this is why I assess the company, I assess the market, I assess their thinking. You&#8217;re learning about the management, the owners, you&#8217;re learning how they think, what they like, what they don&#8217;t like. That&#8217;s what conversation is about. So the pain question is to find out or identify what they&#8217;re willing to do to achieve it.</p>
<p>And they can tell me when it&#8217;s a pain threshold, like, well, they&#8217;re willing to do whatever it takes or, yeah, we don&#8217;t want to rock the boat too much. You get those things when you ask a question, right? You start getting the real answers, right? Then based on that you say, well, what&#8217;s the result you&#8217;re looking for? By the way, I learned it from a divorce lawyer. That&#8217;s what she asked, because she said, you&#8217;d be surprised. These two parties are, when they really go in with that aggressive approach and they want this and they want that and they realize, well, you&#8217;re not willing to do anything for this because relationships, it&#8217;s complex, right? So yeah, they want to hurt the other person, but what they really want is justice. In the end. They both want justice, right? That&#8217;s where the question came from. So what do you want in the end of this? What are you hoping to achieve at end of this process? And once the pain is threshold, what are you willing to do to get it?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>When you look at a brand or a brand design, are there key elements that you try to put into this design that really make it memorable? I would imagine those probably stem from that conversation like you talked about before.</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Always. The value of the brand is really what it represents or who it represents. So what you put into that is meaning. People add meaning to things. When it&#8217;s symbols, so that&#8217;s what a philosophy is for; what I call brand philosophy. I didn&#8217;t come up with it; that don&#8217;t mean I called it that way. I need to have that information, that knowledge that helps me or the team working together to develop a philosophy. This represents the thinking inside the company or the ownership. For people to feel valuable on any team, they need to have that accountability that without them, this won&#8217;t work. So there has to be a philosophy for this company that the brand now would express as the philosophy that this is their belief system. Right? That&#8217;s what people buy into a lot of times, whether it&#8217;s in religion or not. </p>
<p>I use religion a lot in conversation because it&#8217;s a great example of what a brand is and the belief systems are and how people buy into it, getting vested interest. So I have to have a brand philosophy. And then what you do is you make a declaration, so the manifesto comes out. You make a statement as a company and a brand, or you make a statement that this is who we are, this is what we&#8217;re about, and it&#8217;s based on this philosophy. So when I look at brands and I&#8217;m observing them, yeah, you&#8217;re going to see the aesthetic stuff first, service level stuff.</p>
<p>These are functional assets, I call them, because the very good ones are usually from a really deep philosophy. And the results of that is something so simple and powerful. When I see too much effort in the visual, I&#8217;m not usually very impressed with that because it means that you&#8217;re trying to convince something that&#8217;s probably not there. When I see a simple symbol and a really distinctive, confident visual language and architecture to a brand, I know that this company is something that I need to pay attention to. </p>
<p>For example, and that&#8217;s what happened, as an example I could give you was when PepsiCo, Mauro Porcini did the PepsiCo design innovation. I think it was 2012, they never had that before. That changed PepsiCo completely as a corporation. How they go about their business and their marketing. Design innovation at PepsiCo added deep meaning to the brand itself because it tells me what their focus is, it tells me what their thinking is or how they perceive their market and the customers in that market. So I look for those things. I look for deep meaning behind the logo, I look for deep meaning behind the communication. And I think that&#8217;s because of myself. I think I tried to say less and speak more. I hope I&#8217;m doing that now. Sorry. I like to speak less and say more. That&#8217;s what I meant to say. Because I think that&#8217;s one of the most powerful positions you can have when you don&#8217;t have to explain anything, urge to explain anything. If a company can do that, then, I mean, if the brand can do it for a company, then you&#8217;re really powerful. So I look for that. I look for less communication, more visual communication, less explanation, less wordy. And visual means typography as well, but less wordy, less explaining everything to me. I just want to see it because the logo is what I&#8217;m supposed to see. I&#8217;m supposed to see your whole story.</p>
<p>And then the logo is supposed to intrigue me enough that I want to know more. And that&#8217;s where we pour meaning into brands, because the brand actually forms when that experience ends. Anything that you have in your mind now after that experience is what the brand does to you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>How have you sort of seen brand design evolve, like over the past 20 years? I mean, we of course now have AI, we&#8217;ve got machine learning and all these sort of things, the way that technology has sort of infiltrated a lot of the creative industry, but then we also have changing consumer behaviors. I&#8217;m thinking particularly in the U.S. &#8212; I&#8217;m sure this is different internationally, just based on economies &#8212; but there&#8217;s been ups and downs and waves of how people spend money, what people spend money on, what people even value from a brand. How have you seen things evolve over the years?</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen both sides of that. Good and bad, I guess, or horrible. I know it&#8217;s bad or good, there&#8217;s pleasant and there&#8217;s this horrible experience I&#8217;ve seen over at least ten years, is that with automation, the objective changes. </p>
<p>For some reason, the brands that are paying attention, their core values didn&#8217;t change, their philosophy didn&#8217;t change, what they did was change how they interacted with their consumer and society in a whole. For example, the shopping experience, waste management, these things also all add up to what the brand represents because the company has to do these things. So that&#8217;s one, I guess, favorable experience on the brand side. The other side is that it has opened up a whole new services on what a brand is and what the process of brand design and development is. Because I rarely if ever use the word branding as a process.</p>
<p>I specifically say brand design and development because branding for me isn&#8217;t actionable &#8212; it&#8217;s under that process of brand design and development. Branding is a stage of the process where you start to develop these assets that represent and communicate for the company. But because of technology, what&#8217;s happening now is that&#8230;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re aware of a lot of on-demand services are out and what they&#8217;re doing is titled branding. Visual design. Visual identities, for example, have somehow become a separate thing from the brand design process. I don&#8217;t know how that happened where people are actually doing visual design as a service and I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;how do you get there without the brand design process?&#8221; So when you go into on-demand services, what you&#8217;re doing is&#8230;I can pay you less money because clearly you&#8217;re billing by time, which I don&#8217;t do, but you&#8217;re not really providing a valuable solution. </p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m not saying that smaller companies or startups who don&#8217;t have a big capital can&#8217;t start like that. Sometimes you just want to get the company out and if you focus on doing good business, the brand will form anyway. If you&#8217;re going to go into brand as a service and you&#8217;re expecting a certain result, then it&#8217;s probably not the best move to go on-demand. It&#8217;s probably better to focus on your business and just hold off on the development of the things like logos and whatnot. You can just register a company name and communicate as a company. Your brand will form and then obviously you made some money at this time and you can do it now you have a proper process, you have an understanding of what your company does and how people perceive you. But what I&#8217;ve seen with brands is that&#8230;I won&#8217;t say the entire brand landscape is like this, but there are some brands that are aligning themselves with deep and meaningful experiences for the consumer. They&#8217;re looking into how to make the seamless process of shopping and acquiring their products in a more sustainable way. Obviously there&#8217;s financial incentives there once a consumer buys into your thinking. The other side is that there are brands who are aligning themselves to trends. And we saw this when the pandemic came, when everybody started changing&#8230;well, a lot of people started changing their messaging. You&#8217;re now changing your core value. This is a philosophy &#8212; again, you have to have a philosophy that you stick to. It has to be something that you can adapt to environments in, but it doesn&#8217;t change your philosophy.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re only adapting how you do what you do, but not the philosophy of it, not your core values. That&#8217;s what I have seen happening regarding most brands is that they&#8217;re aligning themselves to trends and the consumer is dictating a lot about how they do things, and that&#8217;s fine. But at some point you have to stick to what you believe in and the consumer gets over it. We saw that with Nike and Kaepernick where Nike just stuck through, right? And I think that&#8217;s the most important part, is not to adjust the brand to fit with these trends, whether &#8212; and I mean this on a deep level &#8212; whether it&#8217;s with social movements or activism or anything, do not change your brand to fit that. </p>
<p>If I&#8217;m selling shoes, that&#8217;s what my company does, then my brand represents a company that sells shoes. And the background, I can support these organizations, but I should not be marketing them up front where I have a company with a brand that supports, I don&#8217;t know, some social movement and that has nothing to do with my business unless you build it into your brand like Patagonia. I think they are very open and upfront. It&#8217;s part of their brand philosophy. So unless you have that, I don&#8217;t see a hardware company to not sell certain tools, to align themselves with some kind of trend. A hardware company is a hardware company. The more tools or lumber they sell, the more money they make. What they can do now as a brand is that they can use that money, I guess, from your profits or whatever they used to choose to use to support some kind of social cause. </p>
<p>Do that, but don&#8217;t label it as your brand purpose, is what I&#8217;m saying. Don&#8217;t get up and say &#8220;our brand purpose is to support this cause.&#8221; Your brand purpose is to represent your company. That&#8217;s what a brand purpose is. That&#8217;s what has changed; brand purpose is not a new thing, and the brand no longer serves the purpose that it&#8217;s supposed to serve. It&#8217;s now serving human social causes or needs, or it&#8217;s not representing the companies effectively because they&#8217;re changing the meaning behind what a brand&#8217;s purpose is to represent your company. So your company is the one who should be doing the social support. The brand is only supposed to represent your company so that when you see it, you think of the company and what a company does for society. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s supposed to be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>They&#8217;re starting to become synonymous these days, especially, I think with, not to put this blame on social media, but I do think because social media has allowed a channel of communication between the consumer and the company that probably didn&#8217;t really exist that transparently before. What you end up having is a lot of companies having to, in some ways, sort of change their brand values or put something on their brand values that do stick with a specific social thing that might be happening. </p>
<p>Of course, the one thing I&#8217;m thinking about that has to do with this is regarding the summer of 2020 here in the U.S. where a lot of people were protesting and they were out in the streets. That was George Floyd. And you had so many companies kind of posting black squares on Instagram and making vows to do this specific social change or whatever. And now three years later, all of that stuff is non-existent and cut. And I mean, people try to hold companies to try to hold them accountable for that sort of stuff. But to your point that you&#8217;re mentioning, brand purpose has now gotten&#8230;it&#8217;s changed and evolved to now include how the company feels or has a stance with or against particular social issues.</p>
<p>And I can imagine that&#8217;s like a really difficult place to be.</p>
<p><b>Phillip J. Clayton:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, you don&#8217;t want to make your brand too human. It&#8217;s patronizing. It&#8217;s like, okay, so everybody has this human-centric buzzword now, and everybody has this brand purpose buzzword. It&#8217;s like, what is your brand purpose? And they&#8217;re going to tell you, I don&#8217;t ask that question. I don&#8217;t ask what your brand purpose asks. What&#8217;s your company&#8217;s purpose? When people try to make the brand very human, you have to understand what that means. The human being is a contradiction and a paradox. We&#8217;re subject to change. So unless you&#8217;re willing to put your brand through that constant change, that&#8217;s what it means to be human. </p>
<p>So yes, you can have values like you&#8217;ve mentioned there that you can add things to, you can build on it. This can be a foundation, and you can build on that foundation. But if you don&#8217;t have a foundation to build on, what&#8217;s going to happen is that you&#8217;re going to put up a black square, and then it&#8217;s going to mean nothing afterwards. But if you&#8217;re a company that has a foundation and a core value, and you express that core value &#8212; and this is what we do &#8212; but we are going to show support for this thing. That&#8217;s fine. But don&#8217;t make these bold statements as if you&#8217;re going to change the company now for the next ten years because of what&#8217;s happening. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m still a company that sells ice cream. My brand is whatever I write on&#8230;it&#8217;s Phillip. I sell Phillip&#8217;s ice cream, so that&#8217;s my brand. But my company sells ice cream, and I would like to donate money to this cause I like to do this, and I like to do that, but that&#8217;s not the brand. That&#8217;s a company. The brand represents the thinking and philosophy inside the company, the type of people that work at the company. So a company that used its brand to put up that black square, and then nothing else followed that, was either a company that&#8217;s just saying, &#8220;we do support, but we&#8217;re going to get back to work&#8221; or a company that gave the wrong message out there and made some kind of promises to the Black community and hasn&#8217;t delivered on it, now they&#8217;re accountable. That becomes a marketing problem for you.</p>
<p>So you don&#8217;t want to make your brand do that. What you want is to remember that company management or business management and brand management are two different things. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m saying it in a way that people understand or if I&#8217;m making sense to them, to anyone listening, but brand purpose &#8212; if I&#8217;m going to be grammatically correct, I&#8217;d say your brand&#8217;s purpose &#8212; is to represent your company. Your company is what you do and the people that do it or help you to do it, right? The company is a group of people. So it&#8217;s about your thinking. It&#8217;s about what you find important. It&#8217;s what you value as a company. The brand represents that. </p>
<p>And I love using Batman. It&#8217;s a very great example of what a brand is. All you see in the skies is his logo. That&#8217;s it. But the logo represents the promise he made to the city. That&#8217;s all it is. So your brand upholds the promise that the company made. Quality products. Quality service. These things. The logo is the symbol that represents the brand and the company all at once. It&#8217;s your identifying mark. </p>
<p>Just develop a good core value system, a belief system that you can uphold next 10, 20 years on average &#8212; most companies, I think, they last 30 years, unless they pivot or do some kind of innovation. Like Amazon did innovation. I guess you could say Facebook, because all of these companies, their lifespan was, I think, expected to be 30 years before they closed. But they innovated. So yeah, what&#8217;s the brand in that? If they&#8217;re going to, they didn&#8217;t change. They just adapted to a new environment, made product innovation, service innovation, better customer experience. I just want to make that part clear about the brand purpose because I think it&#8217;s very confusing and muddy right now with what a brand is.</p>

<p>I first learned about Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton way back in 2015 when I interviewed <a href="/silas-munro/" data-wpel-link="internal">Silas Munro</a>. Since then, Tasheka has gone on to become one of the leading voices behind discovering Black people omitted from the graphic design history canon. Even design legend <a href="/dr-cheryl-d-miller/" data-wpel-link="internal">Dr. Cheryl D. Miller</a> has sung her praises, so I knew I had to sit down with Tasheka and learn more about her remarkable journey.</p>
<p>Tasheka spoke to me about her experience as an educator and researcher, including an examination of her teaching philosophy. She also talked about growing up in New Orleans, her shift into design, working for the Navy Reservists, and even starting her own studio, <a href="https://blacvoicedesign.myportfolio.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Blacvoice Design</a>. Lastly, she discussed her upcoming book <em>Black Design in America</em>, and shared how the different aspects of her work keep her motivated and inspired. </p>
<p>If there&#8217;s any lesson you learn from Tasheka, it should be this one: you have control over your own path as a designer, so work hard and you can make your dreams come true!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Hi, and first, I want to say Maurice, thanks for having me here on Revision Path. I&#8217;ve been a listener for a long time now, so I feel really grateful and honored to be here. My name is Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton. I&#8217;m a designer, design educator. I run a design studio called Blacvoice. I also am a researcher, I guess, or design historian in regards to Black designers, as well as design writer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has this year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Very busy, but good for the most part. It&#8217;s been a really, really good year with lots of new projects on the horizon. Exciting and exhausting, all at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Any plans for the summer?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes, family vacation is one of the plans. I will be attending Typographics, and I&#8217;ll be a speaker there. So it&#8217;s exciting because I&#8217;ve never been to the conference before, and it&#8217;s kind of strange to have that my first attendance there would be me actually giving a talk, so I&#8217;m excited about that. I&#8217;m going to be teaching, I guess, this summer. I don&#8217;t normally teach in the summer, but I&#8217;m co-running a design residency program at the University of Texas, Austin where I teach. So I&#8217;m looking forward to that as well. And I have a couple of writing projects that I&#8217;ll be working on over the summer, and some design stuff as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Sounds like you&#8217;re going to have a busy summer ahead.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, speaking of teaching, you are teaching at two universities right now. You&#8217;re at Vermont College of Fine Arts, and you&#8217;re at the University of Texas at Austin, which is pretty new. You&#8217;ve been at VCFA what, for 10, 11 years now?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s been 10 years in April. 10 years. I started there in 2013.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
It&#8217;s kind of crazy to think that I&#8217;ve been there that long, actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What has the experience been like there?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Wow. The experience at VCFA has been truly amazing and transformative, and I think a lot of it has to do with the amazing faculty that&#8217;s there, that I teach with, who are not only colleagues but longtime friends now. It has to do with the sort of non-traditional structure of the program. We don&#8217;t have any classes or any courses. The program is, if you think about it as a two-year-long independent study, basically it&#8217;s a self-directed program where students decide on what they want to study and what they&#8217;re interested in. And the faculty is there basically, to sort of guide them and offer them resources, but it&#8217;s a self-directed program.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, that&#8217;s really interesting. No classes or courses?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you don&#8217;t have to put any curriculum together. That&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
No. So yeah, it&#8217;s definitely a different experience. So you do work with the students during the residency to come up with a semester plan on what they&#8217;re going to be working on throughout the semester. So as a faculty, you are there to help guide them and shape that semester plan. But again, it starts with what they&#8217;re interested in. We meet once a month. Students send their work via email, and then we have an hour conversation through, usually Zoom, and to talk about the work and sort of reflect on it, and kind of give feedback on how to move forward over the next month.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love how sort of open that is, especially I think during this time when I know we&#8217;re not out of the pandemic, but certainly, I think it&#8217;s still a time where some schools are trying hybrid models or things. That sounds like the way that it&#8217;s set up at VCFA, it allows you to really still be able to learn in that type of environment.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes. I think the one thing that at the core of the program is, first of all, it&#8217;s really tailored to, working professionals are people. You don&#8217;t have to quit your job for two years to get an MFA. You can still work or run your business, or whatever it is you&#8217;re doing and still go to school. And this is something that we&#8217;ve been doing prior to the pandemic.</p>
<p>So when the pandemic happened, not saying that it didn&#8217;t change the program and how we teach, but we were already sort of interfacing in that way. So the only thing it stopped was having the week long residencies that we would have twice a year in person. Then that programming got moved to Zoom. But as far as the interaction between the student and the teacher, or we say the student and the advisor, that was already happening.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now one of the professors that&#8217;s also there, we&#8217;ve had on the show. Oh God, that was a long time ago. We had Silas Munro on the show. This was I think, episode 85, 86, something like that. But he&#8217;s also a professor there, I believe.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah. So Silas, so you brought Silas up. Silas is one of the reasons, that&#8217;s how I ended up at VCFA actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
He&#8217;s one of the founding members of the program and Silas and I, we overlap by a year at CalArts. And so yeah, when the program was starting up, he sent me an email and asked me to join the faculty. And I wasn&#8217;t able to join at the time because of obligations with teaching. But then the following semester in April of 2013, I was able to come on board as a visiting, as a guest. Sort of a preliminary or, I wouldn&#8217;t say probationary period, but just to test to see if it would work out for me and if it would work out for the program.</p>
<p>So yeah, I credit Silas to bringing me in to a community in the program that&#8217;s, like I said, it&#8217;s been really transformative. Especially, the sort of approach to design pedagogy, this openness and not having this one idea of what design is. That sort of shift and change and marks according to the students, and the type of work that they&#8217;re interested in, and the type of diversity and the faculty and what we study and research, and type of work we&#8217;re engaged in. So that&#8217;s the thing that I really like, and it&#8217;s probably one of the few places that I&#8217;ve worked where I really felt a sense of family with my coworkers. Not that I didn&#8217;t have that relationship with other places, but there it&#8217;s really genuine. It&#8217;s not forced, it&#8217;s not fake. We actually truly do like and love each other.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, first of all, props to Silas for bringing you in, but it sounds like it is a great environment because you&#8217;ve been there for 10 years. Nobody&#8217;s going to stay there for 10 years if it&#8217;s not good.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, no, that&#8217;s true. Actually, you saying it, it&#8217;s technically the longest job I&#8217;ve ever had.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
When I think about it, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;re also teaching at University of Texas at Austin, which is fairly new. Tell me more about that. How&#8217;s that experience?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Wow, it&#8217;s been great, to be honest. I haven&#8217;t been there that long. I just moved to Austin, so I&#8217;m new to Austin and I&#8217;m new to UT. It&#8217;s been a really good experience as far as working in an environment with, I guess kind of similar to VCFA, where you don&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s this sort of one way that the faculty or the program is trying to teach design. It&#8217;s a little bit more flexible, it&#8217;s a little bit more nuanced where students get to dabble in a lot of different areas of design. Graphic design, industrial design, interactive design, design history, product design. So it&#8217;s really sort of flexible in that way and that&#8217;s one of the things that sort of drawed me in into UT.</p>
<p>The program itself was revamped around 2017, 2018. So the program as it is today, design, it&#8217;s the Department of Design and Creative Technology, is fairly new in a sense compared to a lot of other programs that are out there. So I think there&#8217;s something about that sort of newness. There&#8217;s a lot of vulnerability and a lot of questioning about the direction of the program. So it&#8217;s kind of exciting to be somewhere where we&#8217;re constantly thinking about ways to evolve and improve the experience for the students.</p>

Yeah. What is your teaching philosophy? I would imagine, between the work you&#8217;ve done at VCFA and are currently doing, and now with teaching at UT. And you&#8217;ve taught at some other places as well. What&#8217;s your overall teaching philosophy?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Well, one is, I try to approach teaching, one of the things that probably on the first day of class, I let my students know that, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m interested. I&#8217;m more interested in what you&#8217;re interested in learning, and what you&#8217;re interested in general out there in the world.&#8221; Not that I don&#8217;t have anything to impart or to give to them, but it&#8217;s less about me walking into the classroom saying, &#8220;Hey, listen up, I&#8217;m the expert here. You all need to learn what I have to offer.&#8221; Obviously, there is an important exchange that&#8217;s sort of happening, but I&#8217;m not interested in the hierarchies that traditionally plagues, I think, academia. So that&#8217;s the first thing is, to let my students know, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m curious about you, who you are as a person, and what you&#8217;re interested in.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other part of my teaching philosophy is, so how do I nurture that? How do I give them assignments, and give them projects and things to learn, to help nurture those interests? So often, I give projects and things that are about to help students investigate their community, and their environment and their identity. I think it&#8217;s really important for students to feel a connection to the project brief, to what they&#8217;re working on. And to figure out how to sort of channel their life&#8217;s experiences, as well as who they are into their projects. There are some practical exercises that are given to topography to talk about kerning and leading and that kind of stuff. But the start of bigger projects, I really try to figure out how to give assignments to help them sort of explore who they are in their environment and their community. Also, really, I think it&#8217;s important, one of my other goals is to make sure that I&#8217;m giving them projects or I&#8217;m giving them things to read and write about, and to consider about what&#8217;s going on in the world.</p>
<p>I like having discussions and I don&#8217;t shy away from, I won&#8217;t say controversial conversations, but I don&#8217;t like to shy away from, there&#8217;s always a group of students that have a certain perspective about another thing, and then you might have another group that have a different perspective. So I like having those type of conversations so we can learn from each other, because too many times that we all are always listening to and engaging in conversation with people who have the same perspective as we do. So, I always often give reading assignments, or articles or essays, or just come up with topics or things that might make some of them feel uncomfortable sometimes, where they have to talk about things that they don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;s going to be received by their classmates. And also, try to give them a sort of sense of agency and responsibility when it comes to their own learning, and not just take everything at face value to question, even question me, right? But obviously with the mutual respect, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d love to hear an example of something you would cover in class with your students.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Sometimes, it&#8217;s as simple as, I think this project isn&#8217;t something kind of, out of the park, but giving them &#8230; One time I had students design sort of protest signage. So they could approach it with whatever topic, anything that they felt really strongly about. Some people feels really strongly about, you should have solar panels on your house. Some people still feel really strongly about abortion, which sometimes for me, some of these topics that are still surfacing are kind of surprising. And some people feel strongly about police rights and things like that.</p>
<p>So any type of way I can give them some kind of assignment that addresses these issues, usually I try to get them to think about stuff that&#8217;s relevant in the media. Things that people are on opposite sides or sort of butting heads about, just to see, how do you handle that in the design context? Even, how do you handle as a designer having conversations about, &#8220;Well, if you have a very specific social or political agenda, what does it means to do design? Or could you do design for somebody to have a different perspective than you do?&#8221; So those type of conversations I think, are important to have.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I totally think that&#8217;s important because at any point throughout your design career, you&#8217;re going to encounter some conflict. I mean, I think we know the goal is to try to not have this sort of conflicts with clients or prospective clients or anything like that, but it&#8217;s going to happen. I mean sometimes you&#8217;ll have a client, you think they&#8217;re one way, and then you start working with them and it&#8217;s completely different. And even as you&#8217;ve said about personal views and such like that, it can get really tricky because the world is not just, I mean, not to use this as a racial thing, but it&#8217;s not a black and white place. There&#8217;s all sorts of ambiguity and things in there. So the fact that you&#8217;re able to work out those scenarios and issues with students in a learning environment is really important, because then they don&#8217;t get out there in the real world and have greater consequences for those sorts of scenarios.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah. So that&#8217;s one of the reasons why I do it, because I feel like if we can&#8217;t have these open discussions and conversation and academic space, then what&#8217;s the point of education or school in that environment? At least, that&#8217;s how I look at it.</p>
<p>Another project that I did when I was working at NC State last year was, I tasked my students with doing some design research in their hometown. So if they were from Charlotte, if they were from, I don&#8217;t know, somewhere in Germany, it didn&#8217;t really matter where they were from, but they had to do research about design in their particular community, where they were from. It was up to them if they wanted to pick where they live presently or somewhere where they were raised. And I gave them some sort of guidelines or places to start, I would say, because obviously if you said, &#8220;Okay, go research Charlotte, they may not know where to start.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I gave them four different areas to start. So I said, &#8220;Hey, why don&#8217;t you research the educational institutions, find out what schools offer design programs and research their faculty to see who&#8217;s working there? What type of design work or research that they do? Research the history publications in your particular area,&#8221; because I think newspapers and those type of print media is a good place to find the history of a place, sort of like the pulse, right? Design studios, talk to people there, make a list of all the ones that exist, maybe find out information about ones that used to exist. And I think the last place was printers. If they&#8217;re like print shops, go talk to those people. So those were the different areas as far as starting points that I gave them to start their research.</p>
<p>And then they had to interview people to help fill in the gaps of trying to create that sort of storyline. Because part of what they had to actually design was some kind of information design, but this wasn&#8217;t about charts and graphs. It was more like a storytelling or narrative sort of based research project, if you will. And then it was all the data, information was sort of collected in this zine that each student sort of designed together, and got it professionally printed at the end of the semester.</p>
<p>And I think it was a really good project. They learned a lot about design from where they were from, that they didn&#8217;t know, that they probably wouldn&#8217;t have even thought about if they didn&#8217;t have this project. And they learned something about themselves. I think for some of them, it was confidence boost. If you&#8217;re from somewhere or you come from an area where maybe design isn&#8217;t talked about or there are not a lot of people you see in design that look like you, and I think this project sort of helped them do some research and some discovery in those areas.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, what do you learn from your students? I mean, you mentioned earlier that you tell them at the beginning of the courses that you&#8217;re interested in learning from them. What kind of things do you learn?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I learn a lot from them. I think I can admit as a seasoned educator professional, but sometimes I go into the classroom with certain types of assumptions or misconceptions. So a lots of times, I might have assumptions what I think they might be interested in or what they should be. But then I learn actually, what they&#8217;re actually more interested in, and that sort of shifts and change sometimes. So for instance, a lot of students, now what I&#8217;m seeing, maybe something that&#8217;s trending because of technology is that, this sort of longing for tactile things, this longing to create and print things. Lots of times I think that students wouldn&#8217;t be interested in learning about letterpress, or screen printing or these sort of, or electroset. Electroset is something I love, doing electroset exercises with my students. And I really enjoy being able to talk to them about the history behind these all ways of printing.</p>
<p>But I find they&#8217;re really interested in these things. And I mean, you do have some that are like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m really more comfortable in a digital space, and that&#8217;s fine.&#8221; Again, I&#8217;m not there to try to not nurture what their interests are. But, I feel like I&#8217;m also there for to say, &#8220;Hey, look over here. There are these other ways of making and approaching design that sort of outside of maybe what you think you should be doing.&#8221; Or lots of times, I feel what I have learned is there are very specific things that sometimes students think, &#8220;Okay, design should be this way or look this way.&#8221; And a lot of it has to do with the tools that they&#8217;re using, because everybody&#8217;s using Adobe Sweden, everybody&#8217;s using Illustrator or whatever. And I try to tell them, &#8220;Well, if we&#8217;re all using the same tools, then everything starts to look the same. But why not take your ideas, and have your ideas and the content have to dictate what type of tool you use.&#8221;</p>
<p>So a lot of times I learn a lot that I shouldn&#8217;t make assumptions, about technology or different ways in which how they&#8217;re interested in making, or what they actually want to make. Sometimes I assume, &#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re probably interested in developing an app,&#8221; and they do have those type of interests, or they&#8217;re interested in AI. But then I find so many of them when it comes to technology, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t even want to touch that stuff over there. I want to get my hands dirty.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That is so fascinating to hear that students want to do kind of tactile things. I do a lot of different types of judging throughout the year. I&#8217;ll judge design competitions. I look at portfolios and things like that from students. And I have started to see more actual tactile work books, or pamphlets or zines or something like that. It&#8217;s such a stark contrast to 20 years ago. Now, I didn&#8217;t go to design school, but I knew people that were in design school at the time that I was also in school and everybody wanted a piece of digital. I guess it&#8217;s because it was just coming about at that time. I mean, when I went to college, there were computers. I remember vividly wanting to, I majored in computer science, computer engineering, and then switching my major over to math. Because I told my advisor I wanted to learn web design, and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s a fad. No one&#8217;s going to be into that sort of stuff.&#8221; And the school that I went to didn&#8217;t have an arts program, didn&#8217;t have a design program, so I just switched over to math.</p>
<p>But I knew people that were at the Atlanta College of Art, which existed back then, and the Art Institute of Atlanta. And everybody was just clamoring to try to do something with digital because they were tired of print. They were tired of, I guess, I don&#8217;t want to say they were doing maybe more traditional things like electroset or things like that. But everybody wanted to get in on the newness. And now, 20 years from then when technology is everywhere, now students want to get tactile, they want to make stuff. Yeah, I think that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, I think the thing that I have to keep in mind is that the way they&#8217;re growing up and how they&#8217;re entering these spaces in this world is very different from how I entered it, where I was there prior to computers and then post. Not that, to be honest, I don&#8217;t have the pay stop experience. I mean, I was in school at the advent of, Adobe was already there, Photoshop was already there. The Mac computer was already there in the early two thousands. So I was sort of a little bit post the desktop publishing area. But I think the thing that I forget is that, well, they&#8217;re so consumed, this is all they know. So for them they need a break. They are exhausted from the screen is what they tell me. So they&#8217;re kind of exhausted from it. And so when you show these other analog processes, they really light up. It&#8217;s really nice and encouraging to see that they still have these interests.</p>
<p>But again, there are some that are really interested in the technology. A lot of them are interested in the 3D sort of space and the digital space, but also the physical space. There are sort of a range. But I think that&#8217;s what I learn. The more I teach, the more I learn about what the sort of dynamics to what they&#8217;re interested in. And they have various interests and it&#8217;s not good to even put them into a box and assume what they&#8217;re interested in because, it&#8217;s a lot of different things that are out there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I love that. I love that. Students are tired of screens. I&#8217;m loving hearing that. Now, let&#8217;s learn more about you. Let&#8217;s hear your origin story. You&#8217;re originally from New Orleans. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me about what it was growing up there.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, I grew up in the inner city, not on the outskirts. I grew up in New Orleans, we sort of identified with the wards, which are actually voting wards. So I grew up in the seven ward, New Orleans, which the time that I grew up was predominantly Black or all Black maybe, don&#8217;t know the statistics on that, but a very urban inner city. Grew up poor, single mom, family. I&#8217;m the oldest of four siblings. Had a good childhood. I remember going outside and play, making games up as we go, just started using resources and things that we had around to play different sports, so to do different things. My mom was always really supportive in whatever it was I wanted to do. So when I was younger, I wanted to go to law school. Actually, I wanted to be an attorney. And so, I actually approached going to college, thinking that I was going to go to law school and practice law, actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow. What interested you about law?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
To be honest, Maurice, it was, the part of it that was probably really superficial, meaning I watched a lot of court shows growing up, and I got sucked into the drama of the investigations. And this aha moment when the real person, suspect was revealed. And the banter in the court and the back and forth between the attorneys, all the drama. So that seemed exciting because I always felt like, I&#8217;ve always had a strong voice, I guess, and a strong personality and perspective in that way. I can be very argumentative about things that I&#8217;m super passionate about. So I just thought I would be a good attorney. Why not? I was a good student, usually brought home good grades. So yeah, I could do this law school thing, and I can go to law school and do that.</p>
<p>The other side of it is, I also saw law as something that oppressed us as a people for a long time, and I wanted to understand it better to help us. So that was the sort of flip side of my interest in going to law school. But yeah, that faded when I actually, I mean I was really, up until my last year in college, I was still pursuing going to law school, to be honest.</p>
<p>Now, I was at Loyola, I was an English writing major. And the reason I picked that major was because I was told &#8230; I can&#8217;t remember if it was a job fair or a college fair when I was in high school and somebody said, &#8220;Oh, people who do really well in law school, they major in English because of all the writing and research you have to do,&#8221; whatever. So that&#8217;s really how that came about. And I did a lot of reading growing up. So the idea of having to read and write was kind of made sense, something I was sort of interested in. So yeah, that&#8217;s how that came about was because I wanted to be a good law student, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you had been on this path, I mean, to the point where you went to school, you were studying in it, you were getting all the way up to your senior year. Was there a deciding incident that kind of changed your trajectory?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
The incident was preparing to take the LSAT, I would say. So it was more like a process. So I want to say the first semester of my senior year, I was preparing to take the LSAT, researching what schools to go to. And all of that became extremely overwhelming and stressful, but it wasn&#8217;t exciting in a way, how things could be really overwhelming, but you&#8217;re still sort of excited about it, and if it&#8217;s you&#8217;re anxious. And so then I did some soul-searching and it was like, &#8220;Well, why do you want to do this Tasheka? Why do you want to go to law school?&#8221; And so, one of the things that is at the time it was really hard for me to admit, was that I honestly didn&#8217;t think I was good at anything, or I didn&#8217;t know what I was really good at. So because I was always sort of a good student, I just kind of looked at it as that way. I can go to law school, I&#8217;m going to be a good student, and then I&#8217;ll get a decent job.</p>
<p>I have always been a very goal driven oriented person. And so for me, it was always just sort of scratching things off the list. So go to school, major in English writing, do well, go to law school, take the LSAT, get a high grade, study. It&#8217;s just this constant thing. But when I actually really looked within, I realized that, well, I didn&#8217;t want to do it for the right reasons. You shouldn&#8217;t choose a career path just because it&#8217;s sort of checking off the list. I can accomplish this thing, but it&#8217;s not something that, I mean, I had a genuine interest in the law, but when I look back, yeah, it definitely wasn&#8217;t the right path for me.</p>
<p>So I just remember there was this one day, I used to do work study in the library. I just started going online and doing research about what do creative people do. So copywriter came about because I&#8217;m getting a degree in English, but at the time I didn&#8217;t feel too confident about my writing skills. So I was like, &#8220;Eh, I don&#8217;t really want to do that.&#8221; And then I remember, topography kept popping up, and this isn&#8217;t a time where in the early two thousands, when they had a lot of portfolio schools, like Miami AD and those type of schools.</p>
<p>So I was doing research and those type of schools kept popping up, and then I kept seeing topography and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What is topography? I don&#8217;t even know what that is.&#8221; So I looked in the school course catalog and I saw topography one and two, and then it was graphic design and I didn&#8217;t know what any of these, I wasn&#8217;t aware of any of this stuff, or what that meant as far as a career. And so the more I read and the more I did my research, I was like, &#8220;Oh, this design thing sounds really interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the next semester, I just went head first. I signed up to take a type one and a design one class, the year, the semester I was supposed to graduate. And then I fell in love with it. And then I pushed my graduation back about a year so I could get a minor in graphic design. And I didn&#8217;t get a true minor. I kind of had a relationship with the director of the art department at the time, because throughout my time in college, I took drawing and painting classes as my elective, because I&#8217;ve always had an affection for art and drawing. So I talked to her at the time and about getting a minor, and so they sort of told me that, just take the main classes. I didn&#8217;t have to take the foundations and stuff like that. So they sort of fast tracked me into design one and however many classes I could take within a year, because Loyola is a private Jesuit liberal university, just very expensive. And I was on a scholarship, so that extra year, I could only go to school those two extra semesters.</p>
<p>So I did that. After that year, it was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m a graphic designer now. That&#8217;s it. This is what I want to do.&#8221; Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a really interesting turn. I mean, you were already set to go along this way, and then you kind of just had another idea and there you go.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah. It wasn&#8217;t something that was obviously planned out in that way, but I&#8217;ve never looked back. I can&#8217;t honestly imagine being in any other field than design, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s really awesome that it sort of came about that way. I&#8217;m curious now on what Tasheka the lawyer would be like, if you would&#8217;ve went there.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I think about it, too. I don&#8217;t know, honestly. I mean, I think there&#8217;s a way that I would&#8217;ve found my niche. I would&#8217;ve found an area of law that would&#8217;ve been good for me. I don&#8217;t know how lucrative that would&#8217;ve been, especially if you think about going to a private undergraduate school, and then law school and then student &#8230; It&#8217;s just sort of the bills and student loans to pile up when you think about it. So yeah, I don&#8217;t know. I think I would&#8217;ve found my way, but I think that it definitely wasn&#8217;t the right path for me. And I think the sort of activist in me, I would&#8217;ve found whatever I guess sort of industry I would&#8217;ve ended up, I think I would&#8217;ve found that sort of angle.</p>
<p>But I do remember this one conversation I had with a lady at a job fair my senior year, and she said that her husband was an attorney and that he had a studio in their attic and he was a painter. And she said that, but once he started really getting into law, he stopped painting as much as he used to. And so I started thinking that I never wanted art to not be a part of my life. So that was sort of a reality check where I was, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want to go into law if this is going to prevent me from being creative or being a maker,&#8221; I guess.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So you graduated from Loyola, and I know later you went and got your MFA from CalArts. Between then, did you get out in the working world and experience a little bit of what it was like to not be a student for a while?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes. It was a very short time. It was exactly a year and four months to date. So yeah, after I graduated, I end up working as a designer at the Navy, which was such a strange thing for me personally, to end up working for the military. But yeah, I worked for the Navy Reservist Public Affairs Office, and they hired me because they saw my resume, that I took topography classes, which is kind of funny when I think about it. Because it&#8217;s like, well, when you go to, you study design, you take topography. It wasn&#8217;t nothing special. But anyway, but one of the other reasons they hired me was because they wanted somebody young with fresh ideas. And at the time, they were publishing and producing a tabloid newspaper. And so they wanted me on board to help transition that newspaper into a monthly magazine.<br>
I actually stayed there long enough just to do that, basically. We had a few firsts. I guess half the time I was there, we were publishing the newspaper. Then the second half, we transitioned over to a magazine, and that&#8217;s my first job. I will say that it was a really great learning experience in school, as far as print production and that kind of stuff. You don&#8217;t necessarily learn. So the Navy, I would drive to Panama City to go see the publication on press, that kind of stuff. So I learned all the production there. So yeah, it was a really good experience for me, as far as my first professional design job.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you were able to get that, I mean, one right out of school because you had this small amount of design experience just from studying, and they were like, &#8220;Yeah, we&#8217;ll go with that.&#8221; Nowadays, for entry level position, they already want you to have three years experience somewhere. So it&#8217;s good that they kind of took a chance and said, &#8220;Yeah, we&#8217;ll move forward and see what you have.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, I will say it was actually a head hunter that found me, or like a temp agency, I would say. And they put me in contact with the Navy. And I think that they were, because they were producing a publication, it was probably a time crunch. And so, I don&#8217;t know if I was the first person they referred them to. I don&#8217;t know if they had interviewed a bunch of other people. I have no idea. But I just knew that, oh, they were also impressed that I studied abroad. I&#8217;m trying to think of the things that they said to me during the interview or that made them sort of intrigued or want me to come in. They liked that I had spent some time abroad and that I took topography courses, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Where did you study abroad?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I studied abroad in Prague, in the Czech Republic. And it was mainly, it was more of a printmaking study abroad than graphic design. I mean, the graphic design aspect of it, was it that there was this workshop or this class that we took to set up design posters by hand. All analog, which was great, but it was really for printmaking, like lithography, learning to do aquatints and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And it was interesting, because it was actually with a program that was through NC State, and one of my professors at Loyola at the time was the person who was in charge. I had started that study abroad program. So it was kind of weird last year when I worked at NC State, it was like, &#8220;Oh, I did a study abroad program at this place and now I&#8217;m teaching here.&#8221; So I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s just kind of funny how things kind of happen that way in life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So tell me how your experience was getting your MFA at Cal Arts.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
That in of itself was an experience. CalArts was tough. I mean, I definitely went there knowing that it was going to be difficult, that it wasn&#8217;t going to be easy. Actually, I was there for three years. I got accepted for the three-year track. So a lot of schools now have a three year and a two-year track, and normally the three-year track is reserved for students who don&#8217;t have a traditional graphic design background. And so since my degree wasn&#8217;t in design, it was in English. And then, I had that limited experience, that year and a half working for the Navy. So I actually did three years instead of two. So the first year was, I guess an adjustment and challenging, in and of itself. For one, I was the only Black student there in the graduate and the undergraduate program, which for me was pretty shocking.</p>
<p>And the reason it was surprising is because I think, to be honest, at the time I was just starting, right before grad school and doing my first year of grad school. I was just starting to notice how there was a lack of visibility of Black people in design, or how the design profession didn&#8217;t seem to, or the lack of diversity that existed. Honestly, I don&#8217;t know why it took that long for me to actually realize that, but it wasn&#8217;t until, I think it was the 2004 AIGA conference that I realized that, where I saw maybe four or five other Black people at the conference. It was in Vancouver, I remember that. And then that&#8217;s when, that was not long before I actually started school at CalArts.</p>
<p>So that experience, and that was the thing that I think started me on this kind of trajectory, or the path into doing the research that I do, was looking around, not seeing anybody like me. Not learning anything about anybody who looked like me with the history class, or so, yeah, that&#8217;s sort of where I started. And me being at CalArts as a student, sort of asking the question, talking to faculty or just saying. Even sometimes it was in my work, I was questioning, where are the Black designers? When was the last time CalArts had a Black student in the MFA program? Nobody can answer that question. Or can you tell me something about Black people in design history? Nobody can answer that question.</p>
<p>So it became this thing where, and I know we&#8217;ve done similar sort of scavenger hunts. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Where the hell are all the Black people?&#8221; So anyway, that is where my research started. So because I couldn&#8217;t find anything out there that was tangible to hold onto, I just started doing my own research and investigation. Because I was like, &#8220;There&#8217;s nobody who&#8217;s here to tell me or give me that information. I have to discover it from myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I will say the faculty there was all, for the most part, it was, I felt supported. Although it was tough. It was like bootcamp, going to CalArts. It was a really, really tough, intense program. But I did feel encouraged most of the time for the type of projects that I had. And some of them was filled with a lot of emotion and anger, and aggression and frustration, and a lot of times that came out. But I will say that they sort of helped me nurture and cultivate my voice, and they also always encouraged me to be true, to keep that investigation and then that energy, and to being inquisitive about my design, Black design history, and culture and identity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s such a good thing now that it almost feels like, I&#8217;d say maybe within the past, I don&#8217;t know, 10, 15 years perhaps, we&#8217;ll say that. But we&#8217;ve started to see more Black design educators out there, and we&#8217;ve also started to see community efforts. I mean, Revision Path is one of them, but we&#8217;ve started to also see community efforts with making sure that Black people, and I would say Black and brown, I mean, I would kind of widen that lens a bit. But we&#8217;ve started to see now more people of color in general, being talked about, recognized, showcased, researched as it comes to design. I mean, I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;ll get to a point where there&#8217;s full equity with regards to that, but I think within the past 10 years, we&#8217;ve seen a lot of headway in that direction, where we&#8217;re starting to now see more Black students, or at least more talk about Black designers throughout history. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes, I would agree with that. There is definitely some sort of shift. I mean, if I&#8217;m honest, I&#8217;m not seeing it enough or as much as I would like to see it. But I&#8217;m also aware that things do take time, and especially when you have things that are so systemic and that&#8217;s a part of system that&#8217;s been there for so long that it&#8217;s not, it takes a long time to sort of dismantle it.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m honest, I do believe that it doesn&#8217;t have to, or it shouldn&#8217;t take it as long, but I understand it. I try to understand it. I do think that things can happen a lot quicker, but I do realize that there are still certain structures that are there, that&#8217;s way more difficult to dismantle to where it takes a lot longer. But I am happy to have colleagues. I didn&#8217;t think that I would see a day where I could name at least three other Black women that are doing similar type of work or things like that. So I am happy to see that there&#8217;s a change, and there&#8217;s a lot of work and way more work that needs to be done. But yeah, I agree. There are more efforts, I guess, and more initiatives that are happening at different places.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think with schools, it&#8217;s just always going to take longer because schools are just such, these large institutions. Of course, they get funds from different philanthropists and foundations and stuff like that. But I agree with you, in that I think the change could be happening a lot quicker. I a hundred percent agree with you there.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah. I just think that one of the things that I liked about UT was they started changing their admissions process. I think there are still more work to be done, but they have done away with the traditional portfolio. And so, their admission process is more a design prompt, so a student could &#8230; So the design program looks at just that one particular piece that they&#8217;re doing, and then they submit a 60-minute video that sort of talks about their process and their ideas, alongside the piece that they made for admissions.</p>
<p>So I think that, that takes a lot of pressure off because you still have so many students that, they don&#8217;t have the resources in their high schools to submit even a fine arts portfolio, let alone something that&#8217;s specific to design. Where you need all these different, you need a computer, you need the Adobe software, you need all these digital tools that a lot of high schools still don&#8217;t have those type of resources. So it&#8217;s nice to see that they&#8217;re at least trying to change that process a little bit, to make it more equitable for students of color to have access to the program.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, along with you being a design educator, and you mentioned this a bit earlier, you have your own design studio called Blacvoice Design. Tell me more about that. What are some of the projects or other work that you&#8217;ve done through your studio?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Well, a lot of projects I would say, first start off with the type of clients that I work with. So most of my clients are educational institutions like universities, colleges and things like that, nonprofit organizations, as well as kind of start up or small businesses. And I actually like the work that I do within those spaces. The type of projects that I do, format wise, most of them are books. I design a lot of books, but I don&#8217;t like to just consider myself a book designer because I do do identity projects and things like that. But a lot of the books that I do design, because a lot of my clients have modest budgets, usually I&#8217;m given texts and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>And so, I think that&#8217;s why I wear this hat of an image maker, because a lot of projects might call for me to take photos and I&#8217;ll take my own photographs for a particular project, or I do my own illustrations and create my own imagery for them. And so that I actually like. I like that whole process of generating the imagery, and doing the type setting, and doing the layout and the design. I really do enjoy being a part of that process from the beginning to the end. I thought at this point in my career that I would want to be in a more creative director sort of role, but I actually like and still enjoy being hands on.</p>
<p>So some projects that I&#8217;ve worked on in the past that are really kind of dear to my heart is, I used to do some work for a nonprofit organization. They&#8217;re now called 826 New Orleans, but they used to be called Big Class. And Big Class is a nonprofit organization. They started off basically sort of reaching out to the inner city public schools. And so, they would have writing prompts or writing projects for students to engage in after school. And so they would come up with themes, the students would come up with themes or topics that they wanted to write about. Usually it had to do with their feelings around their culture and their community.</p>
<p>And so, what I would do is basically, I would come in, talk to the student editorial board, find out what ideas they have about the design and the design process, and basically use that as information or inspiration and design a book for these individual projects. And so Big Class would take those books, they would have these readings, they would get people, they had their own press and their own imprint. And so they would publish and sell the books, and then they would just feed and go back into the sort of program. And I really like that program, because it not only gets students excited about writing, and writing is a form of expression, writing can be creative, right? Writing, I think gave them a sense of agency because they get to write, they get to publish, they get to put it out there, they get to have open mic and spoken words.</p>
<p>And so, I really love to see the sort of confidence that it gave these students, that maybe in their school, they may not ever have that type of experience. So for me to provide a platform for them to express themselves through words, through writing, I really did enjoy working with them. But now they&#8217;re part of this larger, more national collection of programs, that&#8217;s like 826 New Orleans, you have 826 Valencia. So 826 sort of exists in a lot of different cities. And my hope is to, there isn&#8217;t an 826 in Austin. Honestly, have no idea how to even start one. And it&#8217;s not that I even want to be in charge of one, but I would love to try to figure out how to create a rapport with some of the schools, some of the public schools here in Austin to try to get one started here. And then that way, it&#8217;s something that I would like my students at UT to be involved in that process, of helping those students design and get their work printed and published.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m a big advocate of designers needing to do more writing. A hundred percent. We had at one point in time, kind of design anthology called Recognize that we were doing through Revision Path, where we had designers just like, we would give a particular prompt or theme. I think the one we did before we shut it down was reset. I think reset was the theme. And so based off of that, we wanted people to submit essays up to 3000 words, centered around reset in whatever way that they wanted to. But it had to be design focused, like design writing. We didn&#8217;t get great ones. I&#8217;ll be completely honest. I think a lot of people rather wanted to design something than write something.</p>
<p>And even the first year that we did it, we would get some pushback from people, &#8220;Well, why do I have to write something?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;It&#8217;s a essay.&#8221; I mean, you have to write something because that&#8217;s the structure of it. I do want to bring it back one day if Revision Path can get the right funding and all of that. Because, I&#8217;m still a big proponent and believer of designers, I think, need to be, they need to know how to write because of course, it just helps you get your ideas out there. But it&#8217;s just so helpful for, and I think this probably ties into your research focus. It ties into your work being part of the cannon. If you can write down what you did, the work you did, case studies, et cetera, if it gets put out there in some way, if it gets preserved in some way, you&#8217;re now part of the cannon.</p>
<p>One thing with me, when I try to find guests for the show, it&#8217;s very hard for me to book a guest when I can&#8217;t find anything on them. I could maybe find-</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, you could maybe do some research.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, yeah, because I can maybe find a website or there&#8217;s maybe a blog post or something somewhere, but I need to be able to see what you&#8217;ve done so I can get a sense of who you are as a designer, if this is going to be a good fit, that sort of thing. But I say all of that to say that I&#8217;m a big, just huge fan of designers being writers, and write it down, write down your work, show your work.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I agree with that too, Maurice. And even as a person, I still think I have a very strange or uncomfortable, I think it&#8217;s a better word, relationship with writing. It&#8217;s something that with my teaching, I always make sure that there&#8217;s some writing component in a project for students, whether it&#8217;s a reflection to something they read or something they saw. I think it&#8217;s really important. I see a lot of similarities in the writing, in the design process. So for me, it&#8217;s been, although it&#8217;s still a place where I&#8217;m super uncomfortable in lots of times, a few years ago, to be honest, I think it was back in 2017 when I was teaching at Southeastern Louisiana University, and I had just gotten tenured there. And I didn&#8217;t realize at the time that until I was at NC State during that interview process, that up until that point, I had got tenured because of my creative work, because of doing exhibitions and things like that.</p>
<p>And at that point, I realized that with the research that I was doing, and then at that time, my research was startup, sporadic, how I was engaged with it. I started this research in graduate school, and then I would start to engage with it from time to time when somebody would ask me to give a lecture. And at some point, going back to what you were saying about the importance of the canon and sort of writing things down, that became a real turning point for me because at that point, I wanted to change my practice a little bit, and have it more focused on writing and publishing. Because in my mind, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, I can continue to do these lectures and talk about this stuff, but then what?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
What do you with it? And so I knew at some point I always wanted to write a book about Black design history. I knew, even from grad school back at CalArts, that&#8217;s something I wanted to do. I think, not until that point, I became more intentional about it. I was like, &#8220;Okay, if I want to shift,&#8221; not do away with making, not do away with freelance, not doing away with that work, but I wanted to be more intentional about the scholarly part of me, I guess, in that work. And sort of getting it out there and not have it just be through lectures. And I think, oral history and that stuff is valuable. I&#8217;m not trying to devalue that at all, but I do think there&#8217;s something about having something written and on a page, and printed and sort of documented. Right? I mean, I think it&#8217;s really important for our work and stuff to be documented, so it can be passed on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Exactly. I mean, the oral storytelling, and I realize we&#8217;re saying this on a podcast, but is mean that is important. But being able to write it down, pass it on, put it in a book, have it stored somewhere, that is what is really, that is the canon. That&#8217;s what you end up preserving. Speaking of books, I mean, we&#8217;re both working on books, but part of the research that I find is trying to find these writings and trying to find where people have talked about stuff. And you know what we&#8217;re doing now? Interviews. We&#8217;re having to talk to people because we can&#8217;t find where folks have written stuff down. So to that end, about books, as I mentioned that just now, you&#8217;re working on a book called Black Design in America. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, so I&#8217;m a co-author of Black Design America, African-Americans, and African Diaspora and Graphic Design, 19th to 21st Century. My co-authors are Silas Munro and Pierre Bowins. And how this book came about is not a linear kind of trajectory of story. So back in 2020, when George Floyd was murdered and you had the protests going on, and a lot of things were sort of happening online, VCFA had started this sort of virtual programming. I believe they contacted me and asked me if I was interested in doing a lecture or something about my research. And so at the time, I want to say around that time, I can&#8217;t remember exactly, but I know at some point, me, Pierre, and Silas had created a Google Doc, and we just started populating it with our research. And some of our focus on our research was slightly different. There was some overlap, but we started this Google Doc, and I think we started it with the intent of writing a book someday.</p>
<p>So the idea was that, &#8220;Okay, we want to have this document populated to start working on the outline.&#8221; So VCFA came to me. I decided that I didn&#8217;t want to just be the only voice talking about Black design history. So I invited Pierre and Silas to also give a lecture. So they call it these micro lectures. So still had the same amount of time that I had to give my lecture, but instead of me talking for an hour or 45 minutes, we each had 15 minutes to do a micro lecture, a mini presentation about our specific research.</p>
<p>So again, around that time, I met Dr. Cheryl Miller, and she was just starting, or had already started her archive for Stanford, a Black design history archive. And somebody gave her my name. And so, I met with her about sending my work there. And something that I still feel weird about saying was that was my first time hearing about her and her work, but I&#8217;m glad I did. I&#8217;m glad that we had that opportunity to talk and connect. And now she&#8217;s a huge mentor and influence, inspiration in my life. But that conversation with her sort of gave me a little focus. So I was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m really interested in the history of Black women in graphic design too.&#8221; So my portion of the lecture was about that.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re in the midst of the pandemic, and Silas had this idea. And so we all talked about how this information needs to get out there. I don&#8217;t know if we have time to go through the process of writing a book and getting published, and trying to do all the stuff that you have to go through, as you you&#8217;re working on one yourself. It&#8217;s a huge timeline. You don&#8217;t just do it overnight. It takes a lot of time. So Silas and his studio, that&#8217;s how they came up, and they put together the BIPOC Design History Classes, went live January of 2021. And so again, it wasn&#8217;t the intent to have the classes. And that sort of happened first. That idea, we thought, prior to the pandemic and whatnot, that we would be working on a book first. So that happened. That was the success. And so then after the chorus, then we felt like, &#8220;Okay, now we have to write this book now, because we kind of already have a structure. We have content.&#8221; But little did we know, Maurice, that it was not that easy.</p>
<p>These small classes. Okay. Yeah. There are chapters in the book, but I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s just, yeah, they&#8217;re still talking to people. There&#8217;s still more research to be done. There&#8217;s still more archives to visit. So it wasn&#8217;t just that simple to just make that transition from the series of classes, and then to make it into a book. So we&#8217;re still in the process of writing now. We have a hard, hard deadline coming up on June 1st, where we have to really turn over the manuscript. And we&#8217;re all also collaborating on the design of the book, too. So yeah, it&#8217;s been an interesting process.</p>
<p>And I think the thing that, I know for me, and I think from my co-authors as well, the thing that&#8217;s been most difficult is that it&#8217;s a design history book, but we&#8217;re not approaching it like a Meg&#8217;s book in a way, or this book came out a few years ago, it&#8217;s called Graphic Design Pioneers, or Pioneers in Design, where it&#8217;s focused on individuals. So we do talk about individual designers and sort of their impact, but it&#8217;s more about the diaspora, it&#8217;s more about Black experience in a way, and what we had to go through and deal with. It&#8217;s more about how we&#8217;ve been represented through visual culture, and who&#8217;s responsible for that and that kind of stuff. So it&#8217;s not necessarily about a clothesline of designers, although we do talk about individual people, because you can&#8217;t write a history book without acknowledging individuals. But, it&#8217;s not just about highlighting people, I guess in that way. It&#8217;s more about the different movements that happened, throughout time and throughout history.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, because I mean-</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
And we&#8217;ve been affected by it, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Because you&#8217;re, like you said, it&#8217;s set up with, it&#8217;s in the context of America during that time, and so there&#8217;s been wars, there&#8217;s been civil rights movements, there&#8217;s been other sorts of radical movements. And so, being able to talk about how Black design has been a through line with all of that in this country, we don&#8217;t learn it in school, in K through 12 schools. And based on what you&#8217;re saying, and probably from others, it&#8217;s probably not even something that&#8217;s really readily learned in colleges.</p>
<p>So having a book like this is super important, I think, not just to the design canon, but just like to American history in general. Because everything that we go through in this country has been designed in some capacity. That don&#8217;t necessarily mean that it&#8217;s been done with a pen and paper or in some visual aspect, but the systems of oppression that are in this country and many other things that sort of hold people back or push others forward, these are designed constructs. And so being able to talk about Black design in this country is super important to, I think, informing that for a lot of people. So, I&#8217;m excited to see the book when it comes out. Congratulations to you, because I know it&#8217;s a lot. I know all too well. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I mean, I think writing a book is a challenge, in and of itself, but I think history, and I think we have a special challenge in the type of history that we&#8217;re trying to bring to light, because it hasn&#8217;t been well documented or readily available. So it&#8217;s a lot of things you have to do to discover these stories. That&#8217;s definitely been a challenge. I think, one thing that I want to say I&#8217;m proud of about how we approach the writing in this book is that we sort of try to do away with &#8230; we&#8217;re being ourselves. We feel like using I, then we use I. If we want to throw in a little snarky, something that maybe a long time ago would be unorthodox for a history book, but we are just throwing it and putting it all out there. We&#8217;re not sort of concerned about our voices being the same, and we like that our voices are fluid and they&#8217;re sort of interchangeable.</p>
<p>We collaborated and wrote the introduction together, and there are parts of it, it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t even remember what I wrote. And we do have our chapters that the three of us have been responsible for, and we have contributors to certain chapters as well, but we&#8217;re not sort of concerned with the more traditional approach to this type of book. We don&#8217;t even call it a textbook. We&#8217;re not really approaching it in that same traditional way, I guess, if you will.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So you&#8217;re teaching, you&#8217;re running your own design studio, you are working on a book, you&#8217;re doing this research and your research focuses on, as we&#8217;ve talked about throughout this interview, Black people being omitted from the graphic design history canon. Given all the different spaces that you occupy, designer, educator, et cetera, what does the path forward look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I think about that a lot. I think it&#8217;s going to continue in this realm of writing and publishing, and designing. I think I like the idea of being a content generator and being the one to design that content. So I see more books around the same topic, but in different iterations. So for instance, I&#8217;m completely obsessed with Louise E. Jefferson. She is a Black woman who was one of the first art directors in the publishing industry at Friendship Press. She started working in the mid, late 1930s, and she was a designer, a calligrapher, a cartographer, an illustrator, a researcher. I mean, she was a real true renaissance woman, and she rubbed shoulders with all kinds of people during the Harlem Renaissance. But I&#8217;ve been doing research on her for a really long time. And so, I envision writing and designing a book about Louise E. Jefferson. And right now, I&#8217;ve been in touch with Friendship Press where she worked at as an art director for 20 years, and they&#8217;re interested in me writing a book about Louise and her work.</p>
<p>So those type of projects I see still continuing. The past few years have been great. The writing, the lecturing have been amazing, meeting amazing people, and have been great with giving me more opportunities to write into research. But I would like to hopefully, have more of a balance between that and my making, especially maybe even more so personal projects. I really enjoy doing small collaborations with other designers, whether it be zines or just random, creating compositions and giving files, going back and forth between digital files and things like that. Well, not really knowing what the outcome is. I think I just miss making and playing, and having fun.</p>
<p>Not that the design work that I do isn&#8217;t enjoyable, but it&#8217;s just a different type of making, I guess it&#8217;s different. You&#8217;re doing research and you&#8217;re writing. That&#8217;s a lot different than like, &#8220;Okay, I have this idea for making this thing using these materials, or even this tool or this technology. Am I making?&#8221; I&#8217;m really interested in this sort of synthesis, and analog and digital tools and how they sort of come together, and how to expand our uses in ways that they weren&#8217;t actually meant to be used. So I would like moving forward to be able to engage more, and just being a maker and not thinking about what I&#8217;m making so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, being a designer and an educator and all these things, you&#8217;ve talked now about how you want your path to go forward, but in your current work, how do you balance these different aspects? Do these different roles inform each other in some way?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, I definitely see there are so much overlap in &#8230; For a long time, I actually didn&#8217;t know how to bring all these things together, especially in the classroom because it took a while before I started teaching design history, and actually I&#8217;m not teaching it right now. I haven&#8217;t taught it in maybe three years. But I think, that doesn&#8217;t mean that I can&#8217;t still bring that into the classroom. So to me, it doesn&#8217;t matter. I don&#8217;t care that I&#8217;m not teaching design history. Whatever I&#8217;m teaching, you&#8217;re going to learn something about Black design. Some kind of way I&#8217;m going to insert my agenda, because I know that these are things that are, in part, it&#8217;s not just Black design history. I talk about queer history. I talk about other areas of design where people are marginalized or we don&#8217;t know a lot about, and I know a little something. I still try to impart that to my students, so I make sure that I&#8217;m trying to be equitable in that sense.</p>
<p>But yeah, I&#8217;m just starting to see where these roads and where these things are starting to overlap. So am I making? Now I think about, well, how could, besides designing books about Black design history or whatever, and the publishing aspect, but I start thinking about, well, what are other things that you can make that sort of has to do with your research? So I&#8217;m starting to think more about that, like timelines and things like that. So to me, the crossover is starting to happen. It&#8217;s slow and maybe not as fast as I would have liked them to be. And then I see them in the projects that I give to my students too. So it sort of reverts back to the classroom in that way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, I like that it all feeds into each other then. That&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Kind of makes less work for me in a way, as opposed to try to compartmentalize everything. So for a long time, everything used to be in these separate buckets. Black design studio, freelance here is writing and lecture. But now, they&#8217;re just starting to morph together, and that has been good, and that&#8217;s how I would like things to continue in the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hey, look, work smarter, not harder. I get it.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to someone out here that&#8217;s hearing your story, that&#8217;s hearing about all these different things that you&#8217;re interested in, and they want to follow in your footsteps? What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I would say, learn how to be comfortable in your voice, in your skin, and how to &#8230; I didn&#8217;t always feel comfortable being Tasheka, being authentically me, because sometimes I had moments where I didn&#8217;t want to step on people&#8217;s toes, but I noticed moments where I did do that, and I was just kind of myself and just kind of put it out there. Those have been the best experiences.</p>
<p>And I would say that we all have control. You have some kind of control over your path, and so if there&#8217;s a certain direction that you want your practice, or your craft, or your skill or whatever it is you are into to take, that you can kind of plan for. Talk to people who are doing the thing that you want to do, align yourself. Reach out to them. I know sometimes, we think and we look at people that we admire and we put them on this pedestal, but if they&#8217;re the right people, they&#8217;ll talk to you and they&#8217;re not full of themselves. And lots of times, people are more than happy to talk to you about your path, and this is especially to younger designers. Don&#8217;t be afraid to reach out to people who you admire, and have conversations with them about what they do and how they got to where they are. But yeah, I just say be bold.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Be bold.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Be bold and intentional about how you move through this world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love that. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want the next chapter of your story to be?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I do see myself still teaching. I do see myself still being at UT, and I&#8217;m hoping, my hope is that in five years, I have a couple of books under my belt by then. Maybe, I&#8217;m just going to throw it out there, Maurice. I would say at least three of them, because I have a list of projects that I&#8217;m really like. It&#8217;s kind of like these have to be done before I die. No, maybe they don&#8217;t have to be done in five years. That&#8217;s pretty ambitious of me, but I&#8217;m already working on one, so I can get the other two at least in the works by that time, that would be great.</p>
<p>I do have sort of a passion project that I&#8217;ve been sitting on on for a while. I have a collection of drawings, maybe it&#8217;s like 200 and something drawings, that I would like in five years to have their own sort of brand, where it&#8217;s a collection of, whether it&#8217;s greeting cards or home decor or apparel. Not or. I should say and. So I&#8217;ve been procrastinated on this project for a really long time, and I hope in five years that that project sort of sees the light of day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I&#8217;m probably most active on Instagram and Facebook. So Facebook is Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton. On Instagram, it&#8217;s Blacvoice. I am on Twitter under Blacvoice, but I&#8217;m not that engaged with that platform as much. But, I&#8217;m on there and I tweet every now and then. I&#8217;m on LinkedIn, which is, you can find me under Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton. Again, that&#8217;s not a platform that I&#8217;m super engaged in, but I&#8217;m there, and you&#8217;ll probably find me multiple times under LinkedIn, but I&#8217;m there. But Instagram, I would say, it&#8217;s probably the place to see me. I&#8217;m more active there. I would hate to throw out my crappy Adobe Portfolio website. That&#8217;s just a bunch of stuff that&#8217;s thrown on there right now. But hey, why not? Blacvoicedesign.portfolio.com. That&#8217;s just something that&#8217;s there right now, just to have an online presence, until I have time to do something else with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. You and your work have been on my radar for many years, I think probably, maybe since 2015? For a while now. And it wasn&#8217;t until recently, I had spoken with Cheryl, had Cheryl on the show for 500th episode, and she sung your praises to the high heavens. And I was like, &#8220;I feel like I reached out to her before. Let me reach out again just to see if she might be interested.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Actually, you did, Maurice. I thought about that. I was actually just telling my sister right before, and I was like, I feel weird because you did reach out to me a long time ago, and I think at the time I was just not ready, and something that had nothing to do with you or the show. I love the show and listen to it, and I think that was just like, &#8220;I&#8217;m still in my boldness. I&#8217;m kind of shy too, and more of an introvert.&#8221; So I think that, yeah, it just took a while, but you did. You did, but I&#8217;m glad you reached back out again.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, but I mean, I also just want to say from hearing your story and hearing about everything that you&#8217;re working on, I think it&#8217;s evident that you have a passion for design. You have a passion for honestly getting the story right, whether it&#8217;s through writing, through education, through your visual design work. I&#8217;m really excited to see and hear more from you in the future. I feel like you&#8217;re one of our bright shining stars that are really going to help represent us, as we move forward in this crazy world that we&#8217;re in right now. I feel like the work that you&#8217;re doing is really going to stand out and help showcase what Black designers are doing everywhere, so thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Thanks again for having me, Maurice.</p>

<p>Our back to school theme continues this week with a conversation with Dr. Christina N. Harrington. I first met Dr. Harrington as a contributor to the first volume of <em><a href="https://recognize.design/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">RECOGNIZE</a></em>, and now she&#8217;s an assistant professor in the <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/christina-harrington" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">HCI Institute</a> at Carnegie Mellon University and the director of their <a href="https://ehilab.cdm.depaul.edu/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Equity and Health Innovations Design Research Lab</a>! Impressive!</p>
<p>After a brief pandemic check-in, Dr. Harrington talked about some of the design research work she&#8217;s doing at Carnegie Mellon, and spoke about how her past teaching experiences helped prepare her for this opportunity. We also talked about  how she got into design via engineering, the utility of design Ph.Ds, and some of her latest obsessions. I&#8217;m glad we have educators like Dr. Harrington who can expand the concepts of design for the next generation!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
All right. I am Christina Harrington. I am a Southern, black, queer creative technologist. I have backgrounds in both engineering and design. I&#8217;m a tinkerer. I&#8217;m a crafter. I&#8217;m an inquisitive, how does this work, inside mechanics, logic type person. Right now I am in the space of higher education academia. I&#8217;m an assistant professor at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And I teach at that intersection of design and HCI, where we think about people and what people need when they engage with technology, why people engage with technology the ways that they do, the ways that technology can better support black and brown folks, folks that may not have the infrastructure to interact with the newest or coolest tech or gadgets or whatever, but that could really benefit from tech being ubiquitous in their everyday lives. I&#8217;m a writer a little bit, in terms of talking about design and figuring out ways to have these conversations about design outside of the walls of academia.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Speaking of writing, you were one of the first people that we published on Revision Path when we did our recognized design anthology back in 2019?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
2019. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Yeah. You scared me with that one. It&#8217;s crazy because going through school, it was almost like you were told you can either be really good at math and science, or you can do the humanity side of things. And I always wanted to write, because I just felt like sometimes expressing ideas is just as equally powerful through text as it is through sketching something.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
When I saw that Revision Path call, I was like, I&#8217;m just going to jump out there and see what happens. And I was super, super, super nervous, which is crazy because I had done like a whole dissertation and conference preceding papers and journal articles, but I was like, I really, really, really want to get into this anthology. And I really want to do writing that has a little bit more of my voice and a little bit less of like academic, technical jargon. Very, I don&#8217;t know, polished speech. It was really, really cool. Thank you for that opportunity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, thank you for submitting it. Unfortunately we had to, I don&#8217;t know if I mentioned this on the show, but I certainly had wrote about it. Unfortunately, I kind of took a hiatus from Recognize this year. The pandemic really did a number on, honestly like the number of people that were submitting, which sort of made sense. I mean, folks were just trying to survive out here. They weren&#8217;t thinking about trying to write stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But then the things that we would get, people just wouldn&#8217;t write to the prompt. They&#8217;d write what they wanted to write. To give you an example, the year that we did the first anthology, and the theme was space, a lot of people wrote about Nipsey Hussle. I&#8217;m not super familiar with Nipsey Hussle. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s like a space theme in his rap or anything, but I was like, why are so many people writing stuff about Nipsey Hussle. This has nothing to do with space. Or maybe it does, I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Is that the year he passed?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that was the year he passed.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I mean, I imagine that might be part of it. I don&#8217;t know anything about Nipsey Hussle either.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. If people are listening and want to clue me in, please do, because I was like, why am I getting all these &#8230; It wasn&#8217;t just that people were writing poems, people were submitting artwork. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No, I just need an essay, I don&#8217;t need something in Photoshop. I don&#8217;t need to see something you painted. Thank you, I guess.&#8221; I plan to bring Recognize back at some point in the future. I just think right now, probably the timing&#8217;s not great for it, but hopefully in the future, with more support, I&#8217;ll try to get it back out there.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
That&#8217;s one of the things about thinking about how we stretch design. Saying that you got so many people that we&#8217;re submitting artwork and Photoshop, and it&#8217;s like, designers are afraid to write sometimes. I&#8217;ve literally heard running jokes, designers, engineers, computer science folks that are like, &#8220;I&#8217;m an engineer or I&#8217;m a computer scientist, I don&#8217;t write.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Wait, wait, wait, how do you communicate what you&#8217;ve done? Or how do you communicate your ideas behind what you&#8217;ve built or what you&#8217;re envisioning?&#8221; There&#8217;s so much space for that, yet folks shy away from it so, so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s certainly something that I was trying to put forth through Recognize, is to have more people just write because it helps you, like you said, formalize your ideas. If you&#8217;re an entrepreneur, it helps with writing better proposals, writing better proofs, just communication in general, it tends to be really helpful. I mean, we even had a writer, actually a couple episodes ago, had our first writer on the show. I think in his background, he called himself a verbal designer, which I thought was really interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He&#8217;s a writer, and we talked all about how writing is, at least nowadays&#8217;s, such a crucial part of the design process. It was good just to have someone who&#8217;s a writer come on and really talk about like, yeah, I&#8217;m a writer and this is how I work within design teams and on design projects and giving feedback to designers about what they could do to either strengthen their writing or improve their writing, or even see the importance of writing in the whole design process.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Yeah. Definitely. Definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, aside from the new appointment, how&#8217;s the year been going? What&#8217;s been on your mind?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
The year has been transformational and also kind of like, you feel like you&#8217;re sludging through mud at the same time. I think the world is like a really crazy place right now. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s like, oh, all of these things are going on, and 2020, 2021 is like this unprecedented time in life. Or if it&#8217;s like, no, the world&#8217;s always kind of been crazy, but as you get older, you have more of a connection to why.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Politics have always been wild in the United States, but for some of us, it&#8217;s not until we get older that you start to really see how like, oh, the ways that we&#8217;re voting are impacting like, I don&#8217;t have healthcare. I can&#8217;t go to the doctor and take care of myself. I can&#8217;t do the things with my body as a person who identifies as a woman in the United States that I want to, because of the state that I live in.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think that all of those things on top of a global health pandemic are happening at the same time. I&#8217;m like, am I becoming an empath in my old age that it just &#8230; I literally have days where I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t today.&#8221; Because everything feels so heavy and it feels pointless to be writing a journal article or to be writing a conference paper. And these are things that I like to do, but there are some day ease lately where I&#8217;m just, I don&#8217;t have the motivation.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve been seeing a lot of memes and all of these articles that are talking about how black women in particular are just like, we are collectively burnt out. And I think it goes to earlier, the question you asked about the things that have happened in the last year in terms of really intensified racial moments. And it&#8217;s like, we dealt with a couple of months of white people coming out of the cracks of the sidewalk, asking us how we&#8217;re doing and apologizing for things. I don&#8217;t even know you. All of that contributes to this like just community exhaustion, I&#8217;m kind of feeling, from a lot of my friends and a lot of folks.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
So on the one hand with this new job and with this new role, it&#8217;s really exciting. It&#8217;s a blessing to be here. My career in terms of academia has shot through the roof to places I don&#8217;t think I ever would&#8217;ve imagined, but I am very tired. I&#8217;m very tired with just holding all of the emotions of what&#8217;s happening in the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I think that&#8217;s been a general sort of feeling that I&#8217;ve gotten from talking with a lot of black creatives, just a lot of black friends of mine. It&#8217;s been like, we&#8217;re just tired. It&#8217;s like a lasagna of fatigue. There&#8217;s tiredness of just like, you being a black person in this country, and then on top of that, whatever other identities you have on top of that, whether you are queer or trans or what have you. Then on top of that, just like this whole pandemic and coronavirus and these variants. And then on top of that, there&#8217;s the government like forcefully pushing people back out into the world like, no more masks mandates, get back out there. Even the whole, and I don&#8217;t mean to get super political, but the insurrection was this year. So much has happened.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Time is so warped right now. Time is so warped right now. There&#8217;s no concept of time because it feels like things are back to back. And it also feels like there&#8217;s so many intertwined struggles that you can&#8217;t parse out something to say, this is what&#8217;s upsetting me, because everything&#8217;s connected.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think that when we think about the moments that we had the uprisings that we had last summer, and it&#8217;s like, you&#8217;re mad about that. You&#8217;re angry about that, because collectively, black lives have been proven over and over again to be disposable in this country. But then at the same time, within those conversations, we have to talk about how black, queer and trans people are treated when they also too are part of those black lives. And what does it mean to have to have those conversations among other black folks who are telling you, we can&#8217;t talk about that right now. Don&#8217;t be divisive right now.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And watch the number of black trans women being killed continue to rise. Watch people not mention the names of the black trans men or the gender non-binary folks who have also been murdered at the hands of the state and police. Watch folks not want to talk about the rates of homelessness and just all of these things. And it&#8217;s like, whew, you can&#8217;t touch on one part of it without feeling that thread and the whole sweater unraveling. So, yeah, it&#8217;s a different type of &#8230; I think I ask my social media once every two weeks, what&#8217;s the word for past exhausted? What happens after you&#8217;re exhausted? What is that called?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I don&#8217;t know. I feel like we&#8217;re all at some point trying to persevere through whatever that state might be called, but it&#8217;s there. Now, we&#8217;ve jumped in like both feet in this discussion. I do want to bring it back to your work and what you&#8217;re doing. You mentioned your assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon at the HCI Institute. Can you talk about what that is and what you&#8217;ll be teaching?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Yeah. So the HCI Institute, it&#8217;s kind of like a dream job for me. It&#8217;s like this collection of, they joke like a collection of almost misfits of people across computer science, human-computer interaction, design, folks that are interested in that intersection of people and technology, technology and environment, people and environment, and anything that has to do with the ways that we interact with the digital world is kind of that area of human-computer interaction.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think what&#8217;s so dope about the HCI Institute at Carnegie Mellon is it&#8217;s one of the few, if not the only spaces designated purely to human-computer interaction degrees. You could study human-computer interaction in schools of computing, sometimes in schools of design within the United States, but to find a space where they&#8217;re like, we know exactly what this is. It&#8217;s kind of thus become like the leading institution for how HCI is thought about. To be at the place where it&#8217;s kind of like, this is &#8230; Some of the work that&#8217;s come out of this institute, this university, is what we&#8217;ve based other research on, is definitely cool for me.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think a little larger than that, being at Carnegie Mellon, where they also have a really high ranked school of design. And folks that work across that so seamlessly, because they do go hand in hand. I think that that&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s really, really, really exciting for me. And a lot of what I&#8217;ll be teaching is everything from foundational courses and introduction to user experience design or human-computer interaction. I like to say that I&#8217;m a methods girl. I love design research methods. Or engaging with students around how they learn about the people that they&#8217;re designing with or for. How they engage people in design and all of that is like design methods.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
You could go your traditional research route of just doing an interview, or you could be doing like card sorting, or role playing, or artifact analysis. Like all of these really cool things that designers have in their tool belt. I will be teaching any one of those things, but also hopefully introducing courses that consider design equity and design justice and thinking about design where design has not been talked about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I first got exposed to HCI, wow, I&#8217;m dating myself. This was 20 years ago. Oh, my God! It was 20 years ago. I was an intern at Marshall Space Flight Center, right outside of Huntsville, Alabama. It&#8217;s normal, Alabama&#8217;s a city. I remember my mentor at the time, he was studying HCI, as it related to like haptic interfaces. And it was so funny because he was like, &#8220;In the future, we&#8217;ll have like a computer that&#8217;s just like the size of a sheet of paper.&#8221; Basically he was talking about a tablet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And this was, my God, this was 2000, 2001, something like that. But talking about like learning how we interact with haptic interfaces. I think it was still very new at the time. I mean, I find that a lot of innovation that tends to happen sometimes through NASA, eventually trickles into consumer stuff. Because that was also where I saw my first 3D printer, was back then, because they print the nose cone of the space shuttle is made out of this substance called Marco. It burns up on reentry when the space shuttles reenter the atmosphere. They print that out every time. They literally like print it out, a big machine, and replace the nose cone every time. And I was like, &#8220;Oh wow!&#8221; I was like, &#8220;So you&#8217;re printing in 3D.&#8221; I mean, that was what? 1920 at the time. It blew my mind, like you&#8217;re printing in 3D.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
It still blows my mind. I didn&#8217;t know that. Definitely learned something. HCI has been around for a while. I mean, definitely since the late nineties, just from like the academic texts that I&#8217;m familiar with. Actually let&#8217;s say, I can think of papers in the mid to late nineties that have talked about human-computer interaction because the minute we started talking about computers, we had to talk about how folks are interacting with computers. And I think initially that was done in like the human factor space. Thinking about work and cognition and like mental load and task load and what it takes for a computer to remember chunks of information and memory and how that is likened to the human brain and then what the person can be expected to be able to do and task and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And then human computer interaction came along. And then somewhere down the road, design kind of like attached itself in a very particular way, because we started talking about, how do we develop the tools that we&#8217;re either building computers with? How do we develop the code? How do we create the housing of the computers? We&#8217;re talking about new phones and we&#8217;re talking about new tablets or iPods. When Apple came along and started doing that so, so, so, so well, and not to say that this was the initiation of it, but it&#8217;s always my go-to example because Apple is just kind of like the Mecca of design for me, when you&#8217;re talking about technology consumer products. Then I really think folks started having conversations about the way things looked in the technology space. And the way things were experienced in the technology space. I think it&#8217;s a cool place to be, in terms of like the work that I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now with HCI, are you focusing on hardware software or both?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Neither.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I am the anti-technologist technologist. I&#8217;m focused on how we think about everyday technologies in people&#8217;s lives. I am not necessarily trying to design the software of the phone and I&#8217;m not necessarily trying to design the casing of the phone, but I&#8217;m trying to think about how the phone can be used as a tool for health information, for folks who might not have access to medical professionals on a consistent basis.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I&#8217;m the researcher that&#8217;s trying to consider, well, in what ways can we embed public displays? How can we get community health information out there for people who don&#8217;t have wifi in the home or computers at home, such that they&#8217;re not behind &#8230; When we think about the pandemic and how out a lot of that information that was coming out from the CDC, I was seeing it on Twitter. I was seeing it on Instagram. You&#8217;re getting alerts. Like the CDC just made this update, here are the places where you can get tested and things like that. How do we get that information to people who aren&#8217;t so heavily reliant on their phone? And do we do that through computers and public libraries? Do we do that through health kiosks that are at the Walgreens or the CVS? That&#8217;s the level at which I&#8217;m thinking about technology?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Actually, that makes a lot more sense too, to think about it in that way. I think it&#8217;s because now, I mean just thinking about haptic interfaces and everything like that, I mean, everything that we utilize with technology, it feels like it&#8217;s through some sort of a touch interface or an audio interface or something like that. Thinking about how it works within the context of our lives and spreading information and stuff like that is really crucial.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good point that you mentioned about with the CDC stuff, because my folks are in rural Alabama. Basically I was passing the information to them on the telephone because they don&#8217;t have an internet connection. They don&#8217;t have a computer, so they&#8217;re not going to get that information in the way that it&#8217;s going out, especially because, one, they&#8217;re in the rural south, but two, broadband is not everywhere in this country. So it&#8217;s not a public utility in that way, like the plain old telephone services.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Yeah. And unfortunately, the reason I focus on digital access and design equity is because is I&#8217;ve been the poem and the quote like, [inaudible 00:24:30] on the moon. Like we&#8217;re trying to get information to our folks in rural areas, but we have communities that are literally shipping off to Mars to escape the realities of what&#8217;s happening down here. And it&#8217;s like, there&#8217;s such gap. There&#8217;s such an imbalance in the ways that technology is utilized between certain communities.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s like at some point we have to say, hey guys, we can&#8217;t keep building new, new, new, new, new, while we have communities that are still like, wait, what&#8217;s a Google Home? What&#8217;s Alexa? Oh, I could use that to track my doctor&#8217;s appointment? Like, what? That gap, that dissonance is something that I feel like I&#8217;m always going to have an area where my work is needed because we have folks that are so focused on creating these technologies for the year 2032, and we are still trying to get some folks caught up to the year 2005.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. A lot of those futurist innovations really just like, they just completely blow by a lot of communities. I mean, even with smart speakers, I think I got my mom a smart speaker, I don&#8217;t know, a while ago, probably back in the early 2010s or whatever, when they first started coming out, and Alexa couldn&#8217;t recognize her. Couldn&#8217;t recognize her accent. So it&#8217;s like, well, that&#8217;s not good. She ended up giving it to me. I don&#8217;t even still have it anymore.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But to that point, like, yeah, you&#8217;ve got these other interfaces and stuff like that. The tech tends to be so focused on the next big innovations when like there&#8217;s still so many issues right now that need solving. And I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because these are not like flashy, sexy news making issues that need to be solved, but it&#8217;s a huge chasm between the work that needs to be done and the work that&#8217;s being done.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
It&#8217;s also why you don&#8217;t have a whole lot of people focusing on it, because it&#8217;s not sexy, innovative work. I get hit with the same question, oh, do you do hardware? Do you do software? Are you in AI? Are you in machine learning? Are you in VR? And it&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m in this space of information because folks are still trying to understand the full features of what your phone can do, to support your everyday living. To jump to, here&#8217;s a headset that can make it seem like you&#8217;re pumping ice cream at McDonald&#8217;s in Kansas. It&#8217;s like, okay, that&#8217;s cool, but we&#8217;ve skipped a whole area for certain folks. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That reminds me of what I saw on, I think it was maybe last week or this week, I think, with Good Morning America Facebook debuting these virtual reality work rooms. And like everybody&#8217;s got on a $300 VR headset to meet in a virtual space to have meetings. I&#8217;m like, this is the most ridiculous shit I have ever seen in my whole life. I mean, it&#8217;s one thing that we can&#8217;t get together because of the pandemic, where like now I have to buy a $300 peripheral just so we can sit in second life and talk about status updates? It&#8217;s ridiculous. You&#8217;re also heading up the Equity and Health Innovations Design Research Lab. Talk to me about what that is and like what some of the projects are that are coming out of the lab.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, the EHI lab is literally just that. I came through both my masters and my PhD in heavy lab cultures. I was involved in the research in ergonomics and design research lab at North Carolina state. And then I worked with the Human Factors and Aging Lab at Georgia Tech. Becoming a faculty, literally the first thing I wanted, and I don&#8217;t know why I was so obsessed, but I was like, &#8220;I need a lab.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I want a lab where I can curate projects, but not just for namesake or ownership of a space, but more so, one of the things I&#8217;ve really been trying to do is kind of like kick open the doors of academic research to the communities that we sit in. So I wanted something where communities know like, okay, if we&#8217;re trying to do something, if we&#8217;re trying to build something, we can come here and collaborate and build and work and voice concerns or discuss some of the things that we&#8217;re trying to do.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Most all of my work is community-based participatory design. What I call CBPD, which stems off of community-based participatory action research that you&#8217;ll find in public health sectors, where it&#8217;s like letting the community define the need, define the project, define the scope of what we&#8217;re doing, which in academia sometimes means flipping on its head, what the project outcomes are. How can we do a design research project and put something in the hands of community before we ever publish a paper or present at a conference or do a poster or whatever? And that means creating zines.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
One of the projects that we&#8217;ve been working on for almost a year now is the creation and the development of a speculative design toolkit for communities to be able to brainstorm without the leadership of a formal design researcher or a professor or academic PI or whatever you want to call it, to say, we want to brainstorm our own solution to this thing that we&#8217;ve been working on, whether it be re-imagining what to do with an abandoned building on a particular block, or we&#8217;re trying to get safety cameras put in at the basketball court, so that parents feel safe. So that with their kids being out there late, or we&#8217;re trying to get broadband access in a particular neighborhood, how can we think about that through a design lens? How can we brainstorm that? How can we iterate on what solutions might look like?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
So we&#8217;ve been developing this toolkit that we&#8217;ve been calling Building Utopia, and we&#8217;ve been working with community design practitioners who do just exactly that type of work. So, Jen Roberts, from the Colored Girls Liberation Lab. An amazing, brilliant end day who works with Black Womxn Flourish Collective, which you may or may not be familiar with. They&#8217;re one of the co-founders of that with Denise Shant√© Brown. And they and Jen have been collaborating with my lab on the development of this toolkit, and we&#8217;ve been testing it and refining it and hoping to launch it maybe sometime this year, early next year.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I told myself that I wanted to do projects that I cared about. So what are the projects that matter to black and brown folks? I think what you mentioned about your mom is actually a really great example because that&#8217;s another one of the big projects I&#8217;ve been doing is looking at health information seeking with voice assistance for black elders. And how do we meet the needs of them being able to ask health-related questions of these devices that right now, for all intents and purposes, don&#8217;t want to understand our voices, our accents, our dialects, the words that we use that may not be formal language. And so that&#8217;s another one of the projects that&#8217;s coming out of my lab at the moment.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And we&#8217;ve been looking at, how do we redefine more ideal conversational assistance? How do we define what the conversational dynamic black elders want to see looks like? And we&#8217;ve been doing that in a very community-based participatory manner. I kind of let the work that I&#8217;m doing lead me, like doing this project, and when you hear enough, people say one thing and it&#8217;s like, okay, here&#8217;s that defines what the next project is. When the toolkit literally came out of us exploring speculative design with folks that are like, yeah, this is all well and good, but what are we doing when the academic researchers are gone? And the students have finished whatever project and studio classes are over, and we&#8217;re still trying to think through some of these things?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s like, oh, well, what if we worked collaboratively with folks to develop a toolkit that is kind of like a resource for folks to do that work without the need of having to engage with universities or industry designers? So, yeah, that&#8217;s kind of what the EHI lab is about. And the things that I&#8217;m open to doing is really just closing that gap that I was mentioning earlier between the ways design has been used in communities of privilege and of fluency. And the ways that design can impact communities that are not defined in that way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
As you&#8217;ve been going through these things with the lab, it&#8217;s interesting that you said that the problems or the things that you all are working on, kind of uncover themselves as you start talking to people, as you start using the things that are coming out of the lab more. It&#8217;s almost, I don&#8217;t know, self-generating in a way. Like you&#8217;re finding new ideas as you get out there and talk with other people. I mean, I think that&#8217;s a good thing. That&#8217;s how labs are. Labs are for experimentation.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now, prior to this, you were teaching at DePaul University in Chicago for a number of years. When you look back at that time, what do you think you learned that really prepared you for what you&#8217;re doing now?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Several things. Definitely I think DePaul, being one of the few formal schools of design that had a PhD, that also was open and starting to define design in this very like social good, social impact way. DePaul, A, I&#8217;d say is known very well for like games design, graphic design. And then you had folks that were also starting to define this sector of like Dr. Sheena Erete&#8217;s lab, the technology for social good and this area of social impact.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think it was a great home for me to start off and define my own research interests and my own research agenda, and how I was going to maneuver through some of these projects in an academic space. And I think Chicago was a really great city to do that because Chicago is kind of like this very, I don&#8217;t want to say social impact, when you&#8217;re talking about things outside of academia. But Chicago has this movement activist, equity driven lens just inherent throughout a lot of the work being done in the city. So I think engaging with outside organizations and then seeing how other faculty were engaging with the city and different organizers and community partners is definitely something that rubbed off on me.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And then I think DePaul as a university, being a place where you really get to harness teaching students. I&#8217;ve been in this research thing since I started my master&#8217;s program. But teaching is very rarely something they teach you how to do. Like how do you effectively develop course objectives and evaluate students in ways that&#8217;s not just throwing a 300 question exam at them? And I think I was able to learn a lot of that at DePaul.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to go general, like more into your background, because you have an extensive educational background and everything. Let&#8217;s start from the beginning. You mentioned at the top of the show that you&#8217;re Southern. Where did you grow up?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I am from Fayetteville, North Carolina, born and raised. At some point my parents moved to Richmond, Virginia. And then when my parents split, my mom&#8217;s side of the family and my dad&#8217;s was still back in North Carolina, but we had the closest relationship with my mom&#8217;s side. We literally were in Fayetteville whenever she was not on the clock at work, because that&#8217;s where her support system was. So North Carolina is very ingrained in me, but I did a lot of my schooling during the week in Richmond, Virginia.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Were you exposed to a lot of tech and design growing up?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
What I would consider the tech and design that I know now, no. I went to the math and science center. I was one of those kids in middle school, I went to the math and science center in middle school. I forget how I got into that. I was always a tinkerer, even in like my younger elementary school days. I was always trying to take things apart, put things together, build things from scratch. I remember one year when I had the concept of like what a birthday is and you get people a gift. I tried to build my mom these shoes by taking one of her pair of shoes and tracing it on paper and then foam. And then the stuffing of the foam that comes out of like a packing box.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I&#8217;m trying to build up these layers so I could build her a more comfortable pair of shoes, because she was always working. Because design hadn&#8217;t really reached a lot of high schools and middle schools, it was like, okay, you&#8217;re doing that, so you&#8217;re supposed to be an engineer. There was no concept of like, you&#8217;re supposed to be a designer. I never heard the word design or like designer. I literally was told you&#8217;re good at math and science, you&#8217;re tinkering, go be an engineer.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I remember telling my high school guidance counselor. I was clearly doing well. And I was in gifted honors classes, and this, that, and the third. So I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to go to college. Here&#8217;s where I&#8217;m applying.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;What do you want to do?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;I want to build electronics. I want to create electronics.&#8221; And he was like, &#8220;Oh, go to school for electrical engineering.&#8221; And then my uncle was an electrical engineer that graduated from North Carolina A&#038;T.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I went to college for electrical engineering, and it wasn&#8217;t until I did a summer bridge program at Virginia Tech, that&#8217;s no longer there, but it used to be called Aspire, but it was for incoming black, Latinx. And I believe at that time, even Asian students to take these summer courses at Virginia Tech, the summer before you started your fall semester as a way to promote retention, because minority students had low numbers of finishing in these degrees at institutions like Virginia Tech.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I did this program. And so you then came into the fall semester of your freshman year with this cohort of folks. I became really close with some of the guys, because it was mainly guys. And I think it was like maybe six girls out of like 40 students. But I remember two of my guy friends that did that program with me. They were mechanical engineering students. They were getting a minor in this thing called industrial design. And I was like, &#8220;Boy, one day, I&#8217;m going to go to class with y&#8217;all.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I went to one of their industrial design classes. I think it was Mitzi Vernon teaching design research at Virginia Tech. And I like fell in love with it. I was like, &#8220;What is this thing?&#8221; And I literally left that class and I went into the College of Architecture&#8217;s front desk office, and I was like, &#8220;How do I sign up for this minor? I want to do this too.&#8221; And then I went to my undergraduate advisor and was like, &#8220;Okay, now how can I make my senior thesis integrate industrial design?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I changed my whole senior thesis to like, instead of just electrical engineering project, it became designing a sensor and designing a hardware of the sensor that could detect vehicles that were coming at joggers and bikers at a certain speed for like safety. I&#8217;ve always been about like safety and designing for impairments and things like that. I just fell in love with design, taking this design research class and then taking this sketching classes. I forget the other classes that were needed for the minor.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And as I moved through that minor and then going back to get my master&#8217;s in industrial design, I realized that like, that&#8217;s where I want it to be, because engineering, and this is no slight to the engineers, but I just felt like engineering put me in a cubicle where I didn&#8217;t get to talk to people. And I didn&#8217;t get to understand people the ways that I wanted to. And design was like, okay, you&#8217;re designing the thing. You&#8217;re also thinking about the core guts of the thing, but you&#8217;re also understanding the person that&#8217;s going to be interacting with the thing.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And the period between when I graduated from undergrad and before I started my masters, I worked at Motorola as an RF systems engineer. I was sitting in a cube, eight, nine hours a day, designing radio packages for the government. I never talked to anybody. I never went out. And I hated it. So when I went back to get my master&#8217;s in industrial design, it felt like some clouds are opening up. So I was like, oh, this is where I want to be. And the further I explored that, the better I defined like exactly what design meant to me and also realized how limited a lot of folks are in being exposed to design, because I could have been doing that the whole time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I think an interesting kind of trend that I&#8217;m seeing here that is what you&#8217;re continuing in your work is that you have the idea that in terms of going into your education, you knew that you were good at these things, but you only had a very limited view of what that could look like, which in turn ended up being engineering. I empathize with that too, because like when I went into school, I wanted to do web design. This was in like late 90s, early two 2000s, and I remember my computer science &#8230; Well, no, first of all, I was told, &#8220;Oh, you should go into computer science, to design a website.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And at the time I enrolled in this computer science, computer engineering dual degree program, you do three years at Morehouse. You do two years at Georgia Tech. You get out with a master&#8217;s and a bachelor&#8217;s. And I was telling my advisor, I wanted to design websites, and he just laughed in my face. &#8220;The internet is a fad. This is what you want to do? We don&#8217;t do that here.&#8221; I switched my major and went into math because Morehouse doesn&#8217;t have a design program. I do think about now how different my career might have been if I ended up going into more of that design route.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m bringing this up because what it sounds like for you is that you started out doing this engineering and then as you learn more information and saw these other paths that were open, that then shifted you more towards design. So like it&#8217;s that thing about access and I guess equity in some respect, but just access to knowing that this is an option that you can take.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, definitely. I think hearing your story fuels that point of, how often are young black and brown students being pushed towards these degrees or this area? You don&#8217;t necessarily have to have a degree to be a designer. I think design is like a skillset. Design is also a way of thinking that a lot of people inherently have or what we all inherently have, it&#8217;s just whether or not we express ourselves in that way. I wonder how we are exposing like black and brown kids to exploring that as a potential thing to do to harness your creativity or to make a living or whatever it is you want to do out of life.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s not a lie. I think that there&#8217;s so many reasons why design is an expensive, especially like a master&#8217;s or a PhD in design, it&#8217;s an expensive area because design proper doesn&#8217;t fall under a lot of the NSF and the fellowships that are going to pay your way. Oftentimes people that are going back and getting post-baccalaureate degrees in design are paying out of pocket or loans. That&#8217;s already going to curate a particular type of folk that&#8217;s able to do that, and not feel financial stress.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And then I think now people have more of an understanding and a vocabulary around design. But 10 or 15 years ago, when you say, I want to be a designer and it&#8217;s was like, well, are you going to make any money doing that? And I think black and brown students are oftentimes limited in having that as a constraint when they come out. If they go to school, it&#8217;s like, I got to pick a major that I&#8217;m going to do a job that makes money. We&#8217;re not always afforded the opportunity to say, I want to do this thing regardless of what the return of investment is going to be.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And so all of these things contribute to, we push, in the past at least, our communities have been pushed to do certain things, to study certain things, and design has not been one of them. And so then it becomes this like elite thing that people think I can&#8217;t do design. [inaudible 00:46:38] doesn&#8217;t think in that way. And it&#8217;s like, if you had a problem at home this morning and you no longer have it because you figured something, you created some type of work around, or you Jimmy rigged your door to no longer creak. Or you&#8217;re trying to go in and out of your bedroom to get watermelon in night, like whatever, you&#8217;re doing design.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s reframing how we think about what design is and how people think about what they can do with design. I think we&#8217;re starting to see that more now. You have designed this trickled out throughout so many sectors. You have literal government agencies that are now wanting to hire people talking about design, to address city infrastructure problems. To address urban planning problems. All of these things, there&#8217;s so much value now. And people considering design as a lens to just think through things. It might not even have to be about problems. It can just be about the process of ingenuity and creativity. But I think for my generation at least, that&#8217;s just such a new thing, because when I was coming out of K through 12, people were not talking about [inaudible 00:47:54].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And I&#8217;m going to just put this out here and folks can quote me on that. I attribute a lot of that, I think, new thinking around how folks approached design to the fact that the people that are talking about design, like you look at just the general makeup, has gotten a lot more diverse than it has been in previous years, because you&#8217;ve got more black and brown people, more queer people, et cetera, bringing their perspectives, which are a mix of education and lived experience into what design is, that it&#8217;s helping for a lot of people to expand what the definition of design looks like.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I remember in like the two thousands, I mean, I was out of college. I was like early in my career and everything about design, at least around like web stuff, because it was still pretty early. It was just all about web stuff. What&#8217;s the latest framework. And it wasn&#8217;t about, how are we solving problems? Like UX wasn&#8217;t really a &#8230; I want to say UX wasn&#8217;t a thing. It certainly wasn&#8217;t as prevalent as it is now. People did UX stuff, but it was not as, I think, known or accepted, I want to say, as being like a hardcore frontend person or backend person or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I mean, it&#8217;s amazing the titles that you see, the type of work that you&#8217;re able to do in design that is, in large part, I think there&#8217;s just more diverse people are out there talking about it, sharing their experiences and really showing other people how design is not just something that&#8217;s done like on a computer or with a pen and paper or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
But even to your point, those tools have also helped to break down the barriers to design. One of the reasons I love what people on social media and the ways, I don&#8217;t know if you saw like, it was like a couple of years ago, and someone created a movie poster, like coming soon for Set It Off 2. And it was so real that I got upset, because I was like, no, leave, Set It Off alone. We do not need a Set It Off 2. There&#8217;s nothing you can do with that. I think it had Teyana Taylor on the cover and somebody else, but it was because someone got in Photoshop and was so sick with Photoshop, that they created this thing that looked like it came out of somebody&#8217;s media company. Like it was actually happening.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
We&#8217;ve gotten so sick with our Photoshop and illustrator and just our creative skills because of these digital tools, that you have so many people that you don&#8217;t need the four year degree to be like, I&#8217;m an illustrator. I&#8217;m a designer. I create flyers. I do the promotion for this restaurant. You know what I mean? I help this photographer clean up their prints. There&#8217;s so many different ways to do it now because of digital tools.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And I think that that&#8217;s the dope thing about design, because we&#8217;ve now started to see it literally infiltrate corners where folks never would have thought about doing that type of thing. And again, like I said, that then starts to bleed back into one of designs origins of political propaganda, because now I can literally build a career doing the social media promotion for Elizabeth Warren, or I can literally build a career doing a design for Black Lives Matter direct action.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think now when you&#8217;re seeing organizations and collective designers protests and design justice network and all of these people that are coming to use design as a lens with all of these different mindsets and backgrounds like, oh, I studied social work, but I now lean heavily into design for ways to really communicate my work and to get things out there and to make change. It&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s what design to me is and how it should have been talked about for all of this time.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Design, it&#8217;s not just this insular, oh, I am in design studio for eight hours a day, studying at this university. And I have this portfolio of these very specific pieces, and now I&#8217;m a designer. Design is so many different things, so many different people coming to the table or literally the streets and moving in so many different ways. And I think that all of these things have built for us to get to this moment. I just think that that&#8217;s so, it&#8217;s dope. It&#8217;s dope, where we&#8217;ve been able to get it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, absolutely. And one thing that I have to mention, you shouted out some of your peers earlier, Dr. Dori Tunstall Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel. Raja Schaar is a doctor also, right? I know I&#8217;ve heard her name. I don&#8217;t recall if she&#8217;s a doctor or not.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Raja&#8217;s not a doctor. But Raja is actually one of my academic mentors, because Raja was teaching at Georgia Tech when I was a student there and gave me my first teaching gig. I always have to shout that out. Raja is the first person that let me teach the class, when I was like, please somebody, let me teach. I need to know how to teach for what I want to do. Raja let me do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is it like being a black woman at the top level of design education in this way?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
That&#8217;s an interesting question, because I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever thought about it like that. The design PhD in general in the United States is not widespread. We&#8217;re still trying to figure out what&#8217;s the utility of it. Like why do you need a design PhD? In the United States, you get a master&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the terminal degree you can teach. You can go into industry. You don&#8217;t even need a master&#8217;s to have your own firm or your own consulting, whatever. Well, you can teach in certain design programs.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Having a design PhD is, in my perspective, literally because Lesley-Ann, Dori and myself, we all do a particular level of writing and research and getting grants and things like that, to move in the ways that some of the other sciences do. I think about it less than the framework of like, oh, I&#8217;m one of the few black women that has a PhD in design.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Although I think that if I stopped and thought about it, that is kind of like, oh, that&#8217;s &#8230; Whoa! I&#8217;ve thought myself as another black woman academic. Still few. Still few and far between. Like if you looked at my department right now, it&#8217;s not like, oh, I&#8217;m the only black woman with a PhD in design. I&#8217;m the only black woman in my department. Differentiating myself in that way is not something I oftentimes think about, but I do hope, and I do see, coming on the horizon, if not already here, maybe not myself. It&#8217;s just because I don&#8217;t always put myself in that equation. It&#8217;s kind of like an imposter syndrome thing, but I definitely see where the Doris and the Lesley-Anns are shifting design.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And I think last year was a moment to put that on grand scale, because more people were coming to them, but their work was already at that nexus of like, y&#8217;all, the way Lesley-Ann thinks about design, the way Dori is talking about design, what Dori is doing at OCAD and bringing in all of these black faculty and design. And even Raja, I don&#8217;t think a PhD really matters, because Raja is one of the people that is &#8230; I mean, you want to talk design, to me, the first person I&#8217;m going to mention is Raja Schaar. I think it&#8217;s more so the impact that they&#8217;re going to have in the field of design because of the types of work that they do, not necessarily because they have PhDs, but I guess they&#8217;re probably synonymous or maybe I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, we spoke about this a bit before we started recording and I really want to talk about it more now. Last year, a lot of organizations and companies really stepped out there to talk about how they support black folks across a number of different fields, design included. And we talk about sort of what it looked like to have that influx of interest and support. Do you still see that support now, a year later?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Yeah, like I said, I don&#8217;t, but I also am not particularly looking for it, because I don&#8217;t think anybody was naive to what that moment was. As I mentioned, there were literally foundations that came and were like, we want to put you on an advisory board so that we can start to think about the equity within our products and our projects. They were also, again, throwing out the same names that I mentioned, you, Lesley-Ann and Dori and Raja. I haven&#8217;t heard from them. I couldn&#8217;t tell you what&#8217;s going on with that project.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
It&#8217;s one of those things where it&#8217;s like take from it what you needed to take from it and continue with the work. Don&#8217;t let that be the sole motivation for the work. Don&#8217;t let the die down of that make you feel like the work is any less important or necessary. Because for a lot of us, we&#8217;ve been talking about these things and we&#8217;ve been doing this type of work, way before anybody was slapping our faces on flyers or panels or whatever. And we will be long after folks no longer care we are. And I think that that&#8217;s what energizes me. I think about like a Chris Rudd, who has been talking about anti-racism and design. That&#8217;s the whole reason that he ever started working in design. And how in the moment of what happened last summer, I&#8217;m sure he like other folks, folks became really familiar with who he was and was speaking on panels and this, that, and the third.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
But he&#8217;s been doing that. He&#8217;s been doing that work. He&#8217;s been so invested in the community in the south side of Chicago. That is his whole lens to design is equity and anti-racism and workers&#8217; rights and thinking about design from a lens of, what would a less racist Chicago look like? What would more equitable Bronzeville corridor look like? He&#8217;s been defining those things. I hope that the moment of last year doesn&#8217;t overshadow the fact that folks have been talking about these things.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
A lot of the organizers with designers protests, Brian Lee has been doing this area of design. A lot of folks just came to know him in the moment of what happened summer of 2020, but he&#8217;s been organizing in this way. He&#8217;s been talking about design in this way. To me, I didn&#8217;t really even see the companies as much as I saw my friends and colleagues and people that I knew from afar and looked up to, kind of pushed into people knowing their work as people should.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
The companies and all of the organizations and all that, all that was like kind of noise that I knew would fall off anyway. That was never my focus. It&#8217;s more like, okay, great. Now we have folks knowing the name of Chris Rudd, of Brian Lee, of Dori Tunstall. That&#8217;s kind of what came out of that moment for me. I don&#8217;t even really think about the fact that in 2021, those organizations or whoever, are not still knocking down, at least my door, I don&#8217;t know about other folks. And the folks that I&#8217;m mentioning, they&#8217;re still doing the work. They haven&#8217;t stopped doing the work because whoever is no longer showcasing 31 days of black on their social media page or whatever, they&#8217;re still doing the work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
To piggyback off of your response there, you&#8217;re a hundred percent right. I think what last summer did is that it did help to, I think, amplify a lot of the work that those of us have been out there doing. It sucks though, that that support hasn&#8217;t been continued or sustained. Like you can very much tell it was just like a, in some respects, kind of like a flash in the pan kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ll share the anecdote, I won&#8217;t name the company, but I&#8217;ll share the anecdote that I share with you before we started recording, that there was a certain, very large pharmaceutical company that I spoke at last year. That definitely was like, yeah, we really want to help out and do this, that, and the third and whatever. It had just becomes sort of very clear, because they were asking like, is this going to be like a continued thing? Do you think that there&#8217;ll be more support out there that people know about this?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Ask me next year.&#8221; Because right now, I mean, for those of us, like I said, I have been doing this for a while. We&#8217;ve seen these kind of like spikes of support that come along as it relates to, it could be a societal issue or it could be an industry issue or something like that. And you get that little spike. That&#8217;s great when it happens. If you can sustain that, that&#8217;s even better. But a lot of that support I know of from last year did sort of just like dry up. Or the company got selective amnesia about what they said or what they promised. It&#8217;s been all sorts of stuff. It is what it is. How can the listeners get more involved in the research areas that you&#8217;re a part of?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think a lot of the organizations that I mentioned. I mean, I think that there&#8217;s always going to be like that shameless, you want to do a PhD, come to death row type comment of like, come work with the kid. You could definitely do that. I also know that academia is not the only avenue to do this work. I even push some of my students to be a part of design justice network, be a part of do the check-ins with designers protest.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think that a lot of the collectives that I&#8217;ve come to learn about, when we did the Denise and Designer project, which it started before the pandemic even hit, but we weren&#8217;t able to put things out until I think like late last summer. It kind of overlapped with, we were talking a lot about this area of design and then it was like, oh, the timing just kind of coincided of us starting to put out the zine and the website and highlighting folks on social media.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think following the Denise and Designer project on Instagram and some of the folks that we highlighted, like looking into their work, looking into the collectives that either they lead or that they&#8217;re a part of, or some of the projects they&#8217;re doing on their own, I think that there are so many ways now, as we talked about equity and design justice is becoming more widespread. There&#8217;s so many ways to get involved. I think that people can tap into any one of those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you think you would&#8217;ve done if you hadn&#8217;t went into academia?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Real answer, I wanted to go to culinary school. I wanted to go to culinary school. I wanted to do a bunch of different things when I was a kid. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s like some sagitarious type stuff. But there was the point in time, pre 1998 when I was like, I&#8217;m going to be the first girl in the NBA. And then there was, I want to go to culinary school. Cooking was so sexy to me. I don&#8217;t know why I just thought I wanted to cook. And then I think when I got to undergrad and I was grounded a little bit more, and even then barely, because I remember end of my sophomore year under my freshman year, calling my mom and being like my, &#8220;I hate electrical engineering. I hate it here. I want to get my degree in Africana Studies and be a writer or something.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And my mom being, &#8220;No, you&#8217;re not [inaudible 01:04:08].&#8221; I wanted to do so many things and it was like engineering oddly was my safety net, because I was smart in math and science. It could have been a number of different things. And it still might be a number of different things, because I don&#8217;t believe that we are fixed to what we do in terms of our productivity or making money in this light. I don&#8217;t think we have to be fixed to that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I still might end up opening a smoothie shop and being the old black lesbian in the neighborhood that&#8217;s just making smoothies and minding her business on the porch. That&#8217;s just my character and how I see the world of just wanting to do what feels good and what makes sense in the moment. I think this past year has showed me that I don&#8217;t want to die working myself to death and stressing over a job. So what that looks like in the next 15, 20 years is very up in the air.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Woo! You hit me with like a shot to the heart with that one. Woo! I know exactly what you mean when you say that. Stress will kill you. And if you happen to be black, if you happen to be anything else on top of that, it&#8217;s a lot out here. I don&#8217;t blame you. I think a lot of people are starting to come to their &#8230; I won&#8217;t want to say come to their senses, because that implies some form of like brainwashing. But I think a lot of people are realizing like, to be quite blunt, fuck these jobs.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The work is always going to be there. I think I had to come to terms with that a few years ago myself, when I really saw that I was really overworking myself. The work will always be there. I may not. Someone else can easily sub in for whatever, but like I don&#8217;t want to burn myself out trying to &#8230; You don&#8217;t get a medal for being a workaholic.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Yep. I think last year I was talking to a friend about this. I mean last year literally showed us whose job was essential and whose wasn&#8217;t. And the ways that we need to let go of some of that internal guilt of taking rest, of taking time off, of going on vacation. I know at least like black, queer, trans, non-binary folk in the academia and the academy, we tend to carry that. Like, I got to work harder to get where other people are, and so, no days off. I also have the invisible labor of holding space for all of the students who don&#8217;t see themselves typically on campus and all of these things. And it&#8217;s like, we also tend to statistically die younger because of it, and not last, and still not get tenured.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think the last year has taught me, I&#8217;m going to rest. I am going to take time. I&#8217;m going to take vacations where I&#8217;m not touching my laptop. I think as burnt out as I was starting to feel with academia, one of the beautiful things that I quickly realized coming into CMU, there&#8217;s a faculty by the name of Jessica Hammer in the HCI Institute, who is all about that. Making sure that you&#8217;re working efficiently, such that you can unplug and take care of yourself and have that balance.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And I think that that&#8217;s just the place that I&#8217;m kind of in, because we watched the world go topsy-turvy, and a lot of us didn&#8217;t know how to put down productivity. We didn&#8217;t know how to not be defined by that. It was kind of sad and a little scary, watching folks scramble to do what felt like normal, but what felt like normal was work, at least in the context of the U.S.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Shout out to the Nap Ministry. I first heard about them last year. I think it might have been right around the summer of last year. Shout out to the Nap Ministry, rest is resistance. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Shout out to the Nap Ministry, shout out to Pleasure Activism, shout out to any messaging that is just like, take care of you. We have to be reminded of that. I think Denise is a great example in the way that they&#8217;re operating Black Womxn Flourish is like, hey y&#8217;all, we&#8217;re taking a break in a couple of weeks. And I&#8217;m like, that is like such a symbol, but I&#8217;ve never thought to just be like, no, it&#8217;s not a holiday, but I&#8217;m just going to go to the lake for a couple of days and not answer my email, and y&#8217;all will be okay. We know the jobs that are essential now. We know what we need to literally survive as a society. More than likely my journal article isn&#8217;t part of that, so I can take a break. I can take a nap.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I love it. I love it. What are you obsessed with at the moment?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
So many things from Real Housewives of Potomac, do not shame me, but I love them. I&#8217;m obsessed with that. I am upset with, in terms of design, like this concept of futuring and speculative design, but through a lens of Afrofuturism. I&#8217;m obsessed with the concept of like, there are black people in the future. I think it&#8217;s become ingrained in everything I see and everything I do, from like TV shows. I like a lot of like sci-fi and those psychological thrillers or like those, the world has ended as we know it and now it&#8217;s 2442 and here&#8217;s what civilization looks like. You watch those shows and you&#8217;re like, wait, so in 2442 there&#8217;s no black people? In the casting call, you don&#8217;t even think to put one mixed girl, nothing?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s like that concept of like us, the longevity and what our futures looks like has become something that I&#8217;m super obsessed with. I&#8217;m obsessed with art, of course. I think that that&#8217;s what attracted me to design because I was introduced to design as like this mesh of engineering and visual art. So the visual art is always going to be something that like aesthetically &#8230; Like I love collecting art in my home. I love going to museums and learning the history of, especially like political art, what people were trying to say through their art. I&#8217;m obsessed with my travel bucket list. That is part of my selfish Americanism of like, when am I going to be able to just roam the world again and feel safe? Safe to the extent of being like black masculine presenting queer woman on this earth, as safe as we feel anyway.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I will admit this, but if you see me in person, I&#8217;m not going to want to engage in it in person. I&#8217;m not a LeBron hater, but I follow his career. So I&#8217;m slightly obsessed with how long is this man going to play in the NBA? It&#8217;s not even like a Vince Carter. Like where Vince was like, he&#8217;s old. He might go in for like five minutes and do a dunk and then you can see him kind of limping off the court and he&#8217;s done. LeBron is still playing as like the centerpiece of the team, going into what? 35, 36. So I&#8217;m kind of obsessed with like what that moment is going to be when he &#8230; Is that going to come? I mean, he&#8217;s conditioned his body so well, and I think he&#8217;s obsessed with proving to people that he can still do it. As an avid basketball fan, I&#8217;m kind of obsessed with seeing how long he goes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
I think I&#8217;ll still be doing similar work. I mean, I have great interest in doing more like civic technology fellowships, where I&#8217;m taking a year and focusing on a project that sits outside of the academic institution, like the walls of the academic institution or consulting with folks that are thinking about larger scale problems. I think that that&#8217;s the next direction that I feel like I want to go in at some point. I don&#8217;t know what capacity that&#8217;s going to look like. Because like I said, I tend to let the work lead me, but I would love to do some type of fellowship that was focused on like a larger scale problem that was dealing with digital access or design equity somewhere.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
So my personal website, christinaharrington.me, although it&#8217;s not, I mean, that flashy, it&#8217;s somewhat updated of like my travel and where I&#8217;m speaking, my research project, the papers that I&#8217;ve published and things like that. You can always follow me on Twitter @adapperprof. I&#8217;m always ranting about academia, design, The Real Housewives of Potomac, rest, productivity. I have pages on LinkedIn and stuff like that. I don&#8217;t use them as much, but I&#8217;d say that those are the two places.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Christina Harrington, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I know when we first met, actually it was a few years ago, we met at black and design, which they are having again this year. So I think by the time this episode comes out, people will start hearing some of the advertisements around the events. That&#8217;ll be happening in October, again, virtually this year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It was just so good to talk with you and to learn about the work that you&#8217;re doing around design equity, your new role at Carnegie Mellon. I just feel like we&#8217;re going to hear so much more from you in these coming years about the work that you&#8217;re doing, because it&#8217;s really super important. I think now that so much of our world has been driven online because of the pandemic in terms of interactions and just general socialization that a lot of the work you&#8217;re doing around design equity and stuff like that is going to be super important. Thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christina N. Harrington:</b><br>
Thank you so much for having me. This is really exciting.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re really in for a great conversation this week! Sela Lewis described herself to me as &#8220;a designer who writes&#8221;, but I think it&#8217;s better to describe her as a designer who thinks. Whether she&#8217;s expressing herself through her blog or taking on lofty design projects, Sela is always figuring out how her design skills can exist in multiple spaces to make the best impact on the world.</p>
<p>We started off with her current work at Education Trust, and from there dove into a number of topics: Black women and creativity, NYC design culture vs. DC design culture, how travel has shaped her design thinking, and a lot more. We even talk a little about the current season of network and cable television! Sela says that designers should always make themselves a part of the deeper conversation, and I think this episode is a great example of that. </p>
