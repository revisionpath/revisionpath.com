Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>We&#8217;re exploring the intersections of design, music, and social impact with this week&#8217;s guest, Sam Viotty. Not only is Sam an extremely knowledgeable program and experience designer, but she&#8217;s also the co-owner of a record label and <a href="https://www.luc.edu/baumhartcenter/bios/samviotty/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">she&#8217;s an adjunct professor at Loyola&#8217;s Quinlan School of Business</a>. And that&#8217;s just scratching the surface!</p>
<p>We started off by defining program design and experience design, and from there Sam talked about her label, <a href="https://www.rosedalecollective.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Rosedale Collective</a>, and her dedication to showcasing BIPOC voices in country music. She also dove into her previous work at The Obama Foundation, and how that opened her world to the importance of design in project management and social innovation (and for starting her own company, Viotty Design Studio). Sam even talked a bit about her current role at Adobe, and shared her plans on what she hopes to accomplish in the near future.</p>
<p>Sam&#8217;s career is a lesson in how we can all reshape our perspective on the conventional borders of design &#8212; something important to learn in this ever-changing world!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m Sam Viotty. I&#8217;m a program and experience designer, a creative at heart, and someone who really just loves design all things design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Just before we really kind of get into the conversation, I&#8217;d love for you to explain just off the top, like, what does experience design and program design mean to you? And the reason I&#8217;m asking this is because oftentimes and we&#8217;ll, I think, get to this later in our conversation oftentimes when people think of design, they&#8217;ll only think UI/UX, visual type of thing. What does experience design and program design mean to you?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I think a lot of the time when I say program design, people are like, you design computer programs? I&#8217;m like, no, not that kind of design. Or they&#8217;re like interior design. And so program and experience design really to me is thinking about service and experiences for people. It really is people design in how I see it. So when we&#8217;re designing the ways that people interact with one another, build relationships, operate in the world professionally, develop themselves, that&#8217;s how I see program design. So really designing programs and experiences that people go through and then experience design, I think is a little bit more broad than program design. So it includes program design, but also thinking about events and experiences and things that people kind of experiencing go through. So events, conferences, those types of things, all thinking about not just what people are going experiencing, but seeing, smelling what they&#8217;re taking away.</p>
<p>A lot of it is like learning. So overall experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So it&#8217;s kind of like an encompassing it&#8217;s funny you mentioned event because that&#8217;s really sort of something that indulges or can indulge all of your senses. What you see, the swag you pick up, any sort of beverages or drinks or food or anything like all of that kind of can fall into the realm of experience, design, it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Correct? Yeah, absolutely right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>How have things been going for you this year?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a busy year. I was traveling a lot. I took on just, like, really trying to spend a lot of time thinking about what is my life outside of my professional work. I live in Los Angeles, so I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time outdoors. Started hiking this year. Yeah, I just really trying to absorb a lot of the outdoors now that I live in a warm climate. I grew up on the East Coast, and so it&#8217;s really nice to spend more time outdoors more times during the year. And I feel like it&#8217;s definitely ignited my creativity in a way that it hasn&#8217;t before.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m really excited about that. So, yeah, spending lots of time outdoors reading, trying to figure out this has been an exploratory year, and I think next year will be more of the taking action on those exploratory ideas. But I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about I&#8217;ve always thought of myself as a designer and a creative and an artist, but recently have more thought about myself as being a curator. So really trying to dive into what that means.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And also, I should say congratulations are in order. I was doing my research, and I saw you were recently selected to participate in something called the 2023 Keychange US Talent Development Program. So congratulations on that.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Thank you so much. Really excited about it. It kicked off at the beginning of October with a cohort of 25 really incredible human beings. It made my heart really warm to spend, like, three days with all of them started in October and it ends in March. So I&#8217;m really at the beginning of the program right now, and so far we&#8217;ve only had a few interactions, so one in person and two virtual events together. And I already feel like I&#8217;m a part of a community, which is why I applied. I was really excited about being a part of a larger music and artist creative community in Los Angeles. But it&#8217;s a Los Angeles, New York and Nashville based program, so we&#8217;re also the first US cohort.</p>
<p>So I love being a part of a pilot program. We&#8217;ll probably get into this later, but yeah, I&#8217;ve been a part of a lot of pilot first time programs, which really is exciting to me to kind of lay the groundwork for what&#8217;s to come. It&#8217;s been really fun. We&#8217;ve spent time working together. We went to Joshua Tree Music Festival together. I&#8217;ve never gone to a music festival for work before as fun, so that was amazing. Yeah. Being a professional at a music festival is interesting.</p>
<p>It was really so four of the participants in the program also performed, and it was the first time I got to see them perform. So just seeing the people who are your peers do their thing on stage was just like a proud mom sitting in the audience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>So, yeah, it&#8217;s a really beautiful community that they&#8217;ve built.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And now you said it&#8217;s the first US based cohort. Is it normally international?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>It sounds like yeah, it&#8217;s an EU funded program, so they mostly do projects in Europe, and so this is the first time they&#8217;re doing a cohort in the United States, which is exciting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And now what will you be doing as part of the program? Is this affiliated with some of your other work?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>It is. So I applied as an innovator. So it&#8217;s twelve innovators and 13 musicians or artists who come together to work just professionally develop. So really thinking about what is your career? I&#8217;m the co-founder of a small indie music accelerator and label focused on uplifting the voices of people of color in country, folk and Americana music. We&#8217;re expanding to other genres of music. So think like genres that you don&#8217;t normally see people of color on the charts. We&#8217;re helping amplify those. I applied thinking, how incredible would it be to be a part of a cohort of people who are working towards similar things, trying to achieve equity in the music space, trying to change the music industry.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working in the music industry for a few years now, and it&#8217;s very interesting. It is unlike any industry that I&#8217;ve ever worked in. I used to work in nonprofit, I moved to the private sector. But music feels very different. And living in Los Angeles, on any Wednesday, you&#8217;ll go grab lunch and you&#8217;re like, Why is it crowded? Because everyone&#8217;s having a lunch work meeting within a different culture than I&#8217;ve ever experienced. Yeah, it&#8217;s very different. I applied thinking, how do I build my music community and work alongside other musicians and innovators to change how the music industry operates. A lot of the label is called Rosedale Collective.</p>
<p>We really often think about how do we change the way that artists are treated and supported and how do they have ownership, in particular, Black and brown people having ownership over the work that they create. So how do we revision no pun intended, actually, how do we revision a way forward for how artists create work and work with labels? And so we&#8217;ve designed a residency program that is a year long. We&#8217;ve done a few that are shorter. We have not launched our long term, one year long program yet, but we&#8217;re working on that. But the long term vision is you support a cohort of artists throughout a year. You pay them a salary and they get to focus on making the art. And then instead of owning the It or the masters to the work that the artists create, we revenue share throughout across all of the different categories that an artist to make money. So through merch and royalties on streaming and touring.</p>
<p>So we split those and instead of just outright owning the work, an artist gets to keep ownership. So we&#8217;re really trying to rethink how the industry makes money with artists, and right now they&#8217;re making money off of artists. So we&#8217;re like, how do we make money with you instead of off of you?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>First off, that is a fascinating model. I mean, I think there&#8217;s no shortage of horror stories about musicians getting shafted in some way by the music industry or taken advantage of or something. So I love that you sort of have this revenue share thing and then also the fact that the focus is on a genre of music. I know you said you want to expand it, but you&#8217;re focusing right now on country music, which, again, is probably not seen as very super diverse. Like, I can probably count the number of Black country artists. There&#8217;s more now than when I was a kid. I&#8217;ll say that in terms of visibility, but yeah, that&#8217;s such an awesome I mean, I feel like there&#8217;s a great story behind even the fact that you co own a record label. That is amazing.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fun, actually. I met my co-founders at a conference in DC while I was working at the Obama Foundation. We got tickets to A Day of Healing and Restorative Justice. And so I was like, I&#8217;d love to not go into the office today. I&#8217;d rather be at a conference. And so met these people who are working at the intersection of social impact and entertainment. And I was like, this is such a cool job. You just get to use celebrity money to change the world.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s awesome. I was 25 then, so I was still doe-eyed and excited&#8230;a little jaded now. So I was very excited about that. And so I kept in contact with the people who were working there, and they reached out to me in 2020 about starting a record label and thinking about designing programs for people of color in the country music space. And so I was like, I don&#8217;t know a ton about country music. I know a little Shania Twain, but I do know that it feels pretty racist and so that I can get behind challenging that. And so how do we really think about what music would look like and how it would be different if Black people or people of color kind of were at the forefront? So country music was made by people of color. And so Charley Pride is one of our people that we look up to.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, how do we just reclaim a genre that really was made by Black people? And now the face of country music is not a Black person, not in the United States and not on the top charts. So how do we reclaim that? So we spent a lot of time thinking about narrative change and really redesigning the system of the music industry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, I feel like there&#8217;s a lot that has to go behind designing a label. I mean, of course you think of general things like album art and logos and things of that nature, but the design and business of putting something like that together, that seems like such a huge undertaking.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to be honest, I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing. I still don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing. And I think it actually has been really beneficial that I stepped into the music industry not knowing how the music industry works, because I&#8217;ve just been doing what I think makes sense, and that doesn&#8217;t necessarily align with what actually happens. And so I&#8217;m like, yeah, I think artists should own their work. And people are like, well, it doesn&#8217;t really work that way because we don&#8217;t make a profit. I&#8217;m like, well, that doesn&#8217;t make sense. We could figure out a way to make money while also letting people own things that they make. So let&#8217;s just design that.</p>
<p>I very lucky. My co-founder is an incredible&#8230;I don&#8217;t think he would consider himself a designer, but he designed our logo, and I think it&#8217;s genius. It&#8217;s a circle that has lines going through it and it&#8217;s the middle of a guitar. It&#8217;s a really amazing logo. I&#8217;m very proud of the logo. So we put it on everything. I wear a sweatshirt. I have a hat. Stickers.</p>
<p>And so thinking about how do we take symbols of country music and redefine them? Because I think right now people think country music. I think or before this, I used to think cowboy hat, cowboy shoots, cowboy boots. So what are the symbols of country music? And what are the symbols of country music for people of color. The guitar is one of them. We work with some other organizations who really like to uplift Black and brown artists. One of them is Black Opry, and so their logo is also a guitar. So just thinking about the symbols and iconography for black country music has been really exciting because I think it&#8217;s a different language. Like, we&#8217;re speaking a different language to a different audience.</p>
<p>And so I spent a lot of my time in undergrad thinking about symbols and iconography. And so it was exciting to bring that piece to the label. And thinking about a label, it&#8217;s like developing a brand. We developed a brand before we did anything. We came up with colors and a logo and a design and a deck. And so so much of it was like, how do we communicate who we are and what we do before we&#8217;ve even done anything? Which lots of conversations, lots of talking to people before we did a single thing, we did a listening and learning tour where we talked to tens of musicians, like 100 music execs and people in the music industry and in the nonprofit space trying to change things, social impact people. So just spend a lot of time talking to people to be like, what are people looking at? What do people feel and how do we communicate what we&#8217;re trying to communicate? And who is our audience, actually? So goes into a lot of the design work. When I went to grad school, I went to grad school at Emerson in a pilot program.</p>
<p>It was called Civic Media Art and Practice. And so that&#8217;s where I learned about design thinking. And so I&#8217;ve brought design thinking into ever since I&#8217;ve learned about it, I&#8217;ve brought it into every single job. And so I think when I don&#8217;t know what to do, I just rely on that process. I&#8217;m like, it&#8217;ll be good, we&#8217;ll just figure out how. It&#8217;s like the scientific method. I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t know how to get an answer, but if we just use this process, I can get us to figuring out how we get an answer. We did a lot of that.</p>
<p>And so that first stage of talking and listening to people is very similar to the empathy stage and the design thinking process.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I say that all the time to people about how design thinking is very much like the scientific method. So I&#8217;m glad that we see eye to eye on that.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I explained it like that. I&#8217;m like, it&#8217;s the same thing. People just yeah, anthropologists looked at it and I guess the design school looked at it and then rebrand it&#8217;s all branding. They rebranded it, but it&#8217;s the same thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I think what you&#8217;re doing with one, shining a light on country music and also promoting and uplifting artists, BIPOC artists, et cetera, in country is great because I grew up as a musician. I grew up as a jazz musician mostly, but there was one thing about like and this might be a bit of a stretch, so if it is, please let me know. But I feel like a lot of could do really well as contemporary country songs. I feel like there&#8217;s a thin line between Toni Braxton and that being a country song. I&#8217;m thinking love should have like &#8220;Love Shoulda Brought You Home&#8221; could totally be a country song.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>I absolutely could be a country song. We used to jokingly make a criteria checklist for what is a country song. One was like, is it about love or heartbreak? Check. Does it have a Twang check? I think you&#8217;re right. The only thing missing from the twang, like, if they all had a twang, they would absolutely be country.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yes. A lot of, like, Anita Baker songs could definitely also sound like country songs. She has like, a slight Twang. But I get what you mean though. There is sort of a checklist of like, is it heartbreak? Is it lament in some capacity then it could totally be a country song. Now, we talked about Rosedale, but also you have another job where you work for Adobe. Can you talk a little bit about what you do there?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, that is really exciting. I spend most of my time working at Adobe now. It&#8217;s one of those companies that when you&#8217;re young and in college and you think about design and education and what&#8217;s the coolest job you could have. It is the job I have now. And I think that&#8217;s incredible. College me would be very proud. So right now, I lead all of Adobe&#8217;s higher education professional development. So training programs for faculty and students in higher education in the United States.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re expanding to the United Kingdom and Australia. Starting to think globally about what does it mean and what are the skills that a 21st century college graduate needs in order to operate in the world. Adobe is notorious for being extremely challenging, having a high learning, a very difficult learning curve and being quite know one financially. And also, just like, the tools are complicated and there are a lot of them. Adobe has launched something called Adobe Express, which is the kind of premier product that I work on and work with schools to use. So think of the rival Canva as&#8230;Canva was a response to Adobe being really difficult. Adobe Express is a response to that. And so it&#8217;s an incredible tool.</p>
<p>I think the thing that&#8217;s exciting about Adobe Express is it has the generative AI in it, which is really helpful now and interesting, brings a conversation about ethics and IP and copyright, which Adobe is big on, especially because we&#8217;ve been working with artists and illustrators and graphic designers for ages. I spend a lot of my time helping faculty and schools and instructional designers think about what does it need to be a digitally fluent individual? And so how do you redesign your curriculum so that students are getting the skills that they need to be successful beyond college. So instead of maybe writing that ten page paper, what does it look like to help a student create an assignment that is actually a video storytelling project or create a podcast instead of the paper? So what is the alternative to the typical research paper? Because in my personal job, I am not writing research paper long things anymore. I am doing research and then applying it to a project. And so how do we do a little bit more project based learning at the higher ed level? I think a lot of K Twelve and high schools have taken this on, which is incredible. But I think the project based learning often happens either in really vocational or technical student projects. So if you&#8217;re in a graphic design class or create this poster or create a project for a client, those things happen. But in the kind of social sciences and English classes that&#8217;s not really happening.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still pretty static and it&#8217;s like write a paper to respond to this. And I&#8217;m like, the world that we live in now doesn&#8217;t really do that. So how do we change how we&#8217;re thinking about it? And how do we cultivate the skills that people need? Creating presentations, marketing on social media, creating posters, creating graphics like everyone video and short form storytelling. Short form video is the primary way that people communicate now. They cannot scroll on any social media without seeing video. How do we cultivate those skills to make sure that students are signed up for success? So I spent a lot of my time doing that, which is really cool because I was really interested. I started my career in education and then I also just have always had this passion for being creative and working with creatives and just thinking about arts and culture. And so I feel like I get to bring those worlds together in my role at Adobe.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now that is fascinating. You&#8217;re designing education or you&#8217;re designing the way that people are learning about these new tools and these new methods. And I&#8217;m curious, does that work and the work you do with Rosedale collectors, does that bleed into each other in any way? It feels like that could be a lot to possibly try to balance it.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Is it&#8217;s like, you know, corporate world and also working at a small indie, but I sit in between the education team and the marketing team. And so I&#8217;ve learned so much about corporate marketing through working at Adobe, which as an Indie label and accelerator, we have the finances to play small. But I&#8217;m like how do we play big? Because that&#8217;s how the music industry works. There&#8217;s so much like everyone&#8217;s a musician, everyone can be right. And so how do you get the people that you want to bubble to the top? And it&#8217;s marketing. I was talking about those interviews earlier and we talked to so many artists, and I&#8217;d say, what do you need help with? What&#8217;s your biggest struggle right now? It is not songwriting. It is not making the music. It is not finding a producer.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t even touring. It is marketing. They&#8217;re like, how do I get someone to hear my music? It&#8217;s marketing and distribution. And so I&#8217;ve learned a lot about marketing and distribution in this corporate role and seeing how that plays out and being able to say, okay, if that&#8217;s true here, how do we apply it to how do we use some of these strategies for our artists and teach them how to do it for themselves? And so I see my role in both of them as I&#8217;m professionally developing people. They&#8217;re just different. But coincidentally, the artists that I work with are about the same age as the students who faculty are working with. I have a similar audience. Like, how do I prepare these 18 to 25 year olds with 21st century skills to be successful in the world to either market themselves, market the things that they&#8217;re working on, and really tell stories?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, I think what you&#8217;re doing is just such extremely important work because I think what we&#8217;ve definitely seen over the past few years is that our systems are changing. I mean, definitely with the advent of AI and things, we&#8217;re seeing how that&#8217;s been affecting certain industries. But even like you said, with marketing and getting content out there, it&#8217;s even weird to call it old school. But the old school ways, which we knew about how to market things and how to learn things are changing. And a lot of that is due to technology. So I think you being at the forefront of that, particularly with sitting kind of between marketing and education teams, that sounds like a dream. I mean, I&#8217;m speaking for myself, but that sounds like a dream job to have.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Again, I think college undergrad me would be like, if someone asked me what job I wanted, it would be this one. And so I&#8217;m excited about that. The other thing that I just so excited about is generative AI. I know that it&#8217;s a hot topic, but working at Adobe and seeing just, like, how these tools have allowed people to make things that they wouldn&#8217;t have created before, same. Like, I also am an illustrator. Not a great one, but it&#8217;s my hobby. It has enabled me to create things that I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to create before.</p>
<p>And not in a plagiarism way, but I&#8217;m like removing the background from something. Used to take ages in Photoshop. Now in Adobe Express, it&#8217;s a like, it has saved me time. Technology is catching up with how quickly and how fast the world is. Like, things happen and then it is online in seconds, and the tools are starting to catch up to that. So I&#8217;ve been really excited about how do we leverage those tools to ignite creativity because I&#8217;m someone who procrastinates, and I also get really stuck. I think generative AI has helped me get unstuck as a brainstorming. Like, you know, let me just pop it in and see what I can start with.</p>
<p>Whereas before, I kind of just sit and wait and then never do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Just recently we had Andre Foster on the show and he has a motion graphics company in Detroit called First Fight and he talks about how he uses generative AI, kind of in the same way that you mentioned it. He uses it like a I think he likened it to a Pinterest board or a mood board where it&#8217;s a good place to sort of just take the idea from your head and start to instantly visualize it, to see where you could possibly go next with it.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Love that. I totally agree with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, you talked about growing up on the East Coast, so I would like to kind of shift the conversation towards that and learn more about just sort of how you got to where you are now. So you grew up on the East Coast. Were you kind of always exposed to a lot of art and creativity and such growing up?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. I grew up in New York City, so every field trip was to a museum. When I was in school. I also had parents who were really excited about the arts. My mother was a dancer, just really excited about performance arts. And with my grandmother and then my dad and my dad&#8217;s mother. My dad&#8217;s mother was a teacher. I was excited about reading as a kid.</p>
<p>He spent so much time at the library. I used to pick out books, and very often I would pick books based on their covers in contrary to what you&#8217;re told. I was like, if it looks cool on the outside, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s cool on the inside. And so I was just really excited about that. I used to draw a lot. Like, the Christmas gifts that I used to get as a kid was like, I don&#8217;t know if you remember those. Really big. I hope they still make them.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t seen them in a while, but it&#8217;s like pastel crayons paint.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, yeah, those 130 piece art kits or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yes. And they&#8217;d have a bunch of pencils, and I never used to use they had, like, four types of pencils, and I was like, I don&#8217;t know what anyone&#8217;s doing with this. I like the color, so I used to get those every year. I&#8217;d ask for a new one. I didn&#8217;t always need a new one, but, yeah, I used to run the cray pods down to the bone, and so I used to play with those all the time. And so I&#8217;d, like, draw pictures of our family, draw pictures of the sky, draw pictures of the books that I&#8217;d read. Spent a lot of time drawing and. Creating.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like, do cutouts. I used to play with paper dolls all the time, just always thinking about what I can now see in retrospect is design. And my dad, who just was so proud of me, used to, in our basement, created kind of like a little curatorial gallery of my work on a string through the basement. So anytime I came down or people came down, it felt like a gallery show. And so I always loved museums and art. Yeah, my art was all over the house. Like, it was on the fridge, it was on the walls, it was upstairs. And so I was really encouraged to express my creativity.</p>
<p>My dad was a computer nerd, and so he tried to teach me computer programming when I was younger. I think it was called Logo?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Logo, with the turtle!</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yes, with the turtle! So my dad was&#8230;yes, he tried to teach me that. I hated it. I was like, this is so boring. I can&#8217;t stand this. He&#8217;s like, but you can create art with it.</p>
<p>I was just, I&#8217;m not interested. I really regret it. I wish I became a computer scientist, but I just constantly encouraged. I used to use the Paint app on Microsoft and on, you know, all kids, but I was really into just, like, creating, and I was really encouraged to create, which I&#8217;m so grateful for now. I think my parents really let me explore, at least when I was a child. This changes a bit when I get older, but while I was a child, in my adolescence, I was very much encouraged to paint, create, make things get messy, do whatever, and explore my creativity, whether it was, like making my own clothes, designing clothes, designing paper, making notebooks, writing stories, like, anything. And I think that I brought a lot of that into how I kind of exist now and explore my creativity now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Did that shift happen in high school?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yang it did. And I think it&#8217;s funny that, you know, that I was not encouraged to explore art when I was in high school. I remember I liked our art class, and I did quite well. My dad was excited, so my mom passed away when I was six. So a little hard. My dad had to take on being a single parent and then remarried. My parents were divorced at the time, so it wasn&#8217;t like that stark of they&#8217;re dating someone else difference. But I was close to the woman who is now my stepmother, who I&#8217;m very close with and who helped raise me.</p>
<p>She was a nurse, and so registered nurse. And so just like a very practical human in a way that maybe my dad and I were not. And so she&#8217;s like, you need a practical job. Need you to get a practical skills, like, what are we doing? Which I think she&#8217;s brought the logic to my creativity, which is wonderful. But once I got to high school, I was not discouraged from taking art classes, but it was like, well, then what are you going to do? I used to use my room as a curatorial space. I&#8217;d buy as many magazines as I could, and then my walls were completely covered with images, and I just would always do that. I&#8217;d look at font type and ads. I was like, how do I create this? And I wanted to go into advertising and market and communications, but my parents were just like, maybe I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>My dad was like, Please go into science. I was like, I&#8217;m really not good at physics. And my mom was like, Please do something practical. And so I was kind of, like, torn. And all I really wanted to do was change the world. Then I just became privy. I went to a predominantly Asian school in New York City. So 50% of the population was Asian, maybe 20% was white, and then the rest was, like, Black and Latino.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, maybe Southeast Asian. It was a very interesting mix, but just was starting to become more privy to racism, I think. Growing up in New York City, I&#8217;d always thought in high school, thought, I&#8217;d go to such a diverse school, I&#8217;ve gone to diverse schools, everything&#8217;s fine, and then realizing the world just doesn&#8217;t operate in the ways that it should. Extreme poverty exists. I want to work in that. How do I do that? And my parents were not excited that they were proud of me, but they were not excited about that career path. My mom&#8217;s like, you want to go into nonprofit, you&#8217;re not going to make any money. And so I ignored them and went to college.</p>
<p>So I went to college at Wheaton College in Massachusetts. Small liberal arts college, about 1600 students. So very small campus was like, you could run around it. I couldn&#8217;t even really get my laps off when I go for a run because it was only a mile and barely. So it&#8217;s a very small campus. And so I was like, I&#8217;m just going to major in English. I wanted to go into marketing, communications, but small liberal arts college only had English as a major. I was like, Seems close enough.</p>
<p>I major in English. My parents are like, sounds fine. It seems like a scale. Great. And I start applying to internships, and I&#8217;m not getting anything. Like, absolutely nothing. I&#8217;m like, I can write things. This seems practical.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on? But I was applying to things that were a little bit more creative, a little bit more ad comms marketing, and I think they were, like, looking for someone who was in that. My junior year, there&#8217;s a new major called Film and New Media Studies, and so it sat within the English department, and so I could take film classes as an English major, and so I did. And the first class I took was race and racism in U.S. cinema. Blew my mind, was excited. I was like, this is all I want to do forever. I need to change my major right now. I know I&#8217;m getting ready to graduate, but I have to.</p>
<p>And I also need to study abroad. So how do I make it happen? My professor and advisor at the time. Incredible. Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to do. You&#8217;re going to switch your major. You&#8217;re just going to change it, and you&#8217;re going to go to Australia because that&#8217;s where they have a mutual program. And you&#8217;ll study film and graphic design there. You&#8217;ll make up your freshman credit for the major, and then you&#8217;ll come back and you&#8217;ll finish the credits and you&#8217;ll graduate on time.</p>
<p>I was like, great. Sounds lovely. I changed my major to New Media Film and New Media Studies on my resume before even changing it formally on paper. And all of a sudden I&#8217;m getting responses back on internships. People are so happy to talk to you. This is ridiculous. And that to me, is the epitome of that&#8217;s. The power of branding and marketing.</p>
<p>Yeah, pursued that. I was excited about Film and New Media Studies. I didn&#8217;t love actually being behind the camera. I was like a senior in freshman classes in Film Production 101, learning about Aperture. I was like, I don&#8217;t want to do this. This is not fun for me. I was like, Can I just tell someone what to do? Isn&#8217;t that a thing? And someone&#8217;s like, oh, you want to be a director? Yes, exactly. So, yeah, I moved a little bit away from technical film and really loved the theory and things like that.</p>
<p>And so I was able to explore ideas of concepts of social justice and equity and race and representation through that studies and then took that into my hope. I was hoping to take it into my professional career, which I did, which quite different as my first job, which was I was helping first generation college students get into college when I first graduated, which there&#8217;s more similarities than I thought. I was really excited about that role, and I wrote a lot. I helped every single student tell their story, writing college essays. I reviewed lots of college essays, lots of supplemental essays. They ended up being more connected than I thought they would be. But yeah, I did not go into a Film and New Media Studies advertising role right after college like I wanted to. But I think supporting students to get into college was really an impactful, one that led me to the career that I have now in education.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, I feel like, and I&#8217;ve said this on the show also before college is really that time for you to experiment and explore exactly what it is that you want to do. And I think it&#8217;s specifically for the reasons that it sounds like your parents didn&#8217;t want you to go into some specific field. I mean, K through twelve, we&#8217;re kind of booked or we&#8217;re sort of subconsciously shaped and molded into a particular trajectory that we may not even want, we may not even want to do. I know for me, when I was growing up, I really wanted to write and I wanted to major in English, and my mom was like, no, you stay on that computer. You&#8217;re going to do something with that computer. Like, you&#8217;re going to major in something with that. And I liked web design, but I also went to a small liberal arts college, and this was in the oh, my God, I&#8217;m dating myself. This is in the they didn&#8217;t have web design, so I was like, oh, I&#8217;m going to be a computer science major.</p>
<p>And that was not web design back then. I mean, we&#8217;re talking 1999, 2000. That was not web design. That curriculum did not exist. You learned it on your own, and you just kind of hoped to make a way for it. It wasn&#8217;t something you went to school for. But I say all of that to say college is really that time where you&#8217;re able to branch out and see where your interests take you. I mean, there&#8217;s very few places outside of that particular type of institution where you&#8217;re allowed to explore and play and do different things, and it won&#8217;t have a detriment on your status as a human in this capitalist world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Totally. And I wish I knew it. I guess I felt it then that that&#8217;s what it was for. My parents were like, the tuition money four years, so explore all you want within that amount of time. So I felt like there was a ticking time bomb. And I was one of those kids who was like, I literally cannot go back home after college. I can&#8217;t live my parents. I am an only child who is just constantly being helicoptered.</p>
<p>I need to live elsewhere for all of us, for everybody. And so I really need a job. I need a job that pays me enough to leave. And so, yeah, I moved to Boston. So my school&#8217;s in Massachusetts. I ended up moving to Boston right after college and lived there for quite a bit. But yeah, college was an interesting time, and I loved school. I was one of those kids who loved school.</p>
<p>When I was younger, I looked forward to going to school. I think part of it was being an only child, because I make all these designs and stuff, and the only person looking at them was my dad or friends who came over occasionally. So I was so excited to go to school and get affirmation from teachers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I 100% know what that&#8217;s like. I mean, I wasn&#8217;t the only child. I had an older brother. But yeah, to get that sort of validation that the work that you&#8217;re doing means something, it&#8217;s actually making an impression on other people. I was very much. Oh, yeah. Especially in college. I was very much like a school kid.</p>
<p>Like, I did not want to go back to Alabama. I&#8217;m like, we have to make it out. I don&#8217;t know what that looks like, but we got to get out. We can&#8217;t go backwards. Now. In 2017, you started working at the Obama Foundation, and you sort of touched on some of your early career things that you did right after Wheaton. How was your time at the Obama Foundation? Like, how did you sort of start there?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>That was like I remember getting my offer verbally, and I just was stunned. I was like, I cannot believe I&#8217;m about to work for the person who was the first Black president of the United States. It meant so much to me. I think it was after he was in the presidency, so he made a foundation really focused on organizing community work for young people. I worked on the education team at the Obama Foundation, which, again, mixing education with what I was excited to end, like, changing the world. I was like, my goodness, dream job. And it&#8217;s so, like, at every stage that I&#8217;ve had a job, it&#8217;s been like a dream job only. And now I&#8217;m in a job that I also think is my dream job.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m like, what will I think years later when I have another job? Anyway, it was incredible. I have made the closest friends I&#8217;ve ever made. It was an interesting time. I think a lot of I never worked on a campaign before, but I imagine some of the campaign culture had seeped into our workplace. And so all of us were very close, spent a lot of time together trying to work towards the goal of empowering 18 to 25 year olds to change their worlds and their communities. I loved it. It was incredible. I was hired as an experienced designer, so thinking about our program, so the education team had one program at the time.</p>
<p>I was there for a few years, and so we developed more programs, but the original program was like a one day experience for 150 18 to 25 year olds in Boston, Chicago, and Phoenix, Arizona. And so we went to each city, and we work with community organizations. We&#8217;d work with designers and organizers to really fire up these 18 to 25 year olds, get them passionate about the thing that they were excited about. So we&#8217;re like, what aren&#8217;t you passionate about? What do you care about? And how can we drive you to a plan of action to organize towards that? And so I saw my role as one just understanding our audience. So I spent so much time talking to the 18 to 25 year olds that we worked with. I set up design workshops. I would work with them. So I used a lot of my design thinking stuff from grad school that I learned and would go through that with them.</p>
<p>I taught a lot of our design thinking sessions, so I go from city to city just going through project based learning and talking about, how do we like, well, if this is what you care about, how do we develop a plan for that? How do you understand them? Who is your audience? A lot of 18 to 25 year olds are like, I want to end poverty. And I&#8217;m like, yes, where do we start? Like, poverty, poverty where? And so that was really exciting for me, and it was really impactful. I can still remember the day that we brought President Obama to meet all of the students who had been in the program. Not students, community members who had been in the program. And it was just, like, the most joyful I&#8217;ve ever seen. People are crying. They&#8217;re, like, falling down. He decides to shake every single one of their hands.</p>
<p>He was supposed to be going to a meeting with donors, and we were scheduling him to just take a photo. He was supposed to come and take a photo with the group. We&#8217;re very excited about that, that he was going to be able to do that. But he is supposed to be rushing to a donor meeting. He was already late. He was late to come get us for the photo. He finds out that he&#8217;s late to the donor meeting and is like, oh, well, and just stands there and shakes 350 hands. And so I&#8217;m so happy I got to witness that.</p>
<p>And so that was the power of his brand. I was so lucky to be able to I felt like I could walk into any room and just be listened to because of who we were representing and the power that that had for people in many communities across the united States. It just symbolized change. It symbolized hope. And I&#8217;d never been a part of a brand like that. I&#8217;d worked at many nonprofits, but obviously nothing like that. And so that experience is yeah, I loved working there. I met so many incredible people, so many smart people who have worked and lived all over, had different experiences, but everyone came together for this one central mission, which was to empower people.</p>
<p>To change the world is absolutely incredible. I think about that experience very often.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, if there&#8217;s any brand that could get you probably in the foot of any company, it would be Obama. I mean, God, that has been such an amazing experience to be able to do that kind of work. I think you kind of alluded to this a little bit earlier when you said, like, making I wrote it down. You said something about using celebrity money to change the world. That is awesome.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it was so great. And the other thing that I was able to do was, because I was our experience designer and helping to design our program, I got to choose who we put on so or who we got to put on a platform. And I was so excited about that. I was like, this is it. I get to choose the people of color that I want to be on stage or the people who I think are making a difference. I can get to curate that experience. So lucky. I&#8217;ve worked with Antionette Carroll and Chris Rudd, who have also been on this show, who were a part of that amazing program that we ran over the course of a few years.</p>
<p>So just really excited to be able to give opportunities to people who really deserve one recognition, the amplification, and just, like, the connection with the community that we really thought they were already doing but wanted to uplift them. So absolutely incredible. Got to work with a ton of designers and creators because I was working in that space, and you send an email with Obama.org attached to it, and people responded, which was, you know, there&#8217;s.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>A saying that you can&#8217;t be what you don&#8217;t see. And I can only imagine, because you had that level of access that it probably opened up for you a lot of possibilities of what you could do personally out in the world. I know while you were at the Obama Foundation, you started your own design studio, via studio. Did that sort of come from that time of seeing what was possible because of the Obama Foundation?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>It did. I didn&#8217;t know how much money existed in the world until I worked. Mean, like, talking to donors and who you have access to and who responds and what people are willing to do, and how many people of color I&#8217;d seen and worked with who started their own companies. So many of the designers that we worked with ran their own design firms. And I was like, oh, I can see how it&#8217;s possible. I had never thought of it before. I knew I wanted to start something when I was younger, but I didn&#8217;t know what. And so I started doing design consulting, so designing programs and giving design thinking advice and doing design sprints and workshops for other companies and nonprofits at the time.</p>
<p>But, yeah, I was so inspired by all the work that I was doing with other people. I was like, well, if you&#8217;re doing it, I think I might be able to do this, which is really exciting. And I had help. I mean, the connections that I made at the Obama Foundation and the people and the designers that I spoke, like, I don&#8217;t think people were trying to gatekeep at all, which I thought was really beautiful. People were like, I mean, I work with them. You should totally work with them. Let me just make an intro, which I had not experienced before. I think a lot of nonprofits that I worked with before that were gatekeeping, and I understand why.</p>
<p>It was like, well, if I tell this company or this grant about you. Will we get the money next year, right? So it was a lot of, like, I want to keep things to myself, but it was not like that at all. I was like, this is amazing. So everyone wanted to help each other, and so I was able to make connections and get clients pretty quickly. And a lot of them came from I think all of my first clients are Obama Foundation related.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow, that&#8217;s amazing. That&#8217;s amazing. Now, you were there for a number of years, and then afterwards you left and you went to work for a biotech startup, Curative. When you look back at that time, what do you remember? Because I could imagine it&#8217;s probably a lot different from nonprofit work, especially the Obama Foundation.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>So it was 2020. So the pandemic had hit, and I used to do programs in person at the Obama Foundation. 2020 happened. We&#8217;re doing programs virtually. I just was like, I don&#8217;t know that our programs virtually are doing the same thing that they were when they were in person. And so the world is in a really scary space. I want to be on the ground. And so I got recruited by Curative to lead all of their kind of expansion with communities.</p>
<p>So the job actually when I had that interview with Curative, the woman who hired me actually was in political organizing before that. And she was like, it&#8217;s actually she&#8217;s like, you&#8217;re telling me about your job at the Long Foundation, but she&#8217;s like, I think it&#8217;s really similar. I know it&#8217;s biotech, hear me out. But I think what you&#8217;re doing is, like, partnering and working with communities. We&#8217;re changing health care, and it&#8217;s the same thing, only it&#8217;s healthcare and not community organizing. And I was like, I think you&#8217;re right. So I partnered with community organizations to pop up COVID testing at the time and then vaccinations for communities of color in particular, where they didn&#8217;t have testing and vaccinations. And so I thought that I was like, this feels like a need, right? Like, people are dying.</p>
<p>I want to be of service. And so it was a crazy time. I don&#8217;t understand how I did not get COVID then. This is like, before, people were wearing masks. I was out helping set up test sites without a mask. And then I was wearing a mask, and I was traveling everyone&#8217;s at home, and I am on a plane to New Orleans to set up a test site alone on the plane because obviously no one&#8217;s flying. And I was, like, flying all across the country trying to make sure that people were getting tested. I thankfully, in the year and a half I worked there, never got COVID.</p>
<p>I got COVID last year at a conference. Yeah, literally, just like I was completely fine. But it was a really impactful experience. I got to use my design thinking skills. I did lots of marketing and trying to understand our audience. I worked with a bunch of different types of clients and customers. I worked with city governments. I worked with fire stations.</p>
<p>I worked with federal government. I worked with everyone private sector. I worked with schools. So many schools wanted to go back to in person, but they didn&#8217;t have a testing plan. So I was like, working with each individual school to workshop what will work best for you. And so I used a lot of what I felt like was my design thinking hat to design programs and processes that made the most sense so that people could return, not return to life, but be able to live lives that felt safe enough to live and still benefit. Yeah, it was a really crazy time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, it feels like it&#8217;s a lot of that sort of practical application or continuation. Like the person that hired you said you&#8217;re taking that same energy and that same sort of skill of putting programs together, but you&#8217;re doing it on really kind of a more tactical level in that way, especially during a time when the pandemic affected. I feel like all of us in different ways, but the one thing we all had to do was sort of figure out how to kind of move through it, navigate through it, move forward, especially with information changing a lot. Like you said, pre masks is a time that now is a bit hard to think of because they were so ubiquitous. And I mean, people are kind of still wearing masks now because we&#8217;re kind of still in the pandemic. But in a lot of ways, because of work that people like you have done, we found ways to kind of manage our lives through it, which who knows how long that would have taken if that didn&#8217;t exist or if there weren&#8217;t people like you that were able to make that happen.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Thanks. Yeah, I was able to hire an incredible team. Just could not have done it with a bunch of other people. And it was a wild time, and I learned a lot about healthcare. I used to hate the healthcare system. I still do. But I now understand why there are so many entities designing for healthcare. Now that I&#8217;ve worked in it, I&#8217;m like, it makes sense.</p>
<p>It needs redesigning. It was my first for private sector job, which I was trying to pivot. Like, the Obama Foundation was great, but I was kind of tired of being a nonprofit. I was tired of not having enough money and working really hard all the time and working to the mission, but not getting paid enough. I was like, I think there&#8217;s a way for me to get paid enough and work towards a real goal. Being in the for profit during COVID was very interesting. Healthcare. We&#8217;re trying to save the world, but we&#8217;re also making money.</p>
<p>So a conversation for another day about the healthcare system. But yeah, it helped me understand a little bit more about the way the world works.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And now you&#8217;re doing Rosedale, you&#8217;re doing Adobe. You still have your studio, and you also teach. You are an adjunct lecturer at Loyola&#8217;s Quinlan School of Business. How did that come about?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an incredible am again. So I met two people. One was someone who was one of the first community members in the Obama Foundation program that we ran. Just stayed really close to her. She was one of those people that I called her our super user. She just would do exactly what I would imagine someone would do in our program. She&#8217;s ideal. I could predict her behavior.</p>
<p>It was amazing. And so we stayed in contact. She started working at the Baumhart Scholars Program at the Cleveland School of Business and asked me if I wanted to guest lecture her class, like, come and just talk. So I did. And then there&#8217;s another person who was in the program I did Starting Block, the Starting Block Fellowship a few years ago, probably 2018. More than a few now, but someone else who was a designer also taught another course and was like, hey, could you come to my class too? And so I did. He was getting ready to leave the following year because he got a very cool job at Capital One doing design. And so he left, and they were like, well, we don&#8217;t have anyone to teach class.</p>
<p>Do you want to teach it? I said, I&#8217;d love to teach this class. So it&#8217;s a project management and social innovation class, and it&#8217;s taken a bunch of different iterations. This will be the third year that I&#8217;m teaching it. It actually starts next week. Time for me to start designing the deck. But the incredible thing about the program in particular so the Bomb Harvest Scholars Program is within the School of Business, but it is for a select group of students who really care about social impact. And so a lot of their courses are focused on it. Obviously, you get an MBA, but a lot of courses that you have to take in addition to the MBA requirements are social impact focused.</p>
<p>So the project management course, I&#8217;ve done lots of project management, so I hadn&#8217;t thought about it as like, how do I teach it? I was like, It&#8217;s just something that I do. I&#8217;d gone to trainings for it throughout my career, but had not thought about, how do I teach this and then how do I teach the social impact piece? And so I actually really excited about how this class was taught. I have kind of mapped the class into different sections, and each section is a different aspect of the design thinking process. So it starts with empathy and goes to reflection. I also take the design equity framework. If people aren&#8217;t familiar, it&#8217;s the kind of typical design thinking process. Empathy empathize. Define ideate, prototype iterate, and do it all.</p>
<p>Over again. But I&#8217;ve added kind of equity pauses, which is a term that I learned from another designer, and reflection at every stage. So I talk about doing all of those things within project management because I think that&#8217;s really what project management is. It is like working with people. It&#8217;s understanding people. It&#8217;s trying things and then doing them again, and then trying it and doing it again. And so I&#8217;m really excited about it&#8217;s. A project based class.</p>
<p>Every single person in the course, it&#8217;s usually a small class, but every single person, I encourage them to choose a project that they are working on at work, or they&#8217;re all adult professionals who have jobs and do this MBA mostly on the side. And so they choose a project from work. And then I want you to change something at work or a project that you&#8217;ve always thought about doing, which you have never actually had the time to do. Like, let&#8217;s use this class time because you have to take this class. Let&#8217;s do it now. So people have come up with incredible things. Someone came up with a youth program last year, which I was really excited about. Someone revamped their entire board of directors processes, which I was impressed with.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s on the board of a nonprofit and was like, we just don&#8217;t fundraise right? How do we rethink the fundraising strategy and how do I lead my team through a process? A lot of the work is quite meta, where they&#8217;re redesigning experiences that will be redesigned. So they&#8217;re coming up with a project plan. So I bring a lot of the design thinking aspect to the course in addition to trying to give people practical skills on how do you manage a project, like what tools are we using, are you using Trello? Are you using Monday? Are you using Asana? How are you assigning roles to people? Are you thinking about equity when you&#8217;re deciding roles for people, how do power dynamics come into play? So really intertwining all of those things. And so I&#8217;ve learned so much from all of the students because they all work at different places. Some people are working in consulting, some are working in education, some are working at healthcare nonprofits, and so they all are working together. A lot of it is group work, but the end project is individual. So I hope that they&#8217;re learning from each other about what each other is working on and challenged with. So I love teaching that class.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also not that long. It takes a few months. And so it&#8217;s what I look forward to every end of year. It&#8217;s a nice close out to the year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, it really feels like a perfect way for you to take all of these skills and things that you&#8217;ve learned throughout your career and pass that on to the next generation of, I want to say of innovators. You mentioned at the top of the episode that you had applied for this development program as an innovator, and the more that you talk about your career and the experiences you&#8217;ve went through, I&#8217;m like, I can see it plain as day. Like, you&#8217;re really out here changing minds and hearts. It&#8217;s so awesome.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to hear. I hadn&#8217;t thought about yeah. I guess when you talk to someone and hear it back, it definitely feels different. So thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, I think what&#8217;s probably most interesting about you and your career and what you do is that you take design. And design is such a broad category. I think even when you tell someone you&#8217;re a designer, if you tell five different people, you may get five different definitions of what that even is. I mean, for you, what does design mean? Like, what&#8217;s your personal philosophy? When it comes to that?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>I believe everyone&#8217;s a designer. I also believe it&#8217;s people who want to take on that role. Like, if you want to be a designer, you can be. I think the most important thing about being a designer is understanding who you&#8217;re designing for. Graphic designer, and I someone who is a programmer, experience designer will have. What we have in common is, who are we designing for? The graphic designer is like, I&#8217;m making a poster, or maybe they&#8217;re making a poster, and they&#8217;re like, okay, well, who&#8217;s the poster for? I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m designing a program. Well, who&#8217;s the program for? So really getting to the meat of how do I understand people? And for program design, I think it&#8217;s beautiful because it&#8217;s everything or experience design is everything. What I said earlier was, it&#8217;s what things smell like, what you&#8217;re touching, what you&#8217;re seeing, who you interact with, when you interact with them.</p>
<p>When we show you something, all of those things make an impression. So I think about design as design is everything. Yeah, I look at and now that I&#8217;ve been in so many different sectors, and I know that design means so many different things, I see design in everything. I can&#8217;t open a door without being like, someone made this and thought about how humans will open this door wild. So, yeah, designs and everything. I think it&#8217;s a branding. As I always say. It&#8217;s a branding, marketing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>It sounds like you&#8217;re really interweaving with design, at least with the way that you&#8217;re approaching design. Everything works together. All these processes work together. Nothing is in a vacuum. And I think that&#8217;s really a holistic way to look at design, because for years, people always say designers are problem solvers, but the problems they end up solving tend to be UX problems or browser problems or things like that when there are so many other things out there in the world. You mentioned healthcare. Government is another one. Government services.</p>
<p>There are so many huge systems that we encounter every day that could use that design eye and that design thinking. And so I hope that people listen to this conversation and start to think of design in a bigger way. Like, think outside of just what you see on a monitor or on a phone. Like, think of design in a broader sense.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. Yeah. I think you&#8217;re spot on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What&#8217;s inspiring you these days?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Thank you for asking that. Color. Color has been inspiring me. I started reading. I went to the library and I started reading Color &#8212; I have the book right here: &#8220;Colors for Designers: 95 Things You Need to Know when Choosing and Using Colors for Layouts and Illustrations&#8221;. And I&#8217;ve been having, like, a lull in inspiration, and I never really learned about color theory formally.</p>
<p>And so I&#8217;ve just been so excited about color. I&#8217;ve been going on hikes recently, and so I&#8217;ve been obsessed with the sky. I go on runs, and there&#8217;s a beautiful sunset on Monday, and I counted eleven colors in the sky. I was just like, wow, what eleven different colors? And so I&#8217;m, like, training my eye to see different colors and hues. So I&#8217;ve been really inspired by that. I started reading. I just finished the book &#8220;Stay Inspired&#8221; by Brandon Stosuy&#8230;or Stossai? Finding motivation to your creative work.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s a book of just, like, a bunch of activities to get you motivated and inspired to do creative work. And so much of the book has you tap into childhood experiences. So I haven&#8217;t been writing all the activities. I&#8217;ve been at least thinking and meditating on them. And so that&#8217;s been really fun. So thinking about my childhood as inspiration for things that I create and do now has been really cool. And then, yeah, just thinking about color. Lots of color.</p>
<p>Lots of just trying to find inspiration and creativity. My end of year project right now is trying to create an art book. And so very similar to the fade on kind of like big coffee table books, I want to curate some type of yeah, I&#8217;ve never tried. So I&#8217;m going to just try and map that out over the holiday and see what I can come up with. Have a little theme. I love material culture, so I think that&#8217;s going to be the theme for the art book, is thinking about material culture and how artists use different materials to create meaning. So I&#8217;ve been doing lots of research. So that&#8217;s been my end of year inspiration.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>At this stage of your career, even just looking back to where you&#8217;ve come from and where you&#8217;ve worked and the impact that you&#8217;ve had, how do you measure success now? What does it look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>So do I feel happy? Do I feel good? Do I feel motivated? Has been whether or not I feel successful or those are my metrics for success. Are things feeling right? Feels a little woo. Woo. I think it&#8217;s because I live in La now. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d ever talk like this before, but yeah, a lot of it is. Like, how do things feel? I think I&#8217;ve had a lot of moments in life. I have ADHD. I also have quite a bit of anxiety.</p>
<p>And so a lot of my life has been me trying to get around those things. And so my metrics of success now have been, do I not feel anxious? How often have I been feeling anxious? Is it less? That seems great. That feels successful. So, yeah, just kind of just like, monitoring my mental health and feeling good about where I am in life right now and being content, spending a lot of time just being happy with what I have right now. It&#8217;s hard because I think, how do you balance that with wanting more and being ambitious? I&#8217;m wrestling with that now, but just be happy with what I got.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Is there anything that you want to do that you haven&#8217;t done yet?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I really want to curate a show. Like an art show. I say it every year. So now that I&#8217;m saying it out loud to you and shared with the public, I think I have to do it. So maybe it&#8217;s on the 2024 docket. Yeah, I really want to curate a show. I&#8217;ve always said I plan for it, I figure it out. But maybe 2024 is the year that I start actually doing it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>You&#8217;re right there in La. That&#8217;s a great place to do it. I know that United talent artists has an artist space, but, I mean, there&#8217;s just so much art and design in Los Angeles. I feel like you could definitely make that happen.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Thanks for saying that. I live close to the UTA artist space, and I&#8217;ve contacted them before just for other stuff, so yeah, thank you. You know what? Yeah, it&#8217;s going to go into the like when I envision boarding for 2024. This is it. Thanks for this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. What kind of work do you see yourself doing in the next five years? I mean, I feel like you&#8217;re someone that, because of the skills and experience you&#8217;ve had, you could really almost go anywhere. Because what you do is you help build systems and you help build processes to work through things. So say it&#8217;s five years from now, what kind of work would you like to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>The thing that I have not dove into that I would like to do more is or just curation in general. So I think I want to move to a space where I think I&#8217;ve spent a lot of this part of my career being like, I want to be the artist, I want to create, I want to work with people and uplift them. I think I can do that in a different way. Whether I&#8217;m curating music shows, which I&#8217;ve started to do with Rosedale curating an art show, just like doing more curation and leaning into, I don&#8217;t have to be the person that&#8217;s doing the thing. I can support the people doing the thing. And so I think that&#8217;s where I want to go, and I want to do it across I imagine it being across a bunch of different sectors, and maybe it&#8217;s not just visual art. Maybe it&#8217;s also fashion, and maybe it&#8217;s also interior design and objects and vintage and stuff like that. So I want to dive more into my creative self of putting things.</p>
<p>I feel like a lot of the work that I do ends up being behind the scenes or I don&#8217;t get to share it very often, or it doesn&#8217;t feel like I share it very often on a public platform. So I would like to move into that space a little bit more.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, just to wrap things up here. Sam, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work, your projects? Like, where can they find that information online?</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>I occasionally post on my personal instagram, which is @samviotty, S-A-M-V-I-O-T-T-Y. But my art stuff is at @theviottystudio on Instagram, so both of those are on Instagram. I occasionally tweet. I&#8217;m @samviotty on most things. I think I&#8217;m also the only Sam Viotty. So if you google Samantha Viotty or Sam Viotty, I&#8217;m pretty sure you&#8217;ll find me anywhere that&#8217;s mostly I respond to DMs. People can also email me at hi at sviotty dot com. So happy to chat.</p>
<p>I love just talking to other people about what they&#8217;re working on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, sounds good. Sam Viotty. I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I mean, when I was doing my research, and I think what really kind of blew me away was, like, this is a program designer that&#8217;s like, trying to change country music. It felt like this weird sort of combination. But now that I&#8217;ve talked with you and I&#8217;ve gotten the sense to kind of see how you work and how you think, you&#8217;re the kind of person that I feel like the design industry needs to have more of. Like someone that can really synthesize all of the things that design can do and use them in ways that can help forward, move people forward, move systems forward, move companies forward. I mean, there&#8217;s been so much talk about generalist versus specialist, right? And I think what you embody is, like, the true kind of generalist type of designer that I wish more designers were like.</p>
<p>I wish more people were able to take their knowledge and think of it and use it and apply it in ways that can really sort of benefit the world. I mean, we live in a very crazy time right now, and a lot of the systems and practices and things we have are designed and can be and should be redesigned. And it&#8217;s just so empowering for me to see someone like you that&#8217;s doing this work out in the world, and I&#8217;m glad to share that with the audience here. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Sam Viotty:</b></p>
<p>Thank you. I&#8217;m so happy that you have this platform. It&#8217;s incredible. Everyone I&#8217;ve listened to a few episodes and people are really inspiring. So I&#8217;m honored to be on the show. So thank you so much.</p>

<p>What a difference a few years makes! When we first had Maya Gold Patterson on the podcast back in 2016, she was a product designer in Chicago. Since then, she&#8217;s moved out west and has held down design leadership positions at two of the most well-known tech companies on the planet &#8212; Twitter (now X) and Facebook (now Meta). And after a recent stint as VP of Design at Riverside.fm, Maya&#8217;s facing one of her biggest challenges yet: quitting her job and embarking on a journey of self-discovery and career exploration.</p>
<p>We caught up and talked about her recent decision, and about how it&#8217;s left her feeling about Big Tech and about her future. But we also spent time looking back at her tour of duty at Facebook and Twitter, and she spoke about the lessons she&#8217;s learned, the products she&#8217;s built, and the importance of making choices that align with her personal goals and values.</p>
<p>Maya is proof that taking a chance on yourself is never a bad idea, so if you&#8217;re feeling burnt out or unsure about your career direction, then this episode is a must-listen!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Hi, Maurice. I am Maya Gold Patterson. I&#8217;m a designer and I recently quit my job on a good note. I&#8217;m doing good, so it&#8217;s good. But what I do traditionally is product design and I&#8217;ve worked in big tech companies &#8212; Facebook, Twitter &#8212; and small tech companies. Riverside, a startup most recently, has filled up most of the time of my career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>You know, you dropped this on me, like, the day before we were about to&#8230;I mean, first of all, I&#8217;m always excited when someone decides to quit their job because I just feel like that&#8217;s just such a great opening up to new experiences and new opportunities and stuff like that. And we&#8217;ll get to that, we&#8217;ll talk about that. But I&#8217;m just curious so far. Leading up to this, how has the year been going?</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>The year has been rough. Oh my gosh. Well, it&#8217;s been highs and lows. It&#8217;s been yoyos. So just to give a little bit of context, like starting out the year, I&#8217;m a new mom, maybe not as new as I was at the start of the year. So my son is eleven months old. But at the start of the year, I was on maternity leave, but supposed to come back and I was supposed to come back to Twitter, where Elon Musk had recently acquired the company while I was on maternity leave. So that was kind of terrible. I was dealing with post weaning depression, which people don&#8217;t talk about often. It has to do with breastfeeding and all of that, and then using all those emotions and trying to figure out what was next for me, I was doing job hunting and soul searching, and so that was a rough start to the year. But then I met these two incredible founders, the founders of Riverside, and we had some awesome working sessions, sort of informally, that escalated into a full time role as a VP of Design, in which we all knew it would be kind of an uphill battle. They were based globally, so it was going to be a ten time zone difference between me and them. And yeah, so I was waking up at like 5:00 a.m. to get on calls between 6:00 to 11:00 a.m., essentially. And at first it was really working and I was really excited. And eventually, for a lot of reasons, it wasn&#8217;t right. And I&#8217;m like, smiling while I&#8217;m saying this, not because of what has happened there, but because of the state that I&#8217;m in now. I&#8217;m so excited for the next half of my year and the six months after that, but the first leading up to now, it has been rough but also amazing and incredible. And to watch my son grow up and I just turned 30, there&#8217;s a lot of newness and experience and learning that I&#8217;m taking in, and I feel like it all just sort of, like, came to a head in the last six months.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow. Well, congratulations on your son. That&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done the ten hour time zone thing, too. The last company I worked at was headquartered in San Francisco&#8230;or co-headquartered in San Francisco and Paris. So I would sometimes have to meet whatever was happening in the West Coast. But then we had people, I think as far out as, I want to say as far out as India, maybe not that far. I know we had people into Africa, we had people throughout Europe, but it was roughly like a ten time zone kind of gap. And it&#8217;s rough, it&#8217;s hard. I know remote work has made it so we can work from anywhere, but time zones are time zones. And it&#8217;s rough.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it is. It really is. And the most challenging thing, honestly, wasn&#8217;t for me, like, getting up early. I had already learned how to not sleep so much with the baby, so he trained me well for this. But it was the type of impact that I know I want to have on a company and on a product and for customers through my design work was just super challenging with that time zone gap and the nuance of what I was dealing with in comparison to what I had come from. Like at Twitter, we were all remote. That was the nuance. Everyone was remote versus in this scenario, at Riverside, I was the one that was remote and everyone was local and they were locally ten time zones away.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh&#8230;wow.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Right. So there just would be a lot happening. A lot happening that I would never just get to pick up on in terms of context and decision making. And it&#8217;s a startup, so it moves fast. And so there&#8217;s only like that three hour overlap where I&#8217;m actually getting to meet with the team and different people at the company. And so if a lot of that time is spent just catching up, when is the time spent to do the work? And it was tough to find that rhythm, honestly, but everyone was really committed to it, so I commend us for that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>When you were last on the show, this was November 2016. We were talking about this a little bit before recording, but you were a bonus episode because we ended up doing this right after I think it was the week Trump was elected in November 2016. And I went back and revisited that conversation and listened through it. And you mentioned talking about when you&#8217;re nervous about something or there&#8217;s something that you want to do that you&#8217;re not sure is the best thing, you kind of have this knot in your chest of nervousness. Did you have that feeling when you decided &#8220;it&#8217;s time for me to quit, it&#8217;s time for me to move on&#8221;?</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I did, but yes, for two reasons. One was because I genuinely really liked working with everyone I was working with at Riverside. So it was hard to come to the decision. Like, I needed to walk away. So just deciding to walk away gave me the ick. It was really difficult. But also the other part of me quitting was me committing to not taking another full time job and to not interview. And that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m even just exploring within myself, like what I really mean by that. But I really mean it. I&#8217;m committing myself right now to a year of not just jumping into another tech role, and that&#8217;s a statement to make for myself. I&#8217;m always the one to go and figure out what the Plan B is. So if I were to quit and then go to the next thing, I wouldn&#8217;t be that scared and that nervous, but I&#8217;m quitting and not immediately jumping back into Big Tech or any type of tech. I&#8217;m kind of exploring a bunch of different paths. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>When you emailed me yesterday, you told me that you were pulling the plug on Big Tech and that is something that you&#8217;ve wanted to do for a few years now. What does pulling the plug on Big Tech mean to you at this moment?</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m such a drama queen. I am pulling the plug on Big Tech right now because it was taking too much of me, and I&#8217;m at a time where I need to invest in myself and explore myself a bit more. So I don&#8217;t know if I won&#8217;t even be as ignorant to say I&#8217;ll never go back into tech. That&#8217;s probably unlikely, but right now it&#8217;s a no. So that means I am going to start turning down interviews that I was ramping up on and being clear with them and hopefully leaving on really good and open terms with those hiring managers that wanted to take a chance on me. And it&#8217;s nerve wracking, right? Because I got into this, and I don&#8217;t know if I touched on this in my first interview. I cringe listening back on myself, but I was a self-taught designer, and I was a Midwestern girl. I didn&#8217;t have a lot of exposure to what Silicon Valley was. So to decide to walk away from something when you&#8217;ve built so much progress and you&#8217;ve put in so much work for the last ten years, like putting in so much work to make it to where I&#8217;ve made it. To then say &#8220;I&#8217;m going to walk away.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know what it looks like, if people will open, receive me again if I want to come back. And I had to decide that that was okay with me. If that ended up being the case, that was okay with me, and I will figure it out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, yeah&#8230;I mean, when you were on the show, you were in Chicago, you were a product designer at Trunk Club, and I think it was maybe about six months after that is when you ended up leaving and then going out to California to work there. And as you mentioned, you&#8217;ve worked for two of the most well known tech companies in the world. You were at Facebook, which is now Meta. You were at Twitter, which is now just a single letter X. How was your time at Facebook? Like, we actually met in person in 2017 for the first time. Revision Path did that event here in Atlanta with Facebook.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Oh, that was so fun. I almost forgot. I was like, &#8220;I know we&#8217;ve met in person,&#8221; but I couldn&#8217;t remember what was the context.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>You surprised me because you had came up to me over like, &#8220;hey Maurice.&#8221; And I was like &#8220;who is this?&#8221; because we had only talked on Skype. And I was like, you didn&#8217;t look like your photo. You had short hair then.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And the photo you sent me, you had like, this long, curly hair. I was like &#8220;oh, oh&#8230;okay. yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>I know, the hair will really do a number on you. How was my time at Facebook? My time at Facebook was awesome. Oh, my goodness, like, I would not be where I am today without Facebook and the unique experience I had at Facebook. So the way that I transitioned out west, first of all, I wanted to be in Silicon Valley to start with, but I wasn&#8217;t ready for it. I didn&#8217;t get any job offers originally, but I found a really cool company in Chicago, so that was really good for just arming me with the tools to eventually try again for Silicon Valley. It did happen really organically where I was recruited into Facebook. I hadn&#8217;t reached out yet. I was preparing to. Dantley Davis, who was a deep mentor of mine, and I&#8217;ve worked with him now for many years. he found a piece of writing that I did for AfroTech that went, like, semi-viral at the time. That was &#8220;Five reasons why UX design and Black people go together&#8221; or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I remember that. It was on Blavity.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>On Blavity. It&#8217;s not Afro Tech. Yeah, this is at the time, you know, when UX was still kind of fresh to people&#8217;s minds, like, what that even meant. I guess he saw that. He saw a couple of other pieces that I had done, and he was like, &#8220;yo, you interested in, you know, my team?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m interested in anything. Please. Yes.&#8221; And I really wanted to work at a social media company, so I got the experience of working for a Black director, first of all, so that&#8217;s already new. A Black director that was really pushing the culture and doing so in an authentic way. Awesome experience. My direct manager was also Black, which is already&#8230;it&#8217;s a bit abnormal than probably your typical Facebook experience. And then there were not a lot of Black people in product at all at Facebook. But because it was so big, there were tens of thousands of people even just having 1% of us, there was a lot more than what I came from in Chicago, which was like, I knew one person who did UX design that looked like me in Chicago. So now I had access to incredible women and men who came from experiences like mine and cultural contexts like mine that were IC6&#8217;s and 7s and 8s and directors. And I&#8217;m like, oh, my gosh, and people are getting money and things are happening, and they&#8217;re talking in different languages, and you&#8217;re immersed in this incredible culture because Facebook Design, I really feel like, was leading a lot of the sort of education on what design organizations could look like and best practices. They were putting out a lot of content on Medium. Julie Zhou was, like, doing a ton on Medium and, like, I would religiously read everything that she put out. Like, I just felt blessed to get to work within this in the space that I had dreamt about. </p>
<p>I learned a lot, technically. Like, I was up against and working with some of the top prototypers who became good friends of mine, top visual designers, top strategic thinkers and storytellers. And I got to sort of see through their own craft, okay, what of this do I like to do? What could I be good at doing? And then they also sort of taught me how to implement that at scale through working with cross functional partners like PMs well, PMs and engineers I was already used to working with. It was working with people even bigger than that that really impacted the full customer experience that I first got to immerse myself with. So that was like, product marketing managers and data scientists and a formal user research team, like all of those people that are so important to the product you put out that I got to be introduced to at Facebook. So that was super cool. The offices were super fly. First of all, this is when Facebook, they were giving money, so they relocated me from Chicago to theBay. So they moved my car. I remember these movers came into my apartment, packed up my house, and set me all up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, really nice stuff. I don&#8217;t know how else I would have moved to California or afforded it. I mean, the offices were just super luxurious. They had seven, ten, I don&#8217;t know, fifteen different cafeterias and vending machines filled with Apple products and just ridiculous type of stuff. And then you were expected to travel around the world to sort of meet the customers that you were building for. So you&#8217;re flying like first class, essentially, to these different countries that I probably would have never been able to visit. So you&#8217;re having all expenses paid by Facebook to go learn and do research, do the thing that you like to do. It just&#8230;it was a really fast and fun time. That also was really challenging too, because, again, not a lot of people that looked like us. Sometimes the decisions that the company made was not vibing with, and it was a huge ship, and you&#8217;re ultimately like a cog in a bigger ship. And I definitely made impacts in the way that I wanted to, but not as fast always as I wanted to, or in the way that I wanted to do it. And that ultimately led me to start looking elsewhere.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Were you working out of MPK 20 out of Menlo Park?</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Yes. So I started there right when they opened MPK 20, I think like a year or two prior to me joining. It was really new.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I was out there, oh, I remember it was October 2016 because Facebook was doing their design lecture series and they were supporting Revision Path. And so I was like, &#8220;well, I would love to do some interviews on Facebook&#8217;s campus.&#8221; I was like, joking, like, &#8220;ha ha&#8221;, you know, &#8220;we could do it. And they were like, &#8220;okay.&#8221; And they paid for a first class ticket, flew me out, flew my equipment out and everything. And I remember going to the building and just&#8230;it&#8217;s kind of hard to describe how tremendous the scale of just that one office was.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Because it has like this&#8230;it&#8217;s almost like an indoor track or like a loop where you can sort of walk around the whole building and yeah, they have all of these different cafeteria stations or food stations or whatever, and people&#8217;s desks are just kind of out. Like, it didn&#8217;t feel like a cube farm at all. It just felt like almost like a department store. But people worked here in a way because it was just that big and massive.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>I had a love/hate relationship with it because to actually do work in that office was terrible, but like, there&#8217;s so much going on and there were so many people, and open floor plans are just really ridiculous for the creative process sometimes, because everyone just comes up to you and they&#8217;re just looking at&#8230;you know, it&#8217;s just obnoxious. But yeah, the lifestyle of Facebook at that time was&#8230;I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like now, but it was really cool, at least for someone who was like 23. I think I joined when I was 23. 23, I had no responsibilities&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, yeah, you were living it up.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>I was living it up! I was like, &#8220;yeah, I&#8217;ll be here all day, all night, whatever.&#8221; You&#8217;re taking the shuttle. Because I lived in Oakland, you would take the shuttle with the WiFi. The shuttles for Facebook are like the most beautiful Greyhounds you&#8217;ve ever seen in your life. Like, not actual Greyhounds. And oh my, you do all your work, get in at 11:00 [a.m.]. I remember the first day I showed up like 9:00 [a.m.] and no one was there, which is the opposite of Chicago, where if you were there at 9:05 [a.m.], you were in fucking trouble. Sorry, you&#8217;re in trouble. This was not the case. People were showing up late in their flip flops and sweats, which I didn&#8217;t love, but whatever. And then they leave on their shuttle at like 3:00 [p.m.], and they&#8217;re just living it up. Yeah, it was good. And we did some really&#8230;I got to work on some really cool stuff. The best projects were working on like a Fenty Beauty AR project and working on Facebook Music, which included some AR stuff and really cool effects, and just the whole vibe of it was, like, really fun, honestly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>We&#8217;re talking about one building when we say MPK 20, but it&#8217;s almost like a town. It&#8217;s almost like Facebookville in terms of the scale, and there&#8217;s even an internal transit system to get you to different buildings and stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Free Uber.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I was so blown away. That was also, I remember, because you know Tory Hargro, We know Tory Hargro. </p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Tory was giving me a tour and we had went to the Instagram building and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh yeah, you know, this is the Instagram building where we do Instagram,&#8221; and they had these little stages as soon as you walk in the building where you gold take pictures for Instagram, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;oh, yeah, give me your phone and I&#8217;ll take some pictures for Revision Path&#8217;s Instagram.&#8221; And I didn&#8217;t have an Instagram for Revision Path. I was like, &#8220;oh, yeah, I don&#8217;t have Instagram.&#8221; And I&#8217;m saying that in the Instagram building. And it was like you could hear a pin drop. Needless to say, I was on Instagram by the time the day ended. But the scale of that place is just so massive to think about. And yeah, I could see how you were saying you felt like just a cog in the whole ship of everything, because it&#8217;s huge.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s huge. And Facebook was definitely a place driven by data, and it was pretty top down. Like, they say it&#8217;s bottoms up. Yeah, you could decide your roadmaps with the PMs and such, and that&#8217;s a skill that you learn. And there are certain initiatives that I got to be part of that definitely influenced what we worked on. But your impact, which translated to, okay, your performance review, which happens every six months, which is tied to your bonuses, whether you&#8217;re going to get promoted or not, your impact is tied to data, like, what metrics did you move? And so that kind of started to incentivize not kind of it incentivized everyone to work in a way that was really not necessarily what I defined for myself as building the best user experience always, or even the way in which I like to go about product development. And so the promotions felt real good, the raises felt really good, the equity refreshes felt really good. But over time, it&#8217;s like, I want to try something else. I want to try something else just for now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So you made the jump over to Twitter, and that was right before the pandemic began, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, my timing is just really interesting, so I coincide everything that I do in my career with major stuff happening out in the world. Dantley had moved to Twitter maybe like two years &#8212; I can&#8217;t remember &#8212; prior to me joining. He was pitching me on a team, or rather an opportunity area that he thought I might be good at. Now I&#8217;m fresh off of what was like the Facebook Sharing team and then the Facebook Watch team. So Sharing is a really ruthless team to be on at times at Facebook because it&#8217;s always the most impactful to the bottom line, but it&#8217;s really hard to get the metrics up. And again, Facebook was oriented around metrics, so if you can&#8217;t move the needle there, it just was really stressful. So I was really burnt out by consumer facing sharing products, like Creation products. So that&#8217;s like creating things on a newsfeed, creative things in any sort of social media app. And this opportunity that he was describing sounded like Sharing to me. It wasn&#8217;t Sharing, but it sounded like some of that same sort of stuff, but it was vaguely like, okay&#8230;&#8221;we want to build something in audio, we don&#8217;t really know what it is. The team needs that sort of design vision and design strategy and some of the velocity that you probably would bring&#8230;if you&#8217;re down.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was like thinking about it, and Twitter I loved as a consumer. Twitter was my social media of choice. I had always loved Twitter, and I built a really strong design network on Twitter and found a home there. I never was interested in joining the company because I had heard through the valley, it&#8217;s just very white. The way things were run. Didn&#8217;t feel really fresh and innovative and they weren&#8217;t shipping a lot of products. I pride myself a bit on being able to ship products. That always was my sort of thing as a designer. I don&#8217;t get stuck in la la land. Like, I really will deliver something by the end of it. And with Dantley moving over there, he was changing the culture along with some other bigger cultural changes too, happening at Twitter. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;no, things are changing, and we&#8217;re hiring talent too, to help with those changes.&#8221; </p>
<p>I ended up taking that role. </p>
<p>It was incredible. Twitter was really incredible. I joined Twitter in January 2020. I went to their One Team. It&#8217;s called One Team, which was a time where everyone across the globe gets together in person to have this big conference that was in Houston. It was like the first week of January, or second, and it was lit. Oh, my God. Oh, it was so lit because Twitter was just that sort of more hippie tech company, you think Jack Dorsey versus Mark Zuckerberg. It just had that sort of vibe. And then they really leaned into, quote unquote, &#8220;the culture.&#8221; There was like Black people doing stuff. It just was cool. We were there partying and hanging, and the vibes were just right from start. And it was a much smaller company than Facebook. So I&#8217;m going from I think when I left Facebook, it was like 40 or 50K, at the time, employees, and Twitter was like 7,000. So it already felt much smaller, easier to navigate. We get back from One Team. I&#8217;m working with my team, which is three guys that were jamming on a very ambiguous scope of audio. And then we are about to head to a user research session in, I think, Houston actually, again, and I get a call to say to cancel my flights because Twitter is going to shut down, probably. Twitter was the first company, I think, in tech to shut down and go remote when 2020 happened. So I get that call. I had to cancel my flight. And I remember asking, I was like, &#8220;it&#8217;s not going to be that long, right? We&#8217;re not going to be locked up for that long, right?&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s going to be a bit&#8221; and I&#8217;m thinking to myself, okay, three weeks to say I never went back into the office again. Like, three years later, and only three months in was, yeah, I just wouldn&#8217;t have expected that. So from there on, it was like a fully remote position. And we were all working remotely, everyone in the globe, obviously. But yeah, my entire time at Twitter was remote, which was interesting. It was really important to have that one team experience. So I think that made me feel much better about the situation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And now one of the products you were working on while you were at Twitter ended up becoming Twitter Spaces. We won&#8217;t go into that. You actually did a whole episode with this podcast I produced called Happy Paths. I&#8217;ll put a link to that if people want to hear about your journey with sort of helping to build that product. But there were some other features that you worked on as well. You worked on voice tweets, is that right? Some other things as well?</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I worked on voice tweets, the first commerce/sort of beta approach which turned into a whole organization. And then I transitioned from Spaces because I was just ready for something new. And I was working on our crypto &#8212; sort of like very ambiguous crypto space &#8212; I was second trimester pregnant at the time. A couple of months prior to that, Jack Dorsey left. They let go of Dantley and a couple of other really important leaders, Kayvon, and those two really were the ones that were driving a lot of the positive change on the product side. So Twitter was quickly corroding from my point of view. And I also just didn&#8217;t care about work like that because I cared about my baby and myself and whether I was going to be able to deliver. There were bigger questions I had for myself, right? Yeah. But I did get to work on a couple of interesting things by the end of it, like some interesting concepts for crypto, but those didn&#8217;t really get to see the light so much. And then a couple months after that, Elon bought the company and the rest, I guess, is in the news.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, it sounds like with all these sort of things changing as quickly as they were, it sort of kind of put that idea in your mind that it might be time for you to go then as well, right?</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, for sure. And I think Spaces was such an incredible experience. voice tweets and Spaces really were like a one-two punch together. I loved the team I was working with and I loved how we built that product and even how we approached it. Everything just felt so good. But it was really hard too. There was some really not cool stuff that went down as well. And we went from a team of three, four to a hundred, and I realized I just didn&#8217;t like that part of the job so much. Maybe in the future I will, but the scaling to an org, I did not like it. Well, I didn&#8217;t know why fully I didn&#8217;t like it, but I knew I didn&#8217;t like it in the context of this bigger tech company where you have the KPIs and the roadmaps and the vision planning, like all that stuff. And it just was a lot of politics. And so I was really burnt out after Spaces and needed a break. And honestly, with all the drama that like, I got that, like people really weren&#8217;t checking for me after Jack Dorsey and them left because no one knew what their job was. Everyone was running around with their heads cut off. And I was like, &#8220;well, I&#8217;m pregnant. I&#8217;m just going to lay up.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, it sounds like it was also just a big career shift in a way, because you had went from being an IC as a product designer. It sounds like you were mostly an IC while you were at Facebook and then at Twitter, you&#8217;re now, like, managing a team. You&#8217;re on management. How did you approach that shift?</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s good context. Just to be super transparent, when I joined Facebook, I was IC 4, got promoted, was about to get promoted, left before that and went to Twitter, and I still was on the IC track. I went from staff to senior staff. So that&#8217;s just like going up the IC sort of career ladder. And during that senior staff transition, which I think translates to an [IC] 8 at most companies, that was at the same time that Spaces had gone live as a beta, the company decided, &#8220;okay, it&#8217;s our number one priority. Maya, Alex, Remy, all the people that were like, the leads of the team, what do you need to make this make product market fit?&#8221; And that included bringing on a lot more designers. And so there was a point where I was getting coaching from Dantley, where I was telling him, I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to do this.&#8221; Like, I&#8217;m not a manager, and I never went into management at Twitter. It wasn&#8217;t my goal. But he wanted me to essentially move into a design lead role, which was undefined at Twitter at the time, even though they were starting to try that out with me and a couple other designers. And he was like, &#8220;you&#8217;re essentially like the mass editor of Spaces, and you need to orient the team, the design team, to be able to create the product that we all see could happen.&#8221; So I internalized that, and I also knew for myself what type of culture and environment I wanted to work within, and that mattered to me. So while it wasn&#8217;t my actual manager, I wasn&#8217;t a manager. I also paid a lot of attention to the team culture, and I worked with my direct manager, and he was awesome. He gave me a lot of support in doing this. I worked with him to sort of set a culture and different activities, put those in place so that the team could not only create the best product, but it felt good getting there, ideally, even though the pressure was high. So, yeah, going from being the sole designer to leading seven designers &#8212; super talented designers, too &#8212; that was an incredible learning experience. But, man, that was really fun. Really fun, really hard.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s good that they sort of were also kind of giving you the sort of support to support that team. Like, they didn&#8217;t just say, &#8220;okay, now you&#8217;re leading. Good luck.&#8221; It sounds like you sort of had help and support along the way, as you were kind of navigating all of this.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Yes and no. So I got the support and I definitely got help. But it usually happened at a major junction point where I just completely was burnt out. One of the ways in which we even realized I needed so many more designers than I originally thought. I remember a new design director leader in the industry, Halli, had just joined. I had never met him. Big fan of his Twitter presence and everything he did with Ueno, they had just been acquired. He and I were going to sit down and have a conversation. Spaces was like&#8230;oh, my God. I was just so stressed out by it. And I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to essentially meet the leadership team&#8217;s ask, which was like, &#8220;okay, figure out how to do all of these things and what resources you need.&#8221; I just didn&#8217;t know. And he and I get on a call &#8212; and he&#8217;s so good at reading people; he and I had never met &#8212; and he was like, &#8220;how are you?&#8221; And the most embarrassing thing happened. I just started bursting out crying to this man that I&#8217;d never met before. It was, oh, my God, it goes against everything that I want to be. I&#8217;ve cried twice in front of people at work, and I always hate myself afterwards, but I could not help myself. I was so distraught. And through that, that&#8217;s when we really got to the essence of what I needed, and that was more support, more designers, and then also the sort of go ahead from design leadership. Sometimes people are really&#8230;I find that managers and leaders sometimes are really nervous about saying, &#8220;no, this designer is who you need to listen to.&#8221; Usually they&#8217;re like, &#8220;oh, everyone&#8217;s opinion is sort of like, equal, and the best one will come out.&#8221; But that&#8217;s not always true. Sometimes you need a decision maker. And so it was a combination of getting those resources and being everyone explicitly knowing, like, Maya is the decision maker. That empowered me to really lean into that role and then sort of transition in that situation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And so now, after Twitter, you joined Riverside as their VP of design, which is where you were most recently. I know you were only there for a short amount of time, but can you just sort of sum up what it was like there for you? </p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah&#8230;and even why I chose it. </p>
<p>So after leaving Twitter, I was curious still. I had some questions about my career. Like I mentioned, I had gotten to a pretty senior level of IC path, but I had been leading a team of designers. Several managers of mine had pitched the idea of me going into management. I knew that I wasn&#8217;t really that interested in doing it at a big tech company, just based off of what I was witnessing was the role of a manager. But I was curious about it, and I kind of thought that at a startup maybe that would be the way that I could both still keep my hands in the product making and product strategy and all of that while also getting to trial management. So I thought that this VP role would be like the sort of best of both worlds and I probably downplayed the challenges. </p>
<p>I knew it was going to be challenging to work in the ten time zone difference and I knew even just the cultural differences might be a challenge but I wasn&#8217;t too concerned about that type of stuff. But yeah, that ten time zones and even just the nuances of the startup world, right? Like I&#8217;m coming from big tech into startup world. It is different. Even though Spaces liked to brand itself as a startup within a big company, no, it&#8217;s still different. It&#8217;s really different. </p>
<p>What I really loved about Riverside is that they just moved really fast, but from a place of curiosity they would always be observing what&#8217;s happening out in the world and where their competitors are moving. And they weren&#8217;t afraid of scrapping a roadmap and just redesigning one or reprioritizing it. Sometimes we did that probably a little bit too much and I think honestly through our work together we started to get a little bit more consistent with our priorities, and that was great. But some of that even was a bit of a headache to just navigate just how rapidly things could change in terms of priorities. </p>
<p>What I found with Riverside was people were really just genuinely down to create and hopefully create a really solid product for customers. And I know everyone says that, but I don&#8217;t know&#8230;people just seem to be really curious to do that and really open to receiving wherever that idea gold come from. So they&#8217;re all taking a bet on me too. I&#8217;m in L.A. and they now have this new leader who&#8217;s all the way over here and they kind of have to listen to, like, they kind of embraced that with open arms and that was cool. And I think the startup world in general, I really am still fascinated by. But one thing I learned was I probably want to be&#8230;to create it myself. I have so many skills at this point and I have a way of working where actually startups aren&#8217;t that different from big tech companies. If you have a boss, the boss is still the boss and what their vision is and how they want to do work. That is the way in which you have to do work. That&#8217;s not a bad thing. And it wasn&#8217;t even bad how Riverside did it. It just at this time in my life, I was realizing that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m looking for. Like, I was actually trying to get away from that sort of, I don&#8217;t know, like company-first mindset. I want to build something. I want to build something. I don&#8217;t want to push forward something that&#8217;s already been built.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that sounds like a natural progression, though. I mean, going from these larger companies to smaller companies, but you&#8217;re gaining more and more experience just as a designer, as a person, you&#8217;re just gaining more experience. So I feel like that&#8217;s a natural progression.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I hope so. It&#8217;s a messy journey. I think it&#8217;s even messier now that I&#8217;ve pulled the plug on big tech, apparently. But I think it&#8217;s going to shake out to something really beautiful, hopefully.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I think it will. I mean, one of the beautiful things about this show and having done it for so long with these conversations, it can kind of show people that your career path isn&#8217;t always a linear thing. Like, it can have ups and downs and highs and lows, et cetera, as long as you kind of at least have a sense of what it is you want to do and where you&#8217;re going. And it sounds like you&#8217;ve kind of weathered that in your own career.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, 100%. Oh, man, you hear it when you first start out. One of my best friends who originally was just a colleague of mine, she just would always tell me, &#8220;your path and your journey is your path. In your journey, you make the decisions that are right for your career.&#8221; And at first you&#8217;re like, &#8220;oh, yeah, of course.&#8221; And you kind of can get taken away in the career paths that these companies have sort of set out. Like IC 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, then you go into VP and then you go into C-suite, or you can start your own. There&#8217;s these very set paths of what success, quote unquote, should look like. And they&#8217;re attached to money and they&#8217;re attached to potentially notoriety and all those things. And what I found myself doing was going through that path, making a couple of choices that were uniquely Maya, but not enough. Not enough of those uniquely Maya choices and ones that only I could answer.</p>
<p>I think, you know, you really have to put in the hours and the effort. Like, the last decade of work was really important to get me to where I am today, where I feel comfortable being comfortable and confident being like, &#8220;actually, it&#8217;s a no right now. Right now I need to go do something different.&#8221; And I believe in what that difference is. And I have the skills to go approach that difference and turn left on this path instead of turning right, even though right is maybe what everyone else would naturally say I should go. And I think when people are able to do that &#8212; and what you and I were talking about a little bit earlier &#8212; was just like, I think a lot of us, a lot of millennials, and definitely people, you know, and other generations, too, are just kind of waking up and realizing, like, &#8220;oh, I don&#8217;t know if I want to do this path in the way in which it&#8217;s been laid out for me. I don&#8217;t actually know if I believe in this work for 30 years and then get to go do the thing that I love to do or that I want to explore within myself. I don&#8217;t even know if I love to do it because I haven&#8217;t been able to do it.&#8221; Do I want to wait until I&#8217;m 60 to do that? Do I need X amount of money to be able to go do that? I think what I&#8217;ve been doing, what I decide to do, is figure out what those constraints are that I&#8217;ve applied to myself; what I&#8217;m missing to be able to go and do that self-exploration through my career path. I don&#8217;t know. And then see, I guess, where the cards land after it. I&#8217;m now not willing to wait until I&#8217;m 40, 50, 60, I guess, to go figure it out. Like it needed to happen now. That&#8217;s what I learned.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So when you look back at kind of the experiences that you&#8217;ve had, you look back at your career, and I would say even, like, looking at what the current landscape is now in tech and design &#8212; I should say we&#8217;ll put tech and design together &#8212; what do you think it means to be a designer these days?</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>What does it mean to be a designer these days? I feel like designers are typically multidisciplinary, like the best designers are, but there is a singular part of their design skills that they can get paid to do or paid really well to do. And so we kind of lean into that. But I&#8217;ve seen people, whether they&#8217;re product designers or really honestly, outside of product designers, like interior designers, stylists, just creators in other ways. I&#8217;ve seen when they leave their corporate structure, and they just take that bet on themselves because they&#8217;ve put in the time and the work and gotten the network and gotten the resources that they need to go do that, amazing stuff blossoms. </p>
<p>So what does that mean for design? I think design is still messy. As messy as it was back in the day, it&#8217;s still messy now. Yes. We have more understanding as an industry of maybe the different types of designers, like what exists and what types of design work we need. But we&#8217;re not yet good at helping designers blossom in a variety of design skills. Like, are you going to be a tech designer? Are you going to be a graphic designer? Are you going to be an agency designer? Are you going to be a fashion designer? It&#8217;s very limiting. There are people that push outside that box, and what I assume is happening is they&#8217;re finding some interesting happiness and making stuff that can be really impactful on the world in a unique way. I&#8217;m kind of hopeful that that same thing happens to me. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s actually their reality or not, but that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m interpreting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Are you where you kind of want to be at this stage in your life? Maybe that&#8217;s an easy question. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I am, actually. That&#8217;s why I think I was comfortable walking away, right? And what does that mean? </p>
<p>So for me, honestly, since I was a little girl, I knew that I wanted to be successful and that meant money and being able to do whatever I wanted to do. So having the financial means to be able to do whatever I wanted to do, have a loving partner, have a family, probably. And so by choosing this career path and then going all in on it and having a lot of luck along the way, I was able to sort of achieve enough to be able to check the boxes on a lot of my childhood dreams. And I think because that happened, I&#8217;m now in this state where I&#8217;m like, &#8220;so then why am I still doing that? Why am I still in the rat race in that way?&#8221; One good answer is I need healthcare. My family needs healthcare. But honestly, again, we tucked away a good amount of money and it&#8217;s not enough for us to just retire retire, but it is probably enough to stop, get out of the rat race, look at it from a different vantage point and maybe go invest in ourselves or myself. Me and my husband are both on our self-employment journey now, and kind of see where it shakes out. </p>
<p>And corporate America is always going to be there. That&#8217;s like the backbone of this. You know, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll be able to enter back into big tech shiny roles when I&#8217;m done with this self-exploration, but I&#8217;ll be able to feed my family. And I think being able to distance myself from the keeping up with the Joneses mentality enabled me to sort of make that call. And a good example of this is like, me and my husband bought a house and that was like a really proud moment for us. And I remember one of the things that happened after we bought this house was like, a lot of people were like, &#8220;oh, this is your starter home. You&#8217;re going to move into a bigger house immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>I know! And they didn&#8217;t even say it coming from a bad place at all. At all. I understand why they said that, but I just was like, &#8220;wow, shouldn&#8217;t we just be satisfied with what we have?&#8221; Because I immediately started thinking like, &#8220;okay, yeah, I need to go get like, a bigger tech bag so then I can go get the bigger house.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want the bigger house.&#8221; Like, I have enough house problems. I have enough house problems with what I have. And I like my home. I like designing my home. Like, I don&#8217;t need more. So because I&#8217;m in this space, I&#8217;m like, okay, so then I don&#8217;t need a job that has these super high dollar signs attached to it and benefits and stuff. Like, maybe I will in the future. Maybe my son or myself or our health will require it. Okay, then we&#8217;ll saddle up and go do that. But if right now my family doesn&#8217;t need it and it doesn&#8217;t bring us ultimate joy, then I&#8217;m not doing it. I&#8217;m not going to do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;d be interested, like even, you know, I think you&#8217;ve sort of alluded that you were kind of taking a year off in a way &#8212; I&#8217;m using air quotes here &#8212; but you may not even want to go back into big tech after that. I&#8217;d be interested just to kind of see what your priorities are at that point.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Me too. Yeah, I leave the door open on big tech just because I know myself and I know also how beneficial big tech can be when you need it, and maybe there&#8217;ll be a right time and right place for it. But this year for me is definitely not going to be a sabbatical. I actually don&#8217;t want that right now. I think I&#8217;ve done a lot of resting and rebirthing and actual birthing over the last two years. I&#8217;m just, like, ready to go after it. Me and my husband talked about it actually yesterday. I want to balance my time really well, where we&#8217;re explicitly saying, &#8220;okay, if no money comes in, that&#8217;s scary, but okay, we&#8217;re just going to do that. That&#8217;s fine.&#8221; If you&#8217;re spending your time investing in your passions, that maybe could lead to making money. And then so, like, the first six months, I&#8217;m hoping is just investigating what I like to do, how far I can go with that sort of sorting out can it make me any money, and if so, how much? Okay, out of those five things that I might want to do and could maybe make me money, let me pick one that actually, like, is drawing me. And now if I really invest all my time there, what would happen? That would be maybe the next six months. Can you tell, like we&#8217;re type A, so we&#8217;re planning already. Very structured, in a very structured way, but that&#8217;s kind of how I see it going, is like, I want to go and I want to maybe reopen up my vintage shop. I want to maybe go and start some stuff with my husband. I&#8217;m going to do some design advising on the side because I&#8217;m interested in that and I have friends building cool stuff and I know a lot now, so maybe I can be helpful, explore all of that, see what feels good or not. I can say no at any time because I&#8217;m not beholden to anyone but myself and my family. And then hopefully success to me would be like, by the end of the year. I&#8217;m not rich or anything at all, but maybe I found a business that just speaks to me or is mine and I&#8217;m loving and also could earn enough for us to continue letting me walk this path. That would be incredible if that happens, but I don&#8217;t know if it will.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, there&#8217;s one project that you started recently called Recshop, is that right? Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Oh, man, that was a really cool project with my brother. So I love all things vintage, so I love vintage clothes, vintage cars. My dad was and still is as a DJ. He was, like, a DJ in the 80s. So he spun vinyl and we always grew up with a ton of vinyl in our house. And recently me and my brother have been getting into it and we decided to open up a record shop. Honestly, it was just like a creative passion project to have. And I think after shutting down my clothing shop, I was looking for that again. Quickly we realized the used record shop business is just not a business and it just wasn&#8217;t sustainable. And I had just had a baby and it was just like too much. So I think I want to do more of that type of stuff, though, because it teaches you so much. I learned about that business and there&#8217;s unique problems for the customer in that business. That was a learning, and even just what I enjoyed about it or didn&#8217;t. And it was a cool outlet. Like, we got to design a brand and a customer experience that was all about music and curating these really important pieces of artwork to the American music landscape. We got to curate that sort of stuff for people; that was really cool. And so maybe I do a couple more things like that that sort of get me closer to understanding what my actual purpose is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What do you want your legacy to be? And again, I feel like asking this now is maybe a bit premature because you&#8217;re right off the heels of quitting. You&#8217;ve got this freedom. The rest of the year has opened up to you. But have you thought about that?</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>I had not thought about that until you asked it a little bit before the podcast. But it&#8217;s such an important question. I do know from a gut sense what legacy for me, and I think my husband shares this, but one of the drivers of me quitting and quitting tech for a little bit was just I want my legacy to be the imprint that I have on my son in the type of woman I&#8217;m proud of and he&#8217;s proud of me for being. So I want him to see that he can make radical choices that are okay and can be honored and enable you to be your best self. And best self means like, showing up as a better partner, a better mommy, a better&#8230;just individual in general, making choices that go against the grain if it means it&#8217;s right for you is okay. That&#8217;s the type of legacy; like him approaching those intersections of life head on and not being scared of that and really having that sort of gut sense of like, &#8220;no, this is right for me. I&#8217;m going to try that. I&#8217;m going to work hard. I&#8217;m going to go try that. I&#8217;m going to go do something kind of crazy and feel good about that because I know it makes me a better man.&#8221; That&#8217;s the type of legacy that I think about. And if I leave some cool projects in my wake as I do that, that&#8217;d be awesome too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, I feel like that&#8217;s a good place to wrap up, but I guess before we do that, is there anything that you wanted to talk about that I didn&#8217;t ask you about?</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>No. I think though, if anyone&#8217;s doing some cool work in any cool work, honestly, I&#8217;m obviously open. I have some free time, believe it or not. So I guess I would just share that. Maybe I&#8217;ll leave my email for people to reach out directly if they&#8217;re working on anything cool, especially any cool collaborations in the vintage space, any cool design product startup stuff. I&#8217;m just here to sort of understand what people are trying to do and see if there&#8217;s some synergy, and if not with me, then maybe with somebody else. So I am open and more accessible than ever, I would say, right now. And yeah, just leave that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay. Where can people find you online?</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>I know that&#8217;s a good question because I kind of am off socials, but my accounts exist. So I&#8217;m on Twitter @mayagpatterson, and then I&#8217;m on Instagram @mayapatterson. I&#8217;m not super active there. Maybe I&#8217;ll become more active. I don&#8217;t know. We gotta see, but usually there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I feel like we&#8217;re sort of at this time where people are maybe trying to wean themselves off of social media. </p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s&#8230;well, I think what it is, honestly, is that Twitter has lost its damn mind. And then all these other Twitter clones kind of popped up, and folks are like, &#8220;oh, well, now I&#8217;m on Threads, now I&#8217;m on Spill, now I&#8217;m on Spoutible,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m not going to be in six different places. I&#8217;m going to wait like a year and see if any of these still exist. And then maybe I&#8217;ll see like, okay, if I decide to migrate to somethin, because people have asked that about Revision Path. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, why isn&#8217;t Revision Path on Threads?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;well, I&#8217;m squatting on an account, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to ever really use it.&#8221; But we&#8217;ll see how things work out.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>I know. It&#8217;s interesting. It&#8217;s in a really interesting space. I don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s going to net out. I think because I&#8217;ve worked in social media now for a bit, I know that it&#8217;s not good for us. I know mentally it&#8217;s not good for us. And so that&#8217;s why I had to make the call for myself to quit smoking, which is like quit social media. Realistically, when you have a small business like you do, or any sort of project, using social media is really one of the best tools you have to get your work out there and make connections and stuff. So I think now I&#8217;m going to have to probably re-investigate my Instagram or something like that. But yeah, it&#8217;s just yuckily&#8230;I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s just not good for us to be consuming people&#8217;s lives in that sort of way that frequently. And I know I feel much better since I&#8217;ve been off. And when I do go on, it&#8217;s like through my desktop for like five minutes. I don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m going to be on Twitter for much longer, which is so sad because like I said, I loved Twitter, but I don&#8217;t believe in anything that&#8217;s going on there. So I probably got to delete that, I guess Threads is kind of left or Spill.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m going to just wait and see. I mean, I talked about this on another episode, but I was like back in 2006, 2007, a bunch of Twitter clones popped up and there was like Yammer, there was Pownce, there was Jaiku&#8230; there were a bunch of them. And then within like a year or two&#8217;s time, they all either looked at other markets &#8212; like Plurk is, I think, huge in Taiwan &#8212; or they got bought out by a bigger company and then got closed down, or they just shut down. I don&#8217;t wanna&#8230;I think the way I said it in the last interview, I said, if Elon Musk is the problem, I don&#8217;t know if Mark Zuckerberg is the answer.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Oh, I know that&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So maybe there might be just an option to divest altogether.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>Maybe I think that there should be. I actually have thought about this as like a potential project, but more on that later. But yeah, get ourselves out of it. You know what I&#8217;ve been doing though, instead of scrolling? You know what I&#8217;ve been spending my time doing recently?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What&#8217;s that?</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been going to the public library. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay!</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been going to the public library, which is an incredible resource that is actually inspiring and gives you a lot of content for free that is not destructive to your mental wellness and health. And it&#8217;s been so&#8230;I like go there regularly and check out books and I spend so much time reading now, it feels really nice. I would encourage people to do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>You heard it folks; support your local library. Maya Gold Patterson, thank you so, so much for coming on the show. One. It&#8217;s just great to have you back on the show, but then also just to have seen your glow up over the years, to see how you have grown as a person, as a designer, I mean, I&#8217;m going to be really excited to see what is next for you. And I&#8217;m so glad that you were able to come on the show, especially on the heels of such a big life change, to talk about sort of what that means in the greater context of your career and everything. So thank you so much for coming on the show.</p>
<p><b>Maya Gold Patterson:</b></p>
<p>I appreciate oh, thank you, Maurice. And thank you for creating this safe space. I mean, I am so happy. Like, you&#8217;re essentially the first place that I get to even share this news with. So just thank you for that and being always so warm and open, keep doing what you&#8217;re like. Your type of energy is what this world needs.</p>

<p>December is a good time to take stock and think about how to approach the new year ahead. And for this week&#8217;s guest, Lawrence Humphrey, this year was about striking out on his own and starting <a href="https://www.pearl.us.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Pearl</a>, a peer-based leadership consulting platform where he serves as CEO.</p>
<p>We began by talking about the origin story of Pearl, and Lawrence walked me through the platform and spoke on how collaboration is a big part of how he makes everything work. He also shared how he started out as an engineer, talked about how his tenure at IBM inspired him to found <a href="https://tcdb.webflow.io/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Tech Can [Do] Better</a>, and gave recognition to those who have helped him achieve the success he has today. According to Lawrence, the best outcomes are a result of bringing diverse people together &#8212; a great message that we can all take to heart!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Hi, yeah, so I&#8217;m Lawrence Humphrey. I&#8217;m founder, CEO of Pearl, and I as a very new startup, very stereotypically, I do everything from setting the strategy, building the team, to executing against the strategy, executing it against myself, to taken out the trash and cleaning up the floor, so to speak. So very much the stereotypical start-up journey right now. But yeah, I do it all. It&#8217;s been really exciting. As a nosy person, I love being able to stick my nose in everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2022 been going so far? I feel like the second half of this year has been plagued by news about tech layoffs and things like that. How have you been holding up?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, this has been a very, let&#8217;s say, uncomfortable year, but not, obviously there are the greater, as you mentioned, societal forces making people uncomfortable, the job uncertainty. I am one of the people that quit my job this year to go full-time with Pearl. So my discomfort is more for from, and I get discomfort and excitement for having taken that leap. And I mean this is my first rodeo, so to speak. So I&#8217;m excited, and it&#8217;s very much, and I don&#8217;t have kids, but I have so much optimism for this kid and I&#8217;d want to make sure I raise them in order to be, I want it to be successful. So that&#8217;s been a super fulfilling journey and definitely a venture into uncharted territory for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, anytime you step out there and do your own thing for the first time, it is equal parts like exhilarating and terrifying. You have so much freedom, but you also really want to make sure that it actually succeeds.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
And I&#8217;ve been telling people that both the highs and lows are much more, they have a higher magnitude. I feel the highs more. I mean, because they&#8217;re my doing, this is because of direct output from my input, which the same could be said for the lows. So I&#8217;m getting used to the swings and trying to approach them with more equanimity, so not get necessarily as whipped around by them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, going into next year into 2023, do you have any kind of big resolutions or goals that you want to accomplish?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I mean, the big one and very practically is to be working on Pearl and that&#8217;s like the low-hanging fruit. Ideally, and I haven&#8217;t quantified this yet, I haven&#8217;t actually run the projections, but I would like for there to be a healthy amount of organic collaboration instead of me, let&#8217;s say heavy handedly really, really guiding people&#8217;s hand using the platform. Ideally we would have some early evangelists and the early adopters, just really giving us good data, using it, driving value from it. Beyond that, I mean I&#8217;m very shortsighted right now with just making sure that the business is set up for success long term and doing what, and I haven&#8217;t done my 2023 strategic planning yet. That&#8217;s going to be the next few weeks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s talk more about Pearl, which I see here is described as &#8220;a platform that makes finding actionable hiring solutions from vetted and diverse leaders easy.&#8221; Tell me more about it.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
So this is born from, and it&#8217;s kind of without getting into the full origin story, maybe we&#8217;ll get there. The observations that I&#8217;ve seen, are we have no shortage of collaboration tools, a lot of which come to mind, let&#8217;s say the Slacks, the Teams, even HBR articles to get thought leadership.</p>
<p>But there is a shortage of solutions that A, get us out of our own echo chambers into finding, I mean really practically, let&#8217;s say what do women think about hiring? Where are women hiring, et cetera. And also the follow-up to that is a lot of it is quote unquote like thought leadership and not the boots on the ground practical work, the practical instructions and recipes that these users or these leaders have used in order to drive results.</p>
<p>And I see these both working together in this very pernicious cycle of we continue to reinvent the wheel, we&#8217;re slower in terms of delivering outcomes, we deliver worse outcomes. People feel like worse leaders because they&#8217;re not getting connected to the work that in most cases already exist from the leaders that have done it. So that&#8217;s the opportunity that I see with Pearl. And we&#8217;re starting with a problem that all leaders have or will face hiring. So this is where we&#8217;re at the first step of our journey in proving out our value prop. So without getting into the origin story, that&#8217;s what Pearl is here to solve.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, look, get into the origin story. Where did the ideas sort of come from?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
So for that, it starts two years ago and the name of that org was Tech Can [Do] Better. And the week after George Floyd was murdered, I was still working at IBM and I noticed how my company at the time and the tech industry, and not just the tech industry, but that&#8217;s just where I live and breathe. They threw their hands up and they were bemused about what could be done to drive racial equity and what ways are we perpetuating it, how could this happen? And I got really frustrated at the confusion and how frantic the industry was knowing that I&#8217;d been on the inside with some of my coworkers, predominantly other black tech employees, advocating for what racial equity looked like within our company. And it felt like at the time we just got pats on the head. And Tech Can [Do] Better was my response to basically remove any obstacle that a tech company could have, like I don&#8217;t know what to do, where to go.</p>
<p>And I co-authored essentially a white paper with other black and brown folks from across the industry to outline very actionable steps about how to drive racial equity, whether you were an executive middle manager, independent contributor, anywhere in between, this is how you can get started with racial equity. And I think we hosted a dozen community calls, had people representing 50 companies from across the industry to help get each other unstuck. And that was when I realized that there was a demand and let&#8217;s say an overlooked opportunity and unsolved pain point for having very actionable perspective from black and brown perspectives, but even more broadly, it just exposed a lot of collaboration hiccups and we weren&#8217;t making it easy to get the answers we need. So it started there. And the other half of the story, I&#8217;ve been a leader with Pearl for almost two years, or a little over two years now.</p>
<p>And I find myself reinventing the wheel every day. And I mean hiring is just one of them. And I wrote the white paper for what diverse hiring looks like, and I assembled all of these diverse hiring sources and I still have trouble doing it. So even for me, very selfishly, I&#8217;m creating this tool to hopefully mitigate reinventing the wheel over and over again for all of these what I perceive to be mostly solved problems. I have to imagine hiring in any capacity is roughly 80% solved. And it&#8217;s just a matter of getting that answer and putting my own little Lawrence Humphrey customization on it, or Maurice, you customize it that last 20%, but I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of starting from 20% and then building out 80%, which is an abject waste of time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I see. I mean it&#8217;s interesting because you know mentioned that this sort of came out from the summer of 2020 and a lot of companies certainly had those pledges to quote unquote &#8220;do better&#8221; in whatever way that meant for them in terms of diversity and inclusion. And it feels like now two plus years out from it that some of those promises have kind of started to wane a little bit. Is Pearl kind of a way to hold companies like this accountable?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I will agree that I&#8217;ve seen the demand and let&#8217;s say the attention wane, and I wouldn&#8217;t say Pearl is a way to hold them accountable. I think Tech Can [Do] Better was more that than Pearl is. One of my philosophies is I think that as a designer, my design background here is if users will do whatever is easiest in most cases or whatever the system sets them up to do, and Pearl is an aim to make doing the right thing easier, I&#8217;d venture to say in my learnings with Tech Can [Do] Better, there are no shortage of people who want to be practicing racial equity at work, showing up in a more human way, building diverse teams, fostering inclusive collaboration.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just that they don&#8217;t have the tools, and let&#8217;s say the literal practical tools like the software and let&#8217;s say the soft skills tools to actually do those things. So Pearl is trying to make doing the right thing easier and less about accountability, pointing fingers, et cetera, et cetera. It&#8217;s assuming positive intent, and connecting people that want to be doing the right thing but not, might not know where to start.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m looking at the website now. I see you&#8217;ve got a great diverse team of advisors behind you. What does a regular day look like for you working on Pearl?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Being so early, and I&#8217;m sure it changes at some point, but every day looks really different and to the extent that I have any sort of consistency in my routine, it&#8217;s more location based. I love going to coffee shops, so I&#8217;ll go in the AM to the coffee shop to do my heads down, deep thinking work where I will do everything from craft social media, marketing outreach, to working on the product itself, to planning out what features need to be added, prioritizing from feedback that I heard in user interviews, what releases need to happen and when. And then in the afternoon, usually I have my calls either with my team, with potential customer discovery interviews, with my advisors, and that&#8217;s usually when I do my more, let&#8217;s say, not heads down work, but by and large the shape of each day from the outside might look similar. But what I&#8217;m doing is very different day to day. I mean, I can&#8217;t say I take many podcast calls right now, so already [inaudible 00:14:09] quite the variety that I&#8217;m getting right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, you got to get the word out about what you&#8217;re doing, so you have to do a little bit of press here and there.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, no, I 100% agree. And I had a release last Monday where I opened up Pearl to close family friends, I mean the social media, the people within my first, second degree connections. And I was joking that I feel like I need to go on tour now. I dropped my little EP and I&#8217;m shopping it around and seeing how it lands, getting people to listen to it, getting them to download my mix tape and all that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So let&#8217;s say that I&#8217;m a company or I&#8217;m a leader of a company that&#8217;s interested in Pearl, what does the onboarding process look like?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, so right now, and I guess it&#8217;s worth backing up and just talking through Pearl is a B2B and B2C, you can think of a GitHub or even a FigMore or Slack or something like that. So there are two avenues for which you can get engaged and I know you were talking about that B2B version. For that you can reach out to us and pilot with us and you can do that from our website. But the onboarding looks like an opening call where we can do some intros. I can tell you, I mean maybe if you are listening to this, I won&#8217;t have to tell you as much about Pearl, but we do some discovery to hear which pain points are you most struggling with. The few use cases that I identified are basically we&#8217;re helpful in smoothing out the transition between either people joining or leaving your team.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s say you are getting rid of some folks, which is timely, whether they&#8217;re either leaving or they got laid off, that work doesn&#8217;t just evaporate, it usually gets reallocated somewhere between the team. And it&#8217;s about helping them codify that work such that whomever is picking it up, it minimizes the time between zero to 60 and getting up to speed.</p>
<p>And then whenever they backfill that person, minimizing the friction of getting them caught up to speed. So that&#8217;s one use case. We&#8217;re also useful in kicking off projects that have multiple stakeholders either within or outside the company that require frequent and high-touch collaboration. So a couple of use cases that we talk out on that call and then fleshing out what success looks like at the end of a two to four-week sprint, it&#8217;s very much responding in the in-person just live in the meeting for where we can add the most value. Like I said, it&#8217;s more important to me to add value and see how folks are using Pearl, and it&#8217;s about figuring out where that sweet spot is between what problems they&#8217;re having and what I see Pearl being poised to solve.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the most challenging parts about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Oh, boy. I think that this might be, I&#8217;m just going to think out loud here and I might have to, I might discover the answer, so just more talking it out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Because this is my first rodeo, I feel like I have a strong intuitive sense for what I feel like needs to be done at any given time. At the same time, I&#8217;m grappling with the fact that practically and in reality, because I&#8217;ve not done this, I cannot fully trust my intuition for what should be done. And for that I have advisors and knowing when to pull them in, and I usually bounce ideas off of them, but it is just truly the, I&#8217;m meandering, like I said, into this uncharted territory with very little visibility of what&#8217;s in front of me. And it&#8217;s just navigating the ambiguity in a way that it makes me feel like I can confidently chart the course and bring other people in.</p>
<p>Luckily, I&#8217;ve had great advisors and because I don&#8217;t have a team of 100, I don&#8217;t really have to justify my decisions to many people. But sometimes it&#8217;s just like the day-to-day, I have no clue if this is going to work and I just try something, and if it doesn&#8217;t work, and I don&#8217;t mean no one likes failing, but it&#8217;s just I&#8217;m getting used to things not going according to plan more so than they do go according to plan. The self-management, I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the right way to say it, but just that keeping my own, keeping the wind in my own sails. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the way to say it now, I&#8217;ll probably think of a more eloquent way to say it as soon as we [inaudible 00:18:45]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But to keep that but to keep that motivation going essentially, right?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, and just like it is the age old, all right, &#8220;I tried six things, none of them went according to plan,&#8221; and you know have that day you get off a call where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;That did not go like I wanted it to go,&#8221; and at the same time tomorrow I&#8217;m going to get up and do it all over again. You got to keep pushing through. But yeah, that motivation&#8217;s huge.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I don&#8217;t know, as you were describing that, it sort of reminded me of that old Donald Rumsfeld quote about how there&#8217;s &#8220;known knowns&#8221; and there&#8217;s &#8220;unknown unknowns.&#8221; And it sounds like certainly I think with venturing into a start-up of something like this where you&#8217;re trying to, you don&#8217;t know what you don&#8217;t know, so even as you&#8217;re trying to build this product and build this company, there are other things down the line that you may encounter that you don&#8217;t really have an idea of. But that&#8217;s why you&#8217;ve got advisors to hopefully kind of help you out and to give you that foresight.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Exactly, and I mean it&#8217;s not an unknown phenomenon. There is, it always doesn&#8217;t work right before it does. And that&#8217;s what keeping me going. And I read another quote and I think it was, and this might be exposing one of my little guilty pleasures here, but there is this book called &#8220;Tiny Beautiful Things.&#8221; Cheryl Strayed, is this amazing writer, and I think she said in one of her books that &#8220;You just have to show up and do the work.&#8221; Like miners don&#8217;t show up and self-doubt like, &#8220;Oh I&#8217;m not a great miner, I don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m not good at this. What should I do about it?&#8221; They just show up and dig, and I just tell myself literally I have it written down. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;show up and dig.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I like that.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
It doesn&#8217;t really matter how you feel about it. Just do the work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, ultimately what would you see as success with Pearl? Let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know, a couple of years down the line, what do you see as being Pearl&#8217;s biggest success?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
A few years out, I would like to have the most actionable stop for workplace or leadership questions period, or challenges period. And those two pain points that I mentioned at the start, I do think they&#8217;re inextricably linked. So very practically, I am a pretty early mid-career professional black leader in a SaaS-based business, SaaS-based startup.</p>
<p>Disproportionately the solutions that you could find on the internet that you could talk to mentors about, all of its skews towards a couple of the majority demographics. So most leaders are white, most leaders are male, most companies are enterprises. These aren&#8217;t as helpful for me with all of those attributes that I mentioned. So if I could create a platform that allows you to find the most actionable solutions by the people who have done the work and are living it, I would consider that a huge win. And speeding up time and quality of outcomes or time to task, time to delivery, quality of outcomes, but also making leaders feel like, okay, I&#8217;m not the only one struggling with this.</p>
<p>There, I can find my little pocket of other similar leaders, and also burst, look outside of my bubble to see, &#8220;Okay, for this challenge I want to know how women are solving it.&#8221; I mean there are just some challenges that certain demographics are more poised at addressing than others.</p>
<p>I mean, rewind to 2020, I don&#8217;t want necessarily to know how let&#8217;s say white folks are solving racial equity in their workplace. I think that most people were looking for what are black and brown folks&#8217; solutions to hiring, to doing or to measuring impact of my product those sorts of things similar to the Me-Too era, men didn&#8217;t have as much of a place in that. That was a woman&#8217;s conversation. So if I can do that, that&#8217;s a huge win.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, we&#8217;ve talked a lot about your work, of course we&#8217;ve learned more about Pearl, but I want to learn more about you, about Lawrence. Tell me about where you grew up?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
So I grew up and Nashville, Tennessee. And it&#8217;s funny because I&#8217;m living in two of the trendiest places in the US right now, but back when I was growing up in Nashville, I was both underaged and it was underdeveloped. So I didn&#8217;t really experience the cool Nashville that a lot of people experience today. But I moved around a lot growing up, landed in Nashville in third grade and was there through graduation, and I was pretty into STEM but didn&#8217;t really know. And I think that this is a through line of my story, I didn&#8217;t really know what I wanted to do for a long time. I had a vague idea of I wanted to create something that impacts a lot of people. And at the time it was the scientist of the time, Nicola Tesla and Leonardo DaVinci and Newton and all these people that create things that change the world.</p>
<p>And then as I went through high school, I had a vague idea of what computer science was because I watched &#8220;The Social Network&#8221; all the time and I was like, this seems dope. Just being able to create stuff from your dorm room that scales, it impacts just millions, tens, hundreds of millions of people. This is awesome. And it just all started as a series of guesses. And I had a friend that we would just dream up these big ideas and he was more the design business guy. I was the tech person. And it wasn&#8217;t until, I mean honestly late college that I realized that okay, entrepreneurship, it is possible even though the path to do that was unclear. But yeah, I think that if I had to reflect on my story, I didn&#8217;t really feel like I had a lot of clear direction for what was possible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But you had that interest I guess from early on, like you said, right?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Oh yeah, I had the interest and a lot of it was gained through just guessing. And I guess media, as weird as that is, just like movies. I thought hackers were cool, I thought computer people were cool, people that built, like people in the STEM, I mean STEM always seemed like magic to me. So I was like, &#8220;This is dope.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know, I mean this might not be cool, like conventionally the cool thing to do, but it always felt really just impactful and magical.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, I think that&#8217;s really interesting. You know, mentioned the movie, &#8220;The Social Network,&#8221; that was, let&#8217;s see, that came out in 2010?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Like 2010, yeah,.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
2010? So that means you were probably in elementary and middle school in the early to mid-2000s, I&#8217;m guessing?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
So let me walk it back. I was definitely in high school when The Social Network came out because I was [inaudible 00:25:55]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, you were in high school then. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, I was doing my, I think my AP Bio homework. I had &#8220;The Social Network,&#8221; on my laptop and I would just play that movie over and over again, like that one and &#8220;Inception,&#8221; I watched those movies over and over again playing them while I was doing my homework.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s interesting that you mentioned that media was also kind of a thing that motivated you about this, because when I think about a lot of the media that sort of depicted tech during that time, I can go back probably as far as say like 1999 with &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; and then &#8220;Matrix Revolution,&#8221; or I forget what the others were.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Those movies were huge.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I remember even then, that was one of the movies I was watching a ton at the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But also the world wide web really started to, I don&#8217;t want to say mature during that time, but I graduated college in 2003 and I just remember that time from 2003 three to 2010 how there were new innovations in tech and design. It felt like every week there was something new. So progress was being made in such a quick pace that whether you were in it as an actual practitioner or even on the outside of it being the beneficiary of this technology, things were just moving at such a rapid pace. I mean, you think about print magazines, print magazines from 2000 to 2010 took such a sharp decline because of the rise of desktop publishing. And people could write blogs, they could make websites, they could use content management systems. So why would they have a print magazine?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Exactly. And I feel like the people, and obviously, I was mean, I don&#8217;t want to say obviously, but I was pretty young at the time, and I feel like there were beneficiaries of people who just got to create and go very hands on, and they rode that wave of let&#8217;s say digital literacy, and just that scrappy entrepreneurship and the Wild West of the worldwide web that was a mouthful.</p>
<p>But there are people that just made a lot of money and influence and clout and learned a ton, and that compounds. And I still think that there is a lot of opportunity in tech, which is why I&#8217;m so passionate about scaling my knowledge, and especially for black and brown people, underserved people, underrepresented folks, of raising our technical literacy because, I mean this, any sort of privilege it all compounds. So yeah, I just think that that was always so cool.</p>
<p>And I kind of keep going back to magic, like &#8220;Matrix&#8221; was literally just people defying physics and cracking the code. And &#8220;Social Network&#8221; just felt larger than life of how this, these gawky kids created this social network that literally changed the world of tech and connected everyone everywhere all at once. It was crazy. And I think that that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m really passionate about, is just scaling that knowledge, like I said, because it&#8217;s magic and it&#8217;s making a lot of people a lot of money and changing the landscape in ways that are for better and worse for some people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, and I think what it also did is it, I would say not just for black and brown people, but if we look at black and brown folks specifically, also really kind of helped change the mindset of us from being consumers to creators. Because now the tools, whether it&#8217;s the personal computer, or whether it&#8217;s even just learning the languages themselves, had become so easy to access that you could do these things now that you were seeing other folks do, and there weren&#8217;t any sort of real gatekeepers to get a lot of these things done.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking back, you mentioned 2010, CNN had this, they used to do this series on CNN called &#8220;Black in America,&#8221; and they would do &#8220;Black in America Two,&#8221; Black in America Three,&#8221; Black in America, Four.&#8221; And they would be focused on different things. And they had one that was &#8220;Black in America, Four&#8221; that focused on the rise of black folks trying to get into Silicon Valley. They called it the &#8220;New Promised Land,&#8221; and&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Is that like the &#8220;If you build it, they&#8217;ll come,&#8221; mentality?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. And it was so&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:30:11] age.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It was so interesting because I was watching that and not only were these people on there that were my age, Angela Benton and Wayne Sutton, et cetera, but I personally knew these people. I had met them, I had sat down and had dinner with them, and it&#8217;s like now they&#8217;re trying to accomplish these big huge, monumental goals, now. It&#8217;s really hard to capture that feeling or to recapture that feeling I think now maybe, but certainly back then it could have been very easy to really get swept up in the feeling that you could do this too, because you also just saw people that looked like you that were doing it Exactly.</p>
<p>And the tools were available, the opportunity was there. It was just a perfect storm.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
And I feel I very much subscribed to that last point you&#8217;re on, you can&#8217;t be what you can&#8217;t see. And I think especially when I was getting started, I kind of always consider myself a little out of the loop, but I struggle to find just role models that really fit tightly to my trajectory, let&#8217;s say.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been a little too counterculture for my own good. So it&#8217;s never been sufficient for me to just necessarily cut and paste someone else&#8217;s trajectory. But even still like, okay, I want to find someone who is threading the needle between being conventionally successful in business and obviously meeting the needs of the business, while also taking this social responsibility lens, who is also a young black leader who also, it&#8217;s all of these Venn diagrams that I&#8217;ve just struggled to find, and which is why I try to be, and I definitely jump at the opportunity to be something of a role model if I can, through mentorship, through podcasts like these, just to be the person that I wish I had.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now you mentioned going to college, you went to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. What was your time like there?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I think that it was, if I had to summarize it still me getting closer to what I felt like my fit was, maybe it is for a lot of people and for some people it clicks more than others. But I started in engineering, so my undergrad was in computer science and I realized pretty quickly that I didn&#8217;t feel like I fit there. Cultural reasons, and I mean demographic, I was one of the few black kids in my class, and in some cases one of the only black students in hundred-plus lecture halls, which exacerbated things a little bit.<br>
But even just the culture of it, in my opinion, the egomania of some of engineers, this wasn&#8217;t for me. And also it just didn&#8217;t feel very tactile. I didn&#8217;t feel, it all felt kind of abstract from time to time. But through that, met a lot of designers which began, light bulbs started firing, and so what that world looked like, found web development, which was the sweet spot of, okay, I can be an engineer that can think more about the user, what their needs are, what can add value for them.</p>
<p>And it was honestly through that web development, I rode that out for a while, and found the world of design through an internship at IBM, which you know in my opinion completely, I think everyone has like landmark milestones in their life. And interning at IBM was absolutely one of them, of &#8220;This is what design looks like at scale,&#8221; this is how these multidisciplinary teams collaborate.</p>
<p>It was so eye-opening, and I love the work that was being done there, and I guess I won&#8217;t say moreover, but equally loved the people from very junior to senior designers, Just all incredibly talented people, and with just huge hearts, great character. And that was around my senior year of college that I did that internship. And it was then that I was like, &#8220;Okay,&#8221; I felt like it started to click, that was the first time in my four or whatever years there that I felt like, &#8220;Okay,&#8221; this is the click that I was looking for. And I guess the three years before that where, I mean obviously I did projects here, I did a class there, but it was a lot of meandering, let&#8217;s say in hindsight until I found that click.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So after you graduated, you&#8217;d mentioned this sort of IBM internship and you stayed there for a long time. You were there for almost six years, starting off as an intern and then working your way up to becoming a strategist. When you look back at that time, what do you remember? Are there any sort of specific takeaways?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
So it can kind of be broken down into a couple chapters. So there was my early career internship, then we went through another onboarding, let&#8217;s say experience, they call them &#8220;boot camps.&#8221; That&#8217;s the one phase where it&#8217;s like starry-eyed early career, Lawrence, &#8220;the world is my oyster,&#8221; the same traps that all of these early 20 somethings succumb to. And then I was on a team for around three years. It was basically IBM design for AI, which is the intersection of design AI and basically consulting and facilitation.</p>
<p>But in essence we were creating technical, so how can non-technical teams get started with AI and create compelling, honest in the sense that this is what the technology can actually do implementation with AI. And amazing experience, and maybe one of the best ways that I could have started my career, on that team in terms of the work that I was doing.</p>
<p>And my boss at the time, extremely encouraging and just gave me a long leash. So I mean there was that chapter, and the next chapter was my tenure on the transformation team, which worked on enterprise wide transformation efforts predominantly in hybrid cloud AI and culture.</p>
<p>So the net of it was, I was doing a lot more consultative work, even on my AI team, the IBM design for AI. And that was when I realized that I just loved sitting in the middle and working in cross-disciplinary teams or multi-disciplinary teams, having high visibility projects, working with a lot of different stakeholders with big personalities. Basically translating the technical needs into layman speak into the needs of the business. And the kind of glib and story that I tell about it is I started in engineering, and then realized that designers tell engineers what to do. So I went into design and then in, or designers get told what to do by PMs and the business people. So I went into that lane. So I don&#8217;t know what you can make of that story, but that was how I decided to hop through those roles</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
From designer to engineer, I feel like that&#8217;s a journey of itself.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Engineer to designer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Oh, engineer to designer.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah. And even now I feel like both are pretty misunderstood titles. I would say design a little more so than engineering, but a lot of times people think, oh, shapes, colors, make things pop as a designer, which I am not that kind of designer. It was, I mentioned my first boss, and I just think that that was a great place for me to start because he built my, I mean both, he was a design executive, so he practically sharpened my skills as a designer, but really just gave me the confidence to go into rooms with very senior people and feel like my perspective had a place there.</p>
<p>So when I think about leadership, and I&#8217;m really passionate about leadership, there was a lot to be learned from the myriad of actual leaders, like reporting chain leaders, and just some of my mentors and peers. Everyone was just so generous with their perspective. There was a lot to learn in how to lead teams.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now when you started the organization, Tech Can [Do] Better, were you still at IBM or is this after you left?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
It was at IBM. So fun fact, and I recommend this to anyone that can pull this off, I ended up taking two leaves of absence to work on, the first one was Tech Can [Do] Better and work on that full time for three months. And the second one, I took a four-month leave of absence to work on what was Pearl, and I mean we reorged right in the middle of my leave of absence, but to work on that full time. And that second leave of absence was earlier this year when we got accepted into a start-up accelerator.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow. So IBM was pretty, it sounds like they were pretty supportive of what you were trying to do?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. And I mean even more specifically, my managers at the time, my leadership, and I mean if you know me, I don&#8217;t, for better or for worse, I think that I&#8217;m pretty obvious with what my intentions are and what my feelings are about, I think. It&#8217;s no secret how passionate I was about this, and how much Tech Can [Do] Better and Pearl meant to me, and I explained it to my managers that I felt like this was a once in a lifetime opportunity for Tech Can [Do] Better.</p>
<p>It was maybe a month or a couple months, I&#8217;m losing track of the time after the George Floyd incident and I was like, &#8220;Okay, the attention&#8217;s waning. I only have so much time before people move on and focus on the next thing. I need to focus on this in order to capitalize in this window.&#8221; And I mean they were receptive to that. And then the second one was, like I mentioned, I got accepted to a startup accelerator and I was like, this is a once in a lifetime thing. And I mean I was like, &#8220;I need to focus on this or I won&#8217;t be able to forgive myself.&#8221; So they were supportive of that. So to their credit, IBM and especially my leaders at the time, I give them nothing but my gratitude for that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Shout out to IBM.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I know, big shout out. And it&#8217;s so easy to just be greedy with talent like that. And I realized that I think I took two leaves of absence, maybe less than a year and a half or something apart I think. So that was, they didn&#8217;t have to do that, shout out to them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has both Tech Can [Do] Better and Pearl kind of been received by the tech community? Have you gotten any sort of valuable feedback to go into either the organization or to the product?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Oh, definitely. I mean, I kind of joked that I accidentally ended up in this leadership role, because when I was starting way back, 2020, when I was starting Tech Can [Do] Better, I would&#8217;ve never predicted that I would be on here right now still talking about it by any means, I mean you always hope so.</p>
<p>But that was unprecedented for me. I&#8217;d never done anything of that scale. And I put out a proposal, I mean I asked some of my usual suspects and some of my closest friends and confidants at the time, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m doing this thing, do you want in? I really could appreciate your help.&#8221; They helped out. I kept asking more people for help. Other people were asking if I needed help, and I was like, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Months later I ended up in Fast Company not knowing how I had got here in the first place.</p>
<p>And it was just overwhelmingly positive and people saying they spun up Tech Can [Do] Better chapters of their company, they gave the proposal to their executive leadership. I mean, it was incredibly surreal for me. I mean, like I said, everything was so novel, and I keep going back to, I have to imagine a lot of that came from just how actionable it was. I get personally really frustrated with all of the noise and just the content generation machine valuing quantity over quality.</p>
<p>And I like to think that a differentiator can just be okay, this is something that takes us beyond that 20%. If I hear another takeaway that&#8217;s like &#8220;Make sure to talk to your team,&#8221; or like, &#8220;Listen, or do your education, it&#8217;s all well intentioned, but it&#8217;s just so ambiguous and doesn&#8217;t help people get started,&#8221; that I have to imagine with Tech Can [Do] Better it was a breath of fresh air because we were going one level deeper, if not like two levels deeper, which informed Pearl.</p>
<p>I mean Pearl is the tech solution that is Tech Can [Do] Better at scale. So driving actionable change from diverse leaders, helping each other get unstuck and unblocked. I mean, it&#8217;s the product that allows that matchmaking to happen. So it is those learnings that I brought even into this new org. But yeah, it&#8217;s a lot of great feedback that, I mean a lot of this has just been listening and responding and reflecting, and doing my best to take in what the signal is, and what can make the product better and more valuable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In recent years, what would you say has been the biggest lesson that you&#8217;ve learned about yourself?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Oh man, I was not expecting that question, but I will say, and I think that just off the cuff there is a very thin line between what is a strength and what is a weakness and vice versa. I think that that&#8217;s the high level what I&#8217;ve learned about myself. And even more practically, and I have friends and advisors call me out about this all the time. I am a very big picture thinker and great, a lot of times people love visionary thinkers, big picture thinkers.</p>
<p>But I am slow and I struggle to get into the details and make it very, very real, and make it maybe in another way like very small so that you can touch it. For me, it has to exist in this universal principles, the big picture, this applies to everyone sort of thing. That&#8217;s like one example, of my what I think is a strength becoming a weakness.</p>
<p>I have other ones too, but it really is such a thin line. And also it&#8217;s just reinforcing to me that in order to change anything, any external thing, it really does start with you. I mean, right now I&#8217;m leading the org. I&#8217;m the first full-time hire, let&#8217;s say, I jumped full-time. But I have to manage my own morale, my own boundaries, my own timeline, my own organization.</p>
<p>And that predicts how well I can manage all of those other things for a team of people or one other person. And let&#8217;s say if I don&#8217;t take the five minutes before the call to get my talking points, it tends to not go well when I bring in whomever I want to bring in. So everything just starts with me. And obviously, I can only control me, but I&#8217;m just front and center every single day, for how my own actions manifest and shape the outcomes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the people that have really helped you get to this point in your career? I mean, no person is an island of course, but I&#8217;m curious who your support system has been throughout all this?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
It is kind of chapter dependent, early career, the people that got me at IBM, Adam Cutler, Greg Story, Phil Gilbert, a huge, Devin O&#8217;Brien. I mean really, either they got me to go into IBM or just really hands-on mentorship, far more than they needed to be for an intern at the time. Huge people. Then just naming names like Brad Neal, one of my co-founders of Tech Can [Do] Better. I mean, honestly, a big brother, if there is one.</p>
<p>He is just such a role model in composure and equanimity. And he and I chat pretty regularly and I always love his perspective. Moses Harris, Jill Soley, one of my advisors, Suresh, Fallon, Wayne, so my advisors now. I mean by and large, I need perspective, and I don&#8217;t do well just working by myself. So even if I&#8217;m not day-to-day working with someone, I&#8217;m always bouncing ideas off of people.</p>
<p>I mean, it might be a little trite or corny to say it, but my mom is such a reliable just, I mean she is my bedrock. I go to her for both practical and emotional support. So I mean, she is just the absolute best. So I mean her as well. I mean, of all the people who are the most reliable through lines, I mean she&#8217;s it. I love her to death.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If there&#8217;s someone out there that&#8217;s listening that kind of wants to follow in your footsteps, what advice would you give them?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I would say, and I was reflecting on this recently, that it&#8217;s not too early to start. I know a lot of people say it&#8217;s not too late to start, but I would say it&#8217;s not ever too early to start. I do think that, I know that a lot of people would say, I&#8217;m young, but I still spent time feeling like I needed permission to do things or I needed the credentials or credibility or I needed something.</p>
<p>I was missing something in order to just do that thing, and I regret it. And I wish that I just had&#8230; I heard it best once, &#8220;the confidence to be imperfect and the courage to be imperfect.&#8221; And I just think that life is short. You just got to do it. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for help. Don&#8217;t be afraid of failing or looking bad. Honestly, you are, by doing your own thing and following your path, you&#8217;re doing what a lot of people don&#8217;t, and I won&#8217;t say can&#8217;t do, but are slow to do it. And just following that fire that exists inside of you and just staying true to whatever that is. So it&#8217;ll be really fulfilling, and it&#8217;ll be a hell of a rollercoaster, but I think that that&#8217;s what makes life worthwhile. If you&#8217;re 80 years old and looking back at your time here that you&#8217;re going to be happy you did that stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything that you haven&#8217;t done yet that you want to do professionally?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I mean, get Tech-, I mean now Pearl to a place where it is I mean, it&#8217;s a mainstay, it&#8217;s a household name. I mean, that&#8217;s the obvious one. I just feel like there&#8217;s a lot of impact I haven&#8217;t yet made that is just ripe for the taking. I have also, I mean on a side note, and this could be a subject of a whole other thing, I have gotten really obsessed with writing comedy, and that is basically filming a show, that is a whole other thing, we don&#8217;t have to get into it here, but I&#8217;ve always&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, let&#8217;s get into it. Let&#8217;s get into it!</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I love the idea of, I mean, just writing a show or a movie or shorts and filming it, and specifically some sort of a comedy. Maybe like Atlanta Meets Nathan For You or something like that, I love stuff like that. But I honestly have no shortage of projects. But that&#8217;s been one of the ones that I haven&#8217;t been able to shake.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, the comedy writing sounds, I like that idea. Would it be something like, I don&#8217;t know for some reason when you said that, &#8220;Abbott Elementary&#8221; immediately came to mind, but would it be some kind of workplace comedy, something like that?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I&#8217;m honestly scared. I have a show that, I mean, I might actually film and every time, I&#8217;ve shopped it to a dozen or so people and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Dude, why aren&#8217;t you making this?&#8221; I&#8217;m honestly scared to give away my game right now. But I have a show, that let&#8217;s say is the style of the show will be more like mockumentary, let&#8217;s say. So it wouldn&#8217;t be a necessarily workplace, but I have maybe the whole first season stubbed out. Definitely, I&#8217;ve talked about it with a friend just shooting the pilot, because I even think I have the pilot mostly stubbed out. It&#8217;s just a matter of doing it. I don&#8217;t know, I just I&#8217;ve always wanted to try my hand at it. I mean, I know I&#8217;m being very vague, but&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, no, I get it. You don&#8217;t want someone listening to poach your idea. I totally get that.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I feel like I could be over-hyping it. I could be delusional, but this is such a good idea. Maybe someone&#8217;s already done it, but I need to release the pilot before I&#8217;m just out here talking about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look, that could be a good side project. You could work on that in your downtime.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, maybe these holidays when things slow down a little bit, I can get out there and just shoot a crappy pilot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There you go.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
But no, I think that that&#8217;s one of the ones, but I think that realistically, I just want to see Pearl succeed, obviously. And there are some quantitative milestones that I would love to hit. And there are some kind of qualitative things, I guess side missions, if you will, that are in support of that goal. Some of those goals that I would like to hit, I want to create a successful company, IPOs, exits or exits.</p>
<p>Obviously this is a long journey. I want to have a tool that is used by let&#8217;s say tens, hundreds, millions of people, that adds value, that changes the landscape, that spawns competitors, let&#8217;s say collaborative companies that do similar things. I just think that the land of the better collaborative software that focuses in on identity and personal context, because this matters, is pretty underexplored. And I say it&#8217;s to all of our detriment, and I&#8217;m going to see it through given this everything that I have. So to the extent that I have a life&#8217;s purpose, I feel like that&#8217;s my calling in addition to shooting the other show that I mentioned, but.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Well, this is kind of a good, I guess follow-up to that then, where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want your legacy to be?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I see those as two different questions, but five years, I would hope to have a team and wherever Pearl evolves from this, because obviously it will evolve. I&#8217;ll use Pearl as a shorthand for the mission that I&#8217;m on now. I want to have a strong leadership team, and I mean just both be practically doing good work, but even, I&#8217;ll say equally importantly, to the work that we&#8217;re doing, the value that we&#8217;re driving through our business, be role modeling a way of better leadership.</p>
<p>So I started Pearl because I felt like it would be more impactful to demonstrate through our actions, all of the recommendations and that we were espousing through Tech Can [Do] Better, than it was just to say them and recommend them. So I want the team to just be a team of all-stars who are just devoted to demonstrating a higher degree of leadership and holding ourselves the industry to a higher standard and five years.</p>
<p>I want that to be even stronger than I&#8217;m doing it today with an awesome just all-star group of people, many of whom I&#8217;ve already collaborated with and potentially some who might be listening to this, hopefully we all find each other.<br>
My legacy, I mean, as that&#8217;s a huge question. I do hope that in line with what I was mentioning before, I very much believe in the idea of leaving things better than we found it. And what that looks like for me is I feel like I owe so much to my ancestors, mostly black ancestors, very directly in my lineage. And let&#8217;s say my cousins, aunts, the folks around me who sacrificed a lot to get me here to where I am right now.</p>
<p>And I want to contribute to that chain of progress of making it easier for black and brown folks younger than me who follow me. Making it easier for them to have the opportunities to create widescale change and showing them that it&#8217;s possible, showing them that you don&#8217;t have to conform to someone else&#8217;s trajectory to do that.</p>
<p>You have the freedom to do it the way that is right for you, basically widening what is possible for people to be conventionally successful and what that actually means. And hopefully never sacrificing, I won&#8217;t say hopefully, hopefully this is conveyed through my actions, threading that needle between doing what&#8217;s right for the business and what is just societally responsible, whatever that looks like.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about Pearl, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, so best starting place for that is our website. So pearl.us.com, and you can find all of our links there to our LinkedIn, to our Instagram, to our app itself. Everything is, that&#8217;s the best place to start for my work. If you want to follow me similarly, you can follow me at lawrencehumphrey.com, so L-A-W-R-E-N-C-E.com. Hopefully, I think this will probably, be shared out in the description, but that also has all of my links and basically anywhere websites are found, you can find those links and find everything else.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Lawrence Humphrey, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I think first of all, just thank you for sharing your story of really kind of building a company. I think it&#8217;s something that we see a lot. I think we have seen a lot over the years, just what does it look like to really step out and try to do your own thing, but I think it&#8217;s really important to also kind of build in public in a way.</p>
<p>And based off what you&#8217;ve kind of been saying, how IBM kind of allows you the time to do this, and now you&#8217;re building it out in public with advisors and such, I think that&#8217;s really important for people to see that they can achieve their own dreams in this way. And of course, what you&#8217;re doing is not only just helping you out as a founder, but also helping out the industry as a whole and hopefully helping generations of people to come, so.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Exactly, and that&#8217;s important to me for exactly the reasons I said before. I want to be really honest about this story too, that it&#8217;s fulfilling, that it&#8217;s hard. The self-doubt is to come and it&#8217;s just that more important to just keep doing it anyway. I have to imagine something. Only good things can come if you just keep doing the work and surrounding yourself with good people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Exactly. Lawrence, thank you so much for coming on the show, man. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Maurice, thank you for hosting. This was a pleasure.</p>

<p>Our paths have crossed several times over the past couple of years, but I finally managed to sit down and chat with the one and only Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel. Along with being an author, design educator, and community builder, she is one of the editors behind <em><a href="https://blackexperienceindesign.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">The Black Experience in Design: Identity, Expression &amp; Reflection</a></em>, a compilation of essays from over 70 Black designers, artists, curators, educators, students, and researchers.</p>
<p>Our conversation began with some good news about a recent grand that she won, and from there we talked about her areas research and what she teaches. Dr. Noel spoke about growing up in Trinidad and Tobago and studying design in Brazil, including becoming a Fulbright Scholar and arriving at North Carolina State University. She also talked about motivation, ambition, and about the importance of finding your own community.</p>
<p>Take Dr. Noel&#8217;s advice &#8212; the world of design is a lot bigger than you think!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
All right. So my name is Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel, and I&#8217;m an assistant professor of design at North Carolina State University. What I do is a hard question because I do a lot of things. I guess the main thing is that I teach design and I work as a design coach in a kind of consulting capacity. And then I do research because I&#8217;m at a research university. So I do research in education, public health, and community engagement. And then, I&#8217;m an author and an editor. And maybe I&#8217;m a convener. I like to bring people together to talk about design. Yes. So I&#8217;ll stop there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I was going to say I&#8217;m glad you mentioned author and convener, because you did bring so many people together, myself included for The Black Experience in Design book that published earlier this year.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Yeah. So I&#8217;m one of six editors of that book. But I think you see my character and my outlook in the way that I brought people together, I suppose in the chapters that I worked on. Or when we were preparing the book, I brought people together to write together. Because I really believe in I guess the power of community. And I understand everybody&#8217;s journey with their own kind of imposter syndrome.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So in that book, one of my key roles was just that. To bring people together and kind of tell people, &#8220;Oh my goodness, your writing is amazing. All you need to do is change this little thing.&#8221; If you have that kind of approach, people can become so much more productive. So I think that that&#8217;s an outlook that I take into a lot of the things that I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I remember those Saturday morning Zoom writing sessions. Those were really helpful.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ve been doing those maybe for about two and a half years. Actually when I went to Tulane, so I&#8217;ve worked at about four different universities. So when I was at Tulane University, I was introduced a little bit more to this culture of writing together with other people. I joined some of their writing workshops that my colleagues had organized. But then I started either joining other people&#8217;s writing workshops, or running my own. I have to say that is really what has made me really productive writing wise in the last two years or so, because I write so often. So now it&#8217;s like I write every day, I suppose.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now you also recently won a grant too, right? The Outreach and Engagement Incentive Grants.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Yeah. So I won a grant at NC State. It&#8217;s a small grant, but it was an exciting proposal to be funded. It&#8217;s called STEM Games Against Oppression. Right? And it was a kind of, I don&#8217;t want to say it was a crazy idea. Because the stakes are &#8220;low&#8221; because it&#8217;s a small grant and it&#8217;s an internal grant, I felt I could actually be very creative in the way that I put together the grant. So this grant combines a lot of things that I&#8217;m interested in. So Afrofuturism or speculative futures. Games. STEM, and teaching STEM in different ways. And of course design. So for this grant, we are going to work with a group. And then the other interest is teenage boys. That sounds weird to say it like that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
My son is 14, and I kind of jokingly say to some of my friends a lot of my research has always been focused at whatever age he&#8217;s at. Right? So with this one, I&#8217;ve been thinking about how can science be more engaging or more interesting for 14 year old boys? So that&#8217;s what this grant is about, this project is about. Where these boys are going to discuss society, and oppression, and all of these things. But they&#8217;re going to make these games. And while they&#8217;re making the games, we&#8217;re going to introduce them to a lot of design-based STEM kind of concepts making. And I don&#8217;t know what the content is actually yet. But I&#8217;m excited about doing this work, which I&#8217;m going to start late fall.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
It was just exciting that I could win that kind of creative grant, to really bring together a lot of the things I was interested in and just create this experimental workshop where we&#8217;re just going to make these fun games. But while we&#8217;re making these fun games, we&#8217;re talking about society. We are going to do some 3D printing and AR/VR kind of stuff. So it&#8217;s creative, and it was exciting for that kind of creative activity to be seen as research. So hopefully, it&#8217;s another line of work that I&#8217;m going to be able to continue in the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, it sounds like you&#8217;ve had a banner year so far. Not just this year, but last year also. I mean, before we started recording, I was just congratulating you on your honorary doctorate that you got from the Pacific Northwest College of Art. Have you kind of had a chance to celebrate all these wins? I mean the doctorate, the book, the grant. Have you had a chance to celebrate?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
No. No, I haven&#8217;t. And it&#8217;s strange to say it, but I know that the pandemic caused a lot of disruption for a lot of people. For me too. But the pandemic also created access in a way that I might not have had access before. I&#8217;m parenting. So before the pandemic, I was always weighing things and trying to figure out, &#8220;Okay, what can I say yes to? What can I say no to?&#8221; And most things I would have to say no to, because I couldn&#8217;t go and participate in things because of my son&#8217;s school year or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So what happened with me with the pandemic is that because of these virtual meetings that we do, I could actually say yes to everything, right? Which is not a strategy that I recommend for a lot of people. But that is I suppose what has led to this bumpy year that because we weren&#8217;t physically going to places, I could now suddenly be involved in a lot of projects that I couldn&#8217;t have been involved in 2019. But also because of the pandemic, I haven&#8217;t had time to celebrate. Now I want to go somewhere and celebrate, but I haven&#8217;t actually been able to.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s been an exciting year. It&#8217;s an exciting year or a couple of years that have been the result of a lot of collaboration. So people might see me, but it&#8217;s hardly ever only about me. I love working with other people. So it&#8217;s a lot of these kinds of collaborations with other people that have created a lot of the results and the visibility that exists now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know what you mean about taking everything as it happens. I swear that summer, really I&#8217;d say from the summer of 2020 on to the end of that year, I just had this influx of opportunities that came in. And I didn&#8217;t say no to any of them because I could just do them all from home. So I know exactly what you mean by that, not having to kind of weigh the pros and cons. You can do it all because you happen to be in a place where you can do it all.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Yeah. And actually, you reminded me of this other thing of course, which we have to talk about. As Black people, summer 2020 was I suppose a year of hyper visibility for Black designers. So there were a lot more opportunities that would&#8217;ve come &#8230; or certainly for me. Let me not speak for everybody. A lot more opportunities, many more opportunities came my way after summer 2020. And I didn&#8217;t have to worry about could I accept them or not. So that&#8217;s why I guess I&#8217;m visible now and I&#8217;m able to celebrate these things. The book, the honorary doctorate, all of these things. Because really the visibility for us professionally changed that summer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It really did. And it&#8217;s interesting because now just two years later now, really kind of looking back on it, I mean we&#8217;re recording this right around the time a lot of this stuff happened back in 2020. It&#8217;s almost two years to the day when a lot of this really happened. And it&#8217;s amazing to see how things have changed just in terms of not only visibility, but also that attention. I don&#8217;t know about you. But for me, I feel like the attention has pretty much just completely died down. Like companies that said they were going to do stuff haven&#8217;t done it yet. Or they made a pledge and they never actually went through with it. That sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
I&#8217;m an academic. Right? And I guess I&#8217;ve maybe been able to use visibility in a slightly different way to other designers. Right? So it&#8217;s like if then that hyper visibility of that year and a half or those two years has given me &#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say it like this, but I will say it like this. It&#8217;s like that has given me permission or validation to do other things. Because then, my name became known as a designer who talks about equity or a designer who talks about social justice. I&#8217;m kind of channeling that into the research that I want to do or the community engagement that I want to do.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s not quite that I&#8217;m depending on the companies that said that they would be doing stuff to do this stuff because I&#8217;m in academia. But I am using the little bit of validation that I got during those 18 months then to underpin some of the work that I want to do. Right? Whether it&#8217;s this work about futures, and Afrofuturism, and how we combining that with design and world building, right? At least I could use the little bit of name recognition that I created in that time to now continue to do this other work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of being an academic, you mentioned teaching at North Carolina State University. How has it been teaching and going through all this over the past few years?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So an interesting thing that I found out during the pandemic is that I love teaching online, which is strange. I enjoy teaching face-to-face or online. But what I really enjoyed about working online &#8230; and there were ups and downs, right? But I first taught online in I think 2018 or 2019. So just before the pandemic. When we went into that crisis in March 13th, I already had two different experiences to build on. One, I worked at the d.school at Stanford in 2018 to 2019, and I did teach some Zoom-based classes then. And then 2019 to 2020, I was at Tulane. And at Tulane, we had to have a crisis management plan where we had to practice teaching online before the pandemic. We didn&#8217;t know the pandemic was coming. It was just part of hurricane crisis management.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So from those experiences, I already had some experience in things like bringing music into the classroom while on the Zoom call or changing up my Zoom backgrounds. I&#8217;d already started using these kind of warmup activities to get people comfortable online. So certainly the early days of the pandemic, I actually really enjoyed teaching online. There&#8217;s some frustration. As a design teacher, one thing that is complicated or difficult to manage is that we don&#8217;t have the same relationship with materials when we&#8217;re working remotely. But then we can experiment with other things, like maybe drawing together on a virtual whiteboard. I did some activities where people had to take photographs and add them to the virtual whiteboard. So I really enjoyed that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
I think that the last semester that was kind of hybrid was the worst point of the pandemic, because you can&#8217;t do both at the same time well. So I really wanted to be either online or in-person, but not both. Because there are these other issues that people hadn&#8217;t thought about. Like maybe we can&#8217;t hear properly when we&#8217;re in that kind of format with booths. Or our classroom suddenly became very accessible during the pandemic. And then when we went back to this kind of strange hybrid space, it became inaccessible again. I had one or two students who just couldn&#8217;t come to the classroom anymore because of accessibility issues like stairs and stuff like that. Right?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
But what else can I say about the experience? The accessibility issue, the pandemic broad accessibility. Or let me not say the pandemic, but teaching remotely made some classes and design classes accessible in ways that they might not have been before. Like throughout the pandemic, I taught hearing impaired people in many different settings, and I never had a lot of engagement with the deaf community before the pandemic. Right? So I that has always been something that has concerned me as we kind of go back to business as usual. What about all the accessibility that we created? Where is it going to go?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you mentioned North Carolina State University being a research university. Can you talk a bit about what research you&#8217;re working on?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Yeah. Well maybe, first I&#8217;m going to talk about one thing that I teach that might be tied to research. So I teach a class called contemporary issues in art and design. And it is a class about &#8230; well contemporary issues yes. But it&#8217;s equity and social justice. And that&#8217;s kind of one of the areas that underpins some of the engagement, because we do research and engagement. And the public engagement that I&#8217;m interested in is very equity and social justice focused.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So out of that class, I&#8217;ve been doing writing that&#8217;s related to the content of that class. So about race, gender, disability, all of these oppression issues. And I&#8217;m starting to bring that into the research that I have to say I want to do, because I&#8217;m a new assistant professor at NC State. So not all of it has started.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
But there are three areas of research that I plan to continue working in. Right? So the first one is tied to education. And it is about using design, and design principles, and design pedagogy, the way that we teach and learn design. And using that to make STEM education more accessible.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
I see this also as a justice issue. So that&#8217;s why I said it&#8217;s tied to that class that I teach. So when I was at Tulane, we started to do this tiny experiment where we turned a math class into a design class. And that&#8217;s a little bit of an example of where I see that research going. Where I worked with a professor, a math professor at Tulane called Marie Dahleh. And she taught me about something called ordinary differential equations, which I knew nothing about before. But when I did a little bit of research, I found it is about actually predicting the future. She might not describe it as that. And mathematicians might not describe it as that. But as someone who&#8217;s interested in futures, that&#8217;s the thing that I grabbed onto. This equation is to predict the future. And then we turned the math class into a design class about predicting the future and then using the equation to somehow support the prediction. Right?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m playing with making STEM curricular really exciting, engaging, future-focused, and critical at the same time. So maybe overlaying a lot of things, but it is a track that I&#8217;ve been following for a little while. In my PhD research, I worked with children who were in fourth grade. And at that time, they had to discuss society and the world around them and then take action through design. And I&#8217;m really just continuing that research and saying well okay, you&#8217;re going to discuss society. Yes. Take action through design, but we are going to make the STEM principles that are attached to the action that you&#8217;re taking a little bit more explicit. So that&#8217;s one area of research that I&#8217;m involved in.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Another area of research. And again, this is tied to another collaborator again at Tulane. This is Alessandra Bazzano. And in this area of research, we are looking at how can we use the way that designers think, talk, express themselves, the way designers use materials. How can we use all of these things to support patients or members of the public to talk about their public health experience more, or more clearly? So we did some workshops where for example, we gave people prototyping materials. And then we asked them to make something related to their pandemic experience, and then use that thing that they had made as a prompt to open up and talk about issues related to public health, right? Or could we get people to use photographs that they had taken as a prompt to get people to talk more about their public health experience in the pandemic? So that&#8217;s another area of research, which is related to patient-centered outcomes research, which is a whole area of research in public health. But it is using design methods and these design ways of thinking to support that patient centered outcomes research.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
And then the third area of research that I&#8217;m into is civic and social innovation, where we are building capacity within cities to get more people within the city or from the public to go through the design process together to address social issues. Right? So it&#8217;s civic or social engagement through design. So I mean, maybe I explain all three badly. But these are the three areas that I&#8217;m interested in. STEM education, public health, or patient-centered outcomes, and civic and social engagement. And all through design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s really interesting that you are doing this as you mentioned, all through design. Even the first part that you mentioned about math really kind of struck me, because my degree is in math. So you start talking about differential equations. That took me right back to my 2002 differential equations class at Morehouse with my professor, Dr. Bozeman and him talking about how a lot of engineers and stuff, they use differential equations for futures predictions. For example, if you want to predict the spread of an oil spill, you would use differential equations to try to figure that out. You&#8217;re predicting it. You don&#8217;t know for sure. But with calculus being the rate of change across a certain period of time or across a certain distance, differential equations helps you to try to chart those paths and stuff. So you&#8217;re right on with that. Certainly. It&#8217;s really just interesting that you&#8217;re able to do all this and tie design into all of it.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Yeah. And it&#8217;s about access an agency, and creating access and agency through design. But I&#8217;ll just share like a little bit of feedback that the professor I was working with that she gave. After we did that math class, that was a design class. She said, &#8220;There were different students engaged in the class today. And that&#8217;s interesting.&#8221; Because there&#8217;s some students who just expect, they&#8217;re going to love everything about math. But she said, &#8220;When we turned the math class into the design class, there were different people who were involved,&#8221; because there were people who were involved because maybe they were acting as they presented the future scenario that they had predicted. So I think can we use design to get people engaged in different ways around STEM education, public health, and social innovation? These are the three little pockets I&#8217;m interested in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And I have to say, I think that&#8217;s important for designers now to really think about. So much I feel like design within the past maybe decade or so has really largely been product focused and UX focused. I think as certainly technology, and tech companies, and social media and stuff have started to really become these pervasive entities in our lives. There&#8217;s so many designers now that are just getting into product, or UX, or something, but not thinking about other areas of practice where they could use their design. Like the stuff that you&#8217;re talking about with social innovation, other non-product oriented design work, community engagement. Speculative futures, which is related to an article that you just published recently. I think it&#8217;s important to show that these options are options.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
These options are options. And then also, we create these options. There&#8217;s something that I say all the time. So someone&#8217;s going to listen to this interview and say, &#8220;Oh my God, she&#8217;s saying this again.&#8221; But when I was finishing up undergrad just before the end, our professor said something like, &#8220;You make yourselves relevant?&#8221; I did industrial design. And he says, &#8220;Nobody needs any industrial designers anywhere.&#8221; But you are the one who kind of make yourself relevant to the conversations that everyone is having. So it&#8217;s like we make these opportunities for ourselves. So we don&#8217;t only have to talk about product and tech. There is work for us as designers in education, in even project management. Because to be a good designer, you know how to manage things, and manage time, and manage people. So these skills kind of don&#8217;t have to stay within the design world. We can take these skills and move them to other sectors where the opportunity might be so obvious.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Absolutely. Absolutely. Well said. Also at North Carolina State University, you&#8217;re co-chair of the Pluriversal Design Special Interest Group, which is part of the Design Research Society. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
All right. So that&#8217;s an exciting little research group. So the Design Research Society is supposed to be the largest professional organization for design research in the world actually. And they do an annual conference. There&#8217;s one that&#8217;s going to happen in June or would&#8217;ve happened by the time this is. So they do a conference every two years. And I&#8217;ve been a member of this association for about five years. Right?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So when I used to go to the annual conference, I used to be very struck that nobody was discussing stuff that I wanted to talk about. Right? And when I say I wanted to talk about, I mean as a Black woman from Trinidad and Tobago. It doesn&#8217;t have to be about race, I suppose. But as somebody from the global south, I found there was no one talking about design in ways that I really wanted to talk to. But if in the conference I met someone from Brazil, from Nigeria, from any other place other than Europe or North America, I found that we started to have more overlap of issues.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So we created this research group, myself and colleague Renata Marques Leitao, we had created this little research group to focus on issues in design from a non-European and non-North American perspective. Right? Also issues related to challenging the dominant narrative in design. Challenging that kind of white Euro American perspective in design. So this group became a group to talk about these types of issues within this Design Research Society. So it was like where could you find stories about practice from designers in South Africa and in India, for example. This became the group where we could have these kind of multicultural or cross cultural conversations in a way where &#8230; in design or very often, these kinds of conversations come with a little bit of a hierarchy where it&#8217;s kind of assumed that the person who is from America or from Europe has more authority or more knowledge than the person from wherever else. And this group challenges a lot of that kind of conversation.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So we&#8217;ve been around since 2018. It&#8217;s a vibrant group where the most vibrant thing that we do is actually a book club where we focus on design. We focus on who designers should be reading, authors that designers should be reading that are not from Europe or North America. People from within the group suggest people, so one week we had worked by a Puerto Rican feminist, Aurora Levins Morales. Another week we had someone talking about, N. K. Jemisin who is American, but is not part of that dominant white male perspective.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So we bring all of these authors that we think people need to hear from and talk about that, and talk about how their work affects design. And then we share stories about practice. We share research. And it is a group then that is focused on decolonizing design, but not only talking about decolonizing design. Because a lot of people talk about decolonizing design, but it remains as just talk. And in group, we&#8217;re asking people to share practice, and share stories. And kind of like, what are you doing that is not focusing on maybe more traditional ways of doing design? How are you shaking things up in your own design practice? And can you share this with us?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know you mentioned that about decolonizing design, and it reminded me about well one, I know Dr. Dori Tunstall is doing a lot of work in driving conversations around that. I remember, I think this might have been maybe a couple of years ago, there was some pushback from another Black designer about even using that term decolonizing design. I believe it was &#8230; oh my goodness. I think it was Saki Mafundikwa from Zimbabwe. He had written this piece for AIGA&#8217;s Eye on Design kind of pushing back on that term. I think thinking of colonialism in the more imperialistic sense, particularly with him being African. Pushing back on that term like can you really say you&#8217;re decolonizing design as an American?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Right. So that&#8217;s a good point of view. Actually, we had a conversation &#8230; when I say our conversation, I mean our group, we led a discussion a few months ago where we actually said that you probably should be an existential crisis if you&#8217;re a designer to be. Because you might want to talk about something like decolonizing design, but actually design is modernist and colonial. So how do we decolonize this? And when we decolonize it, is it still going to be design? Even that&#8217;s going to be part of the future existential crisis. It might not be design when we reach whatever place we think decolonization is.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s not actually a place, it&#8217;s a journey. And the work that I&#8217;ve been doing, I guess my step towards this whole decolonizing work is every issue that I look at, I keep asking myself, &#8220;Well, what is my perspective as person X?&#8221; Which to be really reductionist, this Black woman is from the Caribbean or Black mother from the Caribbean. So that informs a lot of the issues that I am focusing on. And I think that that&#8217;s my small step towards decolonizing given the space where I&#8217;m practicing as a designer and as a design researcher in my very authentic way. I don&#8217;t want to say an authentic way. It&#8217;s my way. And I encourage other people to do that. Bring your way into the process. And I see that us moving towards decolonizing the work, right?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Because a few years ago, maybe five, six years ago, I really thought about how I would see students kind of struggling to fit in or kind of struggling to replicate what they thought good design was.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So I travel a lot or I used to travel a lot, but I went to a design school in India. And at that point, at first I was like, &#8220;This is kind of interesting.&#8221; To see the similarity in the design world between Brazil, and Trinidad, and India. But actually on the other hand, I found it really disturbing that all of these students would&#8217;ve come into design school with their vibrant, vibrant identities, and maybe leave with this more homogenized outlook. And I think that my step towards decolonizing design is making sure that that doesn&#8217;t happen. Right? Getting people to really bring themselves back into the design process.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now we&#8217;ve talked a lot about your work. But I really want to kind of dive more into your origin story, because you&#8217;ve sort of dropped some little breadcrumbs here and there about going to India, and Brazil, and stuff like that. I know you&#8217;re originally from Trinidad and Tobago. So let&#8217;s start there. Tell me about growing up there. What was your childhood like?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Yeah. I grew up, from Trinidad who might be listening to this, I&#8217;m from Diamond Vale Diego Martin. I had probably a really kind of ordinary, middle class kind of existence. And I was a middle child. So growing up in my sister&#8217;s shadow and then kind of the baby after me. But you probably want to know about okay, design in Trinidad. And people in Trinidad don&#8217;t see this, but Trinidad is a very designerly place. Right? Because we have carnival culture. So it means that you are talking and thinking about design every year. And it&#8217;s a very fashion-conscious place.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So there&#8217;s a design language in Trinidad that I think people use from [inaudible 00:37:48], and at different festivals. Maybe they&#8217;re talking about design with regard to the way bamboo structures are made for some of the festivals and things like that. You know? So there&#8217;s that designerly sensibility I think all the time.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
The first design that I remember is in the equivalent of sixth grade, which is like form one. I remember designing maybe my first carnival costume and doing some work with lettering, which I still had. I still have somewhere. I saw the image the other day. But I can&#8217;t say that I know when I made the real conscious choice that design would&#8217;ve been it, right? But I guess maybe somewhere between 10th grade and 11th grade, this was the path that I joined. I became a &#8216;designer&#8217; from that age, became really interested in things like typography. I did a lot of book covers in school. I remember one design exam where I did a popup book with Christopher Columbus. So maybe this was me already challenging the world. Right? So Christopher Columbus was sailing across the ocean. And then when you pulled the little tab, he fell off the flat earth or something like that. But I always thought that design was exciting.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
I went to high school where art and design were really considered respectable professions or respectable areas. My parents probably wondered if I would&#8217;ve been able to pay for myself, survive as a designer. But my parents were really very open-minded and maybe focused on making sure that their children felt empowered. So when I wanted to study in Brazil, nobody ever told me no.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So actually, maybe I have to go backtrack a little bit and say how I ended up in Brazil. But I couldn&#8217;t study design in the way that I wanted to in Trinidad. And again, my parents, because they spoke a language that was very open. They kind of said, &#8220;Well, you could study anywhere in the world, as long as we don&#8217;t have to pay for it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s a good challenge to give 17 year old or 18 year old child. Right? Because I then started to just look for places around the world that I could study and my parents wouldn&#8217;t have to pay for it. Because what they were saying is that, &#8220;If we have to pay for it, we are going to tell you where you have to study. If you want to study anywhere, then you find the opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So eventually, I ended up starting school in Bahia in Brazil. So I started graphic design in Bahia in Federal University of Bahia, but then eventually I moved to a town called Curitiba in the south of Brazil. And I did industrial design. And I spent a really long time in Brazil. But it was an amazing &#8230; I actually spent six years in Brazil. An amazing six years where I was just able to grow without family influence. I just really became very independent and very worldly. I lived in a community, a university community that was very politically conscious and politically active.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So my interest in equity and social justice really started then with my roommates who were in social sciences and psychology. Because we didn&#8217;t have those conversations in design. Those conversations were happening on other floors in the building that I studied in. But those fueled me and world view.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
From Brazil, I went back to Trinidad in the late &#8217;90s. And then kind of almost immediately started working as a kind of design consultant with agencies that was somehow tied to export. So within Trinidad, I worked as a consultant with our trade and export agency for a few years. Then I worked with, there was a regional agency, Caribbean Export. I worked with them also as a consultant. Then I worked in East Africa in different places. Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya also as a consultant in trade and export. And, I was also adjunct faculty at the same time at the University of the West Indies in design.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
But I suppose it&#8217;s a little bit of that work with the export agencies, because this is kind of like development, international development kind of work. That work encouraged me to ask questions that eventually led me to do a PhD. And there was pressure from the university as well, because I eventually moved from being an adjunct to full-time. And you probably know how this academic thing is, but you probably need a PhD if you&#8217;re going to stay in academia.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So it was both the internal pressure from the university as well as these questions I was asking about the work we were doing as designers working in the area of development that eventually led me to do a PhD. Because I just thought that we needed to be asking harder questions, different questions. Really about how do we engage communities? What&#8217;s our role as designers when we are doing this work with people and trying to tell them, &#8220;This is the kind of product you need to make to get more sales and export you.&#8221; I just thought that we needed to reflect more on the work that we were doing. And I took a step back, and I started to apply to PhD programs in the mid, I don&#8217;t even even know how to call that decade in 2015. With no name.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So how did I end up here in the states? I actually got a Fulbright award. NC State, and the Fulbright Association have a good relationship. So it was a school that was recommended to me. I knew about the work that NC State was doing in education and design education. And that&#8217;s kind of how I ended up with the Fulbright Award. And because of NC State&#8217;s reputation, I ended up applying here, and coming here, and really enjoying the program. I spent three years here. I did not actually pursue the questions that I was thinking about pursuing, where I was thinking about design and development, because I was interested in education as well. My PhD is more tied to design education and developing critical design curriculum. So design curricula where people are asking hard questions about society. That was what my PhD research was about.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
But yeah, I spent three years here. Then I spent a year at Stanford and two years at Tulane. And now I&#8217;m back here at NC State. So I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s an origin story, but that&#8217;s a little bit of a story.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, that&#8217;s quite a journey. I think what I kind of want to pull from that is what drove you to really make these big jumps not just geographically, but culturally? I mean, you&#8217;re going from Trinidad to Brazil, then from Brazil back to Trinidad, and then from Trinidad to the states. So there&#8217;s that. But then also it seems like you&#8217;re also leveling up educationally and vocationally I should say, in each situation. You&#8217;re going to undergraduate in Brazil. You&#8217;re pursuing your masters and working in Trinidad. Now you&#8217;re pursuing your PhD in the states. What was driving you during that time? What was really fueling that ambition?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Oh my goodness. I don&#8217;t even know. So what got me to Brazil &#8230; or maybe I&#8217;ll give a kind of umbrella statement. I&#8217;ve had people around me who have made me feel that I could do anything. So it was like the openness of that conversation with my parents. So that challenge that they gave me, that got me to go to Brazil. That got me to find Brazil as a place to go to. Right? Or little things that I would&#8217;ve heard from that professor in undergrad that made me just feel fearless.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
For most of my adult or professional life, I have felt that I could do anything. I have to say I&#8217;m grateful to the people around me who have made me feel like I can do anything. I guess the leveling up is just kind of what had to be done. That was part of the opportunity. I wouldn&#8217;t really have come to the states maybe without doing the PhD. But again, the people around me just made me think, &#8220;Well okay, of course you can go and get a PhD. Why wouldn&#8217;t you be able to get a PhD?&#8221; You know? Or, &#8220;Of course go to Brazil. Why wouldn&#8217;t you be able to go to Brazil?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So I&#8217;ve had that kind of empowering language around me all the time. And that has opened up my world. I really would say though, that I credit my parents for giving me the openness to think of going to Brazil. And I will say to any parent who might be listening to this, that changed my whole outlook on life. Because learning a new language, learning a new culture, that kind of removed all of the barriers on the world. Because I was able to do that, encourage other parents, &#8220;Push your children to kind of open up their worlds a little bit more.&#8221; That open world will just continue to take you to other places.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So of course Brazil, that experience of going back and forth between Trinidad and Brazil for six years made it seem like going between Trinidad and Tanzania for a few months, or Trinidad and Kenya, it was just another thing like that. All of this travel, and getting to know new cultures, and new people, and understanding that the world happens differently for other people. And that curiosity of wanting to know more about how other people experience the world. All that started because of that very open experience I had, I think in undergrad.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And what is it that sort of keeps you motivated and inspired these days?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
There are a few things. I&#8217;m still very excited about conversations with other people in other parts of the world, and how they live, and think, and do. So the Pluriversal Design group is a little bit of that. How do we create a space where we can really listen to how other people, whoever other is, how people do things differently. So that&#8217;s one thing that continues to inspire me, just my curiosity about other people in the world. So that also affects the way that I do research, because that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m interested I suppose in anthropology, or anthropological methods, or ethnographic methods. Because I have that curiosity about the world and people.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
What continues to inspire me as well is that &#8230; well, this is where we get wishy washy, I suppose. Because I think my son, and my niece, and my nephew. What is the world that they&#8217;re going into? I suppose that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve always had this one area of research that has focused on child centered methods or questions that I think are from a child&#8217;s point of view, or questions about making things better for other children so that other children don&#8217;t have to deal with some of the legacy systems that we have that don&#8217;t work. I&#8217;ve been very interested in redesigning or challenging things that we think just have to be the way they are. Right? So one example I&#8217;ll give is we have an exam in Trinidad called the Common Entrance Exam. And that is actually one of the things that started my PhD research when I changed direction. I was like, &#8220;But why do we even have to have that exam?&#8221; And that&#8217;s why I started to do that research.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s something that continues to inspire me. How can we change the things that don&#8217;t work? And that&#8217;s also tied to my interest in futurism or Afrofuturism, because it&#8217;s how do we build new things, and new worlds, and new systems? How do we use design to do all of that? So I&#8217;m very interested in first having these critical conversations so that we could see clearly the things that don&#8217;t work, because sometimes we&#8217;ve been so brainwashed, that we don&#8217;t actually see the systems that don&#8217;t serve us. So everything that I do has to start off with that kind of conversation where we actually talk about what are the things that are wrong? But then we don&#8217;t just stay in that space of talking about the things that are wrong. We try to kind of move beyond that and take action through design. So I mean, that kind of social change also is something that motivates me as well. So I guess internally, it&#8217;s a curiosity. And then externally, it&#8217;s about changing systems, and fighting oppression, and social justice, and equity, and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you want to tell any designers out there listening who might be feeling a bit lost right now as to what to do with their future? And I&#8217;m asking this because I&#8217;ve had several people right into the show, particularly over the past two years, that maybe they just got out of design school through the pandemic. They got a job, but it&#8217;s not what they wanted, because they&#8217;re working from home, which is not really an ideal place for them to work, because this is their first job. And in some cases, it&#8217;s their first department.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then there&#8217;s also people that have been working at places &#8230; I mean, we&#8217;re recording this right now in mid-June. But there&#8217;s been a huge slate of design and layoffs in the tech community over the past couple of weeks now. And some people have just ridden into the show just wanting some advice like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to do now with my future.&#8221; What advice would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not actually going to give people the job advice. I&#8217;m going to ask them about the non-job stuff. Right? Or my advice might be about the non-job. So one thing is about finding community or creating community. So because your job might be fantastic, but maybe you&#8217;re lonely in your job. But it&#8217;s like we need other people to go along this journey with us. Right? And they make the process more interesting, more exciting. They might validate us as we do the work. So like for me personally, when we created that Pluriversal Design group, that kind of changed again my outlook on the world. Because my group was also then feeding me and my work, you know? So for people who might be a little bit lost, I would definitely advise them to make sure that they&#8217;re not just doing this alone. Right? And find these groups, whether there&#8217;s a meetup group about the area of design that you&#8217;re interested in. Or groups probably exist or you can create the group, but you don&#8217;t find that community.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
And then the other bit of advice I would give people is figure out what your passion project is so that you aren&#8217;t only pouring your energy or your creative energy into the work that your employer is giving you. There must be a side creative project that is also feeding you. And maybe that&#8217;s the project that you&#8217;ll get known for later on. Right? Or maybe that&#8217;s going to be the thing that&#8217;s really going to eventually take over, and pay your bills, and whatnot. Right?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
But I think that for me professionally, those two things of making sure that they&#8217;ve always been communities of support, and then making sure that I&#8217;m doing work that is very, very fulfilling and satisfying. Even if that&#8217;s not the work that the employer&#8217;s giving me. I think that those two components of me, and my life, and my work have been really important. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d recommend to young designers. Find that stuff. And then the professional work hopefully will get better because of those two buckets.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
And then maybe a third bit of advice I would give to young designers is just about, well this is tied to the community thing. Networking sounds crass or crude, but make sure that you are yes, meeting people and telling them about their work so that you&#8217;re not invisible. I think that that&#8217;s also really important to be talking to new people often about the work that you do. And that&#8217;s going lead into other opportunities in the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you appreciate the most about your life right now?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
I like gardening. But actually, because I talk about design in a very abstract way now, because I teach about the design process and maybe helping people to see the design process. This means that I now see the design process as I&#8217;m gardening, or as I&#8217;m cooking, or as I&#8217;m dressing in the morning. And all of this, I do appreciate. I really do love choosing where I&#8217;m going to put that gladioli bulb in my garden, or choosing which salt I&#8217;m going to use as I cook dinner. I think there&#8217;s a real ordinariness in my life now that I&#8217;m happy for. I&#8217;m very appreciative for. Because I move a lot. I&#8217;ve had like a lot of chaos I suppose, or kind of been in constant flux. So what I really appreciate now is not being in flux like that, and just being able to relax and watch the plants grow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work would you love to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So I really want to continue doing the civic and social innovation work that I&#8217;m doing. I do some of this work with a foundation. And I&#8217;d love to do more of it with other cities. So what I do is I work with a city for about nine months, and we address some issue that the city has been interested in. Right? And I really enjoy that work. I love working with design students at the College of Design. But I also love working with people who are using design for the first time.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So in five years&#8217; time, I hope to be doing more either public engagement or research around Design for Social Innovation. And working with cities and close to, whether here in North Carolina or back in Trinidad or in the Caribbean. But I really like that kind of public design work that is done with community members and maybe local government representatives, and having people co-create solutions to the issues that they&#8217;re concerned about. So I hope to be doing that more of that in five years&#8217; time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work? Where can they find all of that online?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m on a lot of different platforms. But actually, LinkedIn is probably the best place for people to find me. They just have to look for my name, Lesley-Ann Noel. L-E-S-L-E-Y. That&#8217;s the thing. So if they want to know more about the general work that I&#8217;m doing, LinkedIn is the place. As an academic, I&#8217;ll repost some of the academic articles that I&#8217;ve written on ResearchGate. And then I&#8217;m also pretty active on Twitter actually. But if people Google me, they&#8217;ll find me on some platform that they can reach out to me. And I actually do respond to people generally. But LinkedIn is generally the easiest place to find me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well Lesley-Ann Noel, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. This has been a long time coming I think. I feel like you and I have intersected quite a few times over the past few years, so I&#8217;m really glad to finally have you on the show. Not just to of course share your story and your research, but I think to inspire. I mean, so much of what you&#8217;re doing is about pursuing your own curiosities and interests. And I think that&#8217;s something sometimes as designers, we tend to lose sight of. Especially if you&#8217;re like working in product, I hate to say that. But if you&#8217;re working in UX or product, it&#8217;s hard to kind of see the forest for the trees sometimes because what you&#8217;re doing is so laden into a specific thing, whereas it sounds like at least you&#8217;ve been able to indulge a lot of your creativity across many different passions throughout your career, which is just super inspiring to hear about. I&#8217;m sure of course, we&#8217;ll hear about you now for years and years to come. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Thank you so much for the invitation. And I hope that at least this conversation is able to help people see that they could kind of craft a bit of a path that works for them. Even when the path looks like it&#8217;s been clearly marked, they could kind of shake up the path a little bit and do a little bit of what they want hopefully. So thank you for the invitation.</p>

<p>I think my conversation with this week&#8217;s guest &#8212; artist, musician, and designer Chris Burnett &#8212; is probably the most chill interview I&#8217;ve done this year. Don&#8217;t be fooled though &#8212; Chris is a creative dynamo, and someone you should definitely keep your eyes out for in the future. </p>
<p>We start off with a quick talk about the creative scene in Los Angeles, and from there he talks about being an artist at heart and how his current editorial design projects have been keeping him active. Chris also talked about growing up as a skate kid, attending Cal Arts, and scoring lucrative gigs including a stint with Nike, as well as designing for Odd Future. Chris calls himself a creative superhero, and if you trust your heart and spirit, so can you!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Hi, my name is Chris Burnett. I&#8217;m an artist, designer, musician, pretty much all around creative soul. It&#8217;s hard to peg me down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s the year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
This year and probably for most people, it&#8217;s been a very much transition year, buckling down on the things that I really want to be focusing on and being more selective with my time and my energy and my creative focus. So, it&#8217;s been good to narrow down the path of where I&#8217;m headed. It also coincides with me turning 30 in two weeks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s the beginning of a new decade, a new chapter. So, things have been shifting, but in a good way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s good. What would you say you&#8217;ve learned about yourself since last year?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve learned that I&#8217;m an artist at heart. That&#8217;s ultimately what I really want to do with my life and my creativity. I&#8217;ve been doing graphic design at this point for maybe eight years professionally. As much as I enjoy working with clients and collaborating on projects, there&#8217;s this burning desire in me to just be the artist that I want to be, have gallery shows, release albums, have more maybe design collaborations with companies and do things like that. So, yeah, things are in the works, things are in the works. It feels good to head towards the ultimate dream.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is L.A. a good city for that kind of creative collaboration? I feel like it is.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Well, yeah, I mean, L.A. is such an interesting creative scene, because you get people who come here from all over the world to pursue what they want to pursue. So, I&#8217;m constantly meeting people from all different walks of life, different types of creatives, whether that be musicians, other designers, other artists. So, it is pretty good for that. Although a lot of my work does come from people just reaching out to me by email and the collaboration happens more in a digital space, but I&#8217;m opening myself up more to relationships that I&#8217;m developing in the city. So, I have people that I can actually meet with in person and maybe visit their studios and see what they&#8217;re doing. So, yeah, if you wanted to find it in L.A., you could, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. We just had a fine artist on the show a few weeks ago in L.A. His name is Gabe Gault. I don&#8217;t know if that name sounds familiar.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
I haven&#8217;t heard of him.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He painted the world&#8217;s largest mural in Toledo, Ohio. I think it&#8217;s like an ongoing project, but he does a lot of fine art work. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re familiar with football, but his dad is Willie Gault-</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; who played for the Rams. Don&#8217;t get me talking about sports. I don&#8217;t know that much, but I do know that. It&#8217;s funny because I interviewed him and he kept throwing out like, &#8220;Yeah, my dad does sports. He&#8217;s in NFL and won a few Super Bowls.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; It didn&#8217;t click to me after the interview to be like, &#8220;Wait a minute, who is his dad? Oh, it makes sense, because they have the same last name.&#8221; Yeah, I can imagine that L.A. is a really great place for that creative collaboration. We&#8217;ve been seeing so much Black creativity come out of L.A., I think largely, due to Issa Rae and Kendrick Lamar and folks like that. We&#8217;ve seen a lot of what feels like specifically Black L.A. creativity.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m loving every bit of it. I was just watching Insecure yesterday. I think I caught up on the latest episode, but just to see that creativity coming out of the neighborhoods that I grew up in feels like finally we&#8217;re getting the recognition that is well-deserved.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So, talk to me about Colibri Studios. That&#8217;s a studio that you began last year. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). So, I started Colibri Studios in the middle of last year. It was right when everything went into lockdown, actually, which seems like it would be the least opportune moment to do it, but there&#8217;s an interesting story to how I went about it. I was in New York. I was visiting a friend of mine, and I&#8217;ve been working on a necklace design. I found this charm that I really liked to go in the end of the necklace, and it had a hummingbird in it. It was the first time I was designing a chain and I was really excited about it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
The hummingbird has special significance to me, because of the way that the animal moves throughout its life. It&#8217;s not really in your face. It&#8217;s secretive. But when you do see a hummingbird, it&#8217;s like this moment for you to be present with it and admire it. That&#8217;s how I feel about myself. I&#8217;m not really in the public eye per se. I&#8217;m not too show-offy. But when I do come around people, I make my presence felt. Honestly, I always see them, which is the weirdest thing. I&#8217;ll just be walking down the street and one will fly right in front of me. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;All right, there&#8217;s some weird connection here.&#8221; So yeah, I was designing this necklace.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
I get back from New York and the necklace is ready to be picked up. I get it and I&#8217;m so happy with the design that I thought, &#8220;That&#8217;s the logo. That&#8217;s the logo for the studio.&#8221; This was before I even really conceived of starting a studio. But once I had the necklace done, that was the moment where it was like, &#8220;Okay, this is a step in a new direction that you need to take.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
It became more clear to me over time that I wanted to create a studio that really just was an umbrella for all of my creative endeavors, whether that be music, fine art, design. I found an office space in West Hollywood. I woke up one morning. It was on Craigslist, found the space. The first one I clicked on was the one that I&#8217;m actually in now. It all came together step by step. So, there wasn&#8217;t really a big plan that I was conscious of. It was more these little moments that led to the establishment of the studio. So, that&#8217;s what it is right now at this point.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, you mentioned it being this umbrella. I went on your website. You&#8217;re doing art direction, you&#8217;re doing graphic design, you&#8217;re doing collage and mixed media work. Again, you mentioned music being part of that as well. What made you decide to do such a broad range of services, as opposed to just graphic design?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Well, I&#8217;ve always had this desire to really just be into one thing, but that&#8217;s just not how my life works. There&#8217;s so many creative outlets, and I&#8217;ve never felt limited to stick to just one. So, anything that I pursue, I want to do it to the best of my ability. If I can provide those services for other people, whether that&#8217;s producing music for people or working on an ad campaign for someone or just creating my own artwork that will eventually show in a gallery, I just wanted it to feel like it was a part of one family. So, that&#8217;s why I wanted to include all these different artistic mediums in it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me about how you approach a new project. What does your process look like?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Well, it really depends on the context of the project. So, if we can start with a typical design project, I&#8217;ll get an email from a random person. I&#8217;m always amazed by how people find me because I&#8217;m not on Instagram or social media. I&#8217;m hidden, right? So, I&#8217;ll just get an email out of the blue. Someone&#8217;s saying, &#8220;Hey, we think you might be great for this project we&#8217;re working on.&#8221; We move forward with a brief, which is them giving me a document of what they&#8217;re looking for and maybe the end deliverables and the goals that they want to hit. And then I get to work.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
The process of me actually getting to work is not really standardized in the sense that I don&#8217;t have a list of things that I do every time I start a project. It&#8217;s really based on feeling and it&#8217;s more intuitive, because it allows me to be a bit more spontaneous with the end product. If I had the same process every time, I feel like it might be too stale for me and I might come up with the same thing too much. So, I allow for space in between projects for me to just sit and think about new directions or think about things I want to explore and then try to align those new things with what a client might be asking. Typically, it works out.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
For the most part, a client will ask for what I&#8217;m already good at. They don&#8217;t really ask for things that are completely outside of my wheelhouse. That allows me to use the skills that I already have, but then push it in a little bit of a new direction. Sometimes that creates a back and forth where there&#8217;s notes and there&#8217;s feedback, of course. And then sometimes I hit it right on the head and people are happy with what I create first try. So, it really depends on the project that I&#8217;m being asked to work on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I would also imagine, because like you said, you&#8217;re not on social media and folks have to go to your website and look through your work. By the time they&#8217;ve done that, hopefully, that&#8217;s a pretty good metric for you to see that this is someone that you would possibly want to work with. I&#8217;m pretty sure you have, but I don&#8217;t know. Have you ever gotten the client that has just been completely not a fit?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Oh, yeah, yeah, yes. It&#8217;s funny, because me and one of my designer buddies, we always have this joke that what we show on our website is typically the type of work that we want to receive, which is why we put it there. But there definitely will be times where someone will hit me up and just be like, &#8220;Hey, I need you to design just a simple logo.&#8221; It&#8217;s not that I can&#8217;t design a logo, but that&#8217;s not really where my skillset lies and my strengths are.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
So, I can do it, but then the process becomes a little muddied when it&#8217;s not something that I&#8217;m too passionate about. They&#8217;re maybe expecting the crazy, colorful collage type stuff, but it&#8217;s a logo. So, I can&#8217;t really do that for a logo. Yeah, there have been moments where it doesn&#8217;t work, but I&#8217;m learning which projects to say yes and no to now that I&#8217;ve been doing this for so long.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. What are some of the projects that you&#8217;re working on now?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
So, a lot of the things that I&#8217;ve been doing now is a lot of editorial illustration, which I&#8217;ve found that that really suits my strengths really well. It&#8217;s mostly image making, which is my favorite thing in the world to do is just create a compelling image to look at. So, when you pair that with an article for, say, The New York Times or the Guardian, that&#8217;s where I get to really flex my abilities. Over the past year, I&#8217;d probably gotten the most editorial illustration work than I ever have.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
There&#8217;s also a lot of merch design, merchandise design for artists in the music industry. That&#8217;s always ongoing. There&#8217;s always artists who need things to sell on the road or sell on their website. I help with a lot of that stuff. Some of its like under wraps because people don&#8217;t want to release info about music projects that they might be doing. But yeah, most stuff in the music industry and editorial illustration, I&#8217;d say, are my two big ones.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there a specific type of client that you prefer to work with?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
I&#8217;m always open to new types of clients, people that I haven&#8217;t worked with before just to be able to stretch myself and see, &#8220;What industries can I adapt my creativity towards?&#8221; But I think I do love working in the music industry. It&#8217;s fun to work with artists that you admire. It&#8217;s fun to work with artists that you&#8217;re playing their music in your car when you&#8217;re driving around and you get to work on something that&#8217;s for their project. It&#8217;s fun to be a part of things like that. I love editorial. I don&#8217;t know what it is about it. It&#8217;s just the pairing of an image with an article is like a dream project. It&#8217;s like they&#8217;re little, tiny dream projects, because they&#8217;re really quick and the turnaround time is super-fast, usually within a week or a couple days.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
It&#8217;s typically within those industries like editorial that there&#8217;s a little more room for creative freedom, because they&#8217;re trying to see how you would interpret the article and how that article maybe is reflected in your style and your own sensibility. So, that&#8217;s why I like it a lot, because there&#8217;s not too many notes. There&#8217;s not too much canceling of ideas. It&#8217;s very open ended, which I love.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I don&#8217;t know why for some reason, I would imagine working with musicians might be temperamental, but I guess like you said, if it&#8217;s an artist that you really like, it probably makes it a bit of an easier match.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Well, that&#8217;s a good point. I mean, they&#8217;re definitely artists I&#8217;ve worked with in the past who are artists. An artist comes in mind a lot. There&#8217;s a certain temperament like you said that goes along with it. But I think the reason that I enjoy it and the reason I think I&#8217;m able to do it is because I am also an artist, so I understand that sensibility. It allows me to be as flexible as I need to be when working with them. It also informs my own practice of how I go about my music or my art as well. So, it&#8217;s fun. It&#8217;s a double-edged sword for sure, but I do like it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I just want to say to the audience, I don&#8217;t know if Chris is being a little humble now, but his music is really good. It&#8217;s really good.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Thank you, thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
With your permission, I&#8217;d like to link to your SoundCloud because I was doing research for the interview and I just put the music on. I was like, &#8220;This is good. This is good.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I can hear this on Insecure. I can hear this on Insecure. It&#8217;s pretty good.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Oh, man. I would love for that to happen, but this is their final season. I&#8217;m so sad. Yeah, but thank you. I really appreciate that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, no, I guess to that end, talking about Black art and things like that, we started to see over the past few years that with this influx in Black television shows and movies and stuff, we&#8217;re really starting to see a much wider range of artists, not just musical artists, but visual artists and stuff portrayed through these works. We had Gabe Gault who I mentioned before on the show, and he&#8217;s mentioned that his work has been in a television show. We had Dawn Okoro, who&#8217;s an artist in Austin. Her work has been on a BT show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m wondering, because we hear so much about this Black creative renaissance and you hear about it through these visual artists, does that exposure help you in any way? I don&#8217;t know. Has your work been out there in that way where you feel like you&#8217;ve got an exposure because it&#8217;s been amplified through, say, a musical artist or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Not necessarily. I guess this is a little hard to explain and this is the whole point of the studio, which is funny, is that because I think the hummingbird is such a secretive animal and it&#8217;s very hidden, because it&#8217;s so small and it moves really fast, I&#8217;ve settled into the idea that my work doesn&#8217;t necessarily exist in a public space as much as it could and I&#8217;m okay with that. I think when the time comes, some more visibility might help. But in the meantime, I still get to work with the people I love working with. Whether I&#8217;m publicly associated with them or not is not really what I&#8217;m focusing on. It&#8217;s just, &#8220;How do we make the best possible thing for this person? Or if it&#8217;s for me, how do I make the best possible thing for myself and share it?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
I mean, that doesn&#8217;t mean that I haven&#8217;t had moments where my work was recognized and especially recognized for the culture. There was an article in The New York Times Magazine, I think this was last year, I&#8217;m not too sure, but by Isabel Wilkerson. She just wrote a book called Caste that explores the idea of racism, but not through a racist ideology. It&#8217;s through a caste system, which is a whole another way of looking at it. I did these two collage pieces for the article in The Times. It was heavily centered around Black imagery and police brutality. That was the first time that I actually incorporated imagery into my work.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
It was a very enlightening moment, because I did the collages by hand. I was cutting out images of MLK hanging out with Mahatma Gandhi. I was cutting out images of African American men on the floor with police pointing guns at their heads. It was the first time that I started to have my work speak in a way that was relevant to what was actually happening. That was really eye-opening for me and that led me down a whole new trajectory with my art. But in those instances, I really enjoy when I can speak to what&#8217;s happening in the now and speak to the culture.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve just always been really curious about that, because I want to make sure&#8230; I mean, I&#8217;m saying this like I&#8217;m the singular person that can make this happen, but I want to see that Black artists, visual artists, graphic artists, particularly with their work being featured in entertainment get just as much shine as the show that the artists featured on or the actor that might be in front of the art and the piece. I don&#8217;t know. Something like that, it&#8217;s making me think of&#8230; Are you familiar with Brent Rollins? Does that name sound familiar?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
No. Who&#8217;s Brent Rollins?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, my God. So, Brent Rollins, so he was on episode 400, but Brent Rollins is like&#8230; I forget the moniker that I saw when I was researching, but it was like your favorite hip-hop artist&#8217;s favorite designer or something like. He designed the logo for Boys in the Hood when he was, I think, 19. He designed the logo for Poetic Justice when he was 20. He was rolling in that crew with Ice Cube and John Singleton back in the day. He did a bunch of work in the &#8217;90s and 2000s Ego Trip. God, I can&#8217;t remember the name of the magazine. It&#8217;s escaping me but it&#8217;s episode 400 if people are listening. Go back and listen to it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Hell yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There were these shows on VH1. One was called Race-O-Rama. One was called&#8230; I think it was White rapper showcase or something or a reality show or something like that. He had his hand in all these really interesting things around hip hop culture, but it was through his design and eye. So, a lot of stuff that you see in Vibe Magazine and stuff for the &#8217;90s and 2000s was heavily influenced by him and his work. He is such a cool ass, behind-the-scenes dude.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Him and I were talking. He was like, &#8220;Yeah, man, I did this and did this. I exhibited here and there.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Do you understand, I grew up on your work, watching your stuff, looking at your stuff at Vibe magazine, be like I want to design like that?&#8221;, and was just being so humble about it. I knew who he was because I ended up doing the research on it, but I don&#8217;t think the average hip hop fan knows who Brent Rollins is. That&#8217;s not to say that diminishes Brent&#8217;s work in any way, but why is he not as recognized as artists from that time?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Yeah, well, I think there&#8217;s a couple of levels to it. I think, on a larger scale, typically, designers are in the background, because the work is what speaks to the public, right? So, if I&#8217;m designing a logo for a company, my face isn&#8217;t going to be the face of the company, but the logo will, right? So, there&#8217;s never really been a need for the designer to be in the public eye as much as maybe the person who runs the company, or say, if you&#8217;re working for an artist, the artist is the one who is getting all the focus. So, the designer falls to the background.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
I think we&#8217;re starting to see a shift in that, especially in Black culture, with people like Virgil Abloh, who became almost like designer of the year for every year for a long time at this point. But he came from Kanye&#8217;s group, and he started to create the idea that designer can be the public figure also and not just be the one that sits in the background. So, I think that tide is starting to shift and we&#8217;re starting to see it. It also happens in music too. Back then, producers were always just behind the boards and you never really knew who was producing the music, but now, the producers are just as big as some of the artists. So, we&#8217;re seeing that shift take place and I think that&#8217;s really cool. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;ll happen to me, but it&#8217;s all right. I don&#8217;t mind being in the shadows.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, that&#8217;s true. I do hope to see that day where the designers and the visual artists get that same level of recognition or at least name recognition, where folks know. They look at something. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s a Chris Burnett,&#8221; if they see a collage or something like that, that thing.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, I&#8217;m definitely developing a visual language and a style that feels really specific to me. So, there are certain recognizable aspects of my work. As I&#8217;ve ventured more into music, I&#8217;m definitely going to be presenting myself and my person out there. So, maybe the moment where the tide turns and this all becomes more public is right around the corner.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There you go.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, tell me what it was like growing up in L.A.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Growing up in L.A., yeah, I grew up in South Central, specifically Manchester and Vermont for anyone who knows that area. It wasn&#8217;t really the best neighborhood at the time. There was a lot of gang violence, a lot of drugs. Police relations with the community were not great. Growing up, there definitely had an impact on me, although my parents were very, very careful in what they allowed me and my older brother to do. We weren&#8217;t really allowed to go outside after certain time. I didn&#8217;t really have many friends in the neighborhood, because that was the way that I could get caught up in some of the wrong stuff.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
So, a lot of my time was spent creating indoors, whether that was drawing or painting or my parents would put me in art classes at a pretty young age just to keep me occupied and doing something that I enjoyed versus running around my neighborhood, getting into trouble, like a lot of the kids who were there probably did. It wasn&#8217;t until I went to high school that I was taking the bus to high school to public transport. That was the first time I got a little taste of freedom. I started skateboarding at the same time. So, I would take the bus to skate parks and start to explore a little bit. That was when I really started to understand the neighborhood a little bit better.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
It wasn&#8217;t as dangerous as it was when I was a little kid, but yeah, it definitely influenced my practice and my behavior in terms of I like the area I grew up in, because to me, it feels real. It feels very honest. Where I live now is actually a completely different environment. At this point, I&#8217;m not sure that I want to stay there as much, because every time I go home to visit my folks, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I actually really liked this neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Maybe I was scared of it when I was a kid, but now I&#8217;m an adult and I know how to move. Certain things become illuminated when you&#8217;re in different stages of your life. So, back then, it was a little intimidating, but now it&#8217;s more enticing, especially they just built the big stadium in Inglewood. That&#8217;s 10 minutes from where I grew up. So, there are things that are happening in that area that wouldn&#8217;t necessarily happen. Resources are coming back down there, which I think is great. So, I might move down. Who knows? We&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
L.A. is so big.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Yeah, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was there actually, for the first time last year. We were set to do a live tour throughout 2020 last year. We started off in L.A. and did our first live show out there.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I live in Atlanta, which is pretty spread out, but L.A. is gargantuan in terms of scale. I was in the Korea Town neighborhood initially and then we did the live show. We did that down in Leimert Park, but I didn&#8217;t really get to see L.A. I saw a couple of neighborhoods.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, there&#8217;s always the pockets that people go to, but there&#8217;s a lot of hidden treasures in this city. It takes time. It takes time of living here or just having the time to explore. You got to have a car. You got to drive everywhere. But yeah, it&#8217;s massive. It&#8217;s massive, massive, massive, massive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, you grew up studying art. You were taking art classes and everything. Eventually, you went to college. You went to CalArts. What was that experience like?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
CalArts, for me, was extremely transformative. At this point, I was coming out of high school. I took a graphic design course in high school. So, that&#8217;s how I knew that&#8217;s what I wanted to study in college. So, I applied to a couple different art schools in California. I didn&#8217;t really want to leave the state. The minute I stepped on the CalArts Campus for a tour is the minute that I knew that was the place I needed to be. I didn&#8217;t really even do that much research, I&#8217;ll be honest, but the feeling I got when I arrived there, it felt like I definitely made the right decision.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
The thing that I loved about that school was that there were so many disciplines in one roof. There was acting, there was costume design, there was character animation, there&#8217;s graphic design, there&#8217;s fine arts, there was music, there was set design. There was all kinds of creative people who come from all over the world to study and perfect their craft. So, that period of time really opened my eyes to all the things that maybe I didn&#8217;t get to experience growing up, especially because my parents were really careful about what I was exposed to. Once I got to CalArts, it was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m an individual now. I&#8217;m going to do it or what. I can explore. I can see what life really has to offer.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
It was in a bubble of CalArts, but still, within that bubble, there were so many different pockets to explore. A lot of the friends I have now are people from that school. A lot of the people that I try to keep in touch with creatively are people from that school. It was just a really transformative time. I think it really allowed me to grow up. I&#8217;ve always been the youngest one in my friend circles. I have funny stories.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
When I got to CalArts, I still maybe looked like a 13-year-old or 14-year-old. It was very strange. People would walk up to me and say, &#8220;Do you go here? Are you lost?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No, man, I&#8217;m headed to the movie class right now.&#8221; It was really interesting. It was that time for me to grow up and grow into myself. I wouldn&#8217;t trade those four years for the world. Even though I picked up some student debt from it, we all have a little bit of that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is that where you met Bijan?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
That&#8217;s where I met Bijan, yeah. So, Bijan was my classmate all four years. What happens at CalArts in the design program is that you share a studio. In the graphic design program, you share a studio with your entire year level. So, there were about 19 to maybe 21 of us in our first year, which was pretty large for an incoming class. Bijan was in that class with me. We actually met the day we had a portfolio review. We didn&#8217;t know each other. We were just both coming from our high schools and trying to show our work to get accepted. He was literally standing in line right in front of me. Lo and behold, we both got accepted and ended up in the same class.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Bijan was and still is one of my best friends. He became this creative rival, but in the best way possible, where if he was doing something, I would see what he&#8217;s doing and be like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s really good. Okay, now I got to do something that&#8217;s really good.&#8221; And then he would see what I was doing and it would level him up and then he would level me up. We ping pong off each other like that until we graduated.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. It&#8217;s good to have that creative tension in a way, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
For sure. I&#8217;m really competitive. So, whether it&#8217;s in sports or in making a cool poster, I feel that edge or that desire to want to be the best and bring the best out of myself and others. So, we really thrived on that with each other.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. For folks that are listening, who are like, &#8220;Who is Bijan?&#8221; Bijan Berahimi founded&#8230; Actually, YouTube co-founded FISK together. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
A studio called FISK, like the HBCU but not the HBCU.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Yeah, not the college. Everybody knows. So, this came about in our first year. It&#8217;s actually a collaboration between a bunch of our classmates. We wanted to create a website where we could showcase student work and just have a digital space for us to talk about design as students. A lot of us contributed to the website. We had a thing called Things We&#8217;ve Stolen, which was posters that we stole from the walls of CalArts. We would feature them on the website. There&#8217;s a large poster culture at that school. We would interview other designers who were working professionally and ask them questions about the transition from student life to professional life.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
We would have zines, where we asked students in the program to submit artwork, and then we would throw a party for the zine release. It was a myriad of things when we were in school. After we all graduated, we settled into our own pockets and practices. Bijan decided to resurrect FISK in Portland, and that&#8217;s when it became the studio. I wasn&#8217;t a part of inauguration of the studio per se, but the initial idea was a very collaborative thing. It still is to this day. He runs it out of Portland and has a couple employees and they&#8217;re doing great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Speaking of Portland, after you graduated, you did eventually head to Portland, because you had an opportunity with Nike, which we&#8217;ll get to, but you had another opportunity that happened to you senior year where you got to work with a pretty well-known music group. Can you talk about that?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s actually a crazy story about how that happens. So, my third year of college, we had a project that was to design a magazine of a subculture, any subculture of our choice. I decided at that point, I wanted to focus on Odd Future because they had just started to gain a little traction. I think they were doing most of their stuff independently. It was something that I really resonated with, because of that DIY spirit and because they were from where I was from. It was just cool to see kids like me doing cool stuff. So, I decided to make my magazine about Odd Future.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
I designed the whole thing, printed the whole thing. I gave it to my brother, who was friends with Travis, who used to go by Taco, just so they could see it and be aware of me. I don&#8217;t know if Travis ever got the magazine. I have no idea where the magazine was. I would love to see it because it&#8217;s been so long. But I did that in hopes that that would be my connection point with them. So, they can know that I&#8217;m over here doing my thing. They&#8217;re over there doing their thing. Nothing really came of that. So, by the time fourth year came around, I was setting my sights on other jobs and other opportunities.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Randomly, on a trip to Joshua Tree with Bijan, I get an email in the car from a guy who&#8217;s running an agency that&#8217;s handling all of Odd Future&#8217;s merchandising and branding and things like that. He goes, &#8220;Hey, Chris, I saw your work. Would you love to come work for Odd Future?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;What, a year later, what?&#8221; It was so random and I was not expecting it, but immediately, I said yes. So, that was midway through the end of my time at CalArts. I started interning there. So, I would have class. After class, I would get in my car and drive all the way back down to L.A. to work with them for a couple of hours, come back to school, do my schoolwork.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
That was a balance that I struck at the end of my fourth year until I graduated and then I just started working for them full time. That was a crazy experience for me. It was one of those dream moments where these are artists that I really respect and admire. They&#8217;re doing really cool things musically, visually. Just the fact that I got to be a part of it for that span in my life was pretty amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a dope story. I mean, when you think of Odd Future and of course, Tyler the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt and-</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you think of their whole persona, it&#8217;s so hard to pin down. I feel like you could just say, &#8220;Oh, Black Skater,&#8221; or whatever, but it&#8217;s so much more than that. I think particularly Tyler, I remember Tyler had this show on Vice a few years ago called Nuts and Bolts.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Yeah, I love that show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He was doing all these different design things. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m designing apparel, I&#8217;m designing a shoe or something like that. I&#8217;m designing furniture.&#8221; He was doing all this interesting design stuff. This was going on, I think, right around the time there was also this reality show on YouTube that I&#8217;ve mentioned on the show before called Lace Up, which is basically, a sneaker design reality show contest thing. Because you know, there&#8217;s a PENSOLE Academy in Portland.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, definitely familiar.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So, Dr. D&#8217;Wayne Edwards, by the way, but he runs that school. He did this reality show on YouTube, where he was bringing in designers to design shoes and stuff. I remember, I would watch that and I would watch Nuts and Bolts and be like, &#8220;Why is nobody talking about these design shows?&#8221; I mean, their style is so hard for me to pinpoint. I think most people know Odd Future because of their donut logo. But what stuff were you doing? How did that creative process look like?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Yeah, that was definitely wild for sure. I mean, by the time I started helping with a lot of the merchandise and the clothing, there was definitely a visual aesthetic that was already established. That was primarily Tyler&#8217;s ideas and the group&#8217;s ideas. When I hopped on board, there was definitely a lane to work within. There was definitely visuals that I could reference, things that I knew they liked, things that I knew they didn&#8217;t like to stay away from. So, a lot of the times, what would happen is I&#8217;d be in the office with&#8230; There was me. There&#8217;s another designer named Aaron Martinez, shout out to Aaron.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
There&#8217;s another designer named Phil, who handled mostly the Golf Wang stuff, which was separate from the Odd Future stuff at the time. So, they were the two creative directors, for me, at least. They would pinpoint where I should take things and what directions I should go in. But a lot of the time, the guys, the group of artists and the music makers and the whole clique would just show up at the office. We would have these meetings where they would just pitch ideas to us. I remember Jasper one time saying, &#8220;I want a dolphin on the Empire State Building smoking a blunt.&#8221; I just graduated with a design degree. I was like, &#8220;How am I going to do this weird photo manipulated illustration and pull this off and then put it on a T-shirt? This is wild. It&#8217;s so weird.&#8221; But I ended up doing it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
It actually became one of my favorite pieces, even those one of the strangest things in the world. Yeah, they would just come in. We would print everything out, have these just big jam sessions of getting everyone&#8217;s thoughts and ideas and opinions. If they liked what we did, they would rock with it. If not, they would exit immediately and say, &#8220;Do this differently,&#8221; or &#8220;Do a different thing over here and maybe change the color of this and tweak this a little bit.&#8221; So, it was a super, super collaborative process and really wild to just hang out with them, because this was really at the peak of their stardom as a group. Super interesting, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you have an Odd Future name? Did they give you a name or something?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
No, this is another thing that contributes to me being in the shadows. I didn&#8217;t really try to infiltrate into the group like that. I knew that they were already so tight knit and close friends. I&#8217;ve never really been the type to try to eat off of someone else&#8217;s success. So, I purposefully was like, &#8220;It&#8217;s cool. I enjoy working with you guys. I enjoy creating these things for you, but I&#8217;m just going to take my place in the backseat and watch you guys do your thing.&#8221; It was so fun for me just to do that. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can&#8217;t imagine how some of those design sessions might have went. Just the ideas and the crazy shit that they come up with I imagine is&#8230; I mean, I think for any really strong visual designer, that&#8217;s a dream to have a client or to have someone that has that creative capacity to just do whatever.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Yeah, it was definitely really freeing, especially to come from CalArts, which was a similar environment in terms of the freedom of creativity that we had in school and to have that as my first full time gig, I couldn&#8217;t ask for anything better. It was great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, after working with them, you got an opportunity to work with Nike, which then eventually had you go to Portland. If you could sum up your time at Nike in one phrase, what would it be?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Oh, man. One phrase, working at Nike, you put me on the spot. I would say high level hierarchy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
I mean, I might have to explain that a little bit. When I say high level, I guess I mean, the quality of work that was being produced and the scale of work, the amount of people that would see it, the amount of reach that it had, that&#8217;s what I mean by high level. When I say hierarchy, there&#8217;s such a system in play. It&#8217;s such a large corporate company like that, that sometimes creativity and new ideas are not necessarily accepted, because it doesn&#8217;t fall within the framework of what has been successful for them as a company. So, I&#8217;ve always understood that before I started working there, so I wasn&#8217;t going in thinking that it would be another Odd Future.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
I went in knowing that, okay, this is going to be a big place where there&#8217;s a lot of moving parts. There&#8217;s a lot of things that I can&#8217;t control. There&#8217;s a lot of things that I don&#8217;t have any impact over. So, it was a humbling experience to be able to contribute my ideas to such a large and fast moving company, but then it also, for me, told me that that environment wasn&#8217;t necessarily the one that I wanted to be in for a long time in terms of work in the design world. But it was definitely a great learning experience to get my feet wet. Being a professional was cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, we&#8217;ve had a few designers on the show before that have worked at Nike and I don&#8217;t know if they all liked it. In a way, it&#8217;s good, because it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, this is Nike.&#8221; Like you said, there is this high level reach, but each person we&#8217;ve had on has said, it&#8217;s not a great place to work.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, there&#8217;s certain aspects of it that are really difficult to stomach if you&#8217;re not capable of grinding it out. I think one of the bigger things that I had to do when I was there was just work a lot. When we needed to get a project done, we were up very late working on it on campus until it was done. It really instilled a good work ethic for me, but as far as being a sane human being, it did not contribute to that at all. So, yeah, that was a really difficult part of it, especially coming in as a young designer, who had new ideas and maybe I wanted to bring new innovations to the way they were thinking about design. It&#8217;s not that they didn&#8217;t want to listen. It&#8217;s that they already understood what works for them.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
So, for a group of young designers to come in and just shake everything up and try all these new things, it&#8217;s not really something they were looking for at the time. Now that Virgil cracked open the door with his initial The Ten collaboration, the shoes, where he was messing with the swoosh and change the game, putting it in different locations where they would never do that, it&#8217;s really opened the door for them to expand their creativity to a whole new level, which we&#8217;ve been seeing lately. But when I was there, it was still very much you play by the book, because this is the recipe that has worked for them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, if they know that it&#8217;s going to work all these different times, we&#8217;re not really looking for any variations on that. They just need you to do the same thing.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Right. At the end of the day, if we&#8217;re being honest, they&#8217;re a company, they&#8217;re a business, and they need to make money. So, if they&#8217;re experimenting too much and it messes with their stock price or some of the shareholders get upset, it&#8217;s going to trickle down. That&#8217;s what I mean by hierarchy is that there&#8217;s so many layers to it, that it&#8217;s really impossible as one designer to go in there and really have your voice heard, but to each their own.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. But I mean, like you say, because of the crucible that that design environment is, like you say, it&#8217;s strengthened your work ethic and I&#8217;m sure probably has helped you out in some way now as a designer, just having that experience working there.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Oh, yeah, for sure. So, there were two stints that I did at Nike. The first one was in brand design for sportswear and that was my first experience there. Honestly, all of my co-workers were amazing people. I had a great time working with them. It was, like I said, grinding out a lot, just working hard on campaigns. We were doing the overarching branding system that would then be sent out to all the different categories around the world. They would apply what we designed to whatever product was being released. So, that was really cool to see that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
And then the second stint was for the Olympics, for Rio &#8217;16. That was wow. If I thought the first stint was crazy, the second one was&#8230; I don&#8217;t even know how I lasted, but it definitely helped put a work ethic into my brain. So, if I need to work on something, I will get it done. There&#8217;s no excuses. They always said at Nike, there&#8217;s no finish line. That&#8217;s one of the taglines. The reason I say that is work just keeps on going and innovation keeps on happening. Things don&#8217;t really stop. Even though we&#8217;re running, we&#8217;re putting our all in, things just keep moving and keep going and keep evolving. It&#8217;s a tough environment to be in if you&#8217;re not used to that type of pace of work. But if you&#8217;re down for it, it can really instill a good work ethic in you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s how I was when I worked at AT&#038;T. AT&#038;T was one of these places, you walk in and they have this huge banner over their big marble reception desk that says, &#8220;Shaping human capital,&#8221; or something. You&#8217;d go and there would be this never-ending firehose of work. I think when we go in, we were always six months behind on something. Salespeople just kept selling and the work just kept coming in. So, you&#8217;re never caught up. We had, I think, roughly about 36 designers that were working there in teams of 12. They had this floor to ceiling LED board. So, everything that you design had a point value to it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
No way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
As a designer, I think when I started, you have to hit 36 points at the end of the week and then eventually up to the 40. But everything you design had a point value. So, if you design a banner, that&#8217;s point nine points. If you design a three-page website, that&#8217;s five points. If you design a 10-pager, that&#8217;s nine points. So, you could hit your total pretty easily if you just design four websites in a week or something like that. I mean, this was 2006. You would pull the order from the system.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They have this system called Ice Blue. I don&#8217;t work there anymore. So, even if all this stuff is proprietary, I don&#8217;t care, but they have this thing called Ice Blue and you pull your rec. So, you have to go to a file cabinet, fish out the envelopes, this is my paper, fish out the envelopes that had all the assets in it. It was usually printed out Word files, scraps that the salespeople got from the company of their logo drawn on a napkin or something. You have to go to the scanner. I&#8217;m dating myself, you have to go to the scanner. There was one computer with the scanner for 36 designers.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Oh, my God.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, you had to go to the scanner, scan your stuff in, mail it to yourself, because we didn&#8217;t have Dropbox because it didn&#8217;t exist then. You mail it to yourself, you get back to your station, and then you have to trace it out. We were using Dreamweaver because it&#8217;s 2006. You basically had to build a website, retype all the information and everything. Eventually, you got faster because it&#8217;s one thing to do the actual coding and the design work and Photoshop and Illustrator, whatever, but then you&#8217;ve got all this other operational stuff you have to do like pull the rec and scan and do this and return the folder and walk it over to QA, physically walk it over to QA and all this stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Eventually, you get better just in terms of speed. So, I could knock out four or five websites in a week. If I got the packet in the morning, I could finish it by lunch. And then I could pick up on that lunch and then finish it by the time I was ready to go home. Again, this was 2006. So, this was right around the time when table-based layout was being phased out and CSS layouts were being phased in. I mean, we fired some people because they couldn&#8217;t get it. They did not know how to convert the tables to CSS, so they weren&#8217;t getting it. We fired people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
God, this was a long, long time ago. But eventually, I like made a little CSS work template or something that I could easily just plop in and change the value so I could get quicker with it. I still use that to this day, principles from that. But it&#8217;s one of those things where if I wasn&#8217;t in that type of design environment, would I even know to do something like that? You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Exactly, exactly. So, do you think that having the point system actually helped people stay on track in terms of what they needed to get done? Because I mean, that&#8217;s almost public accountability for the work that you have to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, yes and no. For some people, it really freaked them out. Because if you didn&#8217;t hit your number, because you could see how everyone on the team was doing at any given point in time. So, you could see what your number was and who was above you and who was below you. So, it was one thing for you to know the number but now everyone else knows your number. So, you&#8217;ll be sitting at lunch and someone will come and be like, &#8220;You got to get the numbers up.&#8221; Keep in mind, we only could take a 15-minute lunch. So, you have to wolf down your sandwich or whatever that you brought from home.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And there would just be random people, random supervisors that don&#8217;t even work on your team will just come by you. Points look a little low this week. I don&#8217;t need that kind of pressure. I&#8217;m trying to try to get the work done. I don&#8217;t know if it helped. I mean, certainly, it&#8217;s one of those things where you either cut it or you don&#8217;t, but you definitely knew at any given point in time where you stood. Eventually, it got to the point where they upped the amount of points you have to get and then they lowered the point value of the items. So, you have to crank out more work to get to a higher target. It was a mess. I left there and said, &#8220;I have to do my own thing.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t want to work for another place after that. I think similarly, when you left Nike, you started freelancing too. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Yes. So, between those two stints that I just mentioned, after the first one was when I decided to leave. I just had a nine-month contract, so I never actually took full time at Nike. I was what was called ETW, it&#8217;s like a temporary worker. My contract was up after nine months. I decided that I wanted to try my hand at freelancing, which is something I had never done before. The funny thing is even coming off of the new work ethic that I just developed, all the skills and connections that I had made, freelancing did not really work for me. I think it was because I lacked motivation to do so just because I was coming off of nine months of very, very grueling work. Having this time to set hours for myself, it made me not really want to do that much work and almost like take a vacation.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
So, in that period of time, I was focusing a lot on my music and a lot of my artwork, but I wasn&#8217;t really successful at the freelance thing. So, by the time the Rio Olympics had come around, the guy who wanted me to work with him on his team, Ibrahim Hassan, shout out to Ibrahim, he became my mentor in that moment. He wanted me to come back and work on the Olympics. So, that&#8217;s when I went back. That was even more grueling than the first time, but I learned so much more by working with him and working with our team that it was very much worth it for me to do it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
But after that, I knew that that was it, that I couldn&#8217;t keep doing it. That&#8217;s when I went freelance. The second time around it, it clicked for me. I&#8217;m not necessarily sure what I changed. I think I was just more hungry to make it work, because it didn&#8217;t work the first time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. I mean, I think, with freelancing, for me, when I first started out, I left in late 2008, I just quit my job. I was like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do this anymore,&#8221; and started my studio. I&#8217;d say maybe those first three or four months were rough, because even though I was like, &#8220;I got all the skills, I know people XYZ,&#8221; finding the work ended up being difficult. It wasn&#8217;t so much that I couldn&#8217;t do it. It was just finding the right clients.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then eventually, I did end up working for a client. It was a political client. And then working on that campaign kickstarted my studio and kept me going. If I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten into that, I don&#8217;t know if I would have continued freelancing. I don&#8217;t want to say I have to link up with someone. But once you got the right client and it clicked, then you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, I can keep doing this.&#8221; It makes sense. You had worked with an agency called Ceremony of Roses when you were freelancing, right?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Right. So, after I left Nike the second time, I think there was a stint in between where I went overseas, just to travel around for a little bit. That was maybe three months in Southeast Asia, which was really fun. By the time I came back, I did another short contract at Jordan, which was still on Nike campus, so in that world, but just for the Jordan Brand instead. And then after that, it was like, &#8220;All right, I think I&#8217;m going to move home to L.A.&#8221; At the time, that agency, Ceremony of Roses had reached out to me and was like, &#8220;We have a position open at our agency down in L.A.&#8221; It was literally perfect timing because I was already moving back home.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
That&#8217;s when I decided that I was going to take that job down in L.A. when I got back. They were heavily focused on music, so a completely different world than sports and branding. They had a lot of clients in the music industry. Their main bread and butter was merchandising and creating the brand that surrounded the artists, whether that&#8217;s from tour announcements and flyers and posters to actual merchandising to websites to things for them to post on social media. So, in a similar way to the agency that I worked with for Odd Future, who was just handling a lot of the creativity, that&#8217;s what Ceremony of Roses was, but in a updated and more efficient way, I&#8217;d like to say. I stayed there for about two years.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
My timelines are always a little foggy, but I stayed there for around two years in L.A., just doing a lot of work with artists in the music industry. Janelle Mon√°e had released her album, Dirty Computer. That was one of the bigger projects that I got to work on. Her and her team were fantastic just because they really trusted me and they gave me a lot of creative freedom to create pieces that worked with her album and with the whole concept of what she was doing. That was one of the highlights of that job for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wonderland Studios has a great team.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Oh, yeah, yeah, fantastic people to work with. So, I made a lot of good connections from that, from working with that agency. Yeah, we still work together today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, cool. I know George 2.0. We went to Morehouse together.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Oh, nice. Yeah, 2.0.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We went to Morehouse together. Now, this was back before she was doing the whole Android thing. She had the CD called The Audition, I think. I remember buying it off The Strip one day in the late 2000s, not late 2000s, way earlier than that. This was early 2000s. I&#8217;m not that young. But I remember getting her CD and being like, &#8220;Oh, this is really good.&#8221; Of course, they have the Atlanta connection, because she&#8217;s lived and worked here before and stuff. But their whole crew, their whole studio is doing great work.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve always admired them because they operate in a way that&#8217;s different to a lot of artists. I think just their tight knit community of people that they work with, it was a real family vibe when I would connect with their team and we would talk and discuss work. It just felt really good to be around them, great people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the people that have really helped you out as mentors throughout the years?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
I wouldn&#8217;t say that I&#8217;ve had specific mentors, where their role was to mentor me through the stage of life that I was in, but I think a lot of the times, the supervisors that I had at the companies I worked with took on that role in maybe a subconscious way. The first being a guy named Michael Spoljaric, who was the&#8230; I think, he was brand director or creative director. There&#8217;s so many titles at Nike that I forget what he was doing, but he was the head of sportswear brand design when I was there.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
So, when I got hired to work with them, he was the introduction into that world of professional corporate design. So, really, in terms of design and creativity, he really helped me to understand good typography, good layouts, how to design a book properly, what images to choose for a campaign, stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
The next when I was working on the Rio Olympics, I already mentioned Ibrahim. He really became that mentor figure for me. He already saw that I had potential, but he fine-tuned it. That&#8217;s what I really appreciated about him was that he really got down to the nitty gritty and the specifics of things, the details of things, because every little detail counts if you&#8217;re trying to make something that is impactful. If you leave one little thing out, then it might ruin the whole trajectory of the story. So, he was really a figure like that for me.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
When I came to Ceremony of Roses, the two people who really stuck out to me was Brad Scoffern, who&#8217;s the owner of the company. He&#8217;s the one who brought me on board. I met him when I was working at Odd Future. He always remembered me. So, by the time he started his own agency, he immediately reached out to me and wanted to work with me. And then another guy at that company named Jared Hankey, who became my pseudo mentor at that time when I was working there, too. So, I haven&#8217;t really had specific people outside of work environments that have done that for me, but it&#8217;s always been supervisors or bosses or those who are in higher positions than me who can show me the ropes and keep me on track.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you call yourself a creative superhero. What does that mean to you?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
It means that I have a lot of superpowers. It&#8217;s always been really difficult for me specifically to classify what I am or who I am in terms of my creativity, because I can say one day that I&#8217;m an artist and then another day, I can say I&#8217;m a musician. One day, I can say I&#8217;m a designer. I can wear all these hats, and I try to wear them really well. I was always thinking of, &#8220;What&#8217;s just a cool umbrella term that I could use that doesn&#8217;t take itself too seriously, but does speak to the idea that I can do all of these different things?&#8221; I came up with that when I was designing the website for Colibri and it just stuck. So, that&#8217;s the moniker that I like to use if it&#8217;ll be on business cards or any little bios, but yeah, that&#8217;s what that means.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Now, I&#8217;ve read where you talked about your ultimate dream project, which was back when you were working with Odd Future. It was this collaboration with their brand, with Golf Wang and Hello Kitty. That was years and years ago. Is that still your ultimate dream project or do you have another dream project you want to do one day?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
I think I have a bunch of dream projects. That one specifically came about, my older brother, who&#8217;s also a designer, artist, musician, just like me, his name is Jordan. He was really into A Bathing Ape. This was before I was really knowledgeable about these brands at this time. He had this one shirt, which featured a character named Baby Milo, which was a very cute drawing of a little monkey. It was really simple and it had really thick lines. I was just obsessed with that illustration style for the longest time. I remember when I was working for Odd Future, Tyler had created a character called Shark Cat. He was really into cats. We used them a lot, a lot of the merchandise. I decided that I wanted to create a Shark Cat version of almost a Baby Milo-like character.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
So, I took this cat head that Tyler had come up with, and I placed it onto a very simplified body with the bold strokes and just really a cute little character. I wanted to use it for something but I didn&#8217;t really know what we would use it for. And then my boss at the time told me that Sanrio, which is the company that owns Hello Kitty, they were looking to do a collaboration with Odd Future. That was the moment that I was like, &#8220;Okay, Hello kitty is definitely in the same style of Baby Milo, and this is the moment where I can combine those two worlds. So, I can take this little Shark Cat character and I can take the Hello Kitty character. I can put them in one.&#8221; I must have created an entire capsule collection for them.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
And then I don&#8217;t really know what happened. I was told that the executives at Sanrio saw some of our futures videos and were like, &#8220;Maybe not, it&#8217;s not really in line with our brand aesthetic.&#8221; So, it never went through, but that was definitely just a dream project because I really was into the aesthetic of Hello Kitty and Baby Milo and wish that I could have combined those two worlds, but that never really came to fruition.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
But fast forward to now, my biggest dream project is more self-focused. I want to have a gallery show with&#8230; I&#8217;m working on a new body of work right now, some of the biggest canvases I&#8217;ve ever worked on. I want to have a gallery show where all of that new work is there. I want to create a couple of sculptures to go in there. I also want to perform my music at the gallery show. So, then it can be a full representation of my artistic abilities. That&#8217;s really what I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of my time in the past couple of months. So, that&#8217;s where my brain goes when you ask, &#8220;What would a dream project be?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
If I could work with a client, it might be Tame Impala. He&#8217;s my favorite band. Kevin Parker, the guy who writes and records all the music, is the reason that I started making music. That happened at the end of CalArts, but we can get into that a little later. So, if I could work on some album packaging for him or do some tour visuals or just anything, even if I could just meet them and have a conversation, I&#8217;d be happy. But yeah, he&#8217;s a big influence on me.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
And then I also love the brand Fucking Awesome. It&#8217;s a skate brand. Here out of Hollywood, they have a store here. Jason Dill is the creative genius behind that brand. The reason I love it is because his artwork as an artist, as an individual artist, is the aesthetic of the brand. So, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s still like this, but at a certain point, he was designing all the graphics. He was making all the skateboards that people would ride. That&#8217;s always just been a huge dream of mine is to either work with him or create a brand that follows in his footsteps, because I love skateboarding, too. I&#8217;ve been skateboarding for 15 years at this point. So, combining those worlds would be amazing to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I could really see that gallery show. I could even see a gallery show that combines all of this. You&#8217;ve got that, you&#8217;ve got the music. I don&#8217;t know. Maybe you have a small halfpipe in there doing some skateboard or something. I could see all of this taking place. It&#8217;s interesting now even looking at exhibitions and stuff like that, because we&#8217;ve had a few Black artists on the show, exhibitions now are so much more than just a painting on a wall. They&#8217;re really these immersive 360 creative experiences.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mentioned Dawn Okoro before, and she did a show that had a punk band in it. So, she&#8217;s doing her art and has her art on the wall, but then also has a punk man performing. Wow. So, it&#8217;s like a whole environment that&#8217;s being created with exhibitions. Especially in L.A., I could see all of that really coming together.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, that would definitely be a dream of mine to have this multi-hyphenate experience for people to enjoy. A big thing for me is the more that I look at art, the more that I want it to not exist in just a white walled space.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
I understand that that allows the art to speak volumes when there&#8217;s nothing else to look at except the piece that&#8217;s on the wall, but I&#8217;ve also had this dream of having a gallery that&#8217;s outside and maybe an old, abandoned warehouse and seeing how the art that&#8217;s on the wall in the warehouse communicates with the actual aesthetic of a rusted-out building. I think that could create an interesting tension too, but a lot of these things that I feel like I&#8217;ll pursue once I established my footing in the art world and then I can maybe expand on some of these ideas. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, are you still pursuing your music?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
So, music for me has been really interesting in terms of my dedication to it. Honestly, this happens with a lot of the facets of my creativity. There are moments where I&#8217;m really into making music, and I&#8217;ll write a new song every day. And then there are moments where I just want to collage and I don&#8217;t even pick up the guitar or play the piano at all. Right now, I&#8217;m in a down on the music and I&#8217;m really focused on the artwork. So, it tends to fluctuate and I like that. Because if I was too obsessed over one thing all the time, then I think all my other things would suffer. I just can&#8217;t let anything go.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
So, I can&#8217;t ever stop collaging. I can&#8217;t ever stop making music, but they ebb and flow in ways that support each other, whether I know it or not. That&#8217;s how I feel about it. So, I am planning to release a project next year, but there&#8217;s not much in my mind that&#8217;s happening with it yet. But I know that it&#8217;s going to be released early next year. I&#8217;m sitting on a lot of music that no one&#8217;s heard. So, it was definitely enough to create a project and give it to the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All in due time.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you feel like you&#8217;re living your life&#8217;s purpose or do you think you&#8217;re still figuring it out?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Wow. It&#8217;s funny that you asked that, because I would say that I learned what that was this year, specifically. It&#8217;s been a long journey to get to this point. I&#8217;ve always known that I wanted to do art. I&#8217;ve always known that I wanted to be creative. I&#8217;ve always known that I wanted to do music. But for some reason, recently within the past couple months, the specific focus has been on I&#8217;m an artist and telling myself that and believing it and moving towards it. As I moved towards it, the more it feels natural to me, which also tells me that hey, this is probably what you&#8217;re supposed to be doing. Because for a long time, I was in the design world. I was a graphic designer, and I would call myself that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
I think the artist&#8217;s part of me was really sad that I wasn&#8217;t allowing myself to embrace that. I think at heart, I&#8217;m an artist. I can do graphic design, but I think at heart, my purpose is to create art and share it with the world. So, yeah, I think I&#8217;m getting there. It&#8217;s baby steps for me in terms of establishing who I am as an artist and sharing that with the world and being a bit more open with what I&#8217;m doing creatively, because I tend to sequester myself a little bit, but that&#8217;s all starting to change. So, I&#8217;m pretty happy about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want the next chapter of your career to look like?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Next five years, definitely doing more art shows. I think the ultimate goal for me is to have a bunch of solo shows and really focus in on creating work that challenges the way we think about life, that challenges the way that we interact with each other. Yeah, I see myself really settling into the art world and becoming the artists that I know I can be. It&#8217;s been so long, because when I graduated with a degree in graphic design, to me, that felt like, &#8220;This is who I am now, and this is what I have to do.&#8221; After working so long and reaching a certain amount of success that I am satisfied with, I realized that there was just something missing.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
So, this year really marks that transition that I mentioned earlier into me fully embracing me as an artist and maybe moving away from a lot of the client work and focusing in on the work that I want to be doing for myself. So, in five years, I&#8217;ll be 35. So, hopefully, by then, I&#8217;ll have a couple solo shows under my belt. I&#8217;m definitely getting better at playing guitar. That&#8217;s one of the things I&#8217;m focusing on too. I want to put a band together so that I can play shows in Los Angeles, eventually tour around the world if that&#8217;s a reality that presents itself. Yeah, but really focusing in on the artist&#8217;s aspects of me and myself. That&#8217;s where I see myself in five years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and your work and everything you&#8217;re doing online?</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
So, you can go to colibristudios.com to pretty much see everything that I&#8217;m doing. I&#8217;m not on social media, and I don&#8217;t really like Instagram. We could have a whole another conversation about social media. As much as I understand that it&#8217;s something that allows you to connect with people that may have never seen your work before, something about it just doesn&#8217;t feel right with me.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Especially given the past couple years that we&#8217;ve all experienced in America, we&#8217;re starting to realize and understand the effects that these platforms can have on our mental health and our well-being as individuals and our relationships with other people. I&#8217;ve decided to remove myself from it. So, I can have a different type of perspective. I think it served me pretty well. So, I only have a website. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m saying that. It&#8217;s colibristudios.com. That&#8217;s where all my music is, photography, artwork, design work, everything. That&#8217;s me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Chris Burnett, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. One, for just telling your story and really given some insight into the work that you&#8217;ve done, but I think also, it&#8217;s important when we hear your story and hear you talk about the passion behind your work to know that creativity is something that we all in some way can tap into.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s one of those things where as a kid, we have finger painting and all this stuff. But then as you get older, doing things in art design tend to be looked at as more of a hobby and less of a profession. It really seems like you were able to really lean into a lot of creative work, work with a lot of really interesting and creative companies and people. I&#8217;m excited to see what you&#8217;re going to do in the next five years, because I think it&#8217;s definitely going to be something worth talking about. So, thank you so much for coming on the show, man. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Burnett:</b><br>
Thank you for having me. It&#8217;s been a pleasure chatting with you.</p>
