Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Hi, everyone. My name is Alexandria Batchelor, AKA Foxee Design. I am currently the CEO and creative director of Foxee Design. Completely self employed right now, and I am a designer, but I specialize in branding illustration and comic production specifically. That&#8217;s me in a nutshell.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How is the year going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
It&#8217;s going really well actually. Lots of good projects are coming in. I&#8217;ve actually started subcontracting. That&#8217;s where I&#8217;ve started leveling up where I have acknowledged that I can&#8217;t do it all by myself. One of my mentors taught me that he kind of taught or ingrained this mentality of looking out for your community and your network and taking on all the talented people that you know and spreading the wealth, because I am tired. This year I am focusing on self care and that&#8217;s why I bring it in like, oh, you have some time? All right, I&#8217;ve got two projects for you here, and I&#8217;ve got this much money and I&#8217;ve got this for you and this for you. That&#8217;s kind of how I started managing my business this year. It&#8217;s already working quite well, so good start so far.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a great start so far. I&#8217;m telling you, and for people that are out there listening that might be running one person shops, the minute that you get into subcontracting, you will feel like you have unlocked the cheat code. Wait a minute. I can do this self employment thing. Once you build that network or that collective, you&#8217;re like, oh, I got this.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I know. That&#8217;s not sustainable. Not if you want to be happy and be a real person, because I like reality. Let&#8217;s stay rooted in it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, and also with subcontracting, it can also help you to even just expand your services. If there&#8217;s something that a client may want that you know someone in your network has the capacity to handle, it just kind of makes you appear more well rounded, so good for you. That&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Right. Thank you. I can&#8217;t wait to continue to build. I just actually recruited one of my old design confidants from college as well as one of my old interns who are both my friends still to be my right and my left hand for my company, so that was a big move where I&#8217;m like, I told one of them, I&#8217;m like, you&#8217;re my successor. The other one is just stepping up to the plate, so it&#8217;s just really nice to have people I really trust my business with and I could only be thrilled to imagine how they would run my company one day when I have to go expand to new horizons. Still come back to Foxee because that&#8217;s where my heart is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s amazing. I guess with that, do you have any plans for the summer?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yes. I&#8217;m going on vacation. I don&#8217;t vacation often, so yes. Actually summer, well starting off with my birthday, my birthday&#8217;s next month. May babies, Tauruses. Any Tauruses in the house? I&#8217;m going to Alabama because you were talking about the south, but my family&#8217;s from Alabama and I&#8217;m visiting my grandma for my birthday. We&#8217;re going to hang out in Atlanta for a bit, so that&#8217;s going to be really fun. Then in June, I&#8217;m spending the month in California because I&#8217;m also going to be speaking at VidCon, which is exciting, but most of it I&#8217;m going to be relaxing, but yes. I&#8217;ll have my first major speaking engagement in person. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve nervous yet, but as we get closer, I&#8217;m going to be a ball of nerves.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;ll be fine. VidCon is one of those conferences that everyone&#8217;s going to have a camera, of course. It&#8217;s a video conference, VidCon, but you&#8217;ll be fine. I think there&#8217;s enough energy at that kind of event where everyone wants to see you do well.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true. It&#8217;ll be good vibes. As long as there are good vibes, I&#8217;ll thrive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I&#8217;m curious, where in Alabama will you be visiting?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Nobody knows where this is, so I&#8217;ll be surprised if you know. It&#8217;s called Elba. Elba, Alabama in Coffee County.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I too am from Alabama.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Really?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Oh my goodness. I.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m from Selma in Dallas County. I&#8217;ve heard of Elba though.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Oh, really?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Oh my gosh. You&#8217;re the first person who&#8217;s ever heard of where my family&#8217;s from. That&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
People will come to me and name random cities in Alabama, like Utah or Boaz or something. I was like, yeah. I&#8217;ve heard of that. Really? I&#8217;m like, yeah. I grew up in Selma, from Alabama, south central Alabama. Yeah. Nice. Alabama in the summer is hot.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
It&#8217;s going to be brutal, yeah. Well, May, so that&#8217;s not too bad.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s not too bad. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yeah. My grandma wants us back later in the summer in August, so I think I might die. I don&#8217;t know if I could do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. August is Alabama is brutal, but the thing about visiting small towns in Alabama like that is it just strips everything away, like technology, wifi, cable. Selma is not a big city. Even when I go back home to visit my mom, she&#8217;s got cable and she has internet, but like it&#8217;s not the cable and internet I have at home. In terms of the entire environment, it just kind of strips everything away and forces you to be still for a while.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Nice. Yeah. That&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m looking for to unplug, kind of reconvene with nature. My grandma&#8217;s got this cute little vegetable garden that I want to see and just kind of learn about the land, because we own land too. It&#8217;s low key our inheritance eventually, so I just want to get back to my roots and what better time to do it than for my birthday? I&#8217;m really excited.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Let&#8217;s talk about Foxee Design. I know you&#8217;ve been freelancing for a long time now, but tell the people more about Foxee Design.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Foxee Design, I wanted to figure out a nice alias that really represented me, and we started branding ourselves in college, but everybody was kind of doing&#8230; no shade to people who just use their name. That&#8217;s a very legitimate brand because your name actually holds a lot of meaning. I&#8217;m big into name etymology, so I love learning the meaning behind everything, but I just wanted something more than just like A and B.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I just realized my hair became a really big signifier and symbol in my life because I used to have chemically straightened hair up until I was like 18. Right when I was in college, I did a big chop and I went natural and that was the first time I had had natural hair in my life. That&#8217;s why the hair kind of became a big thing. I have a beauty mark, like the Marilyn Monroe beauty mark and the lips and I&#8217;m like, you know what? Maybe this is the visual I want to represent my brand.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Then Foxee, the name, kind of came about because&#8230; actually, it&#8217;s from Foxy Brown, the Pam Grier movie from the 70s, but I learned about that from Quentin Tarantino&#8217;s iteration of it, Jackie Brown and Pam Grier again. I was like, oh, I&#8217;m in love with this movie. It was my favorite Quentin Tarantino movie. It just really resonated with me, so I was like, well, this character is so cool because she&#8217;s re-contextualizing black female sexuality and she&#8217;s kind of making the black woman a very powerful force to be reckoned with in Hollywood. I&#8217;m like, I want to do that in the design industry. This was before where are the black designers, which we were just talking about too, where I&#8217;m just like, I just want to be myself and be this very strong black woman without any consequence and have it resonate with my work. It doesn&#8217;t always need to be about my work, but it&#8217;s always rooted in it because it&#8217;s a part of me.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
That&#8217;s why it kind of was a little sexy. At times I would ask my friends like, should I have done something a little more palatable, but I just kind of leaned into it and I really want to embody this persona where&#8230; if you see me, I&#8217;m very naturalista, like Tom boy, but I can have those moments where I step out. It feels like an alter ego to an extent as well, but I like stepping into this alter ego because I&#8217;m this authority in the brand space and the design space and the illustration space and I get to know what I&#8217;m talking about and feel really empowered behind the knowledge that I&#8217;ve accrued over time. That&#8217;s kind of how Foxee came about and the meaning behind my whole business.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love that. I love that there&#8217;s so much intention behind it.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yes. Always have intention behind the work I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you specialize in, you mentioned, graphic design, you mentioned illustration or comics and branding. What specifically drew you to branding? I&#8217;ve been finding, I&#8217;d say probably on the show within the past year or so, a lot more designers getting into branding, but what draws you to it?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I look at branding as storytelling. I realize illustration, comics and branding are all storytelling mediums for me that are my favorite mediums. I also write a little bit and my mom is a writer, so I have that in my blood. There&#8217;s something about branding that I feel like can be missed where you just think it&#8217;s a logo, but it&#8217;s much more than that. You&#8217;re telling someone&#8217;s story. I think it&#8217;s more of the owner. You go back to the owner, you find out even more about the business, and that actually influences a lot of decisions, like what colors. Is this based on your favorite colors? Is this just tied to how that color represents the specialty that we&#8217;re trying to brand? What is this interest, this hobby? Did you like skiing? Is that why you wanted to make something related to skiing?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I think brands always go back to the first person who came with that idea, and I love learning about people and understanding the attention behind all of the things that we are drawn to. That&#8217;s why I really like branding, because it&#8217;s kind of like decoding and getting to know someone. It&#8217;s kind of personal, because I know recent years people are trying to separate the personal brand and the business brand. I actually think it can be both. It&#8217;s one logo. One brand can, I believe, represent both personal and business. That&#8217;s how I do it. I don&#8217;t have a separate page. It&#8217;s all at one.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I am a person, I am my business, but I can also be just the person that can just be the business. I can be like, okay, I&#8217;m taking a mental health day and I go to the spa. I feel like when you try to split, it&#8217;s hard to navigate, so I love creating this space where you can feel like your work isn&#8217;t necessarily your life, but it is an important part of your life and it can still be a representation of you, your will, your passion. That&#8217;s why I love branding.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love that. That&#8217;s a great way to put it. I see now branding and storytelling and it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve definitely seen with a lot of small companies are trying to get into it, or I think they&#8217;re trying to get into branding because they&#8217;re starting to see it now as more than just a logo. They&#8217;ll come to a designer, I need a logo, but the logo should hopefully tell the story of your business or why you&#8217;re doing your business or something. It&#8217;s not just something generic that you just slap together and say, this is what my business is. It&#8217;s this logo.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Right. It&#8217;s Papyrus type. No, I&#8217;m just kidding. I&#8217;m literally always walking around like, I don&#8217;t like that, I love that. My dad&#8217;s like, stop working. I&#8217;m like, I can&#8217;t help it, dad. The whole world is design. Oh, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me about how you approach a new project that comes into Foxee Design.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I&#8217;m a big process person, like process junkie over here. I love how you got from point A to point B. I learned that a lot of clients and even designers are only about the final product. When I was getting introduced to this culture of design, I would notice that designers would hoard their designs until they were ready to share it and it would be more finalized and clients would just be like, I don&#8217;t get what this concept is. Just give me the final product. This was in college I reached this theory. I was like, I think there&#8217;s a gap in understanding, because actually my college major, it&#8217;s not graphic design. It&#8217;s communication design, so I quite literally can design communication, and I realized there was a gap in communication between the designer and the client.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I made my process very transparent. I start with a sketch. I&#8217;ll give a couple rounds of sketches and I&#8217;ll share it with the client. I&#8217;m like, what do you think? This isn&#8217;t obviously what it&#8217;s going to look like in the final stage, but these are just some ideas to get from point A to point B. Do you like this? What do you like about that? What do you like about this? We can combine those ideas and see if they work. I can tell you why they might not work. Let&#8217;s try this instead. When you bring the client in and involve them, you just get a much more successful design.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve definitely had projects that have fallen through, obviously. No one&#8217;s perfect, but when the projects really go to the finish line, I&#8217;ve always had very high success rates. People are like, I didn&#8217;t even know this is what I wanted. I&#8217;m like, exactly, because the client always wants to be like, hey, I trust you. Just do whatever you want. I&#8217;m like, no. This is your business. You have to do work too, so I give them homework. I&#8217;m like, fill out this brand brief, answer all these questions. Some people are like, I never thought to answer all these questions about my business. I&#8217;m like, well, you&#8217;ve got to think about some extra stuff before maybe we even start your logo, because I always start with the logo if we&#8217;re doing a big brand project, because it&#8217;s an easy starting point but there&#8217;s way more to that. Especially if you want to be a musician or if you want to be on YouTube.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a lot of other deliverables that go around the logo. I&#8217;ll give you colors and type bases to work with, even if that&#8217;s what you lead me with, but there&#8217;s always more than just a logo. Yes. I make my clients work just as hard as me, and that&#8217;s why I think I work really well with people and now they appreciate the process. They&#8217;ll always walk away like, I learned something about design today, and I&#8217;m like, that&#8217;s amazing. I&#8217;ve got teaching in my blood.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s a good way to approach it. Back when I started my studio, which was&#8230; what year is this? 2022. Back when I started in my studio in the olden days of the inter&#8230; no, I&#8217;m kidding, but back in the late 2000s or so, there was this really big push and maybe it&#8217;s still this way now, I don&#8217;t know, but there was almost this dichotomy that was set up between designer/entrepreneurs and clients where the designer is always right and the client is always wrong and there was this whole thing about clients from hell. Clients from hell.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I remember that blog.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Not to say that they don&#8217;t exist. They do exist. But also I think it&#8217;s up to the designer to vet the people that are coming in.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think if you&#8217;re doing a good job of that and they know that you&#8217;re educating them along with doing the work that you don&#8217;t run into many clients from hell after a while. They know to kind of stay away, but that education portion is super important. I think clients want to know sort of what they&#8217;re paying for, of course. They&#8217;re not just paying for hopefully a set of hands. They want someone that can illustrate, especially if it&#8217;s for their business and its brand. I would hope that they would want to be involved in it.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Me too. Yeah. Someone, I can&#8217;t remember who, but there was four types of clients. You have the smart involved client, you have the smart, lazy client, you have the&#8230; sorry to say dumb, but the dumb involved client and the dumb and lazy client. I think the worst one they said was the dumb involved one because they want to be all up in your business but aren&#8217;t listening or anything. It&#8217;s interesting that there are types of clients out there, but you have to know how to deal with them. If someone is more the uneducated one who wants to be involved, that&#8217;s great. You shouldn&#8217;t see that as a loss. You should be like, no, this is a learning moment. You want to be involved, but you&#8217;re not listening to me and I&#8217;m the authority. You paid for this.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Also, sometimes that&#8217;s where I take an L. If you don&#8217;t want to listen to me, then we&#8217;ll go with what you want. It might not be the right decision, but because you don&#8217;t want to listen to the specialists that you hired, then we&#8217;ll just go and do what you want to do. I think as I got older I started to be less precious with my work because yes, I&#8217;m here to guide you. I&#8217;m here to be like a salesperson. I&#8217;m here to persuade you, but sometimes if they just don&#8217;t want to listen, then that&#8217;s fine. I paid you to do what you want me to do and that&#8217;s that. I think a lot of younger designers get really hellbent on like, well, they&#8217;re not doing this. They&#8217;re not do it. I&#8217;m like yeah, I know that stinks, but put all that energy in your own work then.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Design, at the end of the day, for what it&#8217;s worth, especially as an entrepreneur, it&#8217;s a service industry, so you are serving the client in that way. Honestly, just because you did the work doesn&#8217;t mean you have to put it on your portfolio. There is a lot of work that I&#8217;ve done for horrible clients that will never see the light of day for me.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Right. I get you there, or I&#8217;ll put the one that they should have picked in my portfolio. I&#8217;m like, this is the nice version that we just left from ground zero, and it&#8217;s a dream, but this is the reality it should have been, so I get that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You mentioned earlier about subcontracting and having people as you&#8217;re left and right hand. What does a typical day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Oh my goodness. I&#8217;m in a decompression mode right now, so it&#8217;s a little different. Sometimes I&#8217;ll be gaming all day while also working, so I balance it out, which is kind of hilarious, but other days&#8230; I&#8217;m a Switch girl, so I&#8217;m playing the new Kirby game. Nobody&#8217;s paying me to promote this, but it&#8217;s really good. It&#8217;s beautiful. That&#8217;s been nice to feel restorative, especially if I have a stacked day, but I go through my emails. Also, email anxiety is so real. Some days I just put them off, but I try to have admin days where I can focus and respond as I go so they don&#8217;t build up, because if I&#8217;m away from my email for at least a week, I will have at least 200 emails and that is not fun to go through. Yes. That&#8217;s real. Email, admin stuff, I&#8217;ll go through any contracts that I have and get them signed and sent over, because I always collect deposits or I have regular income where I&#8217;ll have to give bills and stuff. So I&#8217;ll send in my invoices then. That&#8217;s the business side of things.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Then some days I like to blog in the mornings, especially if I worked too much the past day. I&#8217;ll just be writing my memoir, which is a little passion project I have going on, so I&#8217;ll spend time either doing that. This morning I spent embroidering, so I&#8217;ve been trying to get back to traditional art because I want to spend less time on my computer. Yes. I&#8217;ve been wanting to paint more, so in the coming days I&#8217;ll get back to painting. I like to play as much as I work with even my art because it&#8217;s my passion and my job, but traditional is where I&#8217;m steering, so I like being able to balance that throughout the day. Then I&#8217;ll work on a project here or there. I&#8217;ve usually got several going on.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Some days I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m not working on this project or I&#8217;ll have to prioritize which one, like they need this one urgently or this deadline or this sub-task deadline is due this day, so that&#8217;s how I organize my tasks. Then I try to not work into the evening. Then I unwind with some anime and food. That&#8217;s what a day looks like for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love that you said I like to play as much as I work and that you kind of weave that into your work day. That&#8217;s pretty cool. I like that. I think it&#8217;s a good way, one, to just get through the day, but then as an entrepreneur, I think it can be so easy to fall into that trap of just work, work, work, work, work, because everything has to depend on you. Incorporating those moments of play like that into the work is a good strategy.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yes. This is very new too, because I was work, work, work, work, work, and then I crash, crash, crash, crash, crash. Now I&#8217;m like, okay. I have to make sure I am relaxing. I want to bring back yoga and meditation into my routine, because I also was doing that because self-care is just so important. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to stress as much as I&#8217;m trying to make money. I&#8217;m good. I think that&#8217;s also important to have financial literacy when you&#8217;re in these spaces and to be able to save and not worry about going check to check. That&#8217;s where I&#8217;m like, you know what? I&#8217;ve worked hard enough to be like, I can relax. It&#8217;s going to be okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good place to be.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yeah. It takes time. I think everyone can get there, but even if you are living check to check, still put a few bucks aside to get a facial from Walgreens. One of those things to just do the mini. I love doing like those really home care days. I&#8217;ll put my feet in like some Epsom salt or whatever and soak, so you can do it in a very affordable way too. I suggest that as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I like that. I first heard about you about a year or so ago from YouTube. I think I told you this before we started recording. I was randomly watching videos. I was letting the YouTube algorithm guide what I watch next and I ended up on this&#8230; I guess the best way to describe it would be maybe an anime discussion channel. Not necessarily review, but more like discussion. This anime discussion channel called Beyond The Bot. Can you talk about how you became a part of that?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Sure. Actually it goes back to my history at Frederator. We actually got laid off during the pandemic too. It happened to a bunch of different companies. I have no disclaimer. There&#8217;s no shade. I wouldn&#8217;t be the designer I am today without that company. I have much respect for Frederator, but we just couldn&#8217;t afford to keep all of us on after the pandemic hit. If it didn&#8217;t hit, we probably would still be there, to be honest with you. That crew wanted to keep a channel that we started at Frederator called, Get in the Robot. That had to pause production because we had lost our jobs, so we evolved it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I watched Get in the Robot. I didn&#8217;t know that was the succession. Look at that.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Right. Here we go. Full circle.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Full circle.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I knew we&#8217;d get there. Yes. We just evolved it to the next stage with Beyond the Bot. We did it completely independent. We were crowd funded. We had a lot of really great opportunities to us. Then they were like, all right. Come on board, because we literally took the whole old team from Frederator and just started this because we just needed extra work and the fans were helping us pay and keep it alive. We got a couple hundred bucks a month working on it and we just kept the joy alive because that channel meant a lot to us, like Get in the Robot, and then Beyond the Bot was a new baby that helped us be able to do even more than we wanted to do without corporate constraints.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
For people that want to check it out, you should really go to YouTube, search for it. If you&#8217;re into anime, I wouldn&#8217;t even say just modern anime, like My Hero Academia or whatever because you all have talked about stuff with Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball Z and stuff. If you&#8217;re an anime fan of any stripe, definitely check it out.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yes. We do deep cuts. I think we did a Neon Evangelion Genesis video. We&#8217;ve done a Cardcaptor Sakura video, so even the ones you&#8217;ve never heard of, we were talking about that stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. What are the best types of clients for you to work with? I know you&#8217;ve worked with, you mentioned Frederator is a place that you&#8217;ve worked at before, and we&#8217;ll go through the rest of your work history, but you&#8217;ve worked for some publications and other publishing studios. What are the best types of clients for Foxee Design though?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I love working with YouTubers. YouTubers are where it&#8217;s at because everybody is getting on that. I&#8217;m even trying to get on YouTube. I would love to be able to be like, come follow me at Foxee. Content will come this year, I promise, but yes. I love the YouTube space. That&#8217;s kind of what Frederator did too. We were kind of cornering the mark. They were kind of the first people really doing what they&#8217;re doing on YouTube. A lot of these clients that have reached out to me are like, I&#8217;m inspired by Get in the Robot. I&#8217;m inspired by this. We&#8217;ve kind of set a domino effect of these new big YouTubers who focus on anime or cartoon industries or video games. Well, there were other people like [inaudible 00:30:17].</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
All those different names, but YouTube is the place to be. There&#8217;s kind of a lot of not so great branding on there, so I would like to save YouTubers. That&#8217;s also why VidCon is a great space for me to speak at. I can&#8217;t wait to connect with a lot of people who might need a new brand. Either a brand refresh, a whole rebrand, or just a brand in general, but I think YouTube is a great spot because there&#8217;s a lot of authentic personalities that&#8230; the algorithm serves up authenticities. They love when you are just yourself and you have a good niche and you have a good hook. If people have those good ideas and just need a good brand, then they&#8217;re a great fit for me because I can help visualize that and help build their brand on YouTube.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Those are my ideal clients, but I&#8217;ve worked with musicians. Back when I was living in Buffalo, my first set of clients were local rappers who would charge $50 album covers. I&#8217;m like, the come up is real. I&#8217;ve worked with musicians, but I don&#8217;t charge $50 for album covers anymore. I&#8217;m all about indie. I listen to indie music. I love like indie films, so anything independent and not discovered by the world, it just feels more special. You were one of the first few fans to get access. When you see someone blow up, you&#8217;re like, I was following them when Spotify didn&#8217;t even exist. It just feels like an achievement to be able to be in those spaces. I think it&#8217;s high honor, especially if you&#8217;re a designer in those spaces to work with those kind of artists who are doing their thing, because it&#8217;s solely based on passion. Of course they want to be famous and they want money, but they are 100% driven by passion, and passionate clients. Ideal clients are just anybody with a dream and a lot of passion, and money too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. There&#8217;s a guy I design&#8230; not design. Sorry. I had him on the show&#8230; was it last year? I&#8217;ve been doing this for so long I really have to think, like when did I interview this person? It was last year. This guy, Chris Burnett, he started out doing some designs for Odd Future. He loved the music and lucked into becoming their creative director for a while, did work with Tyler and with Frank and them. I&#8217;m like, wow. To be able to come in at that level, whether it&#8217;s a musician or even with what you&#8217;re talking about with a YouTube channel or something like that, to get in on the ground floor of working with another passionate creative is amazing. That&#8217;s the best. It&#8217;s the best. It&#8217;s so good, because that energy is there. They&#8217;re doing their thing. You&#8217;re doing your thing. It&#8217;s so good. It&#8217;s so good.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
So good. Glad you agree.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit. I know we&#8217;ve talked a lot about your work, but let&#8217;s talk more about you. Where did you grow up?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Me, I grew up in the Hudson Valley in New York. A little town. I don&#8217;t know if you all know Fishkill. More like the Poughkeepsie area. I&#8217;m just throwing out general terms because this is so specific. It&#8217;s like the greater New York City area. I know some people are going to be like, what? Then other people are like, what the heck is that? It&#8217;s near Beacon. Beacon&#8217;s also really nice. I don&#8217;t know. Good. It&#8217;s the upstate New York area kind of, but not really. It&#8217;s very white, which is fine. That experience made me very comfortable being in predominantly white spaces, which actually helped me out in corporate and college, although my college program, our class, there was a lot of diversity there, which was surprising because it was Buffalo, but anyway. Yeah. I grew up in a predominantly white area in the suburbs and I lived there my&#8230; that&#8217;s not true. I was a baby in Mount Kisco, so I barely re remember that, but remembering the growing up experience, I grew up in that other area that I ranted about that half of the people listening will probably not know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When did you know that creating art was something you wanted to do for a living?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Probably when I was five. I was always drawing, especially when we hung out with the family. I was always curled up on the couch just doodling. I still have my doodles. I have a great archive. I&#8217;m excited to go through it, like through recent revelations and deeper understanding of my work, but I have stuff from when I was really young still in my possession, but I always knew. Yeah. I&#8217;m an archivist, which is a fancy term for hoarder, but it&#8217;s still worth it. I think having your old work is really important because it says a lot about the interest that shaped you as an artist. I always knew, and I actually wanted to get into architecture briefly because I do love architecture, but I&#8217;m not good at math, or maybe I am but I just didn&#8217;t have good teachers. The pressure it is to be an architect, uh-uh (negative). I was like, I&#8217;m not going to build a house that could fall down and me get sued. I don&#8217;t think so. Then I found graphic design and that was a wrap.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you mentioned studying communication design. You started out at Dutchess Community College and then you attended University of Buffalo. What were those experiences like? Did they really prepare you once you got out there in the world as a working designer?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I would say yes and no. Dutchess, the community college, it was a great school for saving money. I just wanted to save. Maybe I was a little not like ready to run, like jump the nest. That&#8217;s my mom&#8217;s theory, even though I&#8217;m like, no mom. It&#8217;s probably not that, but she&#8217;s usually right with her suspicions, so maybe. I went for free because I graduated in like the top 3% of my high school, but it felt like the 13th grade and me and one of my friends were really bored and we were just like, we have to get out of here. We got to do really fun programs. I got to learn fencing while I was there and did a dance program. I want to get back into fencing. Fencing was super fun and you look really cool. I love swords, and video games, I am always the person with a sword. That&#8217;s my ideal weapon choice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Just in case you guys were wondering, but I didn&#8217;t get to take really graphic design classes there. I took a 2D and 3D design class and a photography class, which is indirectly graphic design, but I had to wait the next year to take a graphic design course, but I was already onto the University at Buffalo. Those courses, they were okay. I thought the teacher I had was kind of pretentious. He was kind of a jerk and told me I couldn&#8217;t get into other schools, even though out of high school, I got into like RIT and I&#8217;m like, okay, well I&#8217;m here just to save money for my family so you&#8217;re wrong, but thanks.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
That was a crappy experience with that guy where I&#8217;m like, maybe you&#8217;re just mad you&#8217;re teaching and you want to be out in the field. I don&#8217;t know. It was not really about me, but it was a crappy experience to still have. University of Buffalo was way better. I actually met two of my mentors that I&#8217;m still friends with today, John Jennings and Stacy Robinson. They together work as Black Kirby and they are leading the Afro-futurist&#8230; they&#8217;re just big names in the Afro-futurist space, especially in the comic book industry. They just kind of took me under their wing immediately when I met them, and that was the best thing I got out of UB especially. Then also all my friends. I still keep in contact with a lot of my classmates. We just kind of all stuck together. I had a friend reach out to me recently like, hey, we&#8217;ve always been fans of your work and we always thought your stuff was next level. I&#8217;m like, me? Fans from school? Oh my gosh. Thanks guys. That was so sweet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. I had John on the show a couple years ago. I want to say 2017, 2018. Yeah. John is great. John, you mentioned his name.nd I think any Afro-futurist circle people are going to be like, oh yeah, Kindred. We know John. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yep. I&#8217;ve worked on most of those projects he&#8217;s worked on, so I actually helped color Kindred too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Work. Nice.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I just think those things [inaudible 00:39:39]&#8230; because I&#8217;m a very humble person. I don&#8217;t go out reciting my resume, but I&#8217;m like yeah, I worked on that too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yeah. He&#8217;s dope. He&#8217;s very cool to work with. He was the one I mentioned earlier who taught me, don&#8217;t leave your network behind and bring them up with you. He is trying to master the subcontract and that&#8217;s who I got that from.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I like that a lot. I like that. What was your early career like once you graduated? Is that when you started freelancing right alongside working?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yes, because my first job out of college was at The Cheesecake Factory. I was a server. I couldn&#8217;t get a job for the life of me because I was in Buffalo and the industry there is very small. It&#8217;s a very blue collar town. No shade to Buffalo, but design was not flourishing there. I&#8217;m not really sure how it is. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s flourishing now. You&#8217;d have to work at like a doctor&#8217;s office or some kind of establishment to really be a designer there. I wanted to work at an agency or some kind of innovative company, but I just couldn&#8217;t get in. I was behind on internships because I didn&#8217;t take internships in school because I was kind of a lazy student. I&#8217;m going to be honest with you. I slept during class all the time, since high school. I was a sleeper. I don&#8217;t know. That was my bad.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Instead, I decided to go into the restaurant industry and I made really great tips. Then that also encouraged me to freelance. If I never served, then I would&#8217;ve never really focused on freelance work and Foxee Design may not be what it is today, because I didn&#8217;t want a gap in my resume. I was like, well, I&#8217;m going to have to really operate as a freelancer so I have this experience for when I&#8217;m ready to get into design. I did end up getting in two offers at internships. One at like a car dealership place, which I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m not a big car person, so I&#8217;m like, it&#8217;s not a great fit. Then the other was at a newspaper, which is really cool. It was called the Buffalo News. It&#8217;s one of the biggest newspapers in the Western New York area. They had a medley of different clients that they would work with, so I thought that was a better fit than a car dealership. No shade.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
It was a great offer that she&#8230; it was the first time someone took me out and wined and dined me to be like, are you going to choose our internship? I&#8217;m like, for an internship for real? No, but thank you. I mean, not wine. She took me out to coffee and got me a snack or whatever, but either way it was [inaudible 00:42:21] that she really wanted me to work there, but I chose the newspaper instead. I worked in their digital ad department because they were still focusing on penny savers, but my department was the smallest and newest and youngest. We worked on Facebook ads, like back in the day when you were only in the backend, working on Facebook. This was back when it was so new that you could actually discriminate through it because you could choose to serve your ads to specific races. It was very interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. I remember when Facebook had that. I think it was some sort of housing. I forget what it was, how someone found out. I think it was because they were making ads that would discriminate against people for housing or something like that, but I remember when could do that with the ad manager.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yes, and I witnessed that happen. The sales rep didn&#8217;t allow it, but the woman was on speaker phone asking and I was just like, oh my goodness. I can&#8217;t believe she just asked if she could only serve this housing ad to white people. It was just the most baffling experience. I was like, wow, people really be doing that nowadays. Still to this day. That was a very interesting experience because it was very old school. I had to dress up for work. I had a retirement fund. I was like, what in the world? I had a retirement fund. That&#8217;s how old school this place was. That was my early career. It was very interesting. Very interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, what was it like at Frederator? What did you learn from there? I know you said it kind of helped you now in terms of, I guess, process and such, but what was that experience like, because Frederator, and we talked about this a bit before recording, but it feels like it serves a very specific type of demographic that I don&#8217;t know if it encompasses black women, black people in general, but probably specifically not black women. What was your experience there like? What did you learn from there?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s funny enough. I was one of the first three black people employed there. It was two black guys and me and one of them, he&#8217;s still there and just got promoted to president, so now he running the place, which is amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Look at that.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
The first day he started, he said, I&#8217;m going to run this place. I said, okay. That was me meeting him. I was like, sure. Then he did. I&#8217;m like, of course he did. Of course he did. It&#8217;s being run by a black person now, but it was a wild ride because it was definitely predominantly white for decades, which, it makes sense. The higher ups were all white. That&#8217;s usually what happens, but that&#8217;s why I was really grateful to my boss who gave me a chance because I needed to get out of Buffalo. Through friend or something, I was able to connect and she&#8217;s like, I love your work. Then I got the job and I got to New York City lickity-split because I was ready to go. It was just amazing to have an opportunity to be in that space, because it&#8217;s so hard for us to get into design spaces for whatever reason. Well, the reason is because it&#8217;s systematically designed like that, but that&#8217;s a whole other conversation. We&#8217;re partially going to talk about it.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yes, it was kind of hard being there, as any predominantly white space, but for whatever reason, there was more and more minorities that kept flooding in. At one point, there was half minorities and half white people and then there were less white people. I&#8217;m like, oh, they&#8217;re getting scared. They&#8217;re getting scared. I&#8217;m just kidding. It was so funny though. We would joke about it, but I think I was able to navigate the space where I let people feel comfortable talking about feeling uncomfortable. I would be able to talk to the one half Hispanic, half indigenous guy and the one Asian guy about in high school when they used to give us really racist names.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
This was water cooler talk, and I don&#8217;t think anybody would ever have been able to have a safe water cooler space talk like that if it was only white people around. I didn&#8217;t really have an influence on company culture because I was the only designer there too, so I was so tired and busy, but the moments I had were really nice where I could just bond with people and we could talk straight with each other. I even talked to some of the white people about it because I&#8217;ve always had white friends who just let me talk. I&#8217;m like, if you just listen, I&#8217;m cool with you. You cool. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Just let hear my voice. I&#8217;ve had really real talks with some white folk and those are the ones to stick with; the ones who aren&#8217;t going to tell you how you are supposed to feel or about your experience. I had a lot of those moments with some people there, which was nice, but design wise, it was YouTube. I got to figure out how to brand YouTube. I made extensive style guides. I&#8217;ll make you a 50 page brand guide that you will use and share with the video editors, because we had a huge freelance network too, some of whom I still keep in contact and using my own network now. Yeah. The people I met there were worth it. The skills I gained there working on YouTube was worth it. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
As a black woman, it wasn&#8217;t always great. I didn&#8217;t always feel like my voice was heard. I feel like I had a lot of good ideas and they would always be overshadowed, and then every time the white guy said exactly what I said two weeks ago, I&#8217;m like, of course. Of course now it&#8217;s a brilliant idea. I don&#8217;t want to think it&#8217;s always intentional, but you always feel a type of way where it&#8217;s like, is anybody listening to me, but still a good experience. Still a good experience. Again, it made me strong. I had interns be like, because we went through a lot, I was able to handle a really crazy work situation being only in a small team, and I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m glad, because it hardens you when you are responsible for a lot. It was too much. I definitely needed like another designer, but I run my own business now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s interesting. It hardens you. That&#8217;s an interesting way to look at it.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s not 100% great terminology, but that&#8217;s the strong black woman though. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s the trope that we do have to play often.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, this kind of leads into my next question, which is kind of about representation. I mentioned to you before and I&#8217;ve talked about this on the show too when I have black illustrators or fine artists, do you feel a need to quote unquote represent with the work that you do?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Not necessarily. Obviously I&#8217;m going to go for the black female representation or even just a lot of women I&#8217;ve always drawn, because I&#8217;m always going to go to the self first. It&#8217;s an easy subject. It&#8217;s like Frida Kahlo. She says, I know myself the best. That&#8217;s why my best subject. She&#8217;s one of my favorite artists. That&#8217;s why I quote her. That was not a direct quote, but anyway, and then also, because I&#8217;m bisexual, I also love how women look and it&#8217;s so easy to draw women. I always have to be like, oh crap. I haven&#8217;t drawn a man in months. I should probably do that. Men are cool too, but dang, I don&#8217;t know. [foreign language 00:50:26].</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Anyway, I think it&#8217;s important specifically to represent the black women in my work because I pull a lot from my feelings, so I make a lot of sense of what I&#8217;m feeling and what I&#8217;m going through through my illustration work, and because black women have to be hardened by society, I think being vulnerable in that way helps be like hey, I&#8217;m still a person and I&#8217;m really sad or I&#8217;m really frustrated, or I feel like I&#8217;m falling apart, which is why I do a lot of disembodied, disconnected body parts. That&#8217;s kind of a style I&#8217;ve developed. I&#8217;ve always been doing that for I think maybe for 10 years.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
That&#8217;s kind of been the art style where it&#8217;s like just the head or the bust or a hand or an arm. It just shows this disconnect and just feeling really outside of your body, because there&#8217;s so much going on, you don&#8217;t really know the feelings that are kind of taking over you and you feel like you&#8217;re just kind of fractured. I&#8217;m constantly breaking apart and putting myself back together to make sense of myself, to reassemble myself, like a stained glass mirror or a stained glass window. Sorry. That&#8217;s why I think when I try to represent the black woman it means more because we aren&#8217;t allowed to feel feelings like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, you do a lot of work with like Afro-futuristic [inaudible 00:52:02]. You mentioned John Jennings and you mentioned Kindred. You&#8217;ve got a new project that&#8217;s coming out in September with Tananarive Due and Steven Barnes. Can you talk to us a little bit about that?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Sure. We&#8217;re now allowed to talk about it. I was doing hold up because I was the colorist on the project, so I colored that whole bad boy. I had some help with my assistants. They were great, but yes. It&#8217;s funny because I&#8217;ve been coloring with John since I was in college and I&#8217;ve been getting promotions with him. This was the first time I was the lead colorist. Oftentimes I&#8217;m an assistant colorist, like on Kindred I was an assistant, but this time I got to be the senior level colorist and I got to see the inks that Marco Finnegan did. He&#8217;s incredible. He loves film noir. That&#8217;s why the shadows are really heavy. I always forget this name, the really intense contrast. It&#8217;s the [inaudible 00:53:01].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, chiaroscuro. Something like that.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
There you go, chiaroscuro. Yes. I never get that right, but one day I will, so thank you for the assist, but it has that really beautiful effect. It made my job easier because I was like, great. I got to do less shadows because he made this so exaggerated, but it was beautiful. His inks were just so strong on their own. Then I got to just take a look at them, understand the scene. I had to plot out the script to see how many days this story went over. It took a place over seven days. It&#8217;s about this little girl, she&#8217;s eight, which, fun fact, was based on Marco&#8217;s daughter, which is really cute. I love when, again, you&#8217;re using your reality as your subject and that&#8217;s what makes it realer, because the expressions, I&#8217;m just like, this feels heartfelt. I&#8217;m like, well, if it&#8217;s based on your daughter, I get it.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
This little girl, she goes through a lot of death and she is kind of on her own after a while because her caretaker dies and then a monster is summoned to take care of her, called the keeper, but there has to be a sacrifice to keep it alive because it needs life to keep it alive. It&#8217;s a beautiful, horrific story. It was funny because I was listening to a talk with Tananarive Due and she was talking a lot of black history or black stories. They are horror. They&#8217;re horrific, so it&#8217;s technically a horror graphic novel. I think the demo is like around&#8230; it&#8217;s supposed to be young adult, but I think it can skew higher because it reads really well. I highly recommend, not just because I worked on it. It&#8217;s good. We nailed it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. We&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes so people can pre-order it, because this will be out before this comes out. Side note, and only because I&#8217;m a nerd, you talked about [inaudible 00:55:06], and as soon as you said that, I was like, there&#8217;s a song by a British jazz singer named ZR McFarland called chiaroscuro, so if anybody&#8217;s listening and they want to check that out, it&#8217;s a pretty good song. She&#8217;s a good singer, but that&#8217;s a pretty good song.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Nice. I&#8217;m going to be jamming to that after this podcast.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. How do you get back your creativity when you&#8217;re feeling uninspired? Do you have any methods that you go through or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I wish my brain could shut off that I could really be uninspired, but I understand it&#8217;s not necessarily not being inspired, but the creative blocks, I guess, where it&#8217;s like I know I want to do this, but sometimes I don&#8217;t know how. Sometimes I guess going back to traditional media, just doodling mindlessly helps, me going back to nature. I was just going on a walk with my mom and she was so annoyed because I literally was stopping and picking the flowers because I mentioned wild flowers in a blog post, so just taking root of my surroundings, even if it&#8217;s a fire hydrant and the colors on that because I&#8217;m a comic book. I work in comic books, so the background art, you think the things that you just pass by every day, we love. We put that in the background so we&#8217;re always studying the environment.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s been a really good way to, I guess, push through creative blocks where I&#8217;m just like, let me just go outside and collect some research and also get in the fresh air and I just want to hike more. I want to get back to nature because I think as we get back to nature and respect it more and I want to raise more plants, I want that to help revitalize me when I&#8217;m feeling like down with my creativity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny. As you said that about creativity and even as you mentioned this about horror before. Have you been to Elba before? Is this going to be your first time visiting this summer?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
No, I used to go when I was a kid, but it&#8217;s been a while. It&#8217;s maybe been over five years, so it&#8217;s been a while.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. One thing I remember about Elba is that it&#8217;s flooded a few times. At least in my lifetime, it&#8217;s with the river there, the town is flooded. I don&#8217;t know. As you started talking about that I was thinking, what if there&#8217;s some interesting southern gothic horror story of this town that&#8217;s been repeatedly flooded with people that can breathe underwater or something. I don&#8217;t know. My mind is wandering a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I would love that. No, please, because it&#8217;s funny. We have another piece of property and on it there&#8217;s this little mini house and they call it the doll house, and it&#8217;s near a lake, so I&#8217;m like, oh, you might be onto something. Okay. We might have to talk. Okay. We&#8217;ve got to talk about this little story over here. That sounds awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have a dream project or anything that you would love to do that you haven&#8217;t done yet?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I am literally working on a dream graphic novel, so yes. It&#8217;s pretty much I have very vivid dreams because I&#8217;m very stressed out a lot, I guess. Yeah. People would call them stress dreams, but I&#8217;ve started getting them again. They&#8217;ve been hilarious. One dream someone said that&#8230; like I was an X-man and someone was like, your sister&#8217;s a normie, and I pimp slapped them because I was like, she&#8217;s amazing. Don&#8217;t you ever talk about my sister like that. These are the kind of weird dreams I have. I&#8217;ve recorded at least 70 plus of these. I&#8217;ve started organizing into a story because there has been a lot of through lines between all of these dreams where it&#8217;s like, there&#8217;s this underlying plot or there&#8217;s this love interest, so it&#8217;s been very interesting mapping out all these symbols because I also love dream symbolism and dream interpretation.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve used that as a resource for this story because it&#8217;s literally writing itself. I literally just have to go to bed and dream and that&#8217;s part of the writing and now it&#8217;s tightening it up, but then I&#8217;m paralleling it with my actual life to be like, what is going on to instigate these dreams? It&#8217;s biographical as well as a dream memoir, so I&#8217;m pulling from my journal entries at the same point in time and I&#8217;m creating this beautiful story that weaves in and out from reality and dream world and creating a narrative. This is going to be a hybrid piece where it&#8217;s graphic novel, but there&#8217;s going to be written pros and there&#8217;s going to be dream dictionary-esque aspects of it. This is a passion project. I&#8217;ve already finished the beginning and figured out the beginning and end. I&#8217;ve just been working on it diligently and hopefully I am going to get this published maybe next year or the following year, given how much time I&#8217;m able to work on it with everything else going on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds amazing. I&#8217;d love to read that once you have it. Once it&#8217;s out there and ready, I&#8217;d love to read that.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Absolutely. I will send you a link personally.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is the best advice that you&#8217;ve ever been given regarding your craft?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I guess reserving my passion for my own projects, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s actually the best advice because I&#8217;m so passionate about everything. I think just focusing more on myself though is important because I&#8217;ve always been worried about everyone else. Not that I&#8217;m going to drop the execution that I spend on projects, but I just need to be a little selfish nowadays and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that because it&#8217;s a balance between selflessness and selfishness, but with my work, I want that dream to come true. I also want to have an exhibit. If I want all these dreams to come true, I&#8217;ve got to think about me, so I think that&#8217;s probably the best advice. Balance, letting myself get a little bored, re-centering myself and just letting go a little bit. That&#8217;s, I think, what I need to continue to grow and not stagnate or burn myself out or give up on this because I feel like I&#8217;m onto something.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I want to do more environmental design. I want to figure out how to help the environment more. I&#8217;m not really sure. I&#8217;m still very new about sustainability. I do it in different ways. I don&#8217;t have a car, so I don&#8217;t add to the carbon footprint. I take the public transportation. I recycle plastic bags and use them as garbage bags. There are little ways I do it, but I want to know how to build that into my business more. I also want to build interactive spaces for people to be able to enjoy separate&#8230; hopefully including sustainability. I want to get more into the museum exhibition space and just create a new world that you walk into whenever you go to a show or some kind of piece. I want to get out of the 2D space because I&#8217;m ready to graduate to 3D.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I like that. That&#8217;s good. Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Sure. Well, I&#8217;m actually not as active as I need to be, but I will be more active on Instagram. That&#8217;s where I prefer to post work. I&#8217;m also on Twitter. It&#8217;s all Foxee Design, F-O-X-E-E Design. Then I&#8217;ll be on YouTube this year too, so those are my main platforms, and then you can find other links through there, but that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ll share for now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Alexandria Batchelor, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I was familiar with your work, like I said, through YouTube and watching the videos and being like, this is so really well done. Who is behind this? Then of course now being able to talk to you and really get the passion and the fun and the energy and the vitality that you have behind your work. I&#8217;m excited to see what comes next, because it sounds like you are working across a lot of different spaces, doing a lot of just really cool stuff. I&#8217;m excited to see what your design future is going to hold, so thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Of course. Thank you so much for having me. I had a blast.</p>

<p>I was introduced last year to Dr. Kenya Oduor through a Tech Circus panel we both participated in, and I&#8217;m really glad to have her on the show now so she can share her brilliance with you all! She is a human-centered designer, researcher, and strategist, and also runs her own consulting and staffing firm <a href="https://leangeeks.net/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Lean Geeks</a>. Very impressive!</p>
<p>We dove right in and talked about her increased focus at this stage of her career, and from there we discussed how Lean Geeks works and what she want to accomplish with the firm this year. She also spoke about growing up in Queens, studying to become a physical therapist, and then pivoting into human factors and user experience design. According to Kenya, getting comfortable with being uncomfortable is how you grow, and her path to where she is now certainly proves that!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Hi, Maurice. I am Dr. Kenya Oduor and I am a human-centered strategist researcher and designer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s on your mind? How&#8217;s 2022 been treating you?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
What&#8217;s on my mind. So, I think there&#8217;s a lot going on right now in terms of coming out on the other end of COVID and understanding what that means to the work that my team and I do with our clients. And how much of this remote model will change to a more hybrid or in-person model, again. I think in looking at some of the work that we do for our clients, I think there&#8217;s a huge opportunity for those conversations to shift to what new expectations do users, customers, clients have around their products and services. So, I&#8217;m really curious, not only to see what that means in terms of work opportunities, but also what insights do we gain from the work that we do in that regard.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I&#8217;m also finding that my career is gravitating towards more focused on me being a Black woman. And 10 years, 15 years ago, I would&#8217;ve never imagined that my identity would matter so much to the trajectory of opportunities and the voice that I present out to the world and that thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s interesting. Can you talk about that a little bit more?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Sure. So, I never forgot who I was, just because in the industry that I&#8217;m in, I might be the only or have been the only woman in the room, the only Black person in the room or both. And so, it&#8217;s always been a constant reminder for me because at certain points in my career, I didn&#8217;t necessarily feel like I was an integral part of the organization, in terms of feeling like I&#8217;m a fit within the culture because of my differences, or I didn&#8217;t feel like I was necessarily heard as much as some of my peers were. But what I&#8217;m finding now is that all of that experience and all of that maybe insecurity, imposter syndrome or angst that I was feeling throughout my career, I feel like that&#8217;s all coming to a place where I&#8217;m now using it to tell my story.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s becoming what I never realized would be a story that a lot of people, Black, white, or otherwise, want to hear in terms of just, we all have our unique differences. And knowing that and embracing those differences and using that to your advantage in terms of, especially in the design room, using that to your advantage in terms of bringing a different perspective.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious if that change has happened since the summer of 2020 because I feel like for a lot of Black folks who I&#8217;ve had on the show&#8230; well, all the Black folks. I&#8217;ve only had Black folks on the show. Let me be clear about that. But I think every person I&#8217;ve had on has said since that summer, there&#8217;s been a shift.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Absolutely. I am more comfortable in the skin that I&#8217;m in and I am unapologetic about. And I&#8217;ve heard that in a lot of circles that I&#8217;m in, being unapologetically Black. And just recognizing that if you are uncomfortable with my identity and who I am, then that&#8217;s not my problem, that&#8217;s yours. I don&#8217;t have to work to make you feel more comfortable. I have to be me and recognize that. And especially, as a business owner, I recognize that clients that want to do business with me and my company have to be comfortable with who I am and that sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of your business, let&#8217;s talk about Lean Geeks. This is your design agency. Where did that name come from?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, the name came from, as a researcher by training and coming from the academic world and having a PhD in human subject research and that sort of thing, I recognize that throughout my career, a lot of times I would get the poo-poo to ideas of &#8220;let&#8217;s go and validate stuff.&#8221; I would get a lot of resistance where the immediate response that people would go to is, &#8220;It&#8217;s going to take too long. It&#8217;s going to be too complex. We don&#8217;t have time for that. We didn&#8217;t bank in that, that time to do those things.&#8221; So, I recognize that being able to position research around being lean research and scrappy where necessary is really, really important in terms of getting buy-in.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And the geek part comes from just as human factors professionals. I&#8217;m not the only one that subscribes to this, but what I found is a lot of my colleagues, we always have swapped stories about whenever we take on a project, we have to go really deep in understanding a new domain or a new type of industry and user within that industry. And so, we almost geek out in the things that we learn about medicine or what we learn about different industries that might be very different than what we would play in otherwise, banking and that kind of thing. So, it&#8217;s always interesting to think about all of those different industries and how you have to go deep in order to be effective in creating solutions or redesigns for services in those different fields.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, your agency offers both consulting and staffing services to clients and you have what you call a human-centered approach. Tell me about your process.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Absolutely. So, the ideal, let me tell you about the ideal because this is what really excites me. When we have a client come to us and they&#8217;re in this phase of discovery where they have certain assumptions or certain hypotheses around what they could do or what their product could do differently. And so, having the opportunity to help define and execute on some research that validates their ideas, we usually provide them with more clarity on essentially what are the requirements for their solution.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And so, having the opportunity to do that and informing the experience design and having data to support our design approach is really, really, to me really exciting. Because it&#8217;s not one of those things where you or I on the team are going off of what we think is the right experience or approach. We&#8217;re using some of our experience to understand what is the best design, but we&#8217;re more so using data to validate the person&#8217;s ability to get something done. Okay? And in those types of projects, we help our client get to the point of sprint zero or basically giving them the different assets that are necessary to feed development and the engineering effort.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And the really ideal experience is when they then allow us to partner with them from a contractor perspective and having maybe an interaction designer or a strategist join their team as a contractor. So then, there&#8217;s continuity from the work that we did. So, it&#8217;s not as if we&#8217;re just throwing research and wire frames over the fence, we&#8217;re actually continuing on with their team. And that allows those individuals that did the research to stay connected to the project and help to still continue and inform the direction that things go in. And for me, if every project started and continued in that fashion, my life would be golden at that point. If that was the model that we could always follow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
To that end, it sounds like the best types of clients then for you to have are ones that possibly would have you all on retainer, because it sounds like the work that you&#8217;re doing continues along a timeline. You&#8217;re not just going in doing one thing and then that&#8217;s the end of the project.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I wish that we were on retainer. Typically, it&#8217;s the upfront research and the deliverables around requirements, priority, wire frames. All of that stuff is usually time boxed and it&#8217;s a fixed cost effort. Over my career, I think, being in a practitioner role and in a leadership role, I&#8217;ve gotten really good at being able to estimate how long an effort should take. So, those are usually time-boxed. And then when you talk about the contractors, those are typically your standard contractor on your team. Somebody that&#8217;s there six months and then they&#8217;re converted to a full timer or they&#8217;re on the project for two years as a contractor. So, those are typically, someone who has a badge and a computer from your company and they submit timesheets to our company. And we pay payroll and that sort of thing, benefits and all that sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds that&#8217;s where the lean part kicks in, at least in terms of being able to estimate the time pretty, pretty accurately.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Absolutely. The one thing that I&#8217;ve not necessarily learned, but has become really clear over the last few years, is that in any project recruitment is the longest [inaudible 00:12:55]. That&#8217;s going to be the hardest part of a project. And it&#8217;s going to take the longest is to recruit panelists to use for interviews, qualitative interviews, or to observe, or to have them do usability testing and that sort of thing. Recruitment is probably the hardest part of what we do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does an average day look for you with Lean Geeks?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
It typically, like most other people, getting up and checking your emails and &#8220;What do I need to do today?&#8221; It&#8217;s engaging with, I don&#8217;t want to say, prospects, because I don&#8217;t look at engagement with potential clients. I don&#8217;t look at them as prospects. I want to get the opportunity to talk to them. &#8220;Let me hear about what&#8217;s going on in your organization. What are your biggest struggles? What keeps you up at night?&#8221; So, having or scheduling conversations with different people is a lot of what I do.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I am focused on business development and closing the sale. So, I&#8217;m not so much doing the research work anymore or the design work as per se, but I try to bring in those projects. And I stay involved from the extent of knowing what&#8217;s going on, so that might also be a part of my day is checking in with the team to see how are things progressing. &#8220;Show me where you are. Maybe I have ideas or questions that help you to expand what you&#8217;re thinking is around a particular problem.&#8221; So, I also spend a portion of my day doing that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And I&#8217;ve had to get comfortable over the last year or more comfortable with marketing. So, just thinking about strategically, what is my brand and what is my voice and what do I want to put out there? And this goes back to my identity, becoming so much more of what I present to the world where historically that wasn&#8217;t necessarily something that I put as much importance in or on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now for those out there who may not have heard of human-centered design. Again, we talked about how you have this human-centered approach. Can you talk about what it is and why it&#8217;s important?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Absolutely. So, human-centered design is essentially, I don&#8217;t want to say putting the human first, it&#8217;s informing your approach to a solution with information around your user and their motivation, their needs, what are their goals in terms of interacting with your product or service. And most importantly, the most important part is context. And I teach a human computer interaction class and my students are software engineering students. And whenever they ask questions, I always get them to unpack their understanding of the context.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Because context really, really impacts our ability to assume what is someone thinking in a particular moment. What are the environmental factors that are outside of their control that they have to consider in using your product? When you think about your product, what features or capabilities need to be in the forefront because of that context? So, that to me is what human-centered design is all about is allowing someone or giving someone the tools that they need to get something done and to consider their motivation and their context in that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you to really accomplish with your business this year?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I really want to get to a place where obviously closing more business. Any business owner wants to continue to grow, so I always want to continue to grow in my business. I want to get connected to more designers and researchers that are in a freelance situation because I&#8217;m always looking for talent. And as you know right now, the market is really hot. So, either we&#8217;ve lost team members or we&#8217;re constantly looking for new ones and I think I do a pretty good job of spotting talent, but in most cases they&#8217;re already either fully committed or not available or whatever it might be at that particular time. So, that&#8217;s a huge goal of mine in 2022 is to build up our network in that regard and across the country, ideally. I have some little pet projects that I&#8217;m working on with colleagues and I would love to see some of those pet projects shape up a little bit more and for us to move from idea to concept.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit, because I want to get more into your background and learn more about really how you came about all of this. So, let&#8217;s start from the beginning here. Talk to me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and I was really young before I started school, we moved to Queens, New York. So, I grew up in Queens. Very different from Pittsburgh and it was very different going back and forth during the summers and holidays. And so, I grew up around a lot of people who might have been first generation Americans. And it was to me, I think that is what shapes my belief that culture and context have so much to do as inputs to any solution because I just remember being around people that were so different, but had similar goals.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Everybody wanted the best for their children. Everybody wanted to work hard and earn a living and that kind of thing. So, I knew that there was a common thread amongst the culture of the people that I was around. But I knew that, when I went into different people&#8217;s homes, the way they did things and the languages and all those sorts of things were different. So, I look back and when I talk to some of my friends growing up, we always talk about how unique our situation was. And we didn&#8217;t realize it until now that we&#8217;re adults living in different parts of the country.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s so interesting that hindsight, looking back and you don&#8217;t think about it at that time when you&#8217;re a kid, probably not even when you&#8217;re a teenager or a young adult. But I find the older I get, when I look back at how I grew up and how I first got into tech and everything like that. It&#8217;s abnormal for the time I think, but I didn&#8217;t even think about it because essentially at the time when I was doing this stuff, it just all felt like play. It just felt toys that I was working with, not actual computers. Teaching myself a language, that kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yeah. And I think that&#8217;s the beauty of, I&#8217;m the parent that, &#8220;Oh, I want them to do the things they enjoy and double down on the ones that they&#8217;re passionate about.&#8221; But I always have to tell myself that you have to also remind yourself and your kids that exposure to as many different things as possible really open your eyes to things you didn&#8217;t even know existed. And like you were talking about, the things that you did with computers early on, you would&#8217;ve never thought about the impact they would have on your career now is just we, as people, have to always look beyond what we&#8217;re comfortable with. Look at the beauty of art and how that translates into the beauty of what you can create. And just being able to translate some of what we see and experience into the work that we do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Did you have a lot of exposure to design or tech as you were growing up?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yeah. So, my parents coming from a small or from small towns in and around Pittsburgh, their intention in moving to New York was to be around culture and that kind of thing. So, my parents used to drag me to the theater when I was younger and I was always, &#8220;Ugh, we have to get dressed up and go to the theater.&#8221; And I used to go to the Museum of Modern Art or Guggenheim Museum. And I used to always look at it like such a chore, because it was maybe different than what my friends were doing or my friends didn&#8217;t go with me.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
But as an adult now, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, my goodness.&#8221; I thank them all the time because all of those different experiences and that exposure had so much to do with, my mother used to do art projects and she would get wood and carve it and then do stamping on fabric. And I look at all those experiences and say that creativity and just seeing different types of creativity, they remind you that there&#8217;s so much out there that can apply to what we see, what we do, what we experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, when it was time for you to go to college, you went to the university of Maryland. Tell me about what your time was like there.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Too much fun. That&#8217;s why I was on a five-year plan. I knew when I was in high school that I wanted to go away to college. I didn&#8217;t want to stay in New York, surprisingly. As much as New York is a wonderful place, it&#8217;s exhausting. And I was talking to somebody else from New York the other day and we were saying how until you leave New York, you don&#8217;t realize how much life there is outside of New York because it takes so much out of you to do everything.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, I went to Maryland and I struggled with figuring out what do I want to do or what do I want to be? I started out as an engineering major. Then I got interested in psychology and people. And then I thought I wanted to be a physical therapist. So, I ended up having to do an extra year because I thought I was going to be a physical therapist and I had to do additional classes. But my time at Maryland was my awakening to experience Black culture more than when I was just going to see my family. Coming from Queens and then going to Maryland, I felt like my identity as a Black woman, I was able to see other people like myself, that I was actually around all the time and not just family that I&#8217;m going to see during a holiday.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, that for me was really interesting and exciting. And I just knew at that point that I wanted&#8230; I used to get the itch to say that one day I was going to start a business. What that was going to be, who knows. But I used to say to myself that I wanted to create something one day. So, I enjoyed Maryland, but obviously not enough to stay there because I&#8217;m in North Carolina now. But yeah, I enjoyed my time at Maryland.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One thing that I remember really, again, another hindsight thing that I remember is just how many different types of Black people I met at college. I&#8217;m from the country-country. Everybody is they&#8217;re Southern. You really don&#8217;t see other types of people unless it&#8217;s maybe on television or something like that. And I remember being at Morehouse here in Atlanta and meeting Caribbean people for the first time that wasn&#8217;t via Caribbean rhythms on BET. Actually meeting people from the Caribbean. Meeting people from other parts of the country and stuff. And realizing how much that really shaped my Black experience, but just the diversity of what is considered the Black experience.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
It&#8217;s true. And so the difference, I think&#8230; I have a cousin, actually, a cousin by marriage, who&#8217;s from Atlanta, born and raised. And I just found out recently that he did not see non-Black people until he went to college. And that blows my mind because for me, you see Atlanta obviously as a metropolis or a metropolitan area. And I think about the fact that to me, that&#8217;s so fascinating in the sense that you had exposure, you had the means and the capability to go to college and in your lived experience, you never saw people that were not Black. That tells me that the upbringing and the community had was one that helped you to get to where you needed to be in order to get to that next level, which I love.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And then I think about the flip side of it with my experience in growing up in Queens, I used to almost feel, I was one of the few people that were not white, whose family had several generations that went back in terms of being in the US. So, I almost felt like, I felt like the outsider because I was the one whose family had been slaves. And to have that connection to this country, but to have no one else around you that has that connection to this country, I felt like the outsider.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. And I think going to Maryland is where I experienced more of my people who were like me, descendants of slaves. And so, I could relate to them in a different way than I could my people in Queens.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, you were enjoying your time at University of Maryland, soaking in that good Black experience. What was your early career like after you graduated? What was next for you?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Oh, my gosh. Yeah. So, like I mentioned, I thought I was going to be a physical therapist, so I got a job even before I finished school. I got a job at a nonprofit that worked with special needs children as a physical therapy aide. And the place that I worked was in the hood, in Southeast DC. And I&#8217;ll never forget that that was probably my first immersive experience into seeing and experiencing, I&#8217;m not going to say we all, but I have the experience of growing up and having family that lives in public housing or we had to eat government cheese and all that stuff.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I had had that experience, but this was my first time really experiencing true poverty and seeing children who were probably in a situation that when they left school, they did not get food. They didn&#8217;t get their diapers changed. They came to school the next day with the same diaper on. So, that experience really opened my eyes to just the divide that existed in this country and the unfortunate result of real poverty that I&#8217;d never experienced, even if I was poor or with poor members. So it really, really became an emotional, not only was it hard to do therapy with special needs children, who born with fetal alcohol syndrome or vitamin K deficiency. Things that you would think are preventable.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
But it was just the emotional part of just seeing that even when they went home, there was no joy necessarily for some of them. That was hard. That was hard. So, it made me revisit only wanting to be there, but also, did I want to consider a different career?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is that when you decided to go back to school after that?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yes. So, I would come home from work in the evenings and it&#8217;s just, so when I went to college, the email just came out the last semester before I graduated. So, me working on a computer was word processing and that kind of thing. And so, the internet was just starting to become popular when I would come home, for me, at least. It might have been for other people, but not for me. So, I would come home from work and get on the internet and start to do my search and look at different fields. And then I found Human Factor Psychology that way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And what about that appeal to you?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Because I don&#8217;t know if you remember me mentioning that I started out undergrad as an engineering major, so I was very interested in engineering. I was interested in designing things and creating things that would impact people and their lives. And I loved interacting with people. So, Human Factor Psychology was the intersection of those things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so, you attended North Carolina state studying this. This is where you got your master&#8217;s and then eventually, your PhD in Human Factors, Ergonomics/Experimental Psychology.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember from that time, whenever anyone talked about ergonomics or at least maybe in the context that I heard. It always was about office furniture like an ergonomic mouse, an ergonomic chair, an ergonomic desk. But of course, ergonomics is more than just that. Correct?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
It is. And it&#8217;s funny because when I first came to North Carolina State, I thought that was going to be more of my major and that my minor would involve psychology. But when I got here, I got to know more about the psychology program and I flipped it. And I was like, &#8220;No, I really. I enjoy more of the experimental and cognitive psychology and the physical is also a part of your context in your environment.&#8221; So, that was to a lesser extent, my areas of interest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now prior to founding Lean Geeks, I know that you worked for a long time at two companies, but you also alluded that you&#8217;ve worked for other places as well. But you worked at IBM for seven years, which people know for big tech and you worked at LexisNexis for eight years, which I know is a service that a lot of lawyers use, I believe, for background checks and things like that. But with both of these work experiences, you were focusing on user experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not asking you to necessarily give the years, but I&#8217;m curious on during that time, how did you notice user experience in the design community? Was it something that a lot of people were latching onto or how did you see it at that time?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, IBM was my first foray in the whole user experience. True user experience realm in terms of, so I shouldn&#8217;t say that. I take that back because the definition of user experience for so many people is something different than what some of us know or understand it to be. When I started out, it was human-centered design and this was in consulting and then IBM. And it started with discovery of who&#8217;s your user, what is their context and what is their need or motivation. And so, at that time, I think IBM was one of the companies that was in the forefront in terms of doing the work to constantly iterate and validate on ideas or concepts.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And as time went on, what I saw was more of an evolution towards design, more of UX than being termed design or focusing on design less about the validation or the discovery aspect of things. Probably midway in my career is when I started to see people who would talk about stumbling into a career in UX, or they might have been painters or people who did visual arts or, industrial design and that their interests. And of course there were people earlier than that time, but in terms of my experiences in the software world, that&#8217;s when I started to see more people coming from the more design community. More of the design community that were playing in the software space. But my early experiences were primarily people who were coming out of the human center design space.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting. How are those IBM and LexisNexis experiences, how were they from each other?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I was just talking to someone earlier today, a student that is considering a transition into UX and I was explaining to her that one environment was very structured and the other was very unstructured. And so, when you talk about structured versus unstructured environments, it&#8217;s what rigor do they have in place and how mature are they from a user experience perspective? Do they have the right people in the organization and do they have a design system and that kind of thing, a process? Do they have validation baked into their framework sorts of things?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, one was very different than the other in that regard. And some people thrive better in one versus the other. But I realized in my career, I made an intentional decision to shift from one to the other because I wanted to see and to build up my own toolkit of navigating two different environments. And I think that&#8217;s helped me in the consulting world, because I&#8217;m able to spot where an organization&#8217;s mature is and how to interact with the people in the companies that we work with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so, what was the impetus behind you starting your own company? You&#8217;ve put in now 15 years in this industry, working as a user experience professional with human-centered design research. What made you say I&#8217;m going to start my own thing now?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, it had been probably more than 15 years at that point that I was saying to myself, I was getting that itch of wanting to spread my wings and go somewhere new. And I explained it or I likened it one day to someone that every day I walked into the office, I felt like I was a caged bird that had to get in the cage. And then every day at the end of the day, I felt like I was stepping out of the cage. And so, I felt like I was being constrained by the four walls of industry. And I didn&#8217;t feel like part of that came from presenting ideas that didn&#8217;t necessarily align in terms of &#8220;it&#8217;s not your job&#8221; kind of thing or &#8220;we&#8217;re not there yet,&#8221; that kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, it got frustrating and I said to myself, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m either going to move on to a new company and take on a similar type of role. My highest level of evangelism and hiring and all that stuff and firing.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well, do I want to do that? And do I want to go through that same climbing the ladder.&#8221; And honestly, I didn&#8217;t want to and I felt that it had almost been 20 years at that point that I was doing this work. And so, I was like, &#8220;You know what? It&#8217;s time for me to spread my wings and try something new and take the show on the road.&#8221; And I&#8217;ve built a pretty good network over those years, so why not tap into that network and see what happens?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You stepped out on faith and here you are.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I stepped out on faith and I have to tell you that statement right there is the only thing that has kept me going is stepping out every day. When you talk about my day-to-day, every day is stepping out on faith and it&#8217;s a faith walk and it&#8217;s constantly reminding yourself that just because you don&#8217;t know something today or it&#8217;s an unknown or it&#8217;s uncomfortable, you got to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. And always know that you have to do the work to figure stuff out, even if you don&#8217;t know it today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Who are some of the mentors that have helped you to get to this place now in your career?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I always had formal mentors when I was at places like IBM. I had people who I leaned on, who were able to help guide me in that way. But as I got further into my career, I found that I didn&#8217;t have as many mentors or the people that I sought out as mentors weren&#8217;t necessarily either in my discipline or they just didn&#8217;t have the bandwidth to take on additional mentors. I started to do a lot in terms of coaching and finding other resources.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting. I would imagine and I&#8217;ve talked about this with other like PhD level people that I&#8217;ve had on the show is like it&#8217;s lonely at the top. Once you get to that level of education and you get to that point in your career, you look around and it&#8217;s just you in a way.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. And it&#8217;s interesting because I would see people and I would see people who were in a position of running their own company or who were in a certain type of leadership role. And I would look at them and say to myself, &#8220;I aspire to be there.&#8221; And what I found in a lot of cases was that, they were and it was no slight on their part in any way. They would just say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have the bandwidth to take on the responsibility of being a mentor.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, I would get whatever opportunity I could to connect with them and then figure out who do I want to be when I grow up and what does that look like. And, and I think the part that&#8217;s most important for anyone that&#8217;s exploring that thing is to always, always, always connect with people and ask questions and invest in yourself. That&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve recognized I have to do a lot of.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you appreciate the most about your life right now?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
When you meet people and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, I hate my job&#8221; or &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so unhappy,&#8221; or &#8220;My kids are stressing me out,&#8221; just have life stressors. What I&#8217;m really happy about my life is that I&#8217;m fortunate to be in a situation where life is hard. I work really hard, but the joy that my family and my career and my company, the joy that I get from those things mean so much to me. And I feel like I&#8217;m so fortunate. Even if things are hard, I&#8217;m so fortunate to have the ability to do these things at this point in my life.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And to not have the grumbling. Whenever I work with colleagues or whenever I talk to colleagues or I work with a client, it&#8217;s so refreshing to know that whatever drama I get pulled into for work projects. As soon as I hang up the phone, leave the meeting or whatever it is, I don&#8217;t take any of it home like I used to when I worked in-house.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What haven&#8217;t you done yet that you want to do? It could be in life. It can be through your business. What&#8217;s the dream project?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, I definitely want to travel more now, especially after COVID. I want to travel more, but more importantly, I have colleagues that I&#8217;m working on side projects with and we&#8217;ve been talking about them. And some of them were things are starting to get off the ground, but I would really love to see some of those things come to pass in terms of us being able to realize and to see things happen.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I always, I&#8217;m very much a visionary. So, I put out there if you have a vision board or they say do visualization of what you want to do or where you want to be. And I see myself creating something that is impactful. So, just doing project work or engaging clients around project work is one facet of my interest. I also have ideas that I feel like I need to bring to life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of, this traveling now, you and I have both spoken on a couple of panels now. Are you starting to see a return to in-person events? Are you getting invited to speak out at any conferences?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yes. I have a speaking engagement next month in the Baltimore area. I have a few, I want to say late summer or early fall. So, I do realize that things are starting to open up. I actually spoke on a panel recently. So, I&#8217;m excited to see and to interact with people in-person, because I feel like the connections. And I had a conversation with someone that I met in-person after meeting them over or talking to them over Zoom a number of times. You really don&#8217;t get the value of connecting with someone the way that you do when you meet that individual in-person first and then transition to virtual versus the other way around. Because it&#8217;s like you make that connection with people face-to-face that you can&#8217;t make over a screen. So, I&#8217;m looking forward to that again.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I just got my first in-person conference invite in a while. I just got it a couple of days ago. So, I&#8217;m leaking it early by saying it on the podcast, but I&#8217;ll be at Design Thinkers in Toronto in October, which is cool. Because I&#8217;ve always wanted to visit Toronto and to now go and do my first in-person conference thing really since&#8230; gosh, I think the last time I did one was in maybe 2019, I think, probably 2019. Wow.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Wow, so it&#8217;s time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s time.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:41:49].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve done a ton of virtual things, so it&#8217;s time to get back on a stage. So, I&#8217;m excited about that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s time, yes. Well, I can tell you that since COVID my whole dress and shoe game is different, so all about-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, really?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I&#8217;m all about comfort now. So, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;If you say I was going to put on heels and all that, forget about it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to anyone that&#8217;s been listening to all of this and they want to follow in your footsteps? What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, I would tell them that don&#8217;t ever look at any experience that you have as a waste of your time or that it&#8217;s in vain. From the time I first moved, when I first moved to North Carolina and I was an administrative assistant in an engineering firm to the jobs that I&#8217;ve had that have nothing to do with what I&#8217;m doing today, each one of those experiences gave me a perspective on interacting with people. Gave me a perspective on myself, what I&#8217;m good at, what I&#8217;m not good at, where my strengths are.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, every experience that you have in life and know that they all build upon one another, even if they&#8217;re not in the same field. And always walk away from bad experiences with the ability to say, &#8220;What did I learn from it?&#8221; Especially when you work with people that get on your nerves or you can&#8217;t stand, figure out what it is you can learn from that. And getting comfortable with being uncomfortable is another thing.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
The only way we grow is by going through some change and I found that I can procrastinate on the things I don&#8217;t want to be bothered with or do. But when I look back, sometimes I delay the things that really were in my mind overwhelming, but once I got into them, they weren&#8217;t. So, don&#8217;t put off for tomorrow what you can do today. And know that you don&#8217;t know if you can do something unless you try. That&#8217;s the way I see it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s the legacy that you want to leave behind? Where do you see yourself say in the next five years or so? What work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, in the next five years or so, I realize in my whole marketing effort that honing in on my brand, my personal brand is something that before I used to, I was always the little young, skinny one in the crew throughout my life. So, I was always quiet and in the background and the observer. So, I never really thought that my brand or who I am or what I have to say was necessarily that impactful or important. But as I get older and I have platforms to do that, I realize, &#8220;Wow, I do have things to say that people are listening to.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And so, I think in the next five years, continuing to sharpen my brand and my voice are a big part of my focus and that I want to be able to use my skills around being an idea generator, being a connector, helping people to progress ideas. I like to see others, I thrive by seeing others thrive. So, being able to utilize that capability and everything that I do would be just the most awesome thing ever for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good question. So, definitely connect on LinkedIn, Kenya Oduor, PhD. Last name is O-D-U-O-R. I wish I would have kept my maiden name if I knew my last name was going to be so hard. Check out the web company website leangeeks.net, L-E-A-N-G-E-E-K-S dot-net. And I think LinkedIn is the best place to start because from there, you can get to YouTube video thing. You can get my contact information.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And I just like to connect with people and like I said, I&#8217;m trying to build up my network of folks, especially like us designers and creators and researchers that look like us are important for me to connect with at this point in my career. Especially those that I don&#8217;t know now or yet. Yeah. Keep in touch.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Dr. Kenya Oduor, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. One, of course, I think just thank you for telling us about your story. But also about putting forth, this really powerful message about look at your experiences and see what you can gain out of them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
My mom used to tell me when I was younger, especially early on in my career before I started becoming a designer, sometimes you have to do the things that you don&#8217;t want to do, so you can do the things that you want to do or something like that. I might be screwing up that whole thing.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Amen. No, but that to me, I get it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s true. Sometimes you have to put the time in, you have to see what you can gain from those experiences, and then use those to become a better person. And certainly, I think from what you&#8217;ve shown in this interview and then even with what you&#8217;re doing through Lean Geeks, you&#8217;re definitely making that happen. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Thank you so much for having me, Maurice. And continued success to you as well.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s no secret that the tech industry has weathered the last few years better than a lot of others, and many people are trying to ditch their current jobs and start their careers in tech for big opportunities (and even bigger salaries). But working for companies like Google and Microsoft take more than just talent &#8212; it takes the helpful hands and heart of this week&#8217;s guest, Anthony D. Mays. As the founder of tech career coaching firm <a href="https://morganlatimer.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Morgan Latimer Consulting</a>, Anthony uses his 20 years of experience as a software engineer and developer to help his clients to ace tech interviews and get real results.</p>
<p>We start our conversation with a quick check-in, and he talks about starting his firm and finding a good work life balance. He spoke about growing up in Compton and learning BASIC on a VTech PreComputer 1000, studying computer science at UC Irvine, and shared how looking for growth opportunities, and his faith in God, helped him succeed throughout his career. So if you&#8217;re looking to work in tech, then Anthony is just the person to make that happen!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Sure. I&#8217;m Anthony D. Mays. I&#8217;m a former software engineer at Google, and I am presently founder and career coach at Morgan Latimer Consulting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2022 been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been an adventure for sure. I left Google on February 1st of this year and I have dived head first into full-time entrepreneurship. Whatever I thought it was going to be, it seems like it&#8217;s just a bit different than that, but it&#8217;s been for the good and for the best.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow. Congratulations on making the leap.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah, thanks. It&#8217;s been quite a ride. And I thought that my time at Google was an adventure and a ride, and it just seems like entrepreneurship has made that escalate. It has escalated that ride even faster. I feel like I don&#8217;t have guardrails either, so I&#8217;m really holding on to my seat, my family and I.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about your firm. Again, it&#8217;s called Morgan Latimer Consulting. For folks who might be interested, that comes from Garrett A. Morgan and Lewis Latimer. Right?</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yes. Yup. Garrett A. Morgan, Lewis Latimer, two of my favorite inventors from Black history. They were innovators during a time when it was neither expected for them to be innovators. They weren&#8217;t encouraged to be innovators. No one was willing to carve out room. There was no DEI program. There was only racism, discrimination, slavery, things of that nature. But they weathered all of that in order to innovate in this space. And because of the innovations and their contributions to society, we live in the world that we live in today and benefit from the privileges and technology that we enjoy.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And so, with my firm, my aim is to renew, I think, an understanding or to introduce an understanding that Black people being innovators in the tech space isn&#8217;t anything new. We&#8217;ve been doing it. And similarly, other underrepresented groups, the same can be said for them as well. And I want to help connect that next generation of talent, wherever they come from, no matter who they are, whether you&#8217;re underrepresented or well-represented, connect that generation of talent to the companies and organizations that are interested in leveraging and harnessing that talent.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
So I work directly with candidates, but I also consult for companies and help them to understand their hiring processes, their practices, through the lens of someone who&#8217;s come from a different background and provide just that insight and wisdom.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What inspired you to start your own firm like that?</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve always been attuned to this idea that entrepreneurship is important, especially in America. And when I was in middle school, I attended a very special charter school that was funded by none other than the National Football League. And as part of that middle school experience, I was exposed to entrepreneurship and this idea that I could go and start a business and begin an enterprise and take the risk and dive in. And so, I felt like that sowed the seeds for me to be thinking about entrepreneurship and independence and just making my own moves.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
I only kind of realize this now, but my career journey has always been set up for this. I think one of the reasons why I wanted to work at a variety of places, spend time doing professional consulting, and then ultimately get to Google is just to establish the credentials and build a network that would allow me to strike out on my own one day and try to carve a different path towards the success that I was looking for.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah. So hindsight 2020, I can see where everything all fit together, but it wasn&#8217;t immediately clear even when I got into business, when I got into the working world, that my path might take me to entrepreneurship 20 years later. But I&#8217;m glad to be here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s having that kind of social proof, I guess, as you might think about it with working for these other places and then striking out on your own. I think it helps with clients certainly to know that, &#8220;Oh, well, you know what you&#8217;re talking about in terms of the work that you&#8217;re doing.&#8221; And there&#8217;s some level of vetting in place because you&#8217;ve managed to have these other experiences first before starting your own thing.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s absolutely right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So one thing that you do with your clients, you sort of help them gain the confidence to work in tech, and these are people that either have an interest in tech or maybe might be early career or mid-career, I&#8217;m assuming, and you do a lot of prep with them for coding interviews. Tell me about that process, because I&#8217;ve heard that Google specifically, their coding interviews can be pretty unusual.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. And I think it&#8217;s important to really call out that word, confidence, because I think that my job as a coach or my unique contribution is really helping someone to see themselves in the role based upon their experience and their willingness to put in the work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And a lot of people can study on their own. There&#8217;s tons of resources out there. There&#8217;s academies and boot camps and free courses and all that stuff. But there&#8217;s this recognition that taking all that stuff in alone may not be enough for some people. And not only that, but there&#8217;s these additional challenges and burdens that you may have, especially if you&#8217;re from an underrepresented background, where you may not have a network of people who can help you to connect your own life and experience and your own journey to the tech space.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And so, what I aim to do is to talk about that and to help people understand how to have the right framework and preparation so that you can begin building that confidence and know that you&#8217;re the right person for the job. And that takes a little more effort. That takes me really getting to know my clients. It takes exercising them, paying attention to their problem-solving, making them think through their own problem-solving, arming them with the right frameworks of thinking, so that as you&#8217;re tackling different kinds of interviews, you know what you need to do and when you need to do it. And I talk to my clients a lot about building something called muscle memory. It&#8217;s the same kind of thing that athletes rely on in professional sports.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
People see them playing the game, but they don&#8217;t see them spending the hours of doing repetitive motions and different kinds of exercises to get prepared. They&#8217;re able to have confidence at game-time playing at the highest level in front of millions of people because they have that muscle memory. And so, part of what I seek to teach to my candidates and help them develop is that muscle memory so that they can go into an interview knowing that they have a great chance and not hindered by doubt and fear and uncertainty and those kinds of things that often stop very talented people from being successful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you&#8217;re kind of like part consultant, part psychiatrist in a way, because you&#8217;re kind of helping them to build that internal confidence so, like you said, they see themselves in the role, and I think that is super important. I mean, I&#8217;ve worked at a couple of tech startups and I&#8217;ve been in the position to hire, and one thing that has been a big thing over the past few years has been inclusive language for job listings.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s now even a thing to put in job listings, particularly for tech and design positions, to say like, &#8220;Even if you don&#8217;t have all of these requirements, you should apply anyway,&#8221; or &#8220;If you only have 50%, apply anyway,&#8221; which I think is a way to kind of help people to see themselves in the role because, oftentimes, you may look at the job listing and look at all those different bullet points, and instead of seeing where you&#8217;re strong, you see where you&#8217;re weak, like, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t have this. Well, I don&#8217;t have this many years experience,&#8221; and then you end up not applying when, in actuality, what you need to have is the confidence to say, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m strong in these things, so I&#8217;m going to apply just to kind of see what happens.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Right. And I also want to help you look at that same job description and maybe realize that it&#8217;s not for you, that this isn&#8217;t going to help you achieve your goals. There&#8217;s a lot of people who come to me because they want to crack those top tech companies, those FAANG companies, the Googles, the Amazons, the Microsoft, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And sometimes, I&#8217;ve got to look at them and say, &#8220;Based upon the goals that you just shared with me, you don&#8217;t really need to crack a FAANG company. What you actually need is to consider this startup or maybe think about something mid-tier. Maybe not even a tech company. Maybe you just need to get your foot in the door, and instead of looking at a tech company, you need to look at a non-tech company that has an IT department but also has the framework and infrastructure to help you grow and develop the skills.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
So depending upon where you are, you may not understand how to correctly map your specific goals to the opportunities that are out there. If you come away from a conversation with me realizing, &#8220;I wanted to do this thing, but I realized that that&#8217;s actually not the best fit. Maybe I need to think about entrepreneurship,&#8221; then I&#8217;m like, &#8220;All right. Great. Fantastic. I&#8217;ve saved you some time. I&#8217;ve saved you some trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And I think that, especially as an entrepreneur now, I realize that my own path was about making it to a place like Google and operating at that level. That&#8217;s not everybody&#8217;s path. Some people don&#8217;t need to pursue that journey. That was my journey. That may not be your journey. And there has to be that conversation. There has to be somebody asking those questions, because I think right now, especially in the tech interviewing, tech prep career coaching space, everybody wants to get you to a FAANG company. They&#8217;re pointing you in that direction. They&#8217;re talking about those salaries and all that stuff. But you&#8217;re not really serving candidates well because you&#8217;re selling them this dream and this bill of goods that isn&#8217;t going to be helpful for them.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
I care about my clients and the people that I work with because I think that there&#8217;s tons of transformative opportunity out there and available, but you need somebody to come alongside with you to educate you on how to best put a plan in place, helps you get to where you&#8217;re trying to go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve started seeing companies, even the big ones like the Microsofts and stuff, they&#8217;re doing outreach on TikTok. I probably spend too much time on TikTok. But there&#8217;s a lot of people on TikTok that are really like, &#8220;I want to find the high-paying, six-figure tech jobs. How do you find those jobs?&#8221; Because there will be people that have those jobs that are on TikTok, and they&#8217;re saying, &#8220;These are the perks that I get. I get free lunch here. This is my ride to the office.&#8221; And they sort of paint this very idealistic picture of what it means to be in tech through these kinds of perks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;ll never forget&#8230; I interviewed Kristy Tillman. She&#8217;s been on the show twice, but Kristy now works at Netflix, and I&#8217;ll never forget how she told me to look at perks at companies as filters that just because something may look good in that way, it could also be something that&#8217;s used to filter people out. So I do see a lot of&#8230; I guess you could almost call it propaganda where people are really painting this very idealistic picture of what it looks like to work in tech in these fancy offices, and you get a free MacBook Pro and all this, but not really showing them what it means, not just to work in tech from day to day, but even the process, like you said, to interview to be a part of a company like that, because it might not even be that they need to be there. They probably just need to start out somewhere smaller maybe.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah. No, absolutely. And here&#8217;s the deal: You want success and you want the paycheck and all that stuff. You get that by being good at what you do. You get that by being excellent at your craft. And that has more to do with you and how you move and how you develop than it does on the place that you work. And certainly, when you&#8217;re working at a company, there&#8217;s an expectation that they&#8217;re going to play some part in your development, in your growth, and in your assessment, and provide useful feedback, and all those things.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
But ultimately, you&#8217;ve got to take your career and your craft and your responsibility and put in the time and work to be effective and to really be thoughtful about how to make the right plan to get you to where you&#8217;re trying to go. And so, I think that a lot of people are looking for shortcuts and they&#8217;re trying to circumvent the process, and it&#8217;s important that I remind people that there aren&#8217;t shortcuts to this. It&#8217;s just the same hard work. It&#8217;s the same hard work that my ancestors poured into being who they were and accomplishing the things that they accomplished, not letting excuses or things of that nature get in the way. And because of that, they were able to do what they were able to do. And they faced a lot of unfairness. They faced a ton of unfairness.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And just like we face, to certain degrees, unfairness in today&#8217;s processes, some of that just comes from natural imperfection. We&#8217;re not perfect at what we do as companies or as individuals and applicants. So there&#8217;s that, but then there&#8217;s also these other biases and even discrimination or racism, to some lesser extent, that we&#8217;ve got to combat. And I sometimes struggle with the approaches that I take because I&#8217;m very focused on the individual regardless of the surrounding circumstances.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
But the circumstances, those could use some changing as well, and it&#8217;s important. And that&#8217;s why I want to tackle this from both sides of the bridge. I want to help clients and candidates to understand what they need to do, but I also want to talk to companies and say, &#8220;There are some things that you need to change because the talent is ready. It&#8217;s not a pipeline issue. It&#8217;s a you issue. You need to change what you&#8217;re doing and the pipeline will come. The people will come. You just haven&#8217;t built a room for them.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s a really good point, to let the companies know that sometimes, there&#8217;s things that they&#8217;re doing wrong or things that they may be doing, even just in the language in job listings, the way they&#8217;ve talked about perks, et cetera, that might set them up in a bad light. It&#8217;s funny, speaking about startups and things like this, startups can be a really good place to cut your teeth on working in tech. But they have their own issues too, particularly depending on the scale of where the company is at, and even with diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
At least I&#8217;ve started to see, on the startup level, it&#8217;s becoming less and less of a factor than it has been at larger companies. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s just because of time or DEI fatigue or whatever. But I remember in the early 2010s when those reports started coming out about Google and Facebook and such about their single-digit workforce numbers for Black employees and what does that mean, and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Right. Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I feel like those companies have started over the years to improve that, certainly. Startups are under no obligation to do that. I just know from working at a couple of them. They do not care.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
It really depends because&#8230; I agree with you that when it comes to the larger companies, there&#8217;s an interest to change, but in many respects, it&#8217;s almost too little, too late to make the kind of change that you need to make as quickly as you want to. Right?</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
So for some of these larger companies that have been around for 20 years, 40 years, 50 years, whatever that may be, you&#8217;re talking about a deeply ingrained culture. There&#8217;s a lot of rot that you have to get rid of first before you can even start talking about doing the right things, very carefully guarding that small little flame, that little spark that turns into a fire that then leads to change. So there&#8217;s a lot of momentum that you&#8217;ve got to slow down if you&#8217;re a big company so that you can begin shifting gears.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
But when you&#8217;re a startup, you are in a better position because you&#8217;re new, because you have the opportunity to learn from those mistakes and, from the very beginning, think about the right things to do. My latest client right now, I just signed with Karat as a tech advisor for their Brilliant Black Minds program. And what I love about Karat is that from the beginning, they&#8217;ve made this very early commitment to increasing the number of Black engineers in the business and really thinking through how they can play a role in that. You can go visit their website and read the statement and the thinking and the resource that they&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
I love that they&#8217;re small enough and nimble enough to really tackle this problem at a speed that other companies can&#8217;t do. And I think that there are similar startups that have that opportunity. And to your earlier point, there are some startups that really did get this wrong in a big way. Most notably, I remember learning about the mess at Uber, and I know that they went through some strides to turn over a new leaf. And from what I understand, things are better, much better than they were back in those days.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
But you could see that where&#8230; When some of today&#8217;s startups started making those mistakes, they got called out on it a whole lot faster. It&#8217;s a lot harder for those companies to grow and develop without having that scrutiny, whereas 10 years ago, nobody really cared. 15 years ago, 20 years ago, nobody cared. You could do whatever you wanted.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
So I think that for those in the audience or for job seekers or candidates who are looking for companies who may have stronger commitments, who may be making better progress, looking at those smaller firms, those startups, those growth phase companies, that might be the better play if that&#8217;s something that you care deeply about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I agree. I agree and I disagree. I mean, I&#8217;m disagreeing from my own personal experiences, but I do agree that there are some startups out there that are doing it, particularly because you&#8217;re starting to see a lot of POC-owned, Black-owned startups. So of course, they have diversity and inclusion in mind because they started it. So that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s important to them. So I get where you&#8217;re coming from. Absolutely. What is a typical day like for you? I know you just said you kind of struck out on your own, but have you started to achieve a work-life balance with the firm?</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
No, I wish. Every day is different, and that&#8217;s been great and it&#8217;s been challenging at the same time. I woke up today and I was like, &#8220;What am I going to do? I know I got to do a podcast, but other than that, what else am I going to do? Should I go put some meetings on the calendar? Should I work on a thing?&#8221; And so, I would like to say that I&#8217;m a lot more intentional and wise in terms of how I&#8217;m planning my time. But each day has been a little bit different, and I find myself in infrastructure-building mode a lot.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
So I think as I work through some of these beginning things as a new entrepreneur, I&#8217;ll get more of the consistency and the regularity out of my routine. But right now, I&#8217;m still, I think, figuring it out. I&#8217;m trying to be patient with that as well. I don&#8217;t want to rush into completely filling up my schedule with things. I want to make sure that everything that I&#8217;m committing to is intentional and thought out and is going to serve, in some way, the mission that I&#8217;m pursuing.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah. From that perspective, it&#8217;s been fun. And the other part of this too is that my wife is the co-owner of Morgan Latimer Consulting. So I&#8217;m working here at home and my wife is a key partner with me in this effort, largely working behind the scenes. But I&#8217;m also getting the kids involved too and having conversations out loud and in the open as they&#8217;re doing school.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And so, it&#8217;s been interesting to expose the whole family to entrepreneurship and to this lifestyle and to be open and honest with my kids about the challenges and opportunities. And so, I think what happens more than that is, I&#8217;ll find a learning opportunity in the middle of the day and put everything on pause and talk to my wife or talk to my kids about what I&#8217;m thinking and where things can go and even getting their advice and input, and that&#8217;s been a lot of fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
A true family business. I like that.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah. Absolutely. The only other challenge that I&#8217;m contending with right now is just needing to travel a little bit more as things thaw out with regards to the pandemic and travel resumes. Now I&#8217;m needing to be in more places crossing the country. And so, I try to look for opportunities to bring my family with me so that they can experience that part of it as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Speaking about family, let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit. You grew up in Compton. I know that because it&#8217;s on the hat that you have in all your photos.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Well, I could be faking it. I could be-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re faking it. I don&#8217;t know anyone that would fake and&#8230; Well, let me not tell that lie. I do know people that would fake and say they&#8217;re from the hood. Let me not say that.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But you&#8217;re from L.A. You live in L.A. Tell me, growing up in Compton, was tech a part of your childhood?</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah, it was, amazingly enough. And that may come across as unexpected for some of your listeners. But growing up in a poor place, in a place like Compton that was renowned for things like gang violence, drugs, poverty, all that stuff, now, well, it turns out that having rich people in the area means that we receive some investment and support from very notable people. And I think it was Magic Johnson who, in the early &#8217;90s, donated a non-trivial sum of money to my elementary school. As a result, we got a basketball court, but also a computer lab.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And it was in that computer lab when I was in the second grade that I had the opportunity to use a computer for the first time. And it profoundly changed my life because that&#8217;s when I realized that computers were cool and this might be something that I want to keep doing, whether I get paid for it or not. And so, I remember asking my parents for a computer and they said no, and I didn&#8217;t understand at the time that computers were $5,000 or more to get something decent. But my foster parents, as well as my birth mom, they both bought me toy computers, which were super cool. And when I was about eight years old, I used one of those toy computers to teach myself how to code.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mmm.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And I remember, at the time, I was being bullied for a variety of reasons. And so, I became somewhat of an introvert out of necessity and would pour focus and time and attention into computers and programming. And I just remember feeling this sense of empowerment and agency and control using computers that I didn&#8217;t have in other aspects of my life. I failed to mention this, and it&#8217;s pretty much common knowledge now, but I grew up as a foster kid after my first grade teacher or kindergarten teacher had found signs of physical abuse.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And so, losing your whole family and being moved out of your home is a very transformative and traumatic experience for someone who&#8217;s four years old. And I found that interacting with technology allowed me to reclaim control and power and just to have a space to be me and to be a creative thinker and an innovative thinker. I wasn&#8217;t building apps and all this stuff, but it was enough to whet my appetite and get me engaged, and I would just continue to pursue computers throughout middle school and throughout high school where I was fortunate in both cases to meet mentors who saw that early love and decided to invest time into developing my knowledge around technology and the internet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. Something you mentioned there, I think, we have in common in terms of growing up in&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say small towns. I don&#8217;t know how large Compton is, but certainly growing up in towns with dubious reputations.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m from Selma, as most people-</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Hey.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; know from the show, from Selma, Alabama. Kind of like the first generation out from Bloody Sunday. And so, now Selma is like a pit stop on every politician&#8217;s tour throughout the country. They stop in, they go to Brown Chapel AME, they walk across the bridge, yada yada yada. They do all that stuff. But because of that general perennial attention on the city, you do have people that will come in and there&#8217;s like an influx of cash to one of the local schools or&#8230; You know what I mean? So we had a computer lab in high school, which is how I learned about the internet. That was my first foray with Netscape Navigator 1.0.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Oh, wow. Let&#8217;s get it. Yes. Yeah. I&#8217;m right there with you, brother. We learned that the same time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That was in my&#8230; I was in, I think, ninth or tenth grade when they installed the computer lab and got to see what the internet was like back then. But even as you mentioned learning and teaching yourself how to code with these toy computers, I&#8217;m super curious, what was the computers that you were using?</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah. So the one that I used specifically to learn coding was called the PreComputer 1000.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Get out! Oh, I&#8217;m sorry. Go ahead.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, no. No, keep going. Sorry. Sorry. I had that same computer. I had that same&#8230; The blue one with the handle?</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the blue one with the handle. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
So I&#8217;ll tell you a funny story real quick. I would talk about that computer when I would go to schools during my time at Google and all this stuff, and I had lost the computer. I didn&#8217;t have&#8230; I don&#8217;t know what happened with it. Things get lost, as they do, over decades. And one day, this Christmas present was sitting on my desk and I opened it up, and it&#8217;s a PreComputer 1000. A co-worker had bought me a PreComputer 1000 off of eBay or something because they knew that I had grown up on that computer and they knew-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
&#8230; how passionate I was about sharing technology with the young people. And so, I would take that computer with me on tours and flip the switch where you&#8217;d hear the little (singing). And I would take out the big old fat D batteries on the back and say,-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh man.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
&#8230; &#8220;This is it.&#8221; That&#8217;s what I had. And one of the reasons why I&#8217;m passionate about supporting underrepresented people in tech specifically is because out of scarcity comes innovation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Out of scarcity and challenge and struggle comes some of the best ideas and some of the greatest opportunities to do things that haven&#8217;t been done before. And for me, growing up under the scarce conditions of the hood and with the family that I often describe as middle-class poor, that led to me doing things like teaching myself how to code and learning about the internet and all these other kinds of things. For an industry that&#8217;s looking for talent that knows how to build technology under those kinds of circumstances, what better place to look than the hoods and ghettos of America?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Why spend all of this time going overseas looking for that kind of talent when we have our own neglected neighborhoods in the backyards of America?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Listen, these kids don&#8217;t know how good they got it now. When you have to teach-</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
They really don&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; yourself how to code on a one-line dot-matrix screen&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, come on. So my older brother had&#8230; And this is when I was younger. I probably might have been about seven or eight or something. He had a&#8230; It was also a VTech, but it was a Laser 50.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Mmm.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so, the Laser 50 is about the size of a standard, regular keyboard that you would get now, but it had a one-line dot-matrix screen at the very top and you would use that to code. And I remember&#8230; The Laser 50 was particularly interesting because it had all these peripherals you could get for it. You could get a tiny dot-matrix printer. You could get a tiny-</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; storage thing. And storage back then were cassettes, because you didn&#8217;t have flash drives. You didn&#8217;t have&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yup.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, you had floppy disks, but you certainly didn&#8217;t have&#8230; But it was a cassette. And so, I would often be mistakenly putting data, like taping over somebody&#8217;s radio mix, because it used this&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Oh, no. Not the radio mix.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Trying to explain to someone that like, &#8220;Yeah. We use cassettes for music and for data storage.&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;What? I don&#8217;t get that.&#8221; But yeah, I had a PreComputer 1000. I think I was in probably fourth or fifth grade. I remember that spiral-bound flip notebook. I taught myself how to type on that thing.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
There it is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I taught myself music on that thing. I&#8217;m sure my mom wanted to launch it into space because I was making all kinds of noise on that thing. Yeah. And it&#8217;s funny, you mentioned getting one off of eBay. Someone gifted one to you. I got one off eBay also-</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Hey, there it is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; a few years ago. I got a Laser 50 and I got a PreComputer 1000 just to have them as artifacts of like, &#8220;This is how I got into technology.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah. And I wish that I had the opportunity to meet the product managers or project managers who worked on that because it would be so great to just give them a personal thank you for thinking about a product like this. Again, to your earlier point, I&#8217;m hard on this generation of technologists that are coming up because, as you said, they don&#8217;t realize how good they have it. And I do understand that there&#8217;s a challenge. There&#8217;s so much information that it can be hard to pick through what&#8217;s reliable and useful from that, which isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
But I had to go to a library that had books that were five, 10 years old out of date, trying to teach myself coding and programming, just kind of growing in that. That was a tough challenge, and that was&#8230; It was enough to make me give up programming until I got out of high school when I would go get my first job as a developer.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
I remember feeling so frustrated because I would pick up these old books and I would try to apply what I was learning, but I didn&#8217;t understand it all the way and I didn&#8217;t have someone that I could lean on to explain. I remember this one time in middle school where I typed out this whole program. I must have spent a couple hours just typing out this whole program into Notepad on Windows.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Whoo! That takes me back.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah. And so, I saved&#8230; I just saved this text document as an exe thinking, &#8220;Well, all I have to do is just save it and then change the extension to exe and I should be able to double-click and run it.&#8221; And I spent an hour just trying to get that to work and it wouldn&#8217;t work, and I was so frustrated because I didn&#8217;t understand that you needed a compiler in between that&#8217;ll produce the actual program. And so, I remember those kinds of moments.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And then I think about the fact that my son can watch a YouTube video now that tells him exactly what tools to install and how to make it all work and have all the sample code and then he could put that up on GitHub and all this other stuff. And so, I reflect on that and I try to&#8230; I have to kind of take a step back and just not yell at people, not get gangsta at them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
What do you mean? What are you talking about? You ain&#8217;t got no struggle. What are you talking about you can&#8217;t do this? What are you talking about you don&#8217;t have information?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Get over it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh man. I remember we&#8230; Our public library had one book on BASIC. It was like this green and white book. And I mean, I check that thing out every two weeks till the cover came off, taped the cover back on. And because Selma is like a&#8230; It&#8217;s a small town. It&#8217;s like 20,000 people maybe.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No mall or anything. So the nearest bookstore was 50-plus miles away in Montgomery. So if I was like, &#8220;Oh, I want to go get a book,&#8221; that&#8217;s a whole trip. That&#8217;s a field trip, pretty much.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh God, I think I got my first HTML book, I might have been in high school or something, but I remember getting it at the Montgomery Mall because we were at some trip in Montgomery and I got it. But there&#8217;s&#8230; Also during that time, I spent a lot of time in the computer lab by myself. My mom worked at a college. And so, I had access to Windows computers. And I just spent so much time looking at source code, writing stuff down, trying to figure out how it all worked, because I could only do it at the computer lab. I would do that and then have to go home and write a paper on a typewriter.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah. Right. Right. Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Because I could only use the computer either at high school or I could use it at my mom&#8217;s work at the college. I didn&#8217;t get my own personal computer until I went off to college in &#8217;99. But yeah, kids, they don&#8217;t know how good they got it. I&#8217;m saying kids in a general pejorative sense, but just like, people that are learning technology now, there&#8217;s so much at your fingertips. It&#8217;s astonishing.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
I mean, and that&#8217;s the thing is&#8230; One of the things I try to impress on this generation is the importance of making things and building things and being public about that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
So as you&#8217;re learning and as you&#8217;re growing, assemble that gallery, assemble that portfolio, and make it external and use social media to your advantage. These are things I didn&#8217;t learn till later on, but it was partly because of those reasons that I was able to even get the attention of a Google in the first place. And I think that&#8230; I ponder what my path in tech might have looked like had I had the tools that I had. And another part of this too, because having a son and daughter, my son is 15, my daughter is 12, I look at them and I realize that they just don&#8217;t have the same gumption. They don&#8217;t have the same motivation that I did, my drive and my wife&#8217;s drive.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
We came from a place where you had to find a pathway to success. You needed the struggle. You needed to overcome a lot and be intentional about figuring out where you wanted to go to avoid all the little traps that come with growing up in the hood. And so, we were sufficiently motivated to take advantage of every possible resource we could find and get our hands on to succeed. My kids benefit from a great deal of privilege. And without much effort at all, they have access to tons of information and tons of resources, but not necessarily having that drive.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And I think that there&#8217;s time for them to develop that and to grow on that. There&#8217;s a sense in which I want them to just enjoy ingesting knowledge and doing it carefully, but just being slow. They don&#8217;t need to build an empire now. But I&#8217;ve got to push them a little bit to put in the work to really realize what they have so that they are being producers and not just consumers of technology.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mmm. I want to go back to&#8230; You mentioned, in high school, you had this aptitude for technology after learning about it so much. And then for college, you went to UC Irvine. Tell me about that time. What was it like there?</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
That was an interesting and difficult time for me personally, and I don&#8217;t mean difficult just in terms of challenging. Yeah, it was challenging, as education should be, but there was also this aspect where I think I had to deal with difficulty that maybe other people didn&#8217;t have to experience. The first thing is that I didn&#8217;t see a lot of people who look like me and who came from where I came from in classes with me learning about computer science.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
I looked at the population of students that I was surrounded by in the computer science program versus in other places of the university and would sometimes think to myself, &#8220;Am I in the wrong major? Is this really a pathway and a world built for me?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And I had to struggle through that. I didn&#8217;t have the best study habits. Well, let me put it another way. I was a lazy bum when it came to school. I think part of it was that I didn&#8217;t understand how I learned and how I would best ingest information. And so, that was one thing. But the other part of it was that, in school, I had to conserve energy a lot. I wasn&#8217;t one of those kinds of people that could just go to school and focus on my studies. I also had to work. I had to earn income to make sure that&#8230; And I had scholarships, but I didn&#8217;t have a full ride.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And so, there was a lot of context switching between being devoted to school, but then also making sure that I&#8217;m taking care of bills and other concerns associated with being an adult on your own. And so, I think in the craziest time of college, I would go to school at UC Irvine. I would drive to downtown L.A., which took about an hour and a half, to go work part-time on my job. And then I would sometimes come back to school, which was another hour, finish off classes, and then drive 30 minutes home. And that was a real grind for, ooh, a couple of years throughout my college education.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
When I talk about providing the perspective of someone who&#8217;s underrepresented, there are a lot of people who want to get into tech who have very challenging life circumstances, where they struggle just to either support themselves or their family or whatever that may be, and they&#8217;re trying to get their leg up and study and learn all these things, and it&#8217;s a challenge. But by God&#8217;s grace, even in college, I had a lot of good support and that I had summer internships through the INROADS program. That was fantastic and really helped to root my education.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And then during the year, I had the opportunity to work for City National Bank to work as a developer in real life. And so, in addition to what I was getting in the classroom, I was also, in some respects, playing that out in the working world. And so, it was good to have that reinforcement there. And there were a community of folks that I could lean on and talk to. I think there was a good community of Black folks on campus.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
I did other strategic things. I took gospel choir three times in college. I don&#8217;t even know if I got credit for the last time I took it because I think there was a limit, but I would take gospel choir because I grew up in the church and I grew up as a gospel music musician from the time that I was, I don&#8217;t know, nine years old, 10 years old, and I&#8217;ve been playing every Sunday at church ever since then. So gospel choir in college was a safe space for me, if I can use that phrase, for me to just be around something familiar and around something that really encouraged and gave me hope. So it was great.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And ultimately, I left the University of California, Irvine with a 2.87 GPA on the five-year plan. I had gone to a charter school for high school as well and had great education opportunities. I really should have gotten out of college in three years because I came in with college credits. It took me five. And I reflect on how challenging that was and how that experience impacted how I saw myself as a professional after I graduated, because I didn&#8217;t have a lot of confidence when I graduated high school, even though I would go on and get a job and all that stuff. I certainly didn&#8217;t see myself as big tech material, as Google material. Just walking across the stage with a diploma was a generational accomplishment, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And so, when you&#8217;re coming from the perspective of survival, any success is big success. And so, it didn&#8217;t take very much for me to feel satisfied and accomplished after graduating college. And I had no idea the amount of headroom I had to work with in my career. If I would&#8217;ve known then what I know today, I think that would&#8217;ve drastically changed my career trajectory and path. I didn&#8217;t have those examples. I didn&#8217;t have that network of people that I could look to and say, &#8220;Hey, I want to be like this person.&#8221; I see that they kind of have a path like mine&#8217;s and they&#8217;ve had some struggles and they&#8217;re able to do what they&#8217;re doing. I might be able to do the same thing. Let me apply myself. Let me work even harder. Let me take advantage of these opportunities that I was too scared to take advantage of.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And I think that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m so public about my own journey, my own trials, and really kind of getting in the face of other folks who might be like me or might have come from where I&#8217;ve come from to let them know that I am that living example of what they can accomplish if they&#8217;re willing to take the risks and to step out on faith, as it were, and really own their journey, their path, their growth, and their development.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, once you graduated from UC Irvine, what was your early career like?</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah. So I transitioned from being an intern to a full-time employee at City National Bank. The experience was a little jarring in that when you grow up in a computer science education, you kind of expect that you&#8217;re going to see theoretical things playing out in the real world. And for the first several years of my career, I really didn&#8217;t see that happen, and it&#8217;s because I didn&#8217;t understand that a computer science education is really designed to position you well for working at a tech company or working at a tech-focused organization. And at the time, I was working for a bank. Banks aren&#8217;t tech companies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
They see IT as a cost center. They see IT as a&#8230; You want to spend the least amount of money possible to get the bare minimum so that you minimize the cost. And so, they just didn&#8217;t care a lot about making things fast or quick or really applying, at that time, good UX principles and stuff like that. And so, it was confusing. I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Hey, we need to do this and have these kinds of practices,&#8221; and it was always seen as a burden and as something that kind of slowed down the process.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And so, I was confused by this and eventually began to fit into the more corporate IT way of thinking about software development and all those things. That&#8217;s useful. It was useful for where I was moving at the time. I learned how to engage with my craft in that kind of environment and find success, but I became detached from what I was learning in school.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And I didn&#8217;t really connect with that again until the Google interview, where I had to dust off the Data Structures and Algorithms book and reacquaint myself with the big O and with some of these other formal concepts that I learned in my computer science education. But the upside of working in the corporate environment that I worked in during those times is that because of what I perceived as chaos and disorganization, I got to learn a crap ton of stuff. It&#8217;s kind of like working at a startup that just hasn&#8217;t figured it out yet.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
You do 10,000 things, because there&#8217;s nobody else to figure it out. And so, you&#8217;re just kind of throwing mud at the wall to see if it sticks. That was kind of my experience early in my career. And so, that made things fun. And I would often say yes to things, even if I didn&#8217;t know what it was or how it worked. My boss says, &#8220;Okay. Who wants to tackle this thing?&#8221; &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ll tackle it. I don&#8217;t know what this is, but if you give me time, I&#8217;ll figure it out.&#8221; And I&#8217;ve just began to develop and grow that muscle of figuring things out, going from knowing nothing to knowing something to then being effective. Repeating that process over and over again really helped me to develop good, solid problem-solving skills that I would take later into my career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you were at City National Bank for a long time, like almost nine years.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And even after that, you worked at a couple of other places for a pretty long time. You worked at Slalom Consulting. You worked at Junction eCommerce On Demand. When you look back at these experiences collectively, what do you remember?</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
I definitely remember leaving City National Bank and making that decision. What caused me to leave&#8230; For me, money isn&#8217;t everything. And what&#8217;s more important to me, or at least what was more important to me at the time, was growth opportunity and learning. I felt like I needed to learn and grow or at least get paid really good money to stay in my seat. And at the time, I felt like I wasn&#8217;t really growing in the way that I wanted to grow and stepping into opportunities that I wanted to step into.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And part of that was because I was working for a bank in 2008 in the middle of something called a financial crisis and a Great Recession. So I was not in the best industry for that kind of stuff anyway. And so, I decided to leave at the time to pursue growth in my development. And so, I remember going from this non-technical company to a tech company in JunctionEOD and all of a sudden connecting with some of these things that I talked about learning in my computer science education.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
I was like, &#8220;Oh, okay. That&#8217;s where this really applies.&#8221; And so, I got to learn a lot of cool stuff and to do some things that would set me up again for success later on. Got to work with a&#8230; I&#8217;d worked in a large company with thousands of employees, and then ended up working in this department where there were just five of us. And so, it felt very much like a startup or a startup in growth phase. It was interesting to work with&#8230; to have a technical manager and someone who was a manager, who was also an engineer. My previous manager wasn&#8217;t an engineer. I have experience coding before, but really didn&#8217;t dabble in the technical.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
So to go from that to someone who is technical and having those discussions, I just found that to be cool. And I really learned a lot from my boss at the time, Mike, who was just a great engineer, double-majored in physics and math, I think it was, or actually had a master&#8217;s degree in physics and math. So just really a smart guy. I just remember growing and develop&#8230; Honestly, Mike, if you&#8217;re listening, sorry, wasn&#8217;t necessarily the best manager at the time. And so, I perceived that I needed to get myself into a position where I could find even more growth and learning.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
But again, a lot of what motivated me to move from one place to the other was the learning and the growth, not necessarily the money. Now, as I move from one company to the next, I found myself getting $15,000 raises each time, so that was nice. But it wasn&#8217;t something I was looking for.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
I felt like it was just necessary for me to keep growing and keep getting better. And if I didn&#8217;t feel like that was happening, then I wanted to move. And so, by the time I got to Slalom Consulting, I had the opportunity to work with consultants in past jobs and past roles, and I really loved looking at consultants and watching them work and seeing the kinds of opportunities they got to dive into. And so, when I had the chance to become a consultant, I really enjoyed that, and working on a variety of customer projects in a variety of different contexts and seeing how the same skills I&#8217;ve been using for over a decade at that point could be used in a variety of different contexts. And that was very helpful. Very, very helpful.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And again, I love this idea of being hired to be an expert in something that I didn&#8217;t know or understand yet, being entrusted to just kind of dive in and start solving problems using brand new tools and processes, and I really enjoyed that. And I enjoy Slalom as a company. I think Slalom continues to be a great company and I hear nothing but good things, still, from folks who have worked there in the past and have gone on to other things. I might still actually be at Slalom today if it hadn&#8217;t been for Google knocking on the door.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s talk about Google. I mean, I&#8217;m sure that folks that are listening have heard about how tough it is to break into Google, their interview process, et cetera. Tell me about what your Google experience was like.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah. So I connected with Google as a young man in college, my first and second year of college actually. So Google Search showed up on the scene, and you probably remember Infoseek and AltaVista and Ask Jeeves and those earlier search engines.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And I remember Google Search coming on the scene and just changing the game. All of a sudden, I felt like I had this world of information at my fingertips where I could find exactly what I was looking for with just a few keystrokes. Then I remember Gmail, this free mail service. And people take advantage of, then neglect to appreciate free email. You had Gmail, which is free email service. I could put attachments in and schoolwork there and use it, and it was amazing.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And I thought Google as a company name was a weird name. The first thing I said was, &#8220;Look at this Yahoo clone. Google. Who do they think they are?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
But they were interesting and innovative, and they were dabbling in a bunch of these different spaces even in the early days. And then they went public and made millions of dollars for folks who had joined the company early and been part of that process. I was attracted to Google as a company and to Google technology. And even today, post-Google career, I still love Google products and services. And I forgot to turn off the device, and so there might be something that&#8230; The Assistant might chirp in and interrupt me at any time now. I&#8217;ve always loved the technologies and things they built and their ambition as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And so, even though I love the company, I never saw myself being worthy of being employed there, being considered amongst the ranks of software engineers there. And so, when I encountered a recruiter in college, I think it was my third year of college, they gave me an application, asked me to fill it out for an internship. I walked away some steps and threw the application in the trash, because I knew-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Whoa.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
&#8230; that they weren&#8217;t going to hire a Black dude from the hood. I just knew that. They weren&#8217;t going to hire a Black man from the hood who&#8217;s a former physical, sexual abuse victim. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No.&#8221; So that was my early interaction with Google. And then some years later, 11 years into my career, a recruiter reached out to me over LinkedIn and said, &#8220;Hey, I think that there&#8217;s a place and a role for you at the company. You should consider applying.&#8221; And it felt different because the recruiter used my full name. They singled me out on LinkedIn.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And I had 11 years of career experience under my belt at that point. And so, I felt emboldened to go through the interview process. Yeah. I didn&#8217;t have a friend, cousin, uncle, brother, whatever, that had worked anywhere near a big tech company. And so, I had to do what any self-respecting engineer would do in my position. I googled it. &#8220;How do you succeed at this interview process?&#8221; And I came across some good information but I also came across some bad information. I didn&#8217;t know how to disambiguate the two. And so, I ended up studying brain teasers for two weeks and went into this interview process and not a single brain teaser was asked.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And I fought as hard as I could with the information that I had and worked very hard. It wasn&#8217;t an issue of work ethic. It was an issue of information and not being connected to the right network. And ultimately, I was saddened to hear from the recruiter that they weren&#8217;t going to move forward. And I remember reflecting on that &#8220;no&#8221; and thinking that I had let down myself, my family, my community, my church, all Black people everywhere, because when-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, when I&#8217;m coming into the space as an underrepresented person, I know that the people that I&#8217;m talking to, I might be one of the very few Black folks that they ever talked to, one of the very few people from Compton. Maybe the only person from Compton that they&#8217;ll ever meet, and that they&#8217;re forming ideas about who I am and about what I represent. And so, I was aware of that burden and I was deeply impacted by that.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
So when recruiters would reach out the next year and the year after that, I think three times total, after I had failed the interview, I was very confused. I was like, &#8220;Y&#8217;all know I&#8217;m a Black man, right?&#8221; Right? Everybody says they&#8217;re going to call you back if a position is available. No one ever does. And these recruiters called me back, I think, three times. And my last recruiter understood that I was very hesitant to reengage with the process.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
It kind of babied me, kind of coddled me in the conversation. And I kind of walked away from that thinking, &#8220;She thinks I&#8217;m a punk.&#8221; She&#8217;s calling me a&#8230; That&#8217;s really what&#8217;s going on here. She&#8217;s calling me a punk. I can&#8217;t go out like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And so, after talking to my wife and getting her support, I realized that I wanted to try again. And so, I picked up Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, bought a whiteboard and some markers, really committed myself to studying the right information this time. And as a result of a month and a half of studying for, I don&#8217;t know, three or four hours a day, except for Sundays because I&#8217;m closed on Sundays, I was able to go through the interview process and get the job.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And you would think that after that, everything is happily ever after, like, &#8220;Yay, you did it. You accomplished this amazing feat. Now you can rest and ride off into the sunset.&#8221; Well, as soon as I got to Google, I felt uncomfortable. And it wasn&#8217;t because of anything specific that people were doing. It&#8217;s that I just&#8230; I couldn&#8217;t sit in my seat. I was unnerved and restless. I would sit in this cafe surrounded by free food, free snacks, free beverages, by games and pool tables and really smart people, and my attention would be directed to the basketball court on the first floor as I&#8217;m watching these dudes duke it out on the basketball court.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m like, I understand that part. I understand basketball. I understand that struggle. I understand that life. I don&#8217;t understand this. I don&#8217;t understand tech, this new privilege. And there&#8217;s this culture shock. I&#8217;m forced to dress different than I had ever dressed before. I start off my career in a bank, suit and tie, and everybody&#8217;s now wearing jeans and a T-shirt. The whole thing is jarring. My bosses&#8230; My co-workers are telling me that I&#8217;m doing a good job, and I don&#8217;t believe them because I know I&#8217;m the diversity hire. Right?</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
You ain&#8217;t got to lie to kick it. I&#8217;m the diversity hire. You hired me because you don&#8217;t have that many Black folks and you just want to make sure that your numbers look good. So I knew all those things, even though it wasn&#8217;t necessarily true. And it wasn&#8217;t until 2014 when Google released their diversity numbers that I realized what I was dealing with. It wasn&#8217;t just impostor syndrome. It was this awareness that I&#8217;m this underrepresented person put in this culture that wasn&#8217;t built for me.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And I felt like, at the time when Google released their numbers, if they were making a commitment to bring visibility and light to this problem, I needed to take a role in helping to solve that problem and using every means at my disposal to bring positive change to the industry using my own experience and journey. And so, I started to write about my journey and experience and share interview tips and talk about things that I did well and things I didn&#8217;t do well. I tried to be very public about the failure that I had during the first interview and the successes during the second one, and just be open and honest about the struggles and all that. And as I did that, people would reward me with recognition and with support and encouragement.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And I thank God that, at Google, I had the opportunity to start off as an engineer, just heads down writing code, but then eventually become this DEI advocate, this speaker, this consultant within the company, and even outside the company, talking about this experience in recruiting and what it means to be an underrepresented person in tech. And so, I really enjoyed the fact that not only did my boss support me in that work, but my boss&#8217;s boss and my boss&#8217;s boss&#8217;s boss, they all said, &#8220;Listen, you do your thing. Keep speaking, keep writing, keep supporting, keep providing value to the tech community, and we&#8217;ll make sure that your performance reviews reflect those contributions positively.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
I felt like it was a unique time, a unique team, and a great time for me to be involved in the work and growing. And I credit the influence and the things that make me who I am today in part to Google and the people that I had the opportunity to work with. So I think because of that, I know that a lot of people are doing the work. I don&#8217;t know that many companies are doing it better than Google is at least in some respects.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, it sounds like you really found yourself there, not only as a professional but, in a way, almost as a person. You had these early times of impostor syndrome and self-doubt, and you were able to overcome that through your time there.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, there was so much self-discovery for me, partly because of all the bags that I brought through in my life and the time that I was a kid. I mean, I really had to confront my whole life in that whole journey when I got to Google. And I don&#8217;t know why it was that it took me getting to Google to do that, but I really went through a crisis when I got to Google.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
There&#8217;s this thing called survivor&#8217;s guilt where, when you feel like you&#8217;ve survived trauma, you feel guilty and ask questions like, &#8220;Why is it that I wasn&#8217;t shot and killed when I was 19 like some of my early friends had been? Why is it that I wasn&#8217;t being funeralized? Why is it that even though I saw other people who were working harder than me and who I thought were smarter than me, why did I make it to this level and they didn&#8217;t?&#8221; And I really had to grapple with that. And it took me to some very dark places personally.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
My wife, my family can tell you that I really found it difficult to bear with that stress. And I told my boss, I said, &#8220;Listen, have you ever managed someone who&#8217;s a physical and sexual abuse survivor to the best of your knowledge?&#8221; Said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, have you ever managed someone who&#8217;s a foster kid from the hood?&#8221; &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay. So we&#8217;re both new at this. We&#8217;re both going to figure this out. But my commitment to you is that I&#8217;m going to work as hard as I possibly can to contribute to this team, to do excellent work, and to pay attention to my craft. That&#8217;s my commitment to you, and we&#8217;ll figure the rest out.&#8221; And I believe that my manager was very great and understanding in coming alongside with me for that journey and just being open and honest. So I appreciate that to this day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see diversity in tech now, from your perspective?</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s still&#8230; I feel like it&#8217;s still burgeoning. We&#8217;re still in the early stages in many respects. I can remember when&#8230; Even just a few years ago, we were still struggling to figure out terminology, and that&#8217;s one of the frustrating things about working in DEI, is it seems like the glossary&#8217;s changing every single year. New words to use, new things to add to the language.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
BIPOC.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly. I think, a month ago, I was like, &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; And I had to ask somebody, &#8220;What&#8217;s a URM stand for?&#8221; because I forgot what it was. Even when I joined Google, I was just like, &#8220;Do I call myself Black or African American?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
I was asking myself that. And so, there&#8217;s still a lot of newness in this space. And part of&#8230; I think there&#8217;s also a conflict between the academic understanding of DEI and things like critical race theory and all that stuff, thought leaders who are on that level. But then you have people who are just trying&#8230; who are experiencing what it&#8217;s like being in the workplace rubbing up against people that you may not understand, who have experiences that you may not be familiar with and just trying to figure it out on an emotional level.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
I think those two perspectives sometimes come into conflict and companies are trying to figure out what to do in the middle of all of that. A decade ago, maybe even five years ago, you wouldn&#8217;t hear about love being talked about in the workplace, unless you&#8217;re talking about workplace romances. But there&#8217;s this notion that tech companies are trying to figure out how to love their employees, which is really weird even when I say that now. But I&#8217;ve had to expose more of my life in big tech in the past several years than I ever had to before, and that&#8217;s because tech, I think pre-2013, 2014, was very much color-blind. We don&#8217;t see race, we don&#8217;t see gender, all those other kinds of things.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
There was this big emphasis on an extreme side of the spectrum where you just pretended to ignore these differentiations between people of different backgrounds and whatnot, then tried to typecast everybody as this one thing. And that was harmful, I think. I don&#8217;t think that was helpful. To a certain extent, you want to make sure that you have a culture where everybody feels like they&#8217;re working on the same mission and going in the same direction. I don&#8217;t want to negate that, but there&#8217;s also disservice when you are pretending to be color-blind.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Last time I checked, color blindness is considered a disorder or a disability or whatever the right word is for that. It&#8217;s not something helpful. And so, I think we&#8217;re starting to open our eyes and see color for the first time and see some of these other things for the first time and are still figuring it out. And like I said, there&#8217;s a lot of things that are happening both at the big tech company and at the small tech company level to correct and chart a new path forward. But it&#8217;s messy work.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
And even that, it&#8217;s refreshing to be able to admit that nowadays because back in the days, DEI was a bunch of people who look different, holding hands, singing Kumbaya, sitting in the middle of a park, high-fiving each other. That was kind of the ideal some years ago, and I think we&#8217;re realizing that that&#8217;s not what the work looks like. The work is grimy, it&#8217;s messy, it&#8217;s hard, it&#8217;s difficult. There&#8217;s a lot of disagreement. There&#8217;s agreeing to disagree.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
But at the end of the day, the hope is that all of these different perspectives will inform a culture that fosters innovation and creativity and new ways of thinking about old problems. And so, there&#8217;s clearly business opportunity here. I think the research bears that out, and I think companies are understanding that there&#8217;s a lot of money to be made by having these discussions and thinking through these things. And that&#8217;s not bad.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s something that perhaps not many people understand about you? I mean, I feel like you&#8217;ve put so much of your life story out there, not just with the work that you do, but also at the places where you&#8217;ve worked.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s something you think people still don&#8217;t get about you?</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
My faith, absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mmm.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Hands down. It&#8217;s the fact that I think about all the things that I think about from the lens of someone who&#8217;s a Christian and is saturated in the Christian Bible and in the scriptures. I&#8217;ve told people countless times, &#8220;If you ever want to figure me out, go read that Bible, then you&#8217;ll have me dead to rights.&#8221; That&#8217;s it. I mean, I do what I do because my hero, my Savior, Christ Jesus, was someone who gave himself up for the world. That style of servant leadership, that sacrificing for other people is very core to what I do.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Also, just in terms of my work ethic and how I engage, I want to make sure that I&#8217;m a good reflection of Christ. I want to make sure that I&#8217;m moving in wisdom. Proverbs, I grew up on the Book of Proverbs when I was growing up and learning about everything from how to manage money wisely, to how to have conversations with people that are going to be positive and good, to how to win friends, and how to avoid the traps of street life.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
A lot of that I learned from the Bible, from Proverbs, and from looking at these exemplary figures, these historical figures, who have to overcome a variety of different circumstances and challenges and trials with their faith rested on God. And that&#8217;s how I move today. So much of what I do is also gospel-focused too. I think one of the things that helps me to be a DEI practitioner, talking about diversity, equity, and inclusion, is my faith. Seeing people as made in the image of God.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
For me, it&#8217;s not about just helping Black people or just helping brown people or just helping women, whatever that is. It&#8217;s about helping anybody in the space that wants to be successful. And then there&#8217;s this other aspect of like, &#8220;I know how evil I am in my own heart because the Bible teaches me that.&#8221; And so, I can have a conversation with someone who maybe is an overt racist and talk about their viewpoints and talk about why I might disagree with them and call them to have hope in Christ and to see that their thinking is evil.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
But I also know that I&#8217;m a bad dude. I have done things over my own career and over my own life that I&#8217;m certainly not proud of because they were wrong, and that means that I can have compassion towards other people who I disagree with and have those calm conversations. One of the things that I tell people all the time is, &#8220;You can ask me about anything with regards to race, gender, my life, whatever. I don&#8217;t care. My promise is that I&#8217;m not going to get angry with you. You&#8217;re going to get nothing from me but love and compassion as we talk through very difficult things,&#8221; because that&#8217;s the way my Savior moves. That drives so much of what I do and how I think about the things that I think about.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
I&#8217;m glad that I&#8217;m able to reflect the goodness of God, reflect the grace of Christ in what I do. And hopefully, people see that. Hopefully, people perceive that. And hopefully, people are curious about what drives me to do the things that I do with the level of excellence that I try to pour into those things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are you excited about at the moment?</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m very excited about the work that I&#8217;m doing with my client, Karat, as the newly signed technical advisor, senior advisor, with the Brilliant Black Minds program. I love the Brilliant Black Minds program because what they&#8217;re attempting to do is provide free interview practice to HBCU students. If you know anything about interview prep in these days and times, it can be very expensive. There are some companies and organizations out there that are just charging obscene amounts of money to provide candidates&#8230; to kind of prey on the hopes and dreams of candidates who are looking to crack FAANG companies.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
But Karat wants to provide free interviews to Black HBCU students and to help them level up in their careers. And I love that because I remember how difficult it was for me to connect to good and reliable resources, and I think this is such a wonderful opportunity for our students to finally get feedback and support that they may have been lacking before. And so, I&#8217;m really excited about that program. I&#8217;m really excited to see it grow and expand.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
I think that this is one of those things that if we get this right, it will really take off and be a substantive force in the industry. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m excited about, and I&#8217;m really excited to continue to partner with them to grow and expand the impact of that program so that, though we may be focused on supporting Black engineers today, that this is something that will be opened up for everybody in the near future. Yeah. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m looking forward to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at your career and you even look now to where you&#8217;re at with your firm and with your family and everything, what does success look like for you now?</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
For me, the measure of success has remained constant. It&#8217;s how well do I reflect Christ in my life, is really what it comes down to. And I think that being able to continue to support for my family and take care of their needs while also providing transformative impact on the industry in which I&#8217;ve grown up and become accustomed and have grown in, that&#8217;s key for me. And so, I want to continue to amplify and multiply the impact that I&#8217;ve had in tech to help more people get in and succeed.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
My hope is that, by doing that, I can leave a good example and legacy for the generation that&#8217;s following after me, because I&#8217;m not just an observer of Black history. I&#8217;m a participant in it. And I&#8217;m continuing that legacy so that future generations will benefit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want the next chapter in the Anthony D. Mays story to look like?</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s a really tough question. That&#8217;s been on my to-do list to answer that one. I haven&#8217;t quite gotten around to it in the two months that I&#8217;ve been a full-time entrepreneur. But I think just real quickly, I hope that in five years, I&#8217;ll be reading a news article about how my efforts has transformationally changed the tech interviewing landscape, that I want to be able to, in five years, read that article, that I want it to be said that, through the work that I did, I was able to help this industry almost leapfrog in terms of how we deal with and grow and develop underrepresented talent in the business. So that hopefully will be my contribution, but we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work, about your firm? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. So I&#8217;ll make it easy for all of your listeners. Anthony D. Mays, D as in diversity. Anthony D. Mays, M-A-Y-S, on all the things, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn. Feel free to connect with me. I&#8217;m also at anthonydmays.com and that&#8217;s a great place to find articles that I&#8217;ve written about tech interviewing, working in tech, being underrepresented.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
If you want to book me for speaking, I&#8217;m also there. Yeah. You can also connect with Morgan Latimer Consulting right through that page. So it&#8217;s all there. Just visit anthonydmays.com and connect with me. I&#8217;d love to chat with you and figure out how I might be able to help you in your journey and your career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Anthony D. Mays, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I mean, I had a sense, from doing my research, how the interview would go in terms of your story and what you&#8217;ve put out there. But I guess I didn&#8217;t realize how similar in a way we were in terms of how we got into technology, growing up in, like I said, these dubious towns and things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hope that people will listen to this interview and not only, I think, seek out your services, but see just where and how far passion can take you. It was very clear to me from listening to your story that you have this passion for technology that would not quit, and to the point where it not only got you to working at one of the top tech companies in the world, but that it also, in a way, started a journey of self-introspection to get you to where you are today to be just a stronger and better person. So thank you so much for coming on the show, man. I really appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Anthony D. Mays:</b><br>
Well, thank you so much, Maurice. This has been quite a pleasure.</p>

<p>It takes a lot of hard work and determination to be a successful entrepreneur, and sometimes, you can lose yourself in your path to success. But not Monique Jenkins! As the CEO of <a href="https://jkinscreative.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">J.kins Creative</a>, Monique bolsters the successes of Black and brown entrepreneurs by creating holistic brand identities with thought leaders who deserve to leave their mark upon the world. And she does it be being the best person for the job &#8212; herself! </p>
<p>Monique talked to me about what she started her own company, and talked about the varied processes she has to ensure clients receive top-class design work. She also spoke about growing up in Baltimore, how she juggles her studio with a full-time job (and a baby on the way!), and gave some insight on the type of legacy she wants to leave in the world. According to Monique, being an authentic version of yourself is a guarantee for living your best life!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
My name is Monique Jenkins and I am the CEO of a design agency called J.kins Creative, also a mentor and teacher at Towson University. And I run a non-for-profit called Ladies, Wine and Design Baltimore, which focuses on creating spaces for women and non-binary creatives and industry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. How has this year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
So far so good. Actually, it feels like we&#8217;ve lived the whole year in this first quarter going into the second quarter. I&#8217;m ready for 2023 already. The year didn&#8217;t start the greatest because I caught COVID in Jamaica. That&#8217;s when we initially talked, but it&#8217;s been getting better since then.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything in particular that you want to sort of accomplish this year?</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
I think my ideas of what was going to happen this year have kind of pivoted. I have since found out that I&#8217;m going to be a mama, so that&#8217;s-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s going to be my major 2022 thing as far as personal life is concerned. But in my business, one of the things that I want to get better at doing is managing life and work. I am constantly doing speaking engagements and mentoring and doing all these other things. And the tone of this year for me was really putting down some of the extracurricular activities that I was doing and really honing in on my business. Because I would like within the next two to three years to kind of take that into a more full-time stance. So that&#8217;s really my focus for the year is gaining clients, understanding marketing better, understanding kind of the ebbs and flows of a couple of different things within my business and really honing on the type of clients I want to work with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s talk about your design studio, J.kins Creative. What was the impetus for you to start your own studio?</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
I have worked for a wide range of companies from smaller kind of startup companies and to larger fortune 500 companies. And I think in all of those respective statuses, it kind of taught me that people who look like us weren&#8217;t always represented regardless of which of those organizations I was working in. But then more specifically I had read so many articles about black women in particular starting their own businesses. And I was like, oh, I see all these wonderful women starting these great things, but I don&#8217;t see that the marketing and the branding is there for those companies. Or we don&#8217;t get to that point until we have probably launched this business two or three years down the line. And it&#8217;s important to me to help foster the information that I&#8217;ve learned in these respective environments in order to grow, to help people grow and sustain their business and figure out what their respective visions are and how that translates into a larger and more holistic idea of who their business is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Walk me through just like a typical day. How do you sort of start out the day with J.kins Creative?</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
In a typical day, I am probably using the morning to reach out to existing clients. So if there&#8217;s something that I was supposed to finish up the previous day, I usually email them early and send over files for them to review or ask questions about things that seem a little sketchy or that we can&#8217;t exactly pinpoint right this second. As I&#8217;m moving throughout the day, I&#8217;m continuing to maintain those emails or phone calls from clients. Having kickoff meetings with potential new clients who are going to becoming on board. Asking them questions about what type of metrics and goals they want to hit for this project. Because generally when people start a design project, I like for them to start it from the process of like, what do you want to achieve by this? Design is pretty, but it&#8217;s also supposed to be functional in some capacity. So trying to understand their motivations for their business and get a little attune with what they&#8217;re doing is important to me.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
And then after initial kickoff calls, we generally send out contracts and then we walk through those with our clients. If we&#8217;ve already done a kickoff call and we&#8217;ve already sent contracts before we kind of walk through that. And then the latter half of the day is used for actually getting work done. So designing respective assets for those clients and really just trying to putting those to the grind. And then usually by the end of the day, I connect with our front end developer who we&#8217;re just walking through what she&#8217;s done for the day and checking over websites and assets and things like that before we give those to our client.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it sounds like you&#8217;ve kind of got the day pretty well structured out.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
Yeah. Some days are easier than others. I mean, in design, nothing is certain. Some days it&#8217;s more client calls and that&#8217;s going to be the base of my day. Some days I don&#8217;t have any client calls and I can really dig in to the design work. Some days it&#8217;s more about trying to gain a better relationship with the engineer and dig into the code and understand why something isn&#8217;t working or interaction patterns aren&#8217;t working the way that we need them to. So, every day is a little bit different but every day is fun in some respects.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What are the best types of clients for you to work with?</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
I would say clients who are a little bit more established in their business are better to work with because they kind of know that you&#8217;re the expert in the situation. I would say that any client that I have probably worked with who spent under 5,000 is someone who&#8217;s much more hands on. I think when you get to a specific level, you understand what your skillset is and you trust professionals to kind of do their work. So I love working with clients who are super enthusiastic about their business. I love working with people who have a strong vision for what they want and have metrics and goals that align to those visions. If someone comes to me and they aren&#8217;t sure about their budget, or they&#8217;re not sure about how this business is going to track or it&#8217;s relatively new, like everything is new. So they&#8217;re not really sure how this is all going to come together. People who have a sound idea of what their business is and what they&#8217;re trying to accomplish are incredibly fun to work with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember back from when I had my studio, it was always the cheapest clients that were the worst one to work with just in terms of, they&#8217;re always on your back, they&#8217;re always asking about something. That&#8217;s not to say, well, maybe there is a correlation between low budget jobs and the amount of client and action that you get. But even as you said, with the higher price or the high ticket clients, sometimes they like to be hands on, maybe just in a different sort of way. But the interaction is different because like you said, they trust you as the expert. I&#8217;ve often found that if the client is trying to nickel and dime you, they don&#8217;t trust that you know what you&#8217;re doing. They don&#8217;t trust why it costs what it costs, et cetera. And with a more established business, they&#8217;ve hopefully already done this before and they know what the value is.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
Yeah. The way that my business coach likes to explain it to me when she&#8217;s like, this is how you want to set up your price points. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;If you are going to do the work, then you&#8217;re going to charge a relatively okay price point.&#8221; So say a project is going to be $50,000. If they&#8217;re going to co-designed with you, that costs more money because it takes you more time. You&#8217;re doing more iterations. If they want to do a majority of the work, then you charge them the most amount of money because what you&#8217;re doing is acting as a production artist and that&#8217;s not a favorable place to be.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
So I always tell client like, &#8220;We can have as many conversations as you want. I build into my contracts now that like three iterations and then we start to charge you after that.&#8221; It&#8217;s just about trying to understand where a person is in their business and what they believe about their business. And I find that people who have a little bit of a lower budget, not that they can&#8217;t be fun to work with. It&#8217;s just that they&#8217;re just a little bit more nitpicky. And I will say, I agree. Clients who have a higher budget are nitpicky, but it&#8217;s just in a different way. And I think that they trust you a little bit more. They probably have experiences working with other agencies and they know that you can bear fruit for them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s true. So when a company or an individual contacts you about a new project, like talk to me about that. What does that process look like in terms of onboarding, working with them throughout the project? Walk me through something like that.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
Generally, what I ask people to do is to go to my website and fill out the new project form. It tells me some basic information about them, about like their name, address, or not address, email phone number, gives me a website URL if they have one existing, what type of project that says what the budget they have in mind is and what their deadline is. And then after I have that initial project form, I send them a project brief and that gets more into the specifics about metrics. So what exactly are you trying to accomplish? What are you trying to do? What are your intentions? It just starts to, and I make our clients make smart goals. It just makes sure that they understand what the accomplishment is of this thing. We are not building designs because they&#8217;re pretty, we are building something that&#8217;s going to be functional for you.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
So what&#8217;s the task that you want to do. Do you want more engagement on your site? Do you want more unique visitors? Do you want to promote a specific campaign or book or something? When I find that I make people start to think about why people are actually coming into their site we can help to define what should be the main CTA versus what are secondary actions that you want someone to commit. And once we go through that project brief and kind of distill that information down together, I tell them a bit more about myself, my background, help to bring in some of those validation points that clients want to know about you. I learn more about them. Hearing someone else&#8217;s story is crazy, interesting. Understanding why they started their business or what they&#8217;re trying to accomplish is super fun.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
And then after we have that call, I send them over a contract, an invoice listed out with all of the things that they&#8217;re telling me they want to accomplish in the timeline that they&#8217;re saying they want to accomplish these things. So then we run through all of that information together. They understand what&#8217;s a part of the project. What&#8217;s not a part of the project. If we break timeline or add additional assets, what the price point is for those things. And then once they sign the contract, submit the deposit, we go off to the races.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
So initial phone call, just like a kickoff call with the client. Give me whatever existing assets you have. Let&#8217;s talk about creative concepts. Let&#8217;s get all of those things nailed down and then we start getting the work on our end. I also might ask them depending on how clear they are with visual assets to create a Pinterest board of some websites that they love, that they want to incorporate into their own respective business as they see as a potential path to visually or stylistically how they want their website or assets to look. And then we use that as a starting post.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And just to be clear earlier, when you said smart goals, you mean the acronym SMART like specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, time-bound.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Got you. Okay. Just wanted to be clear about that. I know that when people probably heard that they&#8217;re thinking, yeah, I want my goals to be smart. But that it&#8217;s more than just that. It&#8217;s like a framework that you have to follow.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
Yes. So specific might be like what needs to be accomplished? Who is responsible for it? What steps or actions need to be taken? Measurable kind of self explanatory, what is this going to accomplish? What are the numbers around it? Specific, like 15% of people that&#8217;s what I want to drive toward this specific thing. Achievable is like, it&#8217;s a reality check. Is this achievable in the timeline that you&#8217;re providing? Relevant is like, how does this compare in the bigger picture of things? And then time-bound is like, this is how much time that we have to actually complete these things. So whenever we create smart goals, I just think that it helps people to really hone in on what they&#8217;re asking me to do and to be incredibly realistic about what&#8217;s going to happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Got you. So let&#8217;s kind of switch gears here a little bit, so people can kind of learn more about the dynamic woman behind J.kins Creative. Tell me more about you. Tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
I am from Bridgeport, Connecticut originally. I moved to Maryland when I was 15. That sounds right. Yes. I couldn&#8217;t remember because I had just gotten into high school and my parents were like, &#8220;Come on girl, we&#8217;re moving to another state.&#8221; But originally from Connecticut. I went to a predominantly Hispanic speaking school for almost the entirety of my adolescences. And then when I came to Maryland, that was the first time I think I went to an all African American school. I had seen that many African American people in one place that&#8217;s different in Connecticut than it is here. So yeah, I will say when I was little in Connecticut, I had no idea I wanted to be a designer. I did not figure that out until I got well into college. So I always thought that I was going to be a lawyer because I&#8217;m so good at arguing with other people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about college. You mentioned that really knowing about kind of wanted to study design until you got there. You went to the Towson University and you still studied communications. Tell me about that experience.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
Yeah. I had multiple majors and minors when I was at Towson University. I really did not&#8230; I had known for almost the majority of my life I was like a lawyer. I&#8217;m so competitive. I love arguing. I love to bring up points. I like to fact check those points. This is going to be it. And then when I got to college, I was like, well lawyers have&#8230; It&#8217;s a long time. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s exactly the right path. I don&#8217;t know if I want to stay here that long. And I had really liked marketing too. This was at the time that Facebook was coming out so you were able to create your own visual graphics. And there was a lot of coding and stuff involved and different applications and social media applications that were coming out.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
The computer was really big and I just assumed marketing and advertising was the way that I wanted to go. And I really did love marketing and advertising, but I think I love the visual components more than I liked all of the numbers behind it. So while I was in the middle of getting my communications degree, I was like, this is cool. I like this. I think I could do this forever, but I think I would like to take a more visual approach to marketing and advertising. I don&#8217;t know if I want to be in that world specifically, but I think that I want to be on the edge of it or work with those type of people. So I got my undergrad in Mass Communications with a concentration in advertisement, in marketing. And then I swapped over to the university of Baltimore a couple years later and got a degree in Graphic Design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now I want to kind of talk about that, because there&#8217;s a little bit of time that sort of happened between you leaving Towson University and then going to University of Baltimore. What was your early career after Towson? What was going on during that time?</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t remember exactly how this happened, but when I was at Towson, I got an opportunity to become an insurance agent. So I got my property and casualty license and I was working for Liberty Mutual as an intern, reaching out to customers who had inquired about auto insurance policies. And I hated it. I really didn&#8217;t, it wasn&#8217;t my thing. I did not like calling people and trying to force them into something that they didn&#8217;t want. I just liked cold calling people and being like, &#8220;Hey, have you thought about your auto insurance?&#8221; And people be like, &#8220;I&#8217;m at work girl. I don&#8217;t have time to talk to you about this.&#8221; So it really wasn&#8217;t my thing. But I worked for the insurance company and there were aspects of it that I loved.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
But it was a really great experience because all of the agents who worked in our office wildly had what I would consider incredible degrees. One of them was a microbiologist, the other one had gotten a law degree, but ultimately they all decided, I want to do that and had gotten into insurance for one purpose or another. They liked the flexibility of the schedule and they had other outside ventures. So the microbiologist was also a real estate agent. We had a bunch of properties and that had me thinking like, I don&#8217;t want to waste this degree that I just got. Going into a field, that&#8217;s completely irrelevant. Let me figure this out. So after I kind of did insurance for a little bit, I transitioned over to finding a position that actually utilized my degree, which is, I was a publisher intern at AOL for about a year and a half or two years where I got to work with sales professionals, which was familiar because of the experience I had at Liberty Mutual and focused on advertising campaigns and online banners.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
And it was my responsibility to put all of our bull websites for our advertisers into tiers. So different tiers of websites get different type of ads. So if you are&#8230; What&#8217;s a website that would be a D-tier. Any type of a TMZ, they&#8217;re probably a perfect example. TMZ would be a tier-D website. So you probably wouldn&#8217;t put Disney ads on that type of site. And then Disney is a tier A website. You probably could put a majority of the ads that you want to run on a type of site like that. So it was my responsibility to classify all of our new clients into respective tiers and then give them off to their marketing agents so that they could work more specifically with them. That was fun and I liked the coworkers. But again, I was just like, I like the looking at the websites. I like dissecting the websites. I like looking at the banner campaigns. I&#8217;ve been starting to develop a relationship with the designers who worked there.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
So I was like, I missed something. I didn&#8217;t get what I needed to get in college and I need to go back to get the thing that I actually want. I think I had found out about the University of Baltimore&#8217;s program at the time and I was like, okay, I&#8217;m going to go back. I&#8217;m going to go back and get a Master&#8217;s degree in Design because I really like that. And I feel like that&#8217;s where my soul was telling me that I want to be. And again, I&#8217;ve been designing flyers and stuff for the church that I went to and birthday cards for friends and baby announcements and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
And I was like, I think this is it. I just need a more formal education. I am certainly one of those people who&#8217;s like, I can&#8217;t watch YouTube videos to get it. I&#8217;m not that person. I need the structure of a classroom and a teacher being like, you have homework in order to pick up these concepts. And the weight is heavier for me. When I paid $5,000 to take a class, I&#8217;m like, girl, you going to class and you going to read this book and [inaudible 00:21:01] this stuff. When it&#8217;s a free video on YouTube, I&#8217;m like, I could watch five minutes of this and then I could go watch TV for three hours and then. So I needed the structure of that environment and the University of Baltimore at the time felt like the best fit for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting when you know that you&#8217;re paying for it, that you&#8217;ll sort of put more value in it because you&#8217;ve got skin in the game, essentially in that way.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
That is exactly what I needed. I needed skin in the game in order to be like, okay, you have to take this seriously because college is not cheap. You spend a lot of money on this class and you will not be taking this class again because there were other people who were&#8230; It&#8217;s whatever. I don&#8217;t care if I have to take this again. I&#8217;m like I spend $5,000 on this class, so I&#8217;m not going to be taking it again. I got to pay another $5,000 for another class. You think I can take this class twice, no. I have to keep going. So once I had a little bit of skin in the game, then I was like, okay, Monique, you can sit down and you can focus so you can concentrate under this environment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think you also touched on something interesting there that you kind of had to get out there in the working world a little bit and discover through that, something that you didn&#8217;t want to do to bring you closer to the thing that you wanted to do.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
Yeah. I don&#8217;t think that&#8230; I think that sometimes we&#8217;re sold this idea that after college it&#8217;s a clear path to working in the industry, but it&#8217;s hard. At Towson University hadn&#8217;t done any internships that were specific to my field and I think that should be a requirement for college. If you were spending all this time and money on a degree, you should at least have to take two or three internships specifically in the field that you want to work in. Because it&#8217;ll help you to be like, you know what? This is not truly what I wanted, once I got into the environment. But once I started working at AOL, I was like, this is fun, this is wonderful. It&#8217;s a great company. There are great coworkers. There are fun things in the office like skateboards and there are free snacks, but I&#8217;m like, something is still missing. I&#8217;m still not getting exactly what I need. So I need to think about this and change paths a little bit. So that&#8217;s what worked for me at least.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now what were those kind of early days of Jenkins creatives like for you because you&#8217;re running your studio, but you were also working full time at a few companies, right?</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
Yeah. I remember feeling like I don&#8217;t even know what, I don&#8217;t even know. I didn&#8217;t even know the right questions to ask. I didn&#8217;t know the right people to talk to. I&#8217;m much more into networking now and facilitating relationships with other people. But at the time I was very much an introvert and I was like, I don&#8217;t want to talk to nobody. I don&#8217;t want nobody to talk to me. I just want to figure this out on my own. And I think that&#8217;s a very hard stance to have. So it was lonely and I wasn&#8217;t exactly sure what I should be doing. I was taking maybe some classes on how to run a business. But I never really felt like any of the curriculum that I was participating in, gave me a full grasp of what was necessary in order to run a business and time gave me that. It let me know what worked and what didn&#8217;t work, where I should invest my resources, where I shouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
But also in addition to time, physically meeting people out in the world and understanding how they ran their businesses and understanding what worked or didn&#8217;t work for them or avenues that I could potentially go down our path, that was what was most helpful for me. Because I feel like all of the people that I worked with since the time of Liberty Mutual had some type of outside or source of revenue or income and had always put it in my head that, you can&#8217;t just have a nine to five, you got to be able to do something else beyond that. What happens if you get fired tomorrow? Can you still pay your bills? Where are your additional revenue streams? And that really stuck with me about being like, okay, you work for a company who sometimes has to make a hard decision and they&#8217;re not going to say, Monique has to pay her grant. So we shouldn&#8217;t let her go. They&#8217;re going to make the decision that&#8217;s best for their organization and you have to have something to fall back on. You can&#8217;t just be out there with nothing to do. And that started to help me be like, okay, I need to figure out how this businesses run.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
So in the beginning it was a mess. I&#8217;m not going to lie. There was no website, there was nothing. It was just me randomly reaching out to people or meeting people. I have 17 different business cards. I would be redesigning those things on the weekly basis. I&#8217;d be like, this isn&#8217;t good enough. No one&#8217;s[inaudible 00:25:32]. Aside from me like this and all of that stuff it just didn&#8217;t work in the way that I thought it was supposed to work. So it was a little bit of ebb and flow. Some things were useful and helpful for me, some things not so much. But just understanding how larger organizations worked, helped me to hone in on how I wanted to run my business and what was acceptable and not acceptable for the type of clients I work with or the type of environment I wanted to work in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I feel like with studios like that, especially when you&#8217;re just starting it off by yourself, you really have to try to&#8230; You&#8217;re kind of doing a lot of trial and error to figure things out on your own. And for you, it was good that you also had a full-time job kind of to back things up while you were figuring out the ins and outs of the studio. So that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
Yeah. A funny story is that I made an Instagram called Trial and Error where I would&#8230; I was testing out different design methodology and things like that. And it was a way to hold myself accountable and be like, you should be designing something, you should be building your skillset. And I think I did that for a couple months and then I was like, Monique, this is so much work. But it was really just a place where I could be like, if I put my designs out there in the world, people will see them. They&#8217;ll be interested and they&#8217;ll potentially come to you as clients. That did not happen. I don&#8217;t think I got one client from that venture, but it helped me to be like, okay, how do you build your skillset to get you to a place where you can make all of these very beautiful and extravagant thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at your work years, prior to starting your studio, what lessons do you take from that time?</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
I think the biggest lesson that I probably could take from that is that people are so kind in so many ways&#8230; When I look back at my career, I think about all of the awesome women specifically, black women and more specifically, who just had my back. Who just took me aside and gave me knowledge and information that I just did not have and could not fathom in a lot of different respects. And even when I was going to make very wild errors or I was acting emotional in the things that I was going to be doing, black women saved me every single time. They helped me to steer my direction and navigate and make better decisions because I was working at a check burning company and I dislike these I was like, this is ridiculous. I don&#8217;t want to do this. And I wrote what is the nastiest probably resignation letter that anybody has ever read. This is stupid. Y&#8217;all are stupid. It just wasn&#8217;t kind.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
I was friends with the HR, director and she was like, show me your resignation letter. And we looked at it together and she ripped it up right in front of me. She was like, &#8220;You will not be giving this to anybody.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;What?&#8221; She was like, &#8220;When you work for a company, you don&#8217;t want to burn bridges. These people that you think are not confident or don&#8217;t know how to do their jobs, you will face these people again in other environments. So you don&#8217;t do that. You don&#8217;t burn bridges in that way. You can respectfully say that you did not have a good time here or you can keep your mouth shut. And you could say this was a great learning experience, which it was, it taught you that you did not want to work with these type of people and you take that on.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
And 10 years later I got an opportunity to work with one of the same people that I worked with in that organization, loved her. She was great. Once we worked one on one, but working as the low person on the totem pole in that context, when I was really young, I was like, these people are&#8230; I don&#8217;t like this. This ain&#8217;t going to work for me. But her pulling me aside and having that conversation about not burning bridges was incredibly a shaping moment. And every single organization that I have worked out since I have been able to find that person who is more knowledgeable than me, who can help me navigate spaces in ways that I did not think about or think about things in ways that I just don&#8217;t inherently have in me.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
So those people incredibly wonderful. They help shape me. And then I guess the other thing that I&#8217;ve taken away from a lot of the organizations is the structure that I like and don&#8217;t like working in, is super important. So, some of the bigger companies that I worked for I really felt like a number. I was like, these people don&#8217;t know me. They don&#8217;t really know anything about me. And I started to find my sweet spot and being like, I don&#8217;t know if I want to work for a fortune 500 company. Maybe I want to work for smaller companies or a mid-tier company where there feels to be a little bit more of a, and I use this loosely, family structure around who you are with. Because I always think it&#8217;s a red flag when someone&#8217;s like, &#8220;We&#8217;re family.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No we not, we&#8217;re coworkers y&#8217;all.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Same. A 100% same.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
I&#8217;m like, we&#8217;re not we just like each other outside of work. That&#8217;s different. I have to stick with my family forever sometimes. But it really helped me to figure out like, I don&#8217;t like being one of 75 designers on a team. I want to be in a smaller team where I actually get to know these people and understand their perspectives or know the other team members that I&#8217;m working with outside of the core team. And well I have never go back to working with a fortune 500 company. It depends on the salary offer. But for, right this second, like I think the sweet spot is really a smaller company where you get to know actual people and then they get to, they open up and they share things with you that I don&#8217;t think they necessarily share in a larger structure with more people working at an organization. I find that people more reserved in that setting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ve worked in startups for the past, I&#8217;d say roughly the past five years. And I don&#8217;t know if anyone from my current job is listening to this so I won&#8217;t say what I feel about startups. But I think it&#8217;s important, like you say, to have those different work experiences to know what you like, what you don&#8217;t like, because once you start getting out there and I&#8217;d say, this is probably the case, even for starting your own studio and finding clients and stuff.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
At the beginning, you&#8217;ll kind of just take any work. Any work that&#8217;s coming in the door, as long as it&#8217;s paying, but then eventually you learn what are the best types of clients for you to work with? What are the best kind of jobs? What&#8217;s the client match for that will allow you to do your best work? That takes trial and error.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
Exactly. I always tell people that I&#8217;m mentoring specifically, because I&#8217;m been mentoring with Thinkful for new UX and UI designers that are coming out of their program. And I always tell them, &#8220;It depends on what you want to gain. So, if you&#8217;re going to work for a startup, generally, you&#8217;re the only designer there. You&#8217;re going to do everything. You are going to have to do research on your own time. You&#8217;re going to be digging into a bunch of different worlds. You&#8217;re going to be learning a bunch of different things.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
If you are like, I want the guardrails of working with other people in a structured environment that has a design system that is already established work for a bigger company, get that under your feet. You&#8217;re never going to put a million dollar campaign or something out the door without any oversight. There will be guardrails there to help to protect you. And then once you understand what the structure is like, then you can transition to a mid-year company or to a startup and feel more confident. But originally coming out of college, it was probably helpful to me to work in an environment that had very rivet you know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
Yeah, so, because there was a design guide and I could look at that for reference when I building something and feel more confident about the thing that I was going to produce or that I was showing and at a manager. I could go to that person and be like, &#8220;Hey, what do you think about this?&#8221; The first startup that I worked at, there was no design director. I was the only person. I was on the marketing team and they are wonderful, but they&#8217;re not designers. So they couldn&#8217;t really give me feedback. They were more so telling me, I like this or I don&#8217;t like this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
But that&#8217;s not logical. They&#8217;re telling me what their preferences are, not who our core customer is and how this design can relate to them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well said a 100%. Are there certain types of projects that you want to do in the future?</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
Yes. Recently in my business have been picking up a lot of clients in the solar energy space, which is super interesting. So I like that client. I like helping, or I like thinking that my work is going to help in a bigger way or have a bigger impact than outside of a redesign. This is for someone actually coming to gain knowledge. And I also think it&#8217;s a environment that I don&#8217;t think as a black person that I read enough about or know enough about, like be informational. So I like the solar energy clients. I like startups specifically. I want to help craft and create brands from the beginning and help them to discover who they are and create an entire branded existence for an organization. That seems like a super fun and challenging thing for me. I like the challenges is what it is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of challenges, in a way you&#8217;ve kind of come full circle. You mentioned attending Towson University several years ago. Now you&#8217;re a teacher at Towson University. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
That actually happened because when I was at the University of Baltimore, I graduated with a master&#8217;s degree and I went back to college, again, for a third time to get a certificate in User Experience and Interaction Design. And I got that and I was like, you know what, as I think back across the entirety of my experience in college, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever had a black professor. I was like, I don&#8217;t remember that ever being a part of my college curriculum. And I talked to a couple friends too, and I was like, &#8220;Have you ever had a black professor? I&#8217;ve never. Have you?&#8221; And they were like, &#8220;Now that I think about it, I don&#8217;t think I had.&#8221; After I went to college for the third time, I was considering going back again to get a doctorate. And I can&#8217;t remember what podcast I was listening to, but I was listening to a podcast and they were talking about validation as a black woman in spaces.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
And I had reached out to the University of Baltimore and I had talked to the recruiting counselor there and she reached back out and she was like, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re having open house or something and I want to make sure you can make it.&#8221; And I just got real honest with her in a way that I don&#8217;t think that I am with some people sometimes. I think I&#8217;m better at it now, but at the time I really wasn&#8217;t. And I sent her an email that said like, &#8220;In all honesty, as a black woman, I think I&#8217;ve used my education as validation that my opinion belongs in the room and it validates that I&#8217;m worth listening to, to those people. And I&#8217;m trying to redevelop how I see myself and how other people should see me in the spaces that I&#8217;m in. I don&#8217;t think I need the validation of another degree in order to get that. So I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to go on and get my doctorate right now. I think I&#8217;m just going to focus on me.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
And this was at the time that I was just starting with Ladies, Wine &#038; Design, Baltimore. I had just off boarded from AIGA, Baltimore. And I was just like, I don&#8217;t want to do that. But I also was like, I don&#8217;t want another person to go through their college experience and not have a minority be a part of that. Not have a person who looks like me or not see another woman who looks like me go through their education experience and not experience that with some of the joy that it is to have a professor who is African American in our space. So I want to teach. I want to show people that it&#8217;s possible. I want people to see me and be like, &#8220;Oh, I can do that one day.&#8221; And understand the path of what it takes to get there. And that&#8217;s how I started teaching. Is that I thought about my own college curriculum and what would&#8217;ve made that situation better for me and I was like, I&#8217;m going to go and teach.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do your students teach you?</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
So much. All the new latest TikTok trends. I&#8217;ll tell you that. I cannot get away. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Y&#8217;all, I don&#8217;t get it. I&#8217;m a mom now. I don&#8217;t understand how you&#8217;re supposed to use this thing.&#8221; I think what they teach me is that failure is okay. I took college incredibly seriously. When we were talking earlier, college was very much a job. I came from a family who financially could not afford for me to go to college. I took out a lot of student loans to get this degree. So college was always very heavy for me. And it was always like, you need to be doing your best self and you need to be doing your best self because your family is counting on you. You don&#8217;t have the option of being lazy. You don&#8217;t have the option of not doing your best. You have to put everything in this because it&#8217;s a lot of money to waste.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
So when I see them and they&#8217;re interacting with me and they&#8217;re interacting with the work that I&#8217;m giving them, it&#8217;s okay for me to be able to tell them like, &#8220;Hey, this is not make or break. This is okay If you&#8217;re not going to do your best on this one project or that you&#8217;re having a hard in life, sympathizing.&#8221; And I think they helped to bring back some of that humanity to me in some respects where I&#8217;m like, it&#8217;s okay to be like, I don&#8217;t get this or this isn&#8217;t exactly where I know I want to be. Or I don&#8217;t really understand these things that are concepts that you&#8217;re explaining. They just help to ground me in a way that I don&#8217;t think that I was ever grounded when I was in college. They give me a little bit of&#8230; And they&#8217;re super honest too when they don&#8217;t like stuff.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
They provide a little bit of lightness to the world and they see things in a&#8230; They&#8217;re growing up in such a different time than what I think I grew up in, which is weird because I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m that old, but apparently I&#8217;m getting there. They have such a different perspective on life. I always say, &#8220;You guys are considering and are interacting with concepts and things that I don&#8217;t think I ever thought of in the entirety of the time that I was in college. And you&#8217;re introduced to things in such a early way that I don&#8217;t think that I ever explored when I was your age.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
So they helped to shape a large part of my world. Also, they helped me to realize what&#8217;s important and what&#8217;s not important in some respects. They give me lots of love and lightness and sometimes drive me crazy. I try to not be the Monique who&#8217;s a production person who&#8217;s just working all the time, but I&#8217;m also like, you don&#8217;t have time to be messing up. You&#8217;re in college. So they help to ground me in a way that I don&#8217;t think that I was at their age.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you had any peers or mentors that have kind of helped you out along your design journey? I feel like you alluded to one of them earlier. But I&#8217;m curious, who&#8217;s helped you to get to where you are today?</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
As I said, so many women whose names that I will not remember, probably have no idea that they had such an influence on me. More recently though, for Ladies, Wine and Design, my co-host or co-partner in that venture is Davia Lilly. And she has helped me to work smarter and not harder and to explore concepts that I just have never explored in design. She is a huge part of helping me to be the best Monique that I can be. I also recently hired two different business coaches, who I&#8217;ve worked with recently, Jessica Langley and Michelle Gomez, who both have been incredibly influential in helping me realize my potential and all of the amazing things that I can do. Dan Brown, who&#8217;s an information architect and principal designer at his company called EightShapes, who has a user experience consultancy has been incredibly helpful. They all have been helpful in so many different ways in helping me to shape who I am, where I&#8217;m going, how I want to run my business or how I don&#8217;t. Yeah. They are amazing people, every single one of them and teach me amazing things every day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is this how you kind of imagined your life would look like when you were a kid?</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
Absolutely not. It is not. I was one of those kids who journaled. So I have a journal with all of the stuff that I wanted to accomplish. I remember being when I turn 18 and go to college, I want to go to NYU and I want to live in New York. And I was just imagining a Sex in the City lifestyle where everything was fabulous or moving out to LA. And I never wanted to be an actor or an actress. That is not my God-given gift. But being in those environments with those type of people. And I think I&#8217;ve accomplished all of the things that young Monique thought that she was going to accomplish. I purchased a house. I finally got my puppy. I&#8217;m about to start a family with my husband. And I just didn&#8217;t think it was going to happen in this way. And I&#8217;m still working towards the dream of being in New York or Los Angeles.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if those are dreams anymore because I&#8217;ve been to LA and I was like, &#8220;This is congested y&#8217;all.&#8221; I&#8217;ve been to New York and also been like, &#8220;This is all right, but I don&#8217;t know about this for a full-time basis.&#8221; I could get a summer home there or something. But it all worked out the way that I wanted it to. When I was young, I thought more materialistic. I wanted things. Now that I&#8217;m older, I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m happy with my life. I&#8217;m happy with my spouse, with my family, with the interactions that we have with each other. I&#8217;m happy that I can pick up the phone right now and call my mama and be like, &#8220;Hey girl, we just got a contract for a $100,000,&#8221; and have her pray for me and love on me and have such good spirits. That&#8217;s the more important thing.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
I think when I was younger, I was like, I&#8217;m going to move away from my family. I&#8217;m never going to talk to them. What do I need to talk to them for? But as I&#8217;ve gotten older, I&#8217;ve appreciated where I am now and appreciate all the things that I want to do. And every single time a major life event happens, I go back to my diary from 12 years old and I&#8217;d be like, let me add something to this because I wasn&#8217;t fully thinking about these things. But by and large, I&#8217;ve gotten to check off a lot of the things that I thought that I was going to do when I was younger. And that is good for my soul because I&#8217;m like, at least you weren&#8217;t dreaming. At least you can reference back to the dreams you had. You can check these things off, you were able to accomplish them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s been one of the great things for me about sort of getting older and then being able to kind of look back at the life that you&#8217;ve worked hard to create. Looking back at what you&#8217;ve built and kind of being content with it. And that&#8217;s not to say that you&#8217;re settling for it, because I&#8217;m sure you have other goals and aspirations that you want to do. And I&#8217;ll ask you about that. But also looking and seeing where you are right now and being like, I did pretty good. That&#8217;s a blessing to get to that point.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
Pair it with some pivotal moments. I think the first $100,000 job that I got was like, oh, that&#8217;s crazy. Nobody in your family has ever even thought of making this much money. And now that I reflect on that, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Girl, you better get to two million dollar, three million dollar. You can get some more money than that.&#8221; But as a kid, that number seemed so big. That just felt like an incredible task. As an adult, I&#8217;m like, well girl, a bread be costing like five dollars. But as a child, it&#8217;s weird to get to this point. And it&#8217;s weird for your family members.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
I will say by and large out of my siblings and my cousins and all that stuff, my mom was like,&#8221; Monique&#8217;s going to be the one. It&#8217;s just in her personality.&#8221; She even says, &#8220;When you were a baby, you didn&#8217;t even want nobody to hold your bottle. You was like, I could do this myself. I don&#8217;t need you for that.&#8221; And I&#8217;ve carried that theme through. She was like, &#8220;You have always been so self reliant. And so you set your own accomplishments.&#8221; She was like, &#8220;You put yourself on punishment when you were 10 years old because you got a B on a paper and you felt embarrassed&#8221; She was like, &#8220;It was so crazy. You took your TV out of your room and everything.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
And I was like, &#8220;Because I knew that I just had so much more in me and I wasn&#8217;t giving it my all.&#8221; And I feel like I do that now. I&#8217;m incredibly hard on myself, but I think that the good thing about living in the space that we are now is that I can see other black women who are like I was too. And I had to learn to balance. Being productive with sustaining a life and having a happy balance between those two. So its nice to look back and be like, all right. I know you wanted to be a lawyer who was also a doctor who was also a mechanic who was also this, but you got to this place and you are still happy. You don&#8217;t have to be productive 365 days a year. You can take some days to just chill and eat Oreos on the couch, watching Netflix and you&#8217;re okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s really something, like you said, to get to that point and realize, there&#8217;s more to life than just work. That whole thing about striking a work life balance, especially when you&#8217;re an entrepreneur is super tough. I know when I started out with my studio initially, I was working or I would tell people the joke about entrepreneurs can work half days, any 12 hours you want because I would just keep working because no one was there to stop me. There was nothing to stop me. I just keep going. And eventually you learn, if you don&#8217;t take the break, your body will take it for you.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so eventually like I learned to of not put so much of that value on to know when to take breaks and all that sort of stuff. But being able to look back on the work that you&#8217;ve done and feel satisfied and grateful, it&#8217;s such a great place to be as an entrepreneur. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want your next chapter to be?</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
I have no idea now. I was not intending to be a mom this year. So I feel like my next four or five years will be incredibly important for the development of my child. And I&#8217;m super interested in making a bunch of Instagram videos that other moms can relate to. I think that&#8217;s where my heart is right this second. Obviously, my business is incredibly important to me because I think there is a purpose behind it. The intention behind my business is personal to me because I&#8217;m one of the women who my businesses services in some respects. So I want to grow my business over the course of the next three years. I would love to get it to a place where it&#8217;s same things or has the ability to pay my mortgage for my household and all that jazz because I think it&#8217;s important. But also I don&#8217;t want to be a mom who can&#8217;t spend all the time that they can with their children. I&#8217;m sure there will become a point in that child&#8217;s life where I&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;A break is good. You going to daycare soon or something.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
But I think out of the gate, at least the first four or five years of your kid&#8217;s life, is incredibly important to me to be present and to be there for all of those little moments and to understand how&#8217;re they are growing up and what their personality is and their expression. So dually for me, it&#8217;s crafting a business that sustains itself outside of me physically having to watch over it, hiring more employees who can service the business and letting go of the reigns in some respects, because when you&#8217;re a business owner you want to be a part of everything.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
And I will say that because I said, when you have a lower budget, you want to be a part of everything. I&#8217;m the same way you all. I&#8217;m just there. And it&#8217;s okay to release the reigns to another person and trust them with some aspects of what you are building because they do have your back and they are building towards the same goals and things that you want to build towards. So building my business is equal to helping facilitate a relationship with my child and obviously a relationship with my husband. My whole purpose for my business is to help my family. It&#8217;s incredibly important for me to build a life where I can assist in whatever ways are helpful to the people and members of my family who have served me and continue to do so.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
You can go to my website, jkinscreative.com. That is also the handle for my Facebook and Instagram, is J.Kins Creative. I&#8217;m also going to be a keynote speaker on April 30th at AIGA Baltimore&#8217;s Ink &#038; Pixels event. So I&#8217;ll be talking about being prepared to get your dream job or leave your dream job depending on what you want to do. So those are the places where I&#8217;m going to be most present over the course of the next couple months.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Monique Jenkins, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I have to say, your passion for your business and your enthusiasm for the work that you do just really, really shines through. And I&#8217;m so grateful that we&#8217;re able to connect. Again, congratulations on the baby. I&#8217;m really excited to see what you do in the future. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Monique Jenkins:</b><br>
Thank you for having me. I&#8217;m also excited to see what I&#8217;m going to do in the future. In this future, I&#8217;m going to go get something to eat, because that&#8217;s the top priority on my mind right this second. But after that, I&#8217;m going to take over the world. I&#8217;m super excited to see all of my dreams realized and expectations grow over&#8230;what is this next phase of my life?</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
My name is Russell Toynes, and I am the creative director and owner at Studio Dzo. I&#8217;m also a design educator. I teach portfolio design at Austin Community College. And I am a core member of AAGD, which is African American Graphic Designers. And I&#8217;m a mentor to a lot of either previous students or folks that wish they were a student of mine.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I&#8217;m also a dad and a husband, but those things, those are all day, every day. And those are some of the best things that I do. We&#8217;ll see. We should ask them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s 2022 been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
2022 has been good. We&#8217;re actually really excited. 2021 was a banner year for us, and 2022 is exactly the same. Our books are full, and the work just keeps coming in, and we have a good team. We had a little bit of an upset in 2021 where we had some folks get, what&#8217;s that bug that they caught? The great resignation?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Some of them got some of that, you know? And so that left us in a little bit of a bind. So we had two new team members start in January, and so we&#8217;re still training them. So it&#8217;s a little challenging with that, with some new team members, but 2022 is starting out great for us.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything in particular that you really want to try to accomplish this year?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Really, we have a good processes, but I always want to get right and tight, right? So I really, really am looking at how do we streamline our business? My goal&#8230; Well, with the pandemic, we&#8217;re really&#8230; Before pandemic, we had a studio on East Sixth Street and it was great. We were there for three or four years, and we just moved into a new place. We did a $10,000 build out. We moved into a new place on South Lamar on February 17th on 2020. And then March 17th, 2020, we said everybody, &#8220;Hey, so this thing&#8217;s going on. We&#8217;re going to send you home. You&#8217;re going to work from home and we&#8217;ll check in every week or two, and we&#8217;ll figure out when we&#8217;re going to come back.&#8221; We were really naive, right? We just didn&#8217;t know. And I was scared. And we have a little blog on our website.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so, I just wrote a blog of just like a cathartic, being a small business owner during a pandemic is fucking scary. And so, I wrote this blog post just talking about like my biggest thing was just thinking about, not only do I have to keep food on my table, but I got to keep food on five other people&#8217;s tables also. And so, not knowing what that was going to look like was really scary.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But what I realized was when we were in the studio, we were really locally focused. We did some state, some things outside of Austin. Lots of things outside of Austin, but lots of things in other states, Oregon, and Pennsylvania, and Arizona, and places like that. But we were really just thinking, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re Austin, we&#8217;re Texas.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
When we went remote, all of a sudden opportunities just started just coming in different directions. And now, we really see ourselves as global. We have done work in Singapore, we have done work all over the United States. We have partners all over the world. So really, thinking about&#8230; we just wrapped up a project in Canada&#8230; just thinking about what we have done in the last year, it&#8217;s amazing that when we opened our minds up to thinking beyond our local borders, what we&#8217;ve accomplished.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so, really 2022 is just about, how do we keep this momentum? How do we move forward and continue to have a global presence?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s really good to hear. I mean, the pandemic, it&#8217;s changed business for so many people. I mean, I&#8217;ve talked to several studio owners, big and small, that have all had to really adjust because they weren&#8217;t able to come together physically in an office like they did before. I mean, for the team, was it a big shift to make that change?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Yes. So, we have team members of various ages. So we have seven team members. Seven in total. So me and my wife, and then we have five other team members. And they&#8217;re all employees of ours, but we call them team members because I don&#8217;t like the idea of people being an employee.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So they&#8217;re all in different places in life. Some have families, some are single, some have partners. And so obviously, the pandemic hit everybody. So if you&#8217;re a family person and you have a spouse at home and children, they&#8217;re all affected. And so, that changed a lot for our team member in particular who has kids. It&#8217;s just, how do you work when his escape was getting in the car, driving to the studio, spending six to eight hours there and driving back, and having that decompression time and that transitional period?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And now it&#8217;s get up, feed, clothe, put them in front of whatever Zoom classes they have, then get in front of his work Zoom and do work. And then their kids, they&#8217;re various ages. And so, that was the biggest challenge. Our big thing was, we wanted to focus on their mental health. We wanted to make sure that they had the freedom to take whatever time they needed just to process what the hell was going on. Because for all of us, we just didn&#8217;t know. It was scary.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Especially in the very beginning when we just didn&#8217;t know what it was, but people were getting sick and people were dying. As time went on, the adaptations change. It went from, &#8220;Okay, let me just figure out just how to keep people, my team healthy and somewhat productive,&#8221; to this, &#8220;Okay, we can&#8217;t talk about going back. We got to talk about moving forward.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so, it was like, &#8220;What do you need to be effective? What do you need to be efficient?&#8221; So, the team came back to the studio, we gave them their desk, their sit-stand desk. Then we got everybody&#8230; Our designers have desktops. Actually, almost everybody had desktops. And so, we were like, &#8220;Look, we can&#8217;t say you work remote, but then basically chain you to a desk.&#8221; So we got everybody all new laptops, and we were like, &#8220;Look, we don&#8217;t know what this is going to look like, but you have the freedom to work from wherever you&#8217;re at. So if you want to travel somewhere, you can work from there. As long as you&#8217;re able to be productive, work however you want to.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so, for us, we really just had to figure out what was going to work now that we were in the long haul for this. So really it was just changing our work model. So changing it from in the studio to being remote. But then also from a clock in, clock out like you had in the studio where people come in and they&#8217;re expected to be in at 9:00, expect to stay till 5:00, and you had a good culture there. Where now it&#8217;s like, &#8220;We have to go to dentists, we have to get our car inspected. We have to do all the things while being at home.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So we switched to this get it done model, where it&#8217;s like, you know what you need to do. Monday, Wednesday, Friday, first thing in the morning, we talk about what we need to do and then you just go do it, however you&#8217;re going to get it done. So if you want to take out in the middle of the day to hang out with the kids, cool. You know what needs to be done when it needs to be done. I don&#8217;t need to babysit you.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so that&#8217;s worked out really, really well, both for my wife and I, Elizabeth, because sometimes we&#8217;re just not feeling like sitting in front of a desk. And so, we can sit with our laptop. And plus, we can do a lot of our work via our phone if we&#8217;re just calling or setting up meetings or reviewing work. So for us, this whole get it done model has really helped us all tackle life&#8217;s responsibilities along with work responsibilities.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, it sounds like you and the team are really able to make a agile shift pretty quickly. Do you think that was just because of your tight-knit nature of the team? What do you really attribute to that?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I was a creative&#8230; Oh sorry, I was art director at Dell for five and a half years, and I learned quite a bit of what to do and what not to do. And so, very, very quickly I knew that I wanted everything that we did to be cloud based. And so, I didn&#8217;t want the opportunity for someone to have anything on their local drive that we needed, or for a laptop to get stolen and work that I had paid for over months for them to do got lost.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So we were already very equipped to work remotely, because everything was already backed up to the cloud constantly through Google File Stream. And we had been using all the Google suites. So everything from the calendars, to email, to everything. So we were already well-equipped to just work from devices, whether that be iPads, phones, or computers, or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I think being that we&#8217;re a small team and it was seven of us, I think that allowed us to be nimble. And we&#8217;ve always prided ourselves on being nimble and being able to fail quickly. So we&#8217;ll try something. If it doesn&#8217;t work, let&#8217;s adapt. But honestly, I attribute it to having just a damn good team who really has a lot of faith in Elizabeth and I to just guide them. And they&#8217;ll follow us in whatever direction we ask them to.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And we have an open-door policy. We ask people, there&#8217;s no hierarchy other than the fact that I&#8217;m responsible for making sure they get paid and everything. Everyone has the opportunity to make a suggestion. Everybody has the opportunity to talk to me or Elizabeth and say, &#8220;Hey, this isn&#8217;t working, or this could be better, or I ain&#8217;t dealing with something.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And unfortunately, during the pandemic, things happen. People die. Maybe it&#8217;s pandemic related, maybe it&#8217;s not. And we have to be adaptive to that. And so, we can&#8217;t just sit there and go, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re running a business here, sorry.&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;No, we&#8217;ll figure it out. We&#8217;ll make it work.&#8221; And we just have a killer team that just everybody has everybody&#8217;s back. So it really has helped us move, and shift, and be nimble during this time of uncertainty.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you talked about going from being more locally focused with your client base to now having this global reach. What are the best types of clients for you to work with?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So we work with architects, interior designers, and developers, and business owners. We work with everybody, but those are the best. Our ideal client&#8230; We don&#8217;t call our clients, clients. We call them partners, because this is a partnership. We have to work together. I don&#8217;t work for anybody. And so, we are working together to meet a goal and to create an experience. And so for us, we love working with interior designers because, A, they know the budget, and they&#8217;re realistic.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
They&#8217;re not developers who have a stake in how much money the project makes. And they&#8217;re not designers who are like, &#8220;Oh, I think I know how to design a sign or an installation,&#8221; and they have no idea. So when we work with&#8230; And architects are good, but architects always hire interior designers, and interior designers love us and we love them. So, they have a vision. We bring their visions either to life, or we just&#8230; They say, &#8220;This is an area that we don&#8217;t know what to do, but that&#8217;s where we call you.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so, interior designers are great. So we work with lots of different agencies that have wonderful, talented interior designers who rely on us to do what we do well. And the crazy thing is, is maybe it&#8217;s the same in design, I don&#8217;t know, but there&#8217;s a lot of turnover. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s just like, they go to a place, they&#8217;re there for a year. And then they want to just go to somewhere else or they move or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So like pollinating, we make great relationships with one studio and then five of their interior designers over the course of a year or two go to five different other places. And then those five other places call us too. And next thing you know, we got 15, 20 interior design agencies all around the United States and whatnot that are calling us for project after project. So, I love them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I like that spread effect like that. I mean, I think you mentioned the great resignation a couple of times now. It&#8217;s interesting how because the pandemic has forced a lot of people to now work from home or work from remote locations, that a lot of companies before are just having to open themselves up to talent from a lot of other places.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so, I think that can be both good and bad. Of course, for the company, I could see the downside of it because now that they&#8217;re working with employees from other states, they&#8217;ve got to think about, &#8220;Well, can we legally hire people in this state and what does that mean?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Exactly. That&#8217;s my wife. We had a team member in Atlanta, and she jumped through so many hoops with the comptroller there in Atlanta to just get this person to where we can offer them insurance and everything else. Yeah, it&#8217;s a huge undertaking when you bring on somebody outside of your state, and it&#8217;s a new state that you haven&#8217;t been in already.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And then for the worker, it can be easy because now so many gigs that before were just landlocked to a certain city, now you can work from everywhere. I&#8217;ve been working, personally I&#8217;ve been working remotely since 2009. And like you, when I had&#8230; I had a studio for nine years, from 2009 to 2017. And we did some work locally. We did a lot of national work, some international work. But I&#8217;d say for the past two years now, on and off for the past two years, I&#8217;ve mostly been working internationally. It&#8217;s worked out that I can now take my skills and I can work in Amsterdam. I can work in Paris, which is where my current job is headquartered at.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So how do you deal with the time difference?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Not well.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I was going to say. I went to Hawaii. I went to Hawaii in January and I didn&#8217;t think that was going to mess me up. But boy, did it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Not well. I mean, so when I worked for the company in Amsterdam, I think it was a six hour time difference, five to six hour time difference. Because you know, daylight savings time eventually creeps in. But it was rough because by the time I&#8217;d start in the morning, it would be in the afternoon there. There would be some times I would have to be up at 4:00 AM for a meeting. And thank God they were not anal about having the camera on with anything. So I could just be halfway in bed on Zoom, like, &#8220;Yeah, yeah, whatever.&#8221; For the current job, it&#8217;s not that bad because we&#8217;re split. Where my time zone is, eastern time zone is sort of split between where the company is. So we&#8217;re between San Francisco and Paris.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So in the morning I work with the Europeans. My boss is in London. And then in the afternoon I&#8217;m working with more of the creative team that&#8217;s here in the US that are in California. So my day is split in that way. We do a lot, a lot of async communication just to pass the baton back and forth. But it can be brutal sometimes. Sometimes I am working a 12-hour day from 5:00 to 5:00. Sometimes. Not all the time, but sometimes it happens, and it&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
That&#8217;s our goal. That&#8217;s our goal is&#8230; My wife and I, I have a 20-year-old daughter, and so she&#8217;s very much into living her own life. That&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been trying to adjust to. But we have aspirations to basically be digital nomads. And really set up our team to where we can&#8230; We have aspirations to make either a home or a temporary home in Portugal.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so, it&#8217;s the idea of, how do we do this? What would it look like? What time would we get up? What time would we be on? What time would we be off? And really just thinking about that. And we haven&#8217;t really put it to the test. The pandemic hasn&#8217;t really given us the comfort that we want to travel. Hawaii, like I mentioned, they had a really good COVID response.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So, you have to have your vaccination, you have to have a 72-hour negative COVID test. You got to have everything right and tight or they won&#8217;t even let you on the island. And so we felt comfortable with&#8230; That was a trip we&#8217;ve been planning since 2019 for my daughter&#8217;s graduation. So, we did go to Florida during Delta. And so, we&#8217;re big Disney fans for the service and the attention to detail. And so we go to Disney World as much as possible. And we went in 2020&#8230; Or 2021, August. And that was not a vacation.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
That was like going to a neighborhood you know you don&#8217;t want to be in. It was like that. It was just, head was on a swivel. Everybody, I mean, Disney did a good job, but people do what people do. And so, people weren&#8217;t wearing their masks right. People were just being too close and all that. But it was really dead there. The crowds were nothing like they would normally be.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So, we made the best of the trip, but now we&#8217;re trying to get back to the swing of things. And we want to travel more and see what it&#8217;s like to work in foreign places and make that adjustment. So I envy you. I might have to call you up and get some tips on how to adjust with jet lag.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I do a lot of&#8230; It&#8217;s a lot of async communication. It&#8217;s a lot of scheduled emails. It&#8217;s a lot of, at least for me, and I don&#8217;t know if this is probably just like a general tactic, but I do a lot of managing up. So, I have a manager, but then I also manage someone. So for my manager, I give regular, regular updates like, &#8220;I just did this. This is what I&#8217;m working on now.&#8221; Because we may only get&#8230; Our schedules only overlap for 30 minutes a day. So we don&#8217;t have a ton of time to really get together and talk.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m always letting him know, &#8220;This is what I have to do. This is what I&#8217;m working on. This is where I have a blocker or something like that.&#8221; And so then he can work on those things when I&#8217;m not at work. And it&#8217;s kind of passing the baton. I would say also the benefit is that he and I have worked together at two other companies now, so we know how to work together well, as opposed to having to figure that out with someone new.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s exactly. That&#8217;s what you were asking, how did we make this adjustment? Our team consists of, like I said, five additional to me and my wife. And so, three of those five&#8230; So the two new ones are the newest. But three of those five have been with us for years. One of them was a previous student of mine, he&#8217;s been with us the longest. He&#8217;s been with us for five years now.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And when you work with somebody that close, there&#8217;s a trust there, but also there&#8217;s just this ability to understand what needs to be done and there&#8217;s not a lot of conversation necessary. And so, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s always hard for us when someone decides they want to leave and go to something else is just that, the onboarding time&#8217;s a headache. But there&#8217;s a lot of just energy and gaining of trust and all that that has to be built with somebody brand new that you can&#8217;t do in your typical onboarding window of 60 to 90 days or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And with this particular thing, and hopefully I&#8217;m not telling too of much my business by saying this, but he and I, we started working together in 2017 at one startup. And then he left, and then a couple, I think maybe a couple months later they eliminated our entire department at the first place we worked at.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But then he got a job at another startup and was like, &#8220;Do you want to work here?&#8221; And I didn&#8217;t have a job, so I was like, &#8220;Sure, let&#8217;s do it.&#8221; And then he left there to another startup, which is where he&#8217;s at now, and then was like, &#8220;Yeah, I need help and I want do these things. Do you want a job?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Sure.&#8221; So for him, I mean, it&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Come on with me and make these things happen.&#8221; But also has increased my salary tremendously.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
There you go. There you go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So for that I am very thankful.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
It makes dollars and sense, huh?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Exactly. Yeah. So just to switch gears a little bit, we talked a lot about Studio Dzo. But let&#8217;s focus on you, because you&#8217;re the subject, of course, of this interview. Tell me a bit about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So I grew up in Austin, Texas. I&#8217;m one of the few Austin Knights that are OOG. Not these people that came in from outside or from California. So I&#8217;ve seen Austin change tremendously over the last 38 years.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I was born in Houston and we moved here as a kid. I remember the ride here. But yeah, I&#8217;ve grown up in Austin, and South Austin in particular, and still live in South Austin. And I have a love/hate with the city, because this is my city. And I say that because I&#8217;ve spent a long time more recently just trying to retrace my roots, and you know that can be challenging for us. And so, realizing my entire family is from Austin.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
My dad was born here in Austin. My great, great, great-</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Yeah, I was born here in Austin. My great, great, great grandfather was born in Austin and crazy thing was, just recently, a random phone call came to the studio, right? This woman&#8217;s like, &#8220;I&#8217;m cleaning up my property and there&#8217;s a headstone with Toynes on it, on my property.&#8221; And she was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think anybody&#8217;s buried here but there&#8217;s headstones here.&#8221; And it&#8217;s my great grandfather&#8217;s headstone. And so, he has a headstone in Evergreen Cemetery so I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What is this about?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so, but we&#8217;ve always joked because the headstone in Evergreen cemetery&#8217;s incorrect, it makes him 150-years-old when he was dead. So whoever made that one, the numbers are wrong. But this one had the correct numbers with the wrong spelling of his first name. And so it was just all &#8230; I don&#8217;t know the story behind this but just to reiterate, my family has been here and everything about my family is Austin and East Austin, in particular. And so it&#8217;s hard for me to see East Austin different.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
It&#8217;s hard for me to see it where I don&#8217;t know what our black population is but it was 8%, I think, at its highest and it&#8217;s three maybe now. I don&#8217;t know, but it&#8217;s not what it used to be and the communities now are so transient. It&#8217;s starting to feel a little bit like New York where you just don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s going to be here for how long. So it&#8217;s been sad for me to accept what&#8217;s happening to Austin. And I think it&#8217;s also been hard for me to accept that maybe this isn&#8217;t my forever place. Even though my family has been here forever, this may not be my forever place.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I think that&#8217;s something a lot of people are realizing particularly over the past two years. Not just because of the pandemic, but because of gentrification, inflation, everything is more expensive. Atlanta is very much a transient city like that, as well. I&#8217;m originally from Alabama but I&#8217;ve been in Atlanta now for 23 years. I think I came in &#8217;99. So I&#8217;ve been here for about 23 years now and even seeing how much Atlanta has changed when I came as a teenager to now being a full grown-ass man and seeing how things have changed, even just different parts of the city.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember when I first got here, I&#8217;d say maybe I was a junior in college. My first apartment was like$600 a month in Buckhead. That&#8217;s impossible now. And then I stayed in another place in Buckhead, it was a two bedroom. One room was my office, one was my bedroom and it was right off of Peachtree Street in Buckhead proper for like $750 a month or something like that. Now those are like $2.5 million condos. It&#8217;s wild seeing how the city has changed over the years. So I totally get what you mean.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s a hard pill to swallow and then also to see who gets pushed out and who comes in, right? And it&#8217;s not like everybody&#8217;s just winning, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s hard. It&#8217;s hard.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Especially here because Atlanta, of course, has a reputation of being a city that&#8217;s really &#8230; There&#8217;s a lot of prosperous black people here. A lot of affluent black people here, which is true. I totally don&#8217;t think I would&#8217;ve been able to accomplish what I was able to accomplish entrepreneurship wise in any other city but Atlanta because I had a lot of support from the black community here. But yeah, rents are getting more and more expensive. Everything is just more expensive. It&#8217;s tough to move here now and start out fresh than you could maybe even like 10 years ago because everything is just changing.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Yeah. I love Atlanta. Me and my wife, we have friends and &#8230; We don&#8217;t have any family but we would like to think of them as family. But we have a lot of people that we know in Atlanta and we love going there and it&#8217;s just a huge, huge city. People think Austin, they think, &#8220;Oh it&#8217;s such a cool city.&#8221; It&#8217;s a small &#8230; When you talk about footprint wise, the city is small. And Atlanta, you got like seven lane highways and I don&#8217;t even know why you have a speed limit. Let&#8217;s be honest, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true. That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Everybody, even the police, man, they&#8217;re out there 80 on the highway and it says 65, 55. You&#8217;re like, you can&#8217;t even legally go this limit. Yeah, and I love what y&#8217;all have done unlike Austin, right? What y&#8217;all have done with Ponce City Market, how you took an old building and instead of tearing it down like they would do in Austin, you utilized it and I know they&#8217;re not at all affordable in any way. But they used to utilize it for housing in a development instead of just tearing it down and creating something brand new, which is Austin&#8217;s mode of operations here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, we have a couple of places like that in Atlanta. There&#8217;s Krog Street Market. There&#8217;s a couple other places probably further outside the perimeter but Atlanta is good for tearing shit down, too, and just starting anew. I tell people, because I used to work in the tourism industry here and I tell people Atlanta&#8217;s a city that every seven years tries to find a new identity. It tries to find like what&#8217;s the new thing that we can latch on to and really make our thing. Because I was working in the tourism industry from 2005 to 2007.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so during that time Hurricane Katrina happened. But when I first started in 2005, Atlanta was really trying to distinguish itself from say, Orlando or Vegas or New York because people like to come to Atlanta. But the reasons that they like to come to Atlanta were not &#8230; How can I put this? Family friendly reasons for wanting to come. Like, they&#8217;ll go to Orlando because of Disney World, they&#8217;ll go to New York City because of the culture. But there was no distinguishing thing that people would come to Atlanta for. At least not ones that you would put on a tourism pamphlet.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Other than the World of Coke and the aquarium.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look, we didn&#8217;t even have the aquarium then. This was pre the aquarium, yeah. I was at the groundbreaking for the aquarium. But this was even before then, all we had was World of Coke. We had the zoo and Turner Fields. That&#8217;s about it. There&#8217;s not a lot of places, really. People came to Atlanta back then because, one, it carried over this reputation of being a party city from the 90s but you&#8217;ve got hip-hop, you&#8217;ve got all kinds of entertainment. You&#8217;ve got clubs. That&#8217;s why people came to Atlanta to have fun, to have a good time. But none of those things &#8230; They&#8217;re not going to put strippers on a pamphlet and have that at the airport. Is that a reason people would come? Sure. But that&#8217;s not one that the Atlanta Convention and Visitor&#8217;s Bureau would get behind because they&#8217;re trying to get-</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
If Vegas can do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well. But see, they&#8217;re trying to get multi-million dollar shows to come here. And we had a huge show pull out in 2005 called, Home Builders. Something happened with like, somebody said the wrong thing to somebody and this million dollar show pulled out of Atlanta. And then there was another big show, T.D. Jakes, the evangelist, the preacher. Yeah. He used to do this big thing called, MegaFest and he would bring it to Atlanta. And it was basically like a two week, I don&#8217;t know, MegaFest. I mean it had carnival rides, it had speakers and panels and all this sort of stuff and they pulled out, as well. And so Atlanta was like, &#8220;Well, we don&#8217;t have any reason for people to come here.&#8221; Because the other thing was these conventions would all be downtown and downtown is a ghost town after five o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Yes, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
People commute downtown and then they leave and the only thing that&#8217;s really downtown at night are homeless folks. And so because of that, conventions didn&#8217;t feel like they wanted to have people down there because they were getting accosted by people on the street and they didn&#8217;t feel it was safe and everything. And so, one of the things that happened was the aquarium opened but then Hurricane Katrina happened and a lot of conventions had to relocate to Atlanta.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so we had a big boom there for a while but then that died out as New Orleans tried to rebuild and conventions went back there. So then the Georgia Tourism Department basically worked with the state to get all these tax benefits for movies and television shows and studios and stuff to shoot here. So now that&#8217;s the big thing that Atlanta is for. Atlanta is like quote, unquote, &#8220;Black Hollywood.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I love it, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Because you have so many movies and shows and things that are here that people come and shoot for. I mean it&#8217;s rare now, well it used to be rare back then, but now it&#8217;s super common to watch a movie and be like, &#8220;Oh yeah, that&#8217;s in Atlanta.&#8221; Like I&#8217;ll watch Black Panther, that scene at the museum. I used to work at that museum selling tickets.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
That&#8217;s awesome. That&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, I&#8217;d look at stuff and be like, &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s &#8230;&#8221; But even now that&#8217;s starting to die off because politics, now politicians here have certain views and then that goes against what the companies are here that are giving them &#8230; It&#8217;s a whole &#8230; Atlanta&#8217;s complicated, man. Really it&#8217;s Georgia, but Atlanta itself is a complicated blue dot in a very red state.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
That is, yeah, that is a whole message right there. Exactly. I mean, we&#8217;ve even talked about moving to Atlanta and they were like, &#8220;But it&#8217;s in Georgia,&#8221; you know? And I&#8217;m in Texas, so I can&#8217;t really say anything because both states are sitting in the same spot. But just like Atlanta, Austin is that blueberry in the tomato soup.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But unfortunately, like you said, the politics of both states have gotten a bad reputation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). I mean, if you&#8217;re in Atlanta, it&#8217;s so funny. I remember this from, oh, I know what the show is. It was, Sex and the City. And there&#8217;s this episode of, Sex and the City, where Carrie and Miranda are double dating these guys. And one of the guys says something about how he&#8217;s never left New York and Miranda&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s a weirdo if he&#8217;s never left New York.&#8221; There&#8217;s people here that have moved to Atlanta and have never left Atlanta. They&#8217;ve stayed right in the perimeter or right in inside the metropolitan area because anything outside of here is deliverance. It&#8217;s a totally different thing, if you go an hour in any direction from the center of Atlanta, like good luck.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Yeah, it is strange also. But the thing is y&#8217;all can travel for three or four hours, maybe not safely, but you can travel for three or four hours and be in a whole other state. With us, it takes eight hours to get to El Paso.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
It&#8217;s like, you want to get to the coast, that&#8217;s a three hour trip. You want to get to Dallas, that&#8217;s a three and a half hour trip with no traffic. And so, Houston, same thing, three hours. And so everything just takes a long time and you&#8217;re still in the damn state.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So being from Austin and growing up there, were you exposed to a lot of design and everything growing up?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Short answer, no. For me, designer was exclusive to jeans and fragrance. I didn&#8217;t know, no one ever told me. I think this just happens to being an 80&#8217;s kid. Having someone sit down and point to you in the library like, you see that crappy poster, somebody designed that. You see this book, someone designed it. No one ever did that, right? So you really only knew the jobs that you saw people do, you know? So my dad worked in restaurants and then basically did sales for Circuit City. That&#8217;s dating, right?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
My mom&#8217;s always been in insurance and then pretty much every single person I knew either worked for the post office or for some insurance company or had military history or just worked some random office job. So no one ever sat down with me, ever and said, you could be this. I was talking to my wife and I was like, &#8220;The first time I ever met somebody at a career fair or something,&#8221; and then that person was like, &#8220;This is what I do.&#8221; And then I said, &#8220;I want to do that.&#8221; The very first time that happened, I think I was in fourth grade and it was a lobbyist and I was like, &#8220;I want to do what they do.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I have no idea what was compelling about being a lobbyist. But I think it was the idea of convincing people, right? And so, no. No one ever told me. So design wasn&#8217;t ever presented to me. And it wasn&#8217;t until I realized when I went to school, that design is problem solving. And that&#8217;s all I have ever done as a kid, is I was that kid that woke up at five o&#8217;clock in the morning with a problem, right? With a problem that I manifested in my dreams and I had to find a solution. So I was constantly taking things apart, re-imagining things, putting things together, just making up shit for myself to do and I was always solving problems.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve always been a natural leader, too. I just managed to convince people to follow me in some direction. And thankfully I never started a cult but it probably wouldn&#8217;t been too hard for me. But I always had the knack of being a loner but having no problem getting followers, but never wanted to be a follower. So I was that kid that was cool with everybody, but really was kind of a loner in a way. Everyone knew me. I had lots of friends but I only let certain people in.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So as a natural problem solver, I just found myself into lots of things, but no one ever gave me the design word to call it. And it wasn&#8217;t until my older brother graduated from school from ACC also with a design degree and a degree in politics, that I even understood that designers had software and they did things and it just wasn&#8217;t like &#8230; I don&#8217;t know, it wasn&#8217;t a word or it wasn&#8217;t painter, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). So you went to Austin Community College and you studied design and visual communications. How was that experience?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Like a lot of black designers, I had a very unconventional journey into design. So as I mentioned, I didn&#8217;t know what design was. So my original entrepreneur efforts started when I was catching shoplifters for four years. And then my daughter was born and she needed round-the-clock care at home. So me and my wife had to decide who&#8217;s going to stay at home and take care of her and who&#8217;s going to go to work. And she had the better benefits so it was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll stay at home and take care of her.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Well, money still needs to be had and so I always had aspirations to be a film director. So I started writing little films and things like that, but that doesn&#8217;t pay but I had the knowledge and understanding to cut video. And so I started out just cutting people&#8217;s home videos, taking people&#8217;s crappy home videos and removing all this stuff where mom left it on the table recording nothing and all that and just started doing that. And that led down to a very strange path to me working with lots of people, one being Vanilla Ice and-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Yeah, random. So yeah, I did a really, really crappy music video for a friend. I did it for $6, too. That&#8217;s just how you helped your friends for back then. And so, and then a promoter for Vanilla Ice saw it &#8230; I&#8217;m embarrassed to say that. But saw it and then they called me up and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;We have a whole bunch of raw footage from a concert in &#8217;99 or 2000.&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Can you cut it and put it to DVD?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so that got things started. So that got me out of doing the home videos. And then that&#8217;s when people were like, &#8220;Oh, can you do a music video for me? Can you do that?&#8221; And I ended up working on a big project for Text Dots, a training video for them. And I saw the future of me being in this film video game but I had no education. I had no knowledge, I didn&#8217;t know anything about anything. I was just doing whatever, how it worked and it worked okay.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But then in 2006, I guess it was 2005, I was working with a rapper and they were less than honest with the people who were giving them money. And then basically, I always tried to operate with contracts. And basically he was trying to get out of the contract and made it quite dramatic. I&#8217;ll spare you the details. But let&#8217;s just say that, I had to act less than professional because he was acting less than professional, you know [crosstalk 00:39:51]-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Got it, got it. No, no, I know what you mean.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
&#8230; when you get grown. And so, I was just like, &#8220;I&#8217;m done with this shit. I&#8217;m done with this shit&#8221; And I just woke up January 1st, 2006 and I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m a designer. That&#8217;s it, that&#8217;s it.&#8221; I just put that shit out in the universe, right? And so, my older brother gave me a bootleg copy of CS2 and I just started working in Illustrator. I had already been designing DVD covers and things like that for the stuff that I had been doing, but I didn&#8217;t know anything about it. And so, but what was crazy was like I said, I have never had a problem getting people to follow me.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I just told the world I was a designer and the world just said, &#8220;Okay,&#8221; and the world just like, &#8220;so can you do this for me? Can you do this for me?&#8221; And so I had a nice little nest of construction people and concrete people who were just like, they didn&#8217;t know anything about anything but they could just pay me and they&#8217;d get their carbonless forms and business cards and mailers and their trucks with vinyl on it and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And I was doing the worst design on the planet and it was awful, but it was paying barely any of the bills I had. And I was just making it each day. But I thought I was balling, too, I got myself a little &#8230; This tells you the time, too. I got myself a little one room office on Burnett Road in central Austin for $250 a month. That&#8217;s all it cost.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So I thought I was balling. I was like, I got an office and this and this. I didn&#8217;t need no office, I could have worked from home, but this was just my excuse to give myself the tools to feel like I have arrived. And then I started mentoring young people at LBJ and I had gone to LBJ Science Academy at the time. It was called Science Academy at the time. Now it&#8217;s called Liberal Arts and Science Academy. But I started mentoring young people there and they were learning Illustrator Photoshop in design all in one semester.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And I was like, these damn kids are going to take my job. I got to get more education. So I went to ACC and I was 27-years-old. I had a five-year-old daughter at the time. I was divorced. And I just saw that I had a lot of passion, I had a lot of drive, but I had no education. And this just winging it was proving not &#8230; I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to sustain myself if I wanted to make a life for myself at all in design. So I went to school and that was the best damn decision I ever made in my life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So after you went to school and you graduated, what was your early career like? You mentioned earlier, you had worked for Dell for quite a number of years.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
You know, I still freelanced while I was in school and I very much have always been a person to take advantage of every single opportunity. And I meet somebody and I&#8217;m like, if I want to work with them, I&#8217;m going to make them work with me. I just have the ability to just manifest a lot of what I want. And so for me, I stayed very involved in design and design community and everything. And I had a great, great portfolio professor who later became a mentor, Owen Hammonds and, yeah, still is a friend of mine. I mean, I call him my mentor. He says, we&#8217;re just friends.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But I still see him as a huge, huge influence to me. I attribute almost all of my success to him and it was honored to have him in my wedding. It was an honor to have him in my life and call him a friend. And we&#8217;re both very, very busy, but whenever we get on the phone with each other or see each other, it&#8217;s just an honor. So, but yeah, he really took me under his wing. He was my portfolio professor at ACC and he just saw this hustler in me and he was like, &#8220;This dude&#8217;s going to do it.&#8221; And he just plugged me in and just stayed on me and never, never bullshitted me, never gassed me up, always pushed me to be better.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so right out of school &#8230; I&#8217;m sure you have them in Atlanta. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard of them, like various talent head hunters, right? Like Aquent or Liaison Resources or the Creative Group and all of them. So Aquent had come to one of our classes and talked about, they&#8217;d find jobs for creatives and all this stuff like that. So I just graduated, I mean, literally the day we finished class. So I hadn&#8217;t even graduated yet, just the class was done. I just was on in the car driving. I just called them up and I was like, &#8220;Hey, heard you can get me a job.&#8221; And they were like, &#8220;Send me your portfolio.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And then the next day they called me in. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s talk.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;We have these jobs.&#8221; And so I started interviewing for people and I interviewed at Dell and it took them a little bit of time to see my magic. But after four months, basically interviewing with them two or three times, I interviewed with them for lunches and all this stuff. And I was like, &#8220;You like me, I like you. Let&#8217;s do this,&#8221; right? Like dating. I got put on at Dell and I started out as a designer and worked my way up to senior designer, art director, senior art director.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And really, I tell people I got my degree in Visual Communications at ACC, but I got my Masters in the Business of Design at Dell. I had an amazing creative director, Tommy Lynn, who really, really, really taught me a lot, gave me a lot of autonomy, really trusted me. And I still see him as a friend and a mentor, even now. And we&#8217;ve both been gone from Dell for many years, but I learned the business of design. I understood how to handle clients, how to give them the level of service that brings them back. And I know it sounds weird because I&#8217;m was on the brand team, so we only answered to the brand.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
We developed the brand, we evolved the brand, but we had internal clients who used our team to create resources that promoted Dell&#8217;s brand. So it would be a corporate responsibility team. It really wasn&#8217;t marketing, we didn&#8217;t do anything about selling product. It was about selling the brand as a whole. And so having both Owen Hammonds, having the education, helped me land Dell but Dell helped me really take this entrepreneurial energy that I&#8217;ve always possessed and really, really hone it into-</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
&#8230; kind of possessed and really, really hone it into where my next step was, was, and I didn&#8217;t really realize that I wanted to go back to being an entrepreneur, but they set me up tremendously and gave me a fat paycheck to learn over the course of five and a half years. So I&#8217;m not going to complain about that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, there you go. I mean, when you had your time there working at Dell and learning about the business of design, was that the impetus for you to start your own studio?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
No, honestly, no. I saw myself like everybody else. You go from one place, you do three to five years, then you go to another place. And honestly, I didn&#8217;t see myself going back into entrepreneurship, because I had never had a nine to five salary with benefits and all that. I had basically worked an hourly job until my daughter was born, and then basically just like hustled in the worst way possible to make crumbs doing video and design and whatnot. So when somebody was like, &#8220;Here, here&#8217;s a paycheck and here&#8217;s some benefits and here&#8217;s a lifestyle you&#8217;ve never had.&#8221; I just figured this is it. I&#8217;ve just landed the jackpot. But then over five and a half years, you start to realize there is a ceiling, and it depends on who your manager is. It depends on who your executive is, and you start realizing, people start leaving and you start wondering, am I the last ship&#8230; Sorry, am I the last rat on a sinking ship?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so all my team that I had been with over the five and a half years, only one other person was with me. And so we had watched like 20 people over the course of the time come in and out that it was just like, okay, the writing&#8217;s in the wall, you either going to be a lifer here or you got to find something else. It was really my wife who said&#8230; She&#8217;s always been my greatest supporter, and I had talked about owning a business and her father had sold his business and was kind of always envious of design and wanted to do something with me. And so I said, &#8220;Look, we&#8217;ll do something, but we&#8217;ll do it on my terms.&#8221; And he was like, &#8220;Yeah, yeah, yeah.&#8221; And so after basically I tried to bluff my executive at Dell to give me more money and to give me a promotion, basically I tried to bluff and be like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to have to go find something else.&#8221; And they were like, &#8220;Look&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So I was like, &#8220;Look, I just can&#8217;t blow smoke. I got to do this.&#8221; And so I left on September 7th. And I thought I was going to take the whole month of September off. And like two weeks later, started the laying the ground work for Studio Dzo. With my father-in-law and mine to be my partner, long story short, we realized quickly we cannot work together. My wife realized that before we realized that.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And my wife was like, &#8220;Look, if&#8230; Because we were about to get married, she&#8217;s like, &#8220;If we&#8217;re going to get married. We can&#8217;t have this. I got to have a relationship with my father. I got to have a relationship with my husband. Y&#8217;all can&#8217;t be at each other&#8217;s throat.&#8221; We had very different mindsets of what this business was going to be. So we had a negotiation with him, had a conversation and we said, &#8220;It&#8217;s time for you to retire. Go and do your own thing.&#8221; And, and he&#8217;s a restless person anyway. So he had a software business. He&#8217;s now able to dedicate himself to that. And so he was with us for about the first seven months of Studio Dzo.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I mean, I guess you didn&#8217;t want it to be that much of a family business.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
He really wanted that. He only has girls. So he really wanted this family business with the son-in-law and all this stuff like that. And I think he had this idea, but in his head that he really wanted. But yeah, now it&#8217;s just me and my wife and it&#8217;s good. We have the same interests, both financially and the goal of the business. So we are in sync where if you have different people who have different lifestyles and different households, it gets complicated. It&#8217;s like, well, if you&#8217;re eating steak, I need to eat steak. Where it&#8217;s like now we got to afford two steaks, versus me and my wife having a steak kind of thing. And so, yeah, it&#8217;s really complicate when you have different households and the family business is obviously complicated, but me and my wife very much, we have professional backgrounds so we always operate very professionally, at least on camera.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What were those kind of early days like with the Studio?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Oh man. So really it was&#8230; Like I said, I got the business of design from Dell, so I knew what I wanted, but it was scary. I&#8217;m not going to lie. But I knew that I had set myself up financially thanks to Dell that if I failed, I was going to fail quickly and I was just going to go and work some at some other place. So I knew what I wanted. And so thankfully I was aware that couldn&#8217;t do it all. So I had hired a friend of mine to help me develop the brand. I had hired a student of mine to just basically be like the hands of things. I had really just put people in the right places so that way I can focus on the development of the business. Thankfully, my wife had already been doing books for her father&#8217;s business and she&#8217;s an accountant, that&#8217;s her education in accounting.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so she does all things like money side. So she&#8217;s thankfully was able to do all of that. So all I had to do was basically sell and do the work and that&#8217;s kind of what I&#8217;m really, really good at. And so it was scary at first, but we also were a smaller team. I guess we were five at the time, but I just didn&#8217;t know what it was going to be. But honestly like people have just trusted us and I hate to kind of keep hitting it over the head with it, but I&#8217;ve never had a problem with getting people to follow us. So being able to sit down with somebody and tell them what we do and why we do it and why they should choose us wasn&#8217;t difficult.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
What was difficult was disrupting design business, design industry. So we&#8217;re designers who design signage, wayfinding, and physical experiences. But the problem with the sign industry is they&#8217;re like the bastard child of construction. So what typically happens is a developer gives their general contractor a budget for signage. And so the general contractor is just trying to find somebody to stick something&#8217;s up on the walls so that way they can get their certificate of occupancy. And so no one is ever talking about brand. No one&#8217;s ever talking about experience. No one&#8217;s talking about that. These sign shops, some of them, not all of them, are just trying to basically put a piece of acrylic with ADA beads on and in whatever default typeface they can in the cheapest way possible. It&#8217;s like a race to the bottom. It&#8217;s like everyone&#8217;s trying to be the Walmart of signs.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so I knew that I did not want to do that. And after listening to my father-in-law, who owned a sign company for like 20 years and he owned Sign Tech International, which at a time was like one of the biggest manufacturers in Texas. He was like, &#8220;No, no people, that&#8217;s not how it works. We design it. We sell it. We mark up the price and that&#8217;s how we get paid.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;So what happens when you design it and then they go and take it to somebody else and they get a lower bid?&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, that just happens.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;No, it doesn&#8217;t. Not here. It&#8217;s not going to happen here.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;We&#8217;re designers. We get paid to solve problems. We need to be paid or we&#8217;re not going to do this.&#8221; And he is like, &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to get people to pay for design before they see it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And I was like, &#8220;Well, then we&#8217;re going to be out of business real quick.&#8221; That was the weird thing is going into people who are used to basically, &#8220;Well, show me something. And if I like it, I&#8217;ll buy it.&#8221; We&#8217;re going to walk through this together. We&#8217;re going to talk about your problems. We&#8217;re going to talk about opportunities. You&#8217;re going to pay me up front and then I&#8217;m going to show you what that is going to look like. And that&#8217;s like I said, me and my father-in-law butted heads quite a bit. It was over that, because he was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve been working with this person for years. We don&#8217;t need to charge him for design.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;No, you&#8217;re setting a precedent with everybody if you do that.&#8221; So we would butt heads and that&#8217;s when he was like, &#8220;Maybe this isn&#8217;t good for us to be in business together.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s when I was like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s do it my way.&#8221; My wife was already on board and we now have, that&#8217;s all we do. That&#8217;s what we do. And people know us for that is that we solve our problems with design first. And then if you like what we design, and we&#8217;re all done with the design process, we&#8217;re going to give you a quote for fabrication, installation. But because you paid for that design process, you can take those files and share them with anybody else. You&#8217;ve already paid me for my work. This is now in your hands. So if you want to go out there and get a quote from somebody else, you can. No sweat off my back. I just keep it moving and go on to the next project. But if they do go with us, then we&#8217;ll fabricate and we have partners all around the world we fabricate with. And then we have partners both locally and all around to install.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And 90% still go with us. I would say more than that. 95% stay with us to do the fabrication, installation process because we don&#8217;t cut corners. And so they know that if we spec this particular material, we spec this particular lighting temperature, whatever, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to be. It&#8217;s not going to get in the hands of somebody else that then chops it up to make more profit. And then gives them a subpar product. We don&#8217;t do that. And so we have no problem getting people to commit through the whole entire process, but we put those breaks, because some people have to get multiple bids. Some people think that they&#8217;re not getting the best deal. And we tell people, we will never be the cheapest, but we&#8217;re the best, is what I say.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
We do good work. That&#8217;s our motto. We do good work for good people with good people. And so first and foremost is that, like I said, I don&#8217;t work for anybody. I work with people. We call all of our clients partners because I pick and choose who I want to work with. If they&#8217;re not a good person, we don&#8217;t work with them. And there&#8217;s been times where I&#8217;ve had to dig in on somebody just for a second, like they call us up and want to work with us. I Google everybody, and if I find anything that doesn&#8217;t agree with our values, I just say, &#8220;Hey, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good fit.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Because we believe that everyone should be treated equitably, fairly, and that this world is unfair and we&#8217;re not going to contribute to that in any way possible. We want to support all those, especially those who are not supported. We want to support the weirdos, the people who are aren&#8217;t typically accepted. And we want to support obviously our black community, our underrepresented community. And so we do a lot to make sure that our good work extends beyond what actually earns us money, but also we do a lot of work with nonprofits and we donate a lot of hours and times to people in organizations.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I have to say one of the best things about having your own business is running it exactly how you want it. Like if it&#8217;s a bad client experience, you don&#8217;t have to work with them. You can fire the client. Or if you have a certain intake process where you know exactly the kind of people you want to work with, that&#8217;s the best part. That was the best part back when I had my studio of really picking and choosing the clients that you want to have, knowing that just because any work comes across your desk, you don&#8217;t have to take it if it doesn&#8217;t feel good.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the freedom. And that&#8217;s what I tell people is that I left Dell to have that freedom. And a lot of people think freelance comes with freedom. I say, there&#8217;s nothing free about freelancing at all. You have to decide, do I want this money or do I not want this money? And for us we&#8217;re not dollar driven. As long as we&#8217;re able to pay all of our team members and pay ourselves a salary that we have dedicated, that&#8217;s it. Anything extra&#8217;s great, and we really typically roll it into the business one way or the other, but I don&#8217;t want to have to say yes to every project and know that it&#8217;s bad work, but it&#8217;s paying the bills.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so I&#8217;m a firm believer that just like free work leads to more free work, same thing with bad work. Crap work leads to more crap work. And so if it&#8217;s not a right fit for us, the project&#8217;s not a right fit. If the timeline&#8230; That&#8217;s the biggest thing is some people just don&#8217;t understand the process and the timeline. And if they don&#8217;t want to adhere to our process and respect our process, that&#8217;s a big red flag. So exactly, being able to pick and choose who you work with is really the reward for owning the business. The rest of it&#8217;s still work. It doesn&#8217;t matter where you go, it&#8217;s work. It&#8217;s not called fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But the best thing you can do though, because you know it&#8217;s still work is at least shape your own ideal work conditions.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Exactly, exactly. And that&#8217;s the thing too like I said about what I learned about Dell is, I had a great creative director who taught us the work life balance. And I will say that Dell actually has a really good work life balance throughout the entire company. So never did I feel like I had to be&#8230; I was on the edge of burnout or anything like that. When it was weekends, no one called you. When it was holidays, no one called you. You didn&#8217;t get woken up in the middle of the night having to do this or that. So there was a really good work life balance. So I knew I did not want to take that away from myself. And I didn&#8217;t want to create an environment where my team felt that way. We offer 27 plus paid holidays to all of our team members. Doesn&#8217;t matter if they&#8217;re part-time or not. We just went through the holidays today or yesterday, they get two weeks off at the end of the year. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m paying them for two weeks?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But we want them, and that&#8217;s on top of their PTO too. They get two weeks PTO on top of the 27 holidays and for us, and then they still have the get it done model. So if they want to travel somewhere and work three days and then be off for two days, then they only use two days PTO. And so for us, we really just want them to have a reason to be with us. And that do good work motto is really what it&#8217;s all about is that we want them to do good work, but we have to do good work by them. And we have to treat them fairly. We have to give them a reasonable salary. I can&#8217;t compete with the Googles and the Apples and these people who are throwing stupid money at all these people.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I can&#8217;t compete with that. We&#8217;re a small business. But what I can say is I can give you a work life balance that&#8217;s fair, treat you like a human being. You&#8217;re going to speak with another human being who&#8217;s also a father, who&#8217;s also a husband, who&#8217;s also an educator, who&#8217;s going to understand what you&#8217;re going through, and we&#8217;re going to make a compromise. If you got to take some days off, let&#8217;s figure out what it&#8217;s going to work. If something&#8217;s got to be moved around, let&#8217;s figure out how to make it work, so that way you can be efficient and we can be efficient.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
With Studio Dzo, I mean, of course, clearly you&#8217;re doing a ton of great work, but you also do a lot of community work as well. And one organization that you work with is one that our listeners, I&#8217;m sure, know about. They&#8217;re probably members of it. And that&#8217;s AAGD, which is African American Graphic Designers. Tell me about that. How&#8217;d you get involved with them?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s funny. So [Owen Hammonds 01:00:55] had kind of twisted my arm. So I&#8217;m a designer, I&#8217;m not an artist. And I make that very, very clear. I don&#8217;t express myself through art or at least through design. I don&#8217;t. I doodle, I do some things to be creative, but I&#8217;m not an artist. But Owen kind of put me up to this challenge. They were doing a gallery thing at [St. Ed&#8217;s 01:01:16], and he kind of said, &#8220;Hey Russ, I want you to participate.&#8221; And like I said, he&#8217;s a mentor of mine, so anything he asked me to do, I&#8217;m going to say yes. So he was like, &#8220;This is a self-portrait gallery and you have to basically draw or create an image of yourself.&#8221; And it was like the worst project ever for me to have to do.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So in there, we&#8217;re presenting our work at the end and it&#8217;s a gallery opening and everything. And [Terrance Moline 01:01:42] was also part of that gallery. And so I hear him talking and he&#8217;s from New Orleans and he tells a little bit about his story and all that. I, like I said, I&#8217;m kind of a person who just says, I&#8217;m going to make this happen. I immediately looked at him and I was like, We&#8217;re going to be friends.&#8221; I&#8217;m going to make this man my friend. And so I introduced myself and he told me a little bit about AAGD, I think we followed each other on LinkedIn or on Facebook or something like that. And then we just kind of bumped into each other a little bit off and on. And I was really, really interested. And I think I pinged him a couple times about it and asked him about it.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
He had had the Facebook group for a couple years. I think 2006 is when he started it, maybe. Katrina forced him to move to Austin. So he had had it for a while, but it was just like a social thing. It was just a community based thing that was more about sharing the work. But he had visions of it being kind of a business model, but didn&#8217;t really know where it was going to go. So I guess probably 2019, he really started doubling down on it being a business model and creating more benefits for its members in exchange for a membership fee. And so pandemic hit early 2020, and I don&#8217;t know how we kicked off, but we just like, we hit the ground running. He was just like, &#8220;Hey, you&#8217;ve been really involved in AAGD like with me, I&#8217;d love for you to look over some of this stuff and just tell me what would you do?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And I had been involved in AIGA, quite a bit. I was the vice president. Owen Hammonds being the president at the time, too, when I was vice president. I had kind of understood like basically AAGD is kind of like a black AIGA. So I understood what was working for AIGA, also what wasn&#8217;t working for AIGA, and what I saw could be an opportunity for AAGD. So we just kind of like together just worked on how do we build this out to be a membership model. So another core member is [Dave McClinton 01:03:40]. And me and Dave met at that gallery too. And I looked at Dave and I was like, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to be friends,&#8221; too. So Dave got really involved. So it was just one of those things, like these two gentlemen that I met one night, and I said, &#8220;I want to be friends with them,&#8221; fast forward a couple years here we are we meet every Tuesday. We joke around. We hang out, and it&#8217;s just it&#8217;s an absolute honor to call these very, very talented, passionate creatives friends of mine.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But then meeting all the people through AAGD, that I&#8217;ve met, it&#8217;s just amazing. It started up with just the need to create community for himself because transplant from New Orleans to Austin, not finding the black community that he had New Orleans wanting to find those, he needed to find it online. Now to this international organization that the one thing that we have in common is that we&#8217;re all black in some varying degree and that we are all creatives. And the creativity spans from film, digital UX UI, all across the board. And just as a design educator and as a person with my experience, I am constantly sharing my knowledge about both the business of design and then also helping them empower them with the confidence to charge more or to get contracts or to understand this idea of freelancing sounds great, but you have to set goals or you&#8217;re just going to work yourself to death.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
You got to set a salary. You got to tell yourself this is how much money I want to make. And then divide that up by 12 and then divide that up by a day and figure out how much money you got to make every single day to make that salary. So a lot of people don&#8217;t understand that right off the bat when they&#8217;re like, &#8220;I want to be an entrepreneur.&#8221; And then unfortunately too, a lot of black creatives don&#8217;t see themselves in the work space. And so they think entrepreneurship is the only path for them, because they&#8217;ve never seen anybody like them at a major creative agency. And so, a lot of them have no understanding of the business of design, because they&#8217;ve never worked at a agency, they&#8217;ve only done it freelance, they&#8217;ve only done it their own way.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So I try to meet them where they&#8217;re at and share with them both my experience from Dell, but so my experience as a owner of Studio Dzo, and just try to tell them, if you are finding these challenges, these are some of the solutions. So AAGD has been a great endeavor of Terrance&#8217;s and I&#8217;m just honored to be trusted with some of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so kind of bring it back to education, we sort of alluded to this before we started of recording the interview, but you&#8217;ve talked about being a design educator. You also now teach at where you learned design, which was at Austin Community College, that you&#8217;ve kind of had this full circle moment. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Yeah. So really, again, I&#8217;m no stranger to anything. My whole life has just been like this one long story of, surely you&#8217;re going to be a designer, but I have always taught in some capacity. So while I was freelancing back in like 2005, I needed additional income because freelancing wasn&#8217;t doing it. And so I started working with an organization called No Kidding, Straight Talk from Teen Parents, which was funded by the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, which was a nonprofit organization that basically utilized the stories of teen parents to use a teaching tool for middle school and high school students. And so I technically didn&#8217;t fall under the category of teen parent. I was 20 years old when my daughter was born, but we had a very unique story. My daughter needed lots of medical care. And so my story was unique in the sense of as much as you thought you had everything planned, plan for the unexpected.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so I go to middle schools and high schools and give presentations and talk and that ended up putting me on national stage at the National Child Support Conference. So I&#8217;ve always had presentation and teaching opportunities. And then while I was in school to supplement my income, I used to teach defensive driving. So I tell people, if you can take a room people and for six hours and make them enjoy it, you could do anything. Because they don&#8217;t even want to be there. They bought tickets to a show they don&#8217;t even want to be at. But everything I do, I do 113%. That&#8217;s my motto. And so no matter teaching defensive driving or talking to young people, I just pour my heart into it, because I&#8217;m just kind of one of those people that just, I can&#8217;t half-ass anything.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
And so it was just only natural for me to see myself as a design educator, but really what it was, and I attribute this 100%, was Owen Hammonds. To see another black man teach and to be passionate and understanding at the same time, but also pull no punches and really give it to you straight and push people to be the best designer they can be. He gave me that vision of like, &#8220;I could do this.&#8221; And so I made it my goal after starting at Dell, I said, &#8220;In five years, I want to teach,&#8221; like that&#8217;s my next rung. And it only took me three years later after saying that, that I started teaching. So I started teaching in 2015, I think, 2015. I&#8217;m like, man, we&#8217;re going up on seven years now. I can&#8217;t bel-</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Man, we&#8217;re coming up on seven years now, and just I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s, yeah, 2015, I started teaching, and I started teaching Portfolio. I have been teaching Portfolio for seven years.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I started a new course because I was finding that my students had no knowledge, including myself. When I left school, when I graduated, I started at Dell, I never knew what a project manager did. I thought they were just like the pretty people who sold our designs. I didn&#8217;t know what they did.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Then when you get an amazing project manager who has your back and is that buffer between you and the client and really helps elevate your design and keeps you on track, but keeps them focused and not, &#8220;Oh, I want to see this. I want to see that.&#8221; When you have a really good project manager, it just changes your life as a designer. So at Dell, I had the whole kit and caboodle. I had great project managers, and I had terrible project managers at various times.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So I was finding that my students were getting into Portfolio, which is a capstone class. They graduate after my class with no knowledge that there were other roles other than designer and creative director. For some reason, they all know creative director, but they didn&#8217;t know like associate creative director, senior art director, art director, senior designer, junior designer, production designer. They didn&#8217;t know anything about those. Those roles didn&#8217;t even pop up in their heads.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So I had basically harassed my department chair that I&#8217;m, like, these students have no idea the various areas of design that they could find themselves in, and a lot of the project managers, the best project managers I ever worked with, all had degrees in design. They just didn&#8217;t have either the passion or the skills to hack it, but they understood design, which makes a really great project manager.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So along with Rachel Wyatt, colleague of mine, we wrote this course called Studio, Design Studio. Basically, it&#8217;s a simulation course where students come in, and they play the role of a project manager, or an art director, or senior designer or creative director, or something like that. They change roles throughout the course, but it gives them a real-life experience. Then they have three projects over the course of that semester, and all those clients are real clients so they have to deal with somebody not liking their work. It&#8217;s not about the grade. It&#8217;s about did you solve the problem? Did you meet your client&#8217;s expectations?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I remember the first time I taught that class was 2020. We wrote this course during the pandemic, and we delivered it in the fall of 2020. I had two teams. I have eight students, and I had two teams of four. One had their presentation buckled up, and it was right and tight, and they knocked their socks off. Then the other team, they just couldn&#8217;t get their shit together. They presented, and it was just falling apart and everything, and it was all over.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I meet with them, the teams, and I was like, &#8220;How are you feeling?&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Shit, this is an awful feeling.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Remember that.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Get your shit together, get it right and tight. When you&#8217;re presenting in front of a client, this is the opportunity for you to sell your design. This is everything. You&#8217;re building trust and all that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So this course is really doing what it&#8217;s designed to do is to give them that experience. That way, when they go out and get their first job at an agency or at a studio, these roles, these requirements, these things that they&#8217;re going to be asked of aren&#8217;t foreign to them that they&#8217;ve like, &#8220;Oh, I presented my work.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Because a lot of designers aren&#8217;t forced to present and sell their work. They just hand it to a project manager or to a creative director. They don&#8217;t actually get to engage with the client and be able to talk of about and articulate their design thinking. Instead, they&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Do you like it or do you not?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So I explained to my students like, &#8220;You have to be able to sell your work,&#8221; and so by the time they get to Portfolio, they&#8217;re able to talk about their work in a much better way because of that Studio class. Now we have Studio One and Studio Two, which just is kind of a repeat, but just more responsibility and more expectations.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do your students teach you?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Man, patience. But, honestly, like I tell them, I get paid to learn from them. They teach me more than I could ever teach them.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
What I&#8217;ve realized more than anything is that we often only see life through our own lenses, and you asked me how did I get started in design? Did I know about designing? I didn&#8217;t. To this day, I meet people in 2022, who they&#8217;re the first person in their family to pursue a creative career or got college degree, and so I meet so many people from so different backgrounds.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve had students as young as 19 and as old as 65, and what I&#8217;ve realized more than anything is that age, experience, life experience makes you a better designer. You can be these 30 under 30s, or these kids that are just like designing the heck out of stuff and are just killing it, and these young guns, and I think there&#8217;s like a whole young guns thing or whatever. I can appreciate that.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But if you just haven&#8217;t seen enough design solutions, if you just haven&#8217;t been around the world enough, no matter how talented you are with the software, you just can&#8217;t be a great design problem-solver without that time. You&#8217;ll get better every single day, but it&#8217;s the people who are older in that sweet spot of like their late 20s, early 30s, early 40s, new collars who are going back to school that I&#8217;m starting to find out they have just enough life experience, they&#8217;ve seen just enough shit to say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want it to be like that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But also I&#8217;ve learned quite a bit from them of just the resilience. I&#8217;ve had students who school was the only safe spot for them. When they went home, they had to deal with outside real-world problems, whether it be addiction, whether it be homelessness, whether it be a number of things and school was a place for them.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So it really taught me to kind of understand that we are all coming from different places, but we all have the same goal, and that is to be financially independent, hopefully, but to pursue a career in a very scary, scary realm where I tell my students, &#8220;You have the greatest job in the world. We get to create something that never existed, and we get to solve problems.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s scary to pick a career where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to do something where every single day I&#8217;m going to be judged, judged by people who have no education in this, judged by the masses.&#8221; That&#8217;s scary as hell, especially if you&#8217;re an artist who&#8217;s trying to pursue design.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I tell them what makes me feel comfortable as a designer and not an artist is that I can objectively defend all of my work and all of my design decisions. That&#8217;s kind of my security blanket is that as long as I know why we did this, as long as I know the problems that we&#8217;re solving, I can defend that all day long, but it&#8217;s the subjective. It&#8217;s the stuff that just because I like it, because it feels good, because it&#8217;s me, because of this stuff, that&#8217;s the stuff that&#8217;s hard because it&#8217;s just judgment, and you have to accept that somebody just doesn&#8217;t like it.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So I try to help them kind of create a bigger gap between those things and I said, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t want people judging your art, don&#8217;t put your art into your design.&#8221; Leave that for the special people that you choose to share that with, but use your design as a tool and do your problem-solving objectively. Then if you want to add a bit of your spice on it, do that, but understand that they may not like it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a word. That&#8217;s a word right there, that last part. I hope people caught that about if you don&#8217;t want to be judged for your&#8230; What&#8217;d you say? Say that again?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Judged for your art, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I mean, I think that&#8217;s the thing. I mean, I don&#8217;t know about you, but a lot of people get into design because someone told them that you&#8217;ll never make a career out of being an artist, and so they hear the word design and they think that. So I got a lot of artists in front of me every semester, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Separate your art from your design.&#8221; So that way you can be a better designer, and you don&#8217;t have to worry about changing who you are as an artist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Something that I think I realized kind of early on with my studio was that a lot of designers design for other designers. Like, they&#8217;re not necessarily designing for the client. They&#8217;re designing because they want to be featured on Brand New, or Under Consideration, or something. Like, they&#8217;re designing for awards. They&#8217;re designing for accolades for their peers when the client may hate it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like, I&#8217;ve seen, oh, God, I remember, especially in like the late 2000s, there was so much design that was just the client hated it, but I did blank doing these kind of wild out-of-the-box stuff. And yeah, if it&#8217;s not in service of the client and that&#8217;s what the actual thing was for, like, yeah, it is arts that you&#8217;re kind of trying to put out there and then you&#8217;re putting this design sheen over it in that sort of way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But that&#8217;s a word right there. When that clicked for me, that&#8217;s when like, honestly, the business and the work just became so much easier because it&#8217;s like just design for what the client is looking for. It may not look the best, but then that client is going to keep hiring you, and you&#8217;re going to keep getting paid, and your studio is going to stay in business so you kind of have to like&#8230; It&#8217;s a compromise in a way. I mean, I think once you get that relationship working, you can then sort of add a little something here and there, but it&#8217;s tricky. But that&#8217;s a real word right there about judging.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I mean, you hit it on the head. Designers, especially in school, start designing for the approval of their peers, and they want to get these awards. They want to get recognized in design community, and at what cost? At the cost of, like you said, the clients or the vision?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Sometimes if you&#8217;ve ever had to do something like wedding invitations, doing your own wedding invitations is the hardest damned thing. I went through like a whole existential mental breakdown designing my own wedding invitations because I started designing them, thinking about all my design friends that were going to be at the wedding, and what are they going to say when they get this in the mail, and you start really questioning yourself. I had to stop for a moment and just realize, &#8220;You&#8217;re designing it for you and your wife on this moment and this day. This is what you&#8217;re capturing. You&#8217;re not trying to get the approval of somebody else.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But you&#8217;re exactly right, and the problem with that is, is that if you forget who&#8217;s paying you. It&#8217;s not in that way of like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to do bad work because this person&#8217;s writing me a check,&#8221; is &#8220;Are you solving their problems?&#8221; If you&#8217;re not going to bat for them and you&#8217;re only going to bat for yourself, then it&#8217;s art, and you&#8217;re doing it only for you. It&#8217;s selfish, and you&#8217;re asking them to pay you to do something that makes you feel good at a disservice to them.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So, first and foremost, you have to serve. Like I tell people all the time, design is a service. Just like waiting tables, just like anything, we have a duty to serve them with the best solution possible, and sometimes it&#8217;s telling them that they shouldn&#8217;t have something.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I give the analogy, forgive me for the crude analogy, but it just works, I tell people if you owned a restaurant and someone came to you and said, &#8220;I want a shit sandwich,&#8221; you wouldn&#8217;t serve them a shit sandwich. Not because you don&#8217;t make shit sandwiches. It&#8217;s because that if they ate a shit sandwich and you know it&#8217;s going to taste bad, they&#8217;re going to tell all their friends that you served them a shit sandwich and what people won&#8217;t know is that they asked for that.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So the same thing goes with design is that if your client ask you for something that you know isn&#8217;t going to solve the problem, but you just give it to them, they&#8217;re going to blame you for when that problem still is there, and you just took their money. Where if you sit down with them and you say, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s go back real quick. Are you hungry?&#8221; And they go, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; &#8220;Well, we serve a lot of other things. Have you tried this?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So I try to always reiterate to my students and my team and to anybody that we, as designers, have a duty to serve our clients, first and foremost, and to solve their problems. Sometimes that means pushing back on them and some of the design decisions that they want, and then sometimes it&#8217;s swallowing our own pride and realizing maybe this isn&#8217;t what we want it to be, but it still does solve the problem and in a different way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look at where you&#8217;re at now in life with the studio and everything, is this how you imagine your life would look like when you were a kid?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
No, it&#8217;s way better. I am making 13, 14, 15-year-old Russell just, I mean, I&#8217;m just killing it. Like, 13-year-old Russell is like, &#8220;Dude, who are you? Who are you?&#8221; And I never would&#8217;ve saw this life for myself because I never saw it, to be honest. We grew up in a middle class-ish household, played with financial illiteracy and a lot of things that unfortunate that I never saw anybody doing the things that I do, living the life that I live so I couldn&#8217;t even have imagined it.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So to look at where I&#8217;m at now&#8230; My nephew, today is his 13th birthday.I called him up and I said, &#8220;You remember what I told you when you were little, I said what happens when you turn 13?&#8221; And he goes, &#8220;I get to go to Disney World?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;You remember that?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yeah. You think I was just bullshitting?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;You know what I mean when you can talk about it, you can be about it.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yeah. It&#8217;s still pandemic right now so we got to figure out a date when we all feel comfortable.&#8221; I said, &#8220;But, yeah, you&#8217;re going to Disney World.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
The fact that I can do that for my nephew and the fact that I can take my daughter and my wife and&#8230; We just went to Hawaii, and I took my whole family, 10 of us to Hawaii, and me and my wife, we were very appreciative of all the work that we have done and all the support of our family to be able to do this for them. The life that I live now and the team that I have and the work that I&#8217;ve done and the amazing people that I&#8217;ve met and the opportunity to teach and the opportunity to get up every day and create something new, I could have never imagined it, and I am so very thankful.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I honestly attribute it all to design. Design, literally, saved my life and made my life. Like I said in the very beginning, going to school at ACC, literally, was the best decision I ever made. It set the trajectory of my life and set so many things in motion that, had I&#8217;d never gone to ACC, had I&#8217;ve not had the people in front of me and had the mentors and the educators in front of me, I would&#8217;ve never gotten to where I&#8217;m at now. So yes, in short, no, I would&#8217;ve never been able to imagine this life and, yes, design, I give all of it to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing either through the studio, or personally, or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I mean, I don&#8217;t want to work, but I have plans and, hopefully&#8230; I love teaching. I really do. I think that I&#8217;m a natural educator and a sharer of information and experience, and so I hope to continue teaching on a wider scale.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
I mentor a few people now, and I&#8217;ve toyed around with the idea of professionally mentoring and offering those services on a regular basis. Right now, my mentees, I feel weird taking money from them so they just pay for my coffee. So I&#8217;m like, now it&#8217;s pandemic so they just send me&#8230; they&#8217;ve been owing me money for coffee.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
But I think that I have a lot to share with young professionals and budding entrepreneurs. I mean, designers, I think that through a longer relationship, a mentor relationship that I can help really guide people who might feel like they haven&#8217;t received the education and knowledge of the business of design and where to go and how to capitalize on opportunities.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Then with the studio, as we were kind of talking about this kind of international work model, me and my wife have goals of finding a place that&#8217;s a little less tumultuous for people of color. Where that place is on earth, I&#8217;m not quite sure. I don&#8217;t think we found Wakanda yet, but we don&#8217;t know if the United States is necessarily our forever home. But our goal would be to really take our business global, honestly, so wherever we end up being, creating a team there, a local team there that would continue to do the work that we are doing and then have our current Studio Dzo team basically lead that team.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
So that would be less of a requirement of me and Elizabeth on our day-to-day, and then take this very seasoned team that has been with us for five years and turn them into leaders to guide maybe this international team to create the good work that we&#8217;ve been known to do. So that&#8217;s where I hope to see ourselves in five years is where I have five or six other people somewhere else in the world who Zoom in with my team here, and we&#8217;re just cranking out the same good work, both night and day. One team&#8217;s working while the other one&#8217;s sleeping.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about the studio, about your work? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Well, you can always find us at studiodzo.com. That&#8217;s studio, D as in dog, Z as in zebra, O as in Oscar, the D is silent, and you can find us on Instagram, studiodzo.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
You can follow me on Instagram, Russell Toynes, that&#8217;s Russell, two SSs and two Ls, never trust a one L Russell, and you can follow me on LinkedIn.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Please, please, please check out aagd.co and see all the good work that we&#8217;re doing for our community there.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Check out Austin Community College also. I know community colleges get a bad rap, but I have personally hired more designers from ACC than any other school from UT, from Texas State, from St. Ed&#8217;s. ACC, hands down, has a better design program and the designers come out stronger. So if you&#8217;re curious about that, if you&#8217;re looking to change careers, ACC might be an opportunity for anybody who&#8217;s local to the Austin area.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Yeah, Russell Toynes, T-O-Y-N-E-S. There&#8217;s only a few of us out there. So if you just Google that last name, you&#8217;ll be sure to find me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Well, Russell Toynes, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I mean, I&#8217;ve heard of you for years. I probably didn&#8217;t mention that before we started recording, but I&#8217;ve heard about you for years, just like you were saying, my name has been kind of bandied about in the design community. I&#8217;ve heard about you for years. I was really excited to do this interview and really just kind of hearing your story, hearing your passion for design, and really even just your passion for just giving back to the community that has given so much to you is just super inspiring.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I hope people, when they listen to this, they really can kind of feel where your passion comes from with this, and also see how they can maybe pay it forward in their own communities as well. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Russell Toynes:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate it, Maurice.</p>
