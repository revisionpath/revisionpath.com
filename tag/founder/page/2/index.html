Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
Kevin Carroll, author, speaker, instigator of inspiration. I get an opportunity to spend time with co-conspirators and storytelling, creativity, innovation, human performance, and advancing the human condition in a good and positive way. So I get a chance to do that on a regular.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds like a dream job.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s necessarily, you know, it&#8217;s so funny, one of the things that I tell folks is I don&#8217;t really have a job per se. I&#8217;m kind of like Tommy from Martin Lawrence&#8217;s show. So my friends always say, what do you do, what do you do? Because like you&#8217;re always here and there and there. And so, I think I just have discovered that folks see a talent or a gift or skill that I might have that would lend itself to a project or an idea or something that they&#8217;re trying to advance.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t really see myself as having a job in a traditional sense, a J-O-B. I really do think that I have this career portfolio, I actually was reading an article about that, why you should build a career portfolio, not a career path. And so I think I have a series of experiences. So I have more of a portfolio than a career path.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2022 been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
Surprise and delight and expect the unexpected, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s been happening so far this year already. I&#8217;ve been really blessed and count my blessings. We&#8217;ve stayed healthy this entire time. I think that&#8217;s allowed me to double down on optimism and positivity and to put out in the world some good energy. And that good energy is being reciprocated and reflected back. It&#8217;s been really wonderful some of the different projects that I&#8217;ve been invited to be a part of, find opportunities, to do a little bit of travel already.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
So, some really fun locations. I was at the University of Oklahoma recently where I did some work with students on campus, but also student athletes on the campus there, and also in the community of Norman, Oklahoma. So that was really exciting. And then I literally just got back from an event where I spoke to 5,000 people, a live event, and that&#8217;s the first time a large group like that has been together was in DC.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
And I was telling a friend that I got a chance to see the African American Museum, the National African American Museum of Art. I had not seen it like sitting on the, as you drive by it. Most of the buildings, if you&#8217;ve ever been in DC, Maurice, I don&#8217;t know if you spent much time there, most of the buildings are white. And here&#8217;s this building that&#8217;s this beautiful bronze brown, and it just stands out, and it feels so warm and inviting. And so, I got to see that yesterday, actually, I got there on Sunday and we were driving through and it was a sunny and it just stood out, and I was so inspired to see that.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
That event with 5,000 people was actually in DC. So, I think that was a great sign for me to realize that wonderful things are coming this year and that&#8217;s a great source of inspiration to see a building like that and to think about all the voices and actions and impact that black and brown folks have been making, and I want to join forces with that. So that&#8217;s my goal, is to keep advancing that kind of intention that you would find in a building like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. It&#8217;s definitely great to come across that sort of realization like that, especially during Black History Month.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
Yeah. Right? It fell right on the last two days of Black History Month, so it was great timing to see that building. It wasn&#8217;t something that I was unaware of, I was paying attention to that. I also talked about the importance of being where your feet are and being present. I think that&#8217;s what a lot of folks don&#8217;t do a great job of is being present, so that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s really been helpful for me is being present.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I guess given that, what do you want to achieve this year? Did that kind of put like an idea in your head about what you want to do?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t ever really have like a I want to grow my business X percent or I want to, I don&#8217;t have those kinds of metric measurable per se. My whole thing is just at the end of the year, can I reflect back and see that I advanced the human condition in a positive way, and I had in some way that really will reverberate. That&#8217;s a thing that I always look at is like, what were some of the moments, what were some of the things? And so, I just want to continue to do that.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
A big thing for me is I&#8217;m chasing significance, not success. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m chasing> success is attainable and you can have a measure of success at any age, quite frankly, but significance takes time, and that&#8217;s the long game, and that&#8217;s the collective measure of all the impact that you&#8217;ve had. And so, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m pursuing. This year is just another part of that mosaic, of that journey and chase to significance.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;re doing so many things, as you mentioned, at the top of the show. You&#8217;re an author, you&#8217;re a speaker, you&#8217;re an instigator of inspiration. And I&#8217;m curious, what does an average day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
Probably not an average day. It can vary. There&#8217;s always some structure to what I&#8217;m trying to accomplish each day, and I do like to make sure that I feel inspired at some point. I&#8217;m always looking for opportunities to connect with folks. I have a very curious spirit about me. I think a typical or average day can be captured in this quote by Albert Einstein, &#8220;I have no special talents, I&#8217;m only passionately curious.&#8221; So I like to be passionately curious each day.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
And so, whatever that unfolds or brings my way, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m about. So it could be doing three virtual keynotes because we can do that now. [inaudible 00:08:20] necessarily got to get on a plane, to working on a collaboration with a sports program or sports team or university, or doing some reverse mentoring with my godson, where he actually teaches me art or Legos or something, and I&#8217;m learning from him, and he&#8217;s nine years old and he&#8217;s brilliant. I enjoy doing that. I just think that every day that&#8217;s my end goal is, was I passionately curious today or not?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I definitely think that the way that these past few years have been, in many ways, it&#8217;s opened up a lot of different avenues for people to try different things, to just pursue different types of work and stuff like that. I like that idea of just being curious and kind of seeing where things go. For me, at least I can&#8217;t say it for the listener maybe, but for myself, that feels super aspirational to be able to have that kind of freedom to do that. You&#8217;ve been doing it since 2004. What&#8217;s been the key to your longevity with this?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s relationship building. And my attitude is, if you shine, I shine, and I don&#8217;t want to be transactional with you, I want to be transformational with you. And so, that means we&#8217;re building something, we&#8217;re building something. And you&#8217;re in the business of seeing what you can get from me and you want to be transactional. We probably won&#8217;t build together. But if you&#8217;re about building a relationship and connecting on a deeper level that I can help you shine and in turn, it&#8217;s going to reflect back and maybe not right away, it could be five, 10 years from then. But that&#8217;s all good, and that&#8217;s all love, and that&#8217;s the way that I&#8217;ve looked at it.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
So relationships have been really, really key and critical, because what I&#8217;ve discovered, and I think it&#8217;s one of those really wonderful, unexpected things, is I&#8217;ve been meeting people. When you think about all the public speaking that I&#8217;ve done, I&#8217;ve done public speaking since early 90s, I&#8217;ve been doing that. &#8220;Formally,&#8221; I&#8217;ve been doing it since 2002, but I&#8217;ve been meeting young people, meeting individuals where they are for decades.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
Those individuals have grown up and guess who they remember put them on back in the day? Me. So now they&#8217;re in positions of influence and decision makers, and I get these notes on LinkedIn, Twitter, DMs on Instagram, hey, you might not remember me, KC, but you spoke at my school. My mom got you to sign this book. I happened to be at this conference. And now I&#8217;m with this company, this business, I&#8217;m doing this, I&#8217;ve started mine. And I thought of you when this idea came up, when this project came up, when this conference came up, and I immediately put your name for it. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s been happening for 18 years.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s been gaining more momentum, which has been really magical when you think about it. But I didn&#8217;t plan it that way. It&#8217;s just been organic the way it&#8217;s all played out. My wife always points out, she said, &#8220;You put all those seeds out there not knowing that they would grow into oaks.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Just to kind of, I guess, peel the curtain back a little bit, you asked me before we started recording, what&#8217;s your end game with this, this of course being Revision Path and this podcast. And the way that you just expressed that I think maybe ties into what I guess I could see the end goal of Revision Path being, in that there&#8217;s all these stories about black designers and developers and creatives and such that people can learn about. And to me, my hope is that this helps inform as many people as possible, we&#8217;re out here, we&#8217;re a creative force, we&#8217;re doing this work, in terms of planting those seeds as you mentioned.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
You know what else, you&#8217;re creating a time capsule, you&#8217;re creating a time capsule that&#8217;s going to be a way finder for the next generation. So you need to realize that. I know we talked about you creating some kind of other creative effort off of this. You know exactly what I just said, I know you wrote it down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I did.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
I know you did, because look, we did our little prep call, convo before this, our warmup, and this just came to me. This is a time capsule. And imagine if you&#8217;re a young person trying to find your way and we can only envision ourselves in a position if we see ourselves there, well, they get to hear ourselves, they get to hear these voices. So you&#8217;re creating this audio time capsule. Come on, man. That&#8217;s fire. That&#8217;s fire. I&#8217;m telling you, first one&#8217;s free, Maurice, first one&#8217;s free right there. There you go. Receive that bro. Receive that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Before striking out on your own and doing your own thing, I think people probably know you well from your work that you&#8217;ve done at Nike because it sounds like it was a very, very unique experience for you. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
Yeah, you had a couple other guests on here that are Nike alums, Jeff Henderson and Kevin Bethune, those are two of my partners in crime and positivity. So they&#8217;re good brothers and we&#8217;ve done some fun projects together. My time at Nike, I always reference it in this way that Nike let me fly my freak flag. Nike let me really stretch my wings creatively and to discover things about myself that I didn&#8217;t know or that were lying dormant because of other experiences, and I didn&#8217;t get encouraged to express it. And Nike gave me permission.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
And in doing so, unlocked a lot of my creative energy and my creative confidence. And so, I think that&#8217;s been something I&#8217;ll always be grateful for at Nike. I think I reciprocated with creating a more sense of belonging and connection there at Nike and Nike at large, at the other locations around world. And so yeah, I got an opportunity to do lots of different projects and work in lots of different areas from footwear design to special projects with Tinker Hatfield and his group to being a director of internal communications, working there.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
So Nike really gave me an opportunity to tap into a lot of my gifts and talents, and they saw value in allowing someone to have all these experiences. And remember I said, I don&#8217;t think I have a career path, I have a career portfolio. Nike was a place that let me put more arrows in my quiver of that portfolio, if you will, of that career experiences. And so, yeah, I&#8217;ve always felt that Nike was this amazing living lab for me that I got a chance to do and try lots of different things and discover a lot of things about myself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember listening to an interview where you were talking about how Phil Knight, who is the, I think he still is or maybe he was, the CEO of Nike, but he kind of referred to you as the mayor of Nike.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. He&#8217;s retired now but he was the co-founder, CEO and chairman at the time when I was there, 97 to 2004. He caught wind of some of the creative capers I was doing on campus and the impact I was having. And so, he asked me to have a regular meeting with him monthly and to discuss with me the people and the culture and how things were going there. He kind of coined that term for me, said, I might be CEO and chairman here, but you&#8217;re the mayor here and you know this place.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
So, I would give him information and share how people were feeling, what was going on, and being that bridge for him, being an executive, you&#8217;re not necessarily privy to that. So I was giving him that insight and visibility to how the people were feeling, what was going on, and opportunities for him to continue to further advance the culture in a positive way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to switch gears here a little bit. As I mentioned to you before I listened to some interviews and things, you really talk a lot about how like your personal story can be a catalyst for someone else to kind of chase their dreams. So I want to dive a little bit into your personal story. Tell me about what it was like growing up in Philly.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
Listen, Philly&#8217;s grimy. I love Philly that way. And we take a lot of pride in that with our city and everything. My childhood was challenging because of circumstances that we were navigating as kids, me and my two brothers. And so, addiction and abandonment, upheaval and uncertainty, dysfunction and disappointment were the norm because my parents were addicts and my grandparents rescued us.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
The thing that I think my grandparents, maybe not necessarily realizing it but because of their age, we had a lot of freedom as kids to make a lot of decisions that probably shouldn&#8217;t be making when you&#8217;re a kid, but we out of necessity and just they couldn&#8217;t keep up with us that way. So, we had a lot of freedom. And so, I discovered a playground in my neighborhood first that was kind of the epicenter of our neighborhood, but it was this place where I felt I belonged first.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
And so sports was a big thing in our neighborhood and I realized that very quickly. And so I dove head long into sports and played every sport you could imagine, whatever the season I was playing it. But it was never for trophies or first place or medals, it was always for belonging. I loved being part of a team and connecting and being a part of that.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
That was I think an unlock for me was being part of a team and finding a place to belong. And it was a positive way for me to channel a lot of the questions I was having as a kid because of the decisions my parents made. And so, sports really was a great outlet and a great coping tool for me to manage that. And then public library was another great place, I loved learning and reading. So I went to the public library a lot.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
And then my best friend&#8217;s mom became my mom in many ways, Ms. Lane. And so she poured into me as much wisdom as possible every day. I had a key to their house since I was nine, still have that key to their house. Ms. Lane was the cheat code, if you will, for me. She gave me all of the different ways to unlock possibilities and potential. I always say it was just two words that she would speak to me, why not. And she would always answer any of my, like Ms. Lane, Ms. Lane, I got this idea. She&#8217;d always say, well, why not? But then she&#8217;d always follow up with, don&#8217;t talk about it, be about it. Lots of talkers and very few doers, which one are you? So I learned about action And accountability from her.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
But also someone who was unconditional in their love and just hoped for me to be successful. And Ms. Lane was the person who poured that significance idea into me, that you are going to be successful because you&#8217;ve got intellect and smarts, but I want you to chase something bigger and grander, I want you to chase significance. So that&#8217;s where that all stems from.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
So that childhood started off difficult, but I found a way to rise above it and didn&#8217;t do it alone. I think that was one of the key things for me was when I talk about relationships earlier, that&#8217;s where I learned relationships and the importance of them. And it served me well all the way through me being on my own now for 18 years. Relationships stem all the way back to my childhood.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It takes a village. Like you said, you were staying with your grandparents and then you had Ms. Lane, you had your sports teams that you were a part of. So you had all of these different influences as you were growing up.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
And these crazy people at the playground, because playgrounds, they got some colorful folks that are up there. I tell people, I&#8217;m a mosaic of many people, drug dealers, abusers, and war veterans, and ain&#8217;t quite right folks in the head folks. Just all kinds of people were there, other kids&#8217; parents, food service workers, custodians, they all poured into me. And my brothers. I know that I&#8217;m a mosaic of many people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, after you graduated high school, you went on to college, and then after college you went into the military, you went into the air force. What was behind that decision?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
I became a young dad. So, I didn&#8217;t even finish college, I was in my junior year, became a young father, I was 20 years old. And I came home and my grandfather said, &#8220;So what are you going to do about this?&#8221; He said, &#8220;You need to do the right thing.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;You need to not repeat history and be an absent father.&#8221; And so that was a loud message from my grandfather. And so these are his sensibilities.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
So I made a decision to join the air force, not go back to college. I figured I could finish it while I&#8217;m in the air force, but I wanted to provide for my family. So I went in the military, my uncle was in the air force, so that&#8217;s why I chose the air force. I told people, they said, why&#8217;d you pick the air force? I said, my uncle always was smiling, so I figured he must be enjoying it. So, that&#8217;s why I picked the air force over any other branch. And joined the air force.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
That was first time I ever been on an airplane was going to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. And landed in Texas and had no idea that I would end up really enjoying the air force and learning so much about myself and discovering I had other gifts and talents that had not been discovered yet. I had a language ability in the military discovered that and ended up becoming a language translator in the military and working with a top seeker clearance and doing all this clandestine work, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, kind of crazy stuff. So I speak a bunch of languages, and did that in the military.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
And once again, more relationships, I&#8217;m still connected to a lot of people that I met when I was in the air force from 1980 to 1990. So 10 years I was in there, I&#8217;m still connected to a lot of those people too. So, we go back to that, what&#8217;s that through line for me is relationships and the importance of it and not being transactional with people being transformational.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t want to gloss over the language part because I think that&#8217;s something which is super interesting because when you were in school, you had started to learn Spanish, but you dropped out, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
Yeah, I dropped Spanish actually. It was five minutes. It was an amazing five minutes, Maurice. I thought it was a silly class, so I walked out of class, but the funny thing is I never forgot that five minutes. [Spanish 00:23:32], literally that stuck. I was a bit of a knucklehead and young, and I didn&#8217;t realize I had a gift then. And the military, they test you and it&#8217;s smart, they test you in everything just in case you have a talent that hasn&#8217;t been discovered. And lo and behold, I passed this language test in the military in basic training. And that&#8217;s how I got uncovered.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
And so, I end up learning Serbian and Croatian Czech and German and become fluent in those and do that work in the military. But yeah, that&#8217;s how it ended up happening. But I can always reflect back to the fact that I actually always had it in me, I was just a bit of a hard head back in the day. So yeah, had I hung in there, I&#8217;d have Spanish in my repertoire. I&#8217;m sure if I put some time to it, I can learn that too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think if you know German, German&#8217;s a romantic language. I think Spanish might be not a total one to one, but I feel like you probably could pick up Spanish pretty well if you know German.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
They&#8217;re in that family. Germanic is a little harsher than Spanish. Germans, you wouldn&#8217;t necessarily equate that like romance language, it&#8217;s a little harsh, a little strong. What I&#8217;ve discovered is once you learn a language, you are what I say language curious, if you will. So you&#8217;re just open to hearing what people are saying and how they&#8217;re using their words and what does that word mean. I use Google Translate all the time. I really am fascinated with what was that language and what was that I heard.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s the thing that really helps you. And a lot of folks that are American aren&#8217;t learning other languages. And I think that&#8217;s a big misstep here in the US, because you go to other countries and people are fluent in other languages because they&#8217;re just open to that, and they&#8217;re also raised that way. So I just think it&#8217;s so important. You&#8217;re not going to learn a language only taking the class twice a week for 50 minutes though. It&#8217;s not going to happen. That ain&#8217;t working.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
Oh yeah, I took Spanish in high school. Yeah, how often did you yeah, oh, twice a week for 50 minutes, I said, how much do you remember nothing? Nothing. Yeah, because you got to be immersed in it. So I think that&#8217;s the other thing too is you have to be curious about it and want to keep learning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
French was my language. My mom had, French is her first language. But she also studied French and stuff in school and everything. And so I remember being a kid, she&#8217;s a retired biologist, but she had all her college level French books at home. So, I started learning French in second grade, and then basically learned it from second grade all the way up until I graduated college.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
You were around it all the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
Practice it. See that&#8217;s the problem is that if you don&#8217;t have a way of actually exercising and using the muscle and using the words to gain confidence, that&#8217;s why people fall off from their language learning. So you had a built in tutor, you had something there, you were immersed in it, you probably had either magazines or periodicals or different things you could read in French, all that stuff that immerses you, that&#8217;s what happened in language school in the military, it&#8217;s like you are fully immersed. I can sing Roll out the Barrels in Czech and all these other things.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
We&#8217;d get dressed in cultural clothing and different things, so you really understood what it was you were learning. So full immersion is the key. That definitely had the right kind of environment to get really fluent in that language.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s so interesting when you kind of say it that way, especially about the Spanish part, because when I got to middle school, seventh grade, I wanted to take Spanish so bad. It was the first language elective that had filled up super quickly, because I was like, I didn&#8217;t want to take French because I already knew French, and I felt it wouldn&#8217;t have been fair for me to take French when I already knew it. Everyone else was learning it and I would be like, yeah, yeah, yeah, [French 00:27:51], whatever. I would already know it. I was doing good in French, I ended up taking French, but I did want to take Spanish.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can kind of understand a bit of Spanish now, but I mean, even with French, I can listen to French music, I can read French books. I can understand it. It does, like you say, knowing another language does kind of make you language curious and opens you up to just more culture I think.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
More culture, which is never a bad thing. The world is flat now, we have access to everything from everywhere. You do yourself at a disservice if you&#8217;re not curious around these opportunities and things to broaden your viewpoint and outlook on everything. I&#8217;m so glad that you have languages in your life. Maybe that&#8217;ll be the takeaway from our conversation is get some language in your life. Foreign language, not just English language, foreign language.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You had 10 years in the air force. After you left there, what was your next step? What were you thinking about doing?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
I got my degree while I was in the service. Got a certification as an athletic trainer, I was actually working some NFL summer training camps when I was in the military, did armed forces sports program. I was actually the only certified athletic trainer in any branch of the service, so I got a chance to travel in support of armed forces of sports program around the world while I was still in the service. So I decided I was going to do athletic training when I got out of the service.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
So I left after 10 years, moved back to Philadelphia, actually was a single dad then, so raising my boys. And started working in high school as an athletic trainer and a health teacher. Then I got a job at college level as an athletic trainer. And then I ended up in the NBA as only the first black trainer in the history of the NBA for the Philadelphia 76ers, and the third in the history of the NBA. In 1995. And did that for two years.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
That was the springboard. And my languages were the springboard to me actually getting noticed by Nike. So when I was with the 76ers, I actually got encouraged to use Serbian in the middle of a game to insult a player from the former Yugoslavia, [inaudible 00:30:19]. My coach told me to start saying something about his family when he&#8217;d run by because he wouldn&#8217;t expect it from our bench and distract him a little bit to save a time out. Literally that&#8217;s what my coach asked me to do.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
So I start cussing at this dude every time he runs by and he&#8217;s seven feet tall. So I&#8217;m mumbling, whispering stuff every time he goes by our bench, and he can&#8217;t figure out where it&#8217;s coming from. So when he turns in the middle of the game and says, who&#8217;s insulting my family in Serbian over here, and the coach points at me goes that little guy right there. And Vlad is like, there&#8217;s no way. And I [Serbian 00:30:54], and he&#8217;s like what? And after the game, he came and approached me, and you&#8217;re going to love this because you&#8217;re based in Atlanta, he asked me to join the Yugoslavian National Basketball team for the 96 Olympic games in Atlanta.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
And so, I joined them as the sports medicine liaison and their translator.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
Black dude from Philly working with the Yugoslavian national basketball team. I got this crazy old school Polaroid picture of all of us. I&#8217;m the only raisin in the milk, I&#8217;m the only raisin in the milk. So it&#8217;s this really great candid picture of all us from a Polaroid from that moment when we were doing the pre-Olympic tour. That&#8217;s how folks at Nike actually found out about me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Languages really did unlock something for you. I mean, of course you kind of had the interest in sports, so, being an athletic trainer I&#8217;m sure it kind of was almost like a fulfillment of a wish that you kind of had as a kid, I would imagine.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s so funny, I thought I was going to be in the NBA as all kids play sports, I&#8217;m going to be in the league one day, as a player I&#8217;m thinking. I didn&#8217;t think that my intellect and my ability to learn and then the understanding of games and then learning the science behind injuries and all that would actually propel me to that position.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
So when I actually got to the NBA, I paused and really thought about like, whoa, I never thought it would be like this, but I made it to the league. How about that? And then of course, them haters from back in the day that told me it wasn&#8217;t going to happen, as soon as I got that gig, guess who was calling for tickets, Maurice? Yo Kev, hook us up with some tickets. Nah, remember that thing you said back in the day. I remember. I kept the receipts. No tickets for you, no tickets for you, no tickets for you. So yes. But I ended up getting to the NBA, which was a roundabout crazy way, unexpected way, but yeah, made it to the league.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, man. Then like you said, that sort of opened you up to end up doing work for Nike and you started your own business. You&#8217;ve lived like four lives. With all these different careers and the way that they&#8217;ve all intersected, that&#8217;s fascinating.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
It doesn&#8217;t make sense now when I say that it&#8217;s not a path, it&#8217;s a portfolio.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When did you decide to start writing?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
So, Ms. Lane, my best friend&#8217;s mom who&#8217;s like my mom, she was the one who kept bugging me. When I got to Nike, she kept saying, when are you going to write a book? When are you going to write a book? And I would always push back, Ms. Lane, [inaudible 00:33:37] for? And she was persistent. I want to say for at least five years, she kept bugging me, bugging me, bugging me about it.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
And then finally I said, &#8220;Ms. Lane, who&#8217;s going to read it?&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s another you out there that needs to know it&#8217;s possible. That&#8217;s who you should write it for.&#8221; Bet. That was the moment I went, okay, bet, I&#8217;ll do it. But then I went, I don&#8217;t want it to be like a regular book so I&#8217;m going to use all this creative energy I&#8217;ve learned at Nike and all these things, I&#8217;m going to create this proposal that&#8217;s going to be so amazing that they&#8217;re just going to clamor for this book.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
And I put together this proposal that was unique and different, crickets. Nobody wanted do it. Rejection. In fact, one publisher said it was over-designed and too creative. And actually told me to dumb down my idea, and maybe they&#8217;ll consider doing my book. And then I made a decision I&#8217;m going to self-publish it.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
So I started the process of self-publishing it in 2003. We got it done by 2004. And it took off, we sold 11,000 copies in nine months. I didn&#8217;t realize that was determined to be a successful book because in the industry, if you sell more than 8,000, which is basically getting beyond your friends and family, that&#8217;s a successful book. We had done that with just word of mouth, no back table sales. I wasn&#8217;t pitching it on stage or anything.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
And someone at ESPN happened to get a copy of my book and they were starting a books division. And I got a call out of the blue from ESPN, they wanted to sign me to a book deal. And I was still at Nike when all that happened. And so, I signed a book deal with ESPN and Disney while I&#8217;m at Nike, and that really starts this great opportunity to write more books and everything.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
But Ms. Lane was the person behind the decision to write a book, well, the indecision, but lovingly shoved me towards my destiny kind of moment and stuff. But I&#8217;d always loved books. The public library was always a really special place for me as a kid, so I&#8217;d always loved books. And I&#8217;m always surrounded by books. But I never envisioned myself being an author. That was never anything I imagined or thought of even in my quiet time. Now that I&#8217;ve done four books, I&#8217;m quite proud of them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love that you self-published first, and then the success from that is what sort of ended up having publishers kind of coming to you for are doing more books. I love that part.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
Yeah. And I think that sometimes you have to know what you&#8217;re writing it for, what&#8217;s the end game, let&#8217;s go back to that, right? What&#8217;s the end game. And when she basically said, well, there&#8217;s another you out there that needs to know it&#8217;s possible, oh, okay, bet, I&#8217;m going to do it then.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
So until you kind of have that in mind who you are doing it for, and then we just talked about this time capsule, I know for you you can see someone opening up this time capsule, if you will, figuratively and literally, with all of these gifts and they&#8217;re unearthing these voices and these stories. That&#8217;s the spark for you then, that&#8217;s catalytic. And so, she was that catalyst for me to share a story. Then I made kind of that like, well, I&#8217;m not going to do a regular book. Having that attitude.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
That decision actually was so interesting with the book it won over 23 design awards, my book did. Working with a great design team and then working with a great print team that did the self-published piece, and ESPN didn&#8217;t change anything in the design when they signed me to the book deal, they just put their logo on it and that was it. And so, that book&#8217;s been in print with them since 2005 and still in print, and I think there&#8217;s over 400,000 in print now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Katalytic with a K.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
Yes. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now the metaphor of the red rubber ball comes up a lot in your books. Of course people can sort of check out the books and know what that&#8217;s about because you literally have one book called what is your red rubber ball. How would you suggest that listeners out there find their own red rubber ball?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
So, it&#8217;s a metaphor, the red rubber ball, it&#8217;s literal for me because of sports and play, and the playground being the first place that I felt a sense of belonging and connection. But for most people, it&#8217;s more about the metaphor. What are you chasing? What gets you out of bed in the morning? What inspires you to go after it? And so, I think that&#8217;s a fundamental question. You need to know what inspires you to get out of bed every single morning. You have to have something.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
And that became even more evident during this pandemic, because this global traumatic event broke a lot of people who didn&#8217;t have that clarity of purpose and passion and intention, and they felt lost. It derailed a lot of people. It broke a lot of people. And then there were some people who had this discovery moment, and they doubled down on the thing that they cared about, and they learned more during this pause.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
And so I just think that the red rubber ball is about what are you chasing. What inspires you to get out of bed in the morning and that you want to chase it every single day? And then if you can be blessed and fortunate enough to find a way to blur your passion and your play, that&#8217;s great. Maybe you don&#8217;t necessarily, your work isn&#8217;t your play, but you can always know that this is something I&#8217;m chasing, this is something that inspires me and I want to keep that close. That&#8217;s the red rubber ball.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at your career and all of your life experiences that you&#8217;ve had, is this how you imagined yourself as a kid?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
Never, never. I never imagined myself like this, honestly. When I first went to college, after high school, when I went to college, here was my job career idea. I was going to be in public relations in a bank. How random is that, dude? How random is that? But Maurice, this is how this got in my head. So, when I would ride the trolley, the trains in Philly and out on the main line, I would always see these men just dress sharp with briefcase. And so, I envisioned in my head, oh, they must work in a bank because I always see people dressed nice going in the bank. So, maybe they&#8217;re in there doing, I don&#8217;t know, public relations. I don&#8217;t know where I got that idea of public relations. So I said, I want to do that.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
So when I went to college and people would ask me, so, what do you hope to accomplish? Oh, I want to work in public relations in a bank. I would spit that so fast, public relations in a bank. And people would always look at me curiously like, well, that&#8217;s very clear what you want to do. I was about them fits. I loved how cool they looked and clean and [inaudible 00:41:04], briefcase. And I obviously was interested in stories, public relations. But I didn&#8217;t have the word storytelling. And so, that&#8217;s what I thought I was going to do.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
There&#8217;s no way in my wildest, wildest, wildest dreams, could I have ever imagined doing what I&#8217;m doing right now. Zero chance. The NBA thing was probably the only thing I might have spoke out and got laughed, basically just laughed at. And that squashed when I was a kid and my attitude was I&#8217;ll show you, you watch, I&#8217;ll show you. And then I end up in the NBA. That might be the only thing that I had an inkling of an idea. But of course, no one believed that would happen. But other than that, there&#8217;s zero chance I imagined what I&#8217;m doing right now, zero chance.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
I just knew that I needed to be around a ball, so sports and play. Books, around education and enlightenment and just raising your game and elevating your game to learn more of the curiosity piece. And betterment. So people bettered me, and so, how can I better others? And so, those are my three Bs that I look that, the ball, books and betterment. And that&#8217;s kind of how I&#8217;ve always been about. I recently got that clarity, but those are three things that have been consistently in my life and a constant for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What gives you the purpose now to keep doing the work that you do?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
There&#8217;s another one out there that needs to know it&#8217;s possible. Ms. Lane. So I made a promise to her before she passed away, it&#8217;s been eight years now, and I told her, I&#8217;m going to be the next you, Ms. Lane. I&#8217;m going to be that encourager for the next generation. I&#8217;m going to use technology and all these things, I&#8217;m going to have greater reach and impact, but I&#8217;m going to be the next you, and I&#8217;m going to remember what you said, there&#8217;s another you out there that needs to know what&#8217;s possible.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s what gives me the passion to do this each and every day, that there&#8217;s someone that needs to hear from me, see a project I&#8217;m working on, maybe collide with somebody that I&#8217;ve already impacted, something like that. But I know there&#8217;s another one out there. So that&#8217;s what I do the work for on behalf of them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you talked earlier about significance versus success. I&#8217;m curious, what does success look like for you now?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
It&#8217;s happening. I&#8217;m doing it and I&#8217;m proof that you can find success. Your circumstances don&#8217;t have to dictate your destiny, you can rise above that. Got to have that passion, purpose, and intention, and that clarity around what it is that you want to chase. So, that&#8217;s success, I have that. Significance is what I&#8217;m chasing. So I can point to, like you said, I&#8217;ve had four or five different lives, they&#8217;ve all been successful. Easy to point to that.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
But significance, I haven&#8217;t reached that yet. I haven&#8217;t gotten to that point where I&#8217;ve got this really amazing platform that I&#8217;m impacting lots of people on a regular basis. I&#8217;m doing it kind of in piecemeal now. I&#8217;m hoping, I mean, speak it into existence, I want to have a TV show. I want it to be a Saturday morning show, where I&#8217;m inspiring young people, and they&#8217;re seeing themselves in me. But not to be the host or anything, but seeing all these journeys and all these experiences that I&#8217;ve had, and know that it&#8217;s possible for them.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
And so, how can I introduce them to all these different careers and show them this wonderful multicultural expertise that&#8217;s out there so that they can see themselves in these roles that maybe they quietly imagine themselves doing, but not speaking them into existing or letting anybody know that they really want to do that, because they&#8217;ve not seen themselves in that role. So how can I be that unlock? How can I be that way finder? How can I be the plug for folks? How can I be a cheat code? That&#8217;s what I want to do.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
So, that would be the end game for me, is this programming of some sort, traditional, Saturday morning or on a digital platform, but have the reach an impact so that I can be that Ms. Lane for the next generation, that CEO, that chief encouragement officer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can see a Netflix series in your near future. I totally can see it.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
That&#8217;s what&#8217;s up. See. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s up. Right? Your lips God&#8217;s ears. Let&#8217;s go. Let&#8217;s go. Let&#8217;s do this, Maurice. You&#8217;d be one of the people on the show, I&#8217;d be talking about you. We&#8217;re now interviewing Maurice Cherry and how he created a time capsule of black and brown voices to encourage people to go after it. See, there it is, it&#8217;s already happening. Episode five, limited series. Or it might be like season nine.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You dropped already so many pearls of wisdom in this conversation. It almost feels a bit selfish to ask this, but what advice would you give somebody that wants to sort of chart the same kind of I guess path, to call it that, how can someone follow in your footsteps? How can someone be like you?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
Do you. Be the best you think is the advice that I&#8217;d love to give folks. I&#8217;ll go back to the original thing I brought up. I have no special talents, I&#8217;m only passionately curious. And I think curiosity for the win, FTW. Curiosity, that&#8217;s going to unlock, that&#8217;s going to help you stay in beta as a human being, always updating, always improving. I say this all the time, we&#8217;re so quick to update those apps on our devices and our computers, but what about ourselves?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
We&#8217;re the greatest app ever created, Maurice. There is no app greater than us. We&#8217;re so quick to update those apps on the devices, update yourself. That starts with curiosity, that starts with wanting to raise your game. And that&#8217;s going to unlock all kinds of possibilities and potential because you stay in beta, you&#8217;re always in this mindset of improving, of getting better, of leveling up. And that&#8217;s the key. And so, that would be my advice, that would be the thing that I think would really make a difference for someone, to chart their own path to significance, and to have a career portfolio of lots of amazing experiences. And to go beyond just a path.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
We go into a super highway, that&#8217;s what we want, super highway of experiences. I think it&#8217;s available for everyone and it doesn&#8217;t, I&#8217;m proof, circumstances don&#8217;t have to dictate your destiny. I&#8217;ve seen it all over the world, I&#8217;ve seen people do a lot with very little, we&#8217;re resourceful and resilient well beyond our circumstances, but we got to surround ourselves with the right other mindset and people who believe in the same things. Haters are your motivators, they&#8217;re going to be out there and they&#8217;re real.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
But find people who are like-minded and about the same things and keep them close. Keep those people close because they&#8217;re going to be the ones that help you when you&#8217;re really struggling. It&#8217;s not a clean, straight path. It twists and turns and challenges you. I always say this too, Maurice, doubt is success testing you. When doubt appears, when doubt comes into your mind, that self-talk that you&#8217;re not good enough, this isn&#8217;t going to be available, this is never going to happen for you, are you ready to dance with doubt? Are you ready to fight the good fight on behalf of that hope, that dream, that aspiration that you have? Then you ready to battle, then you ready to dance.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s the key. Are you willing to fight for this when it&#8217;s not going to be easy, when there are challenging times? That&#8217;s the key, because that&#8217;s going to unlock things that you never thought were going to be possible.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
One of the things that&#8217;s clear, my journey, expect the unexpected, because there&#8217;s a lot of unexpected stuff that&#8217;s happened. It continues to happen in my life, and just expect that, and respect it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, Kevin, I mean, again, you&#8217;ve given so much in this interview, my God, where can people find out more about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
Just @ me, @ me, @KCkatalyst with a K, that&#8217;s easy. K-A-T-A-L-Y-S-T. Yep. So KCkatalyst. @ me. You&#8217;ll find you can find me on all my socials, is that, and it&#8217;s easy to find me linked in that way. You can find out more about me that way. And if I can be of service to the next gen especially or the young at heart, and folks that are just trying to advance something, I&#8217;m happy to do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Man, Kevin Carroll, thank you so, so much for coming on the show. I had an idea I think how the conversation went, because as I mentioned to you before, I&#8217;ve been listening to your interviews all day prepping for this, but I mean, the unexpected twists and turns that are just a part of your stor, I think what anyone will take away from this is that you are someone that embodies curiosity and really just a passion for learning that is definitely taking you to where you are now. The fact that you&#8217;re also still paying it forward to so many people is astonishing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I see that Netflix series in your future. It may not be Netflix, maybe it&#8217;s Hulu. I mean, there&#8217;s like a dozen streaming services or something now. But I see it happening because this kind if message, it&#8217;s an important message, but I think especially right now, it&#8217;s so important because of what&#8217;s happened over the past few years. I think a lot of people have just kind of felt stuck, and this period of time has caused them to think about, well, what&#8217;s the next thing going to be. They need that catalyst, they need the KC Katalyst, that&#8217;s what they need.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Carroll:</b><br>
My buddy would call me the hope peddler, he said, you out there peddling that hope. I&#8217;m like, that&#8217;s right, I got what you want, I got what you need. Come on. Let&#8217;s go. Hope will not be canceled, my man, hope will not be canceled as long as I&#8217;m out here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Absolutely. Thank you so, so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s our anniversary! For this special episode, I dug way back in the archives and talked to one of our early guests, Joe Blau. He was a software engineer then, but seven years have passed, and now he&#8217;s an angel investor and the founder and CEO of his own company &#8212; Atomize. </p>
<p>We started chatting about the past seven years, and Joe talked about his time working for Uber and how that experience got him involved in crypto. We also talked about smart contracts, Web3, the metaverse, and a lot more. Stay tuned for the story I give near the end! </p>
<p>Thank you all so much for allowing me to bring these amazing interviews to you since 2013!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Hi, everybody. Also, thank you for having me back on, Maurice. My name is Joe Blau, and I am the founder of a no-code smart contract platform called Atomize, and I&#8217;m also an angel investor based in San Francisco, California.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. How has this year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
This year has actually been pretty amazing for us. I know last time we spoke, I was mentioning that I would go to Amazon and back and chat with my girlfriend. She&#8217;s now my wife. We have two young boys, and I would say that this year is probably shaping up to be one of the most amazingly in a good way years of my career. So I&#8217;m super excited about what&#8217;s been going on and what&#8217;s been kind of opened up in terms of opportunity for myself, and then also for a couple of friends and the company that we&#8217;re founding and we&#8217;re building.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has it been just kind of working over these past few years with the pandemic and everything?</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
I would say that the pandemic has really introduced a lot of new dynamics into the workplace. I have a lot of friends that have gone from remote work to back in the office and back and forth. There are lots of conversations about what&#8217;s the right way. What&#8217;s the wrong way? Can we even go back in? Do we need to go back in? I&#8217;ve noticed that a lot of my friends are really unhappy with this disconnect between being out of the office and still trying to have this tight-knit relationship with your colleagues.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been interesting to see that transpire in certain companies. And then other spaces, I&#8217;ve seen actually increased productivity where the teams already have this bond. They kind of already know what they&#8217;re doing, and it makes it so that people can really live their lives and have more of a work/life balance. For me personally, I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out a way to live in this new world where I can actually have that balance.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
I can work from my desk in my house, have this balance of being able to be creative and be productive and not have to go into an office. So I&#8217;ve actually been trying to take advantage of it. My co-founder and I were trying to become more proponents of that lifestyle, but it has been tough because you do have people that really thrive and live off of this in-person engagement. I would say I&#8217;m one of those, too. I love meeting people in-person.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
I love going to events. I love going to parties. I love meeting people. But I think that there&#8217;s this really interesting push and pull in the community right now and in all office spaces between should we be in the office or should we not be in the office and then the trade-offs of doing that hybrid.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Balance, I think, is something that so many folks now, especially so many working folks, are really trying to figure out. Companies are trying to figure it out because they&#8217;ve sunk hundreds of thousands of dollars into real estate that is largely sitting empty because people are working from home. So some companies are like, &#8220;Well, maybe we&#8217;ll do hybrid. Maybe we&#8217;ll try to figure out some way to still keep our brick-and-mortar location, but then also be able to work remotely.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know just for the show, we have folks that are in the advertising industry. I found it&#8217;s been really rough for the them because they&#8217;re really used to that in-office collaboration that you just really can&#8217;t replicate over Zoom. You can try. I think we&#8217;re starting to get better at it and such, but it&#8217;s still something we&#8217;re all trying to balance.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;m a big fan of Star Trek. So I liken this to the whole world was basically traveling at warp speed and, all of a sudden, the pandemic hit and just dropped us out of warp. Now, we&#8217;re all looking around saying, &#8220;What are we doing? Was what we were doing before actually productive or is it counterproductive?&#8221; We&#8217;re asking a lot of questions that we just were never asking before because we were all just going with the flow because everybody else was doing it.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So I think these questions that are coming up are really important questions to ask about the future of work, and every company has their own take on how they&#8217;re trying to address it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I think also with this balance of trying to figure it out, I feel like that&#8217;s where a lot of these talks about the metaverse, and work metaverse spaces have started to come up. We&#8217;ll get into metaverse stuff later. But I think one thing is how technology has sort of risen to fill the gaps in some way. I mean Zoom had always been around, but it really blew up in 2020 because of all of this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then you&#8217;ve got other platforms that have just started to come up because of that, because now more people are video conferencing. So there&#8217;s browser-based video conferencing solutions. There&#8217;s ways that people are trying to still replicate that experience. So technology, interestingly, has started to fill the void, but it&#8217;s still a process.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Yeah. I would say right when the pandemic started, I attended a lot of Zoom weddings. I attended a lot of Zoom everything. Nothing really, up until this point, has really been a substitute for just physically being there with people in meet space, in atom space. So Zoom does kind of fill that gap, and it definitely makes it a lot easier.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
If you&#8217;re fundraising and you don&#8217;t have to go walk downtown and go to a bunch of different coffee shops, if you can just have four meetings in a row on Zoom in two hours, that&#8217;s a lot easier than having to go spend half of your day walking around talking to investors, but there&#8217;s trade-offs to that as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean I can tell the story now because I don&#8217;t work there anymore. But one of the companies I used to work for, they were trying to raise funds right during the start of the pandemic, like March, April, May, and it was just impossible. They would try to have these Zoom meetings, and people were either Zoomed out already, they just didn&#8217;t want to do anymore meetings, or they found it difficult to replicate at that same kind of in-person shaking hands, talking over drinks kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s just not the same over Zoom, especially when we were really trying to get a hold on what all of this was and how we were going to possibly come out of it. I mean the company is still around. It&#8217;s a shell of its former self, but it has impacted business in a big way.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
One of the things that we are trying to do as, my co-founder and I, we&#8217;ve been thinking about this is we really want to see if there&#8217;s a way that we can embrace this new lifestyle because there are clearly people that really believe I should be able to work remote. I should be able to work anywhere. I want to be able to have a flexible lifestyle. So I&#8217;m looking at it more from the perspective of how do we embrace this, and what are the tools that are available for us to really take advantage of this new lifestyle and see if we can actually push this forward?</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Because while there are trade-offs, I love going into the office. After I left Amazon, I pivoted to working at Uber. It was an in-office relationship, and I loved the time that I spent there. It was probably one of the best experiences in my career But right now, I feel like I&#8217;m at a point where I can step away and look back and healthily say I would rather be in a position where I can have a little bit more flexibility and have a little bit more of that balance and have a little bit more control over my time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Actually, let&#8217;s dive into that a bit. When you first came on the show, which was back in 2015, you were working at Amazon as a software engineer and you had a startup that you had created called Canopsis that was working in the Internet of Things space. Now, I know you&#8217;re not at Amazon anymore, of course. You just mentioned you&#8217;re CEO of your own company now. Are you still building Canopsis? Is it still kind of in the wings?</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
We&#8217;re working on that for a little while, but I actually ended up sun-setting the company when I moved out work in Pittsburgh at Uber. So I&#8217;ll go through and I&#8217;ll kind of do a little bit of a historical what happened between our last interview and now, catching you up to speed since the last episode. I was at Amazon for a little bit over a year and a half working on the mobile point-of-sale application. I had a blast doing it, met a bunch of amazing colleagues and a bunch of amazing friends.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
I ended up being tapped by a product manager at Uber who was actually the one that led scouting for the Uber ATG team, which is the self-driving car team at Uber. He reached out to me in mid-2015, said, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re building up a new iOS team out here. We need somebody to help us build the user interface for the self-driving cars. You&#8217;re going to be the second person on the team, and you&#8217;re going to help scale this team up.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So I ended up saying, &#8220;Why would I pass this opportunity up?&#8221; I&#8217;m very big into sensors. I&#8217;m very big into sensor fusion. The self-driving car, to me, is the culmination of almost every sensor you can put into something. So in January of 2016, I ended up moving out to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and I lived there for about three and a half years, and I was working on Uber self-driving car. So we were able to launch V-1 of the self-driving car and then V-2 of the self-driving car.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
The software that I built and helped contribute to, we were able to conduct about 50,000 trips with actual passengers in our car in Pittsburgh, also down in Arizona, and a few trips in San Francisco. So it was a really great experience because I got a chance to work with some of the brightest minds in the software industry and in the automotive industry, amazing industrial designers, amazing software engineers, amazing infrastructure engineers, amazing LIDAR designers.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
The people that invented Google Maps were working there. I mean we had the best of the best talent on the team. So I really enjoyed my time and my stint there. And then about three and a half years in, I started to want to work on a few other projects. I started to see kind of the light at the end of the tunnel. I had a feeling that Uber was eventually going to sell the self-driving car division due to the change in leadership. So I moved back to San Francisco, joined Uber AI, where I worked on a bunch of also really cool stuff.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
The team was amazing, another group of extremely bright individuals. And then right after the pandemic started actually, we were fortunate enough to be able to capture some equity from being employees of Uber, and we were fortunate enough to be able to invest that into some cryptocurrencies. That basically gave us enough runway to kind of set ourselves free.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So I was able to leave Uber in early 2020, soon after the pandemic started, and took a year to kind of explore what I wanted to do, and then eventually linked up with one of my friends that I actually met at Uber ATG, who was an industrial designer. We were able to start building our company.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. That is quite a story. There&#8217;s a lot of points in there I want to touch on. I want to go back just briefly to Uber. I mean during that time that you were there with the whole self-driving car thing, there was a lot of stuff that went down just with the company, in general. Just a few of the things were around Travis Kalanick stepping down as CEO. There was a huge data breach. There was talk about employees tracking customers with this God mode.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you ever feel any of the fallout from those events, just working there? Was it a palpable thing that you were working for a company where this sort of stuff was going on?</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean I still have friends and I still have family members that are in the real world. They&#8217;re watching the news, and they see all of the stuff that&#8217;s happening. There were definitely lots of questions that I got about it. I had lots of friends that, when I would go visit them, they would say, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to take a Lyft. We&#8217;re not taking Uber,&#8221; even though I worked at Uber. As an Uber employee, you get free credits to ride in the cars. So for the most part, I never even paid for Ubers while I was there because you get $400 of free credits every month, or you used to.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So it was really tough, from that perspective. I think that whole season, I remember when that first started. It was in January of 2017. It was the Susan Fowler incident. Then there was the gray ball thing that you were talking about, where they were tracking people, reporters. There was Travis Kalanick yelling at the Uber driver. Then there was the guy in the-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, I forgot about that. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Yeah. Then there was the guy in India who was doing something nefarious over there. There was all these. Then there was the Anthony Levandowski taking data from Google. Then there was Travis Kalanick&#8217;s parents or his mom died in the boating accident. So there was this really compact six-month window where it was just drama every single month. We had a lot of colleagues leave. A lot of people left.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a pretty fluid transfer of engineering between a lot of the Silicon Valley companies, so a lot of people that I knew that I was friends with all left and went to Facebook or Twitter or Amazon or whatever. So it was pretty tough. There was one saving grace for us, which is that because ATG was a bit insulated from the rest of the company, we were effectively our own company. We were our own separate LLC.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Because we were insulated from the rest of the company, we didn&#8217;t really feel a lot of those effects, I would say, as strongly as people that were in the rest of the world, the rest of the offices did. But it definitely had a negative impact on sentiment at the company and sentiment as a team because, in our mind, we&#8217;re building this service that&#8217;s supposed to basically make it so that you can always get a ride. The original saying with Uber was. &#8220;Push a button, get a ride.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
When you looked at the thing that drew me to Uber was actually a bunch of negative experiences that I had with taxis in a bunch of different cities where I would try to flag a taxi and the taxi would drive by. I remember being in LA and actually my co-founder at Canopsis, we were in LA and he&#8217;d lived in LA. There were a bunch of taxis on Hollywood Boulevard. We had just come out of a club. We went to go flag a taxi, and they were like, &#8220;No, no, no.&#8221; And then this other Caucasian couple comes up and they get right in and they go.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve had a bunch of experiences like that in the United States. So for me, when I pick an Uber, the Uber always shows up. So for me, I wasn&#8217;t just like, &#8220;Oh, I like Uber because,&#8221; for whatever reason, because it&#8217;s cheaper or whatever. I like Uber because it actually allows me to get a cab and get from point A to point B and not need a car. I had a deeper rationale for why I would choose Uber over a cab. Now, Uber over Lyft, that&#8217;s a toss-up at that point.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
But yeah, it was really tough during those years to be an employee of the company because we lost a lot of talent. People were not looking to work at Uber. Our leader had kind of lost a lot of his power to be able to be actionable and, at that point, he was replaced with Dara.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I remember those times when people were really actively boycotting Uber from the user side because all these things were happening. It&#8217;s interesting because I don&#8217;t know. Do you think Uber&#8217;s turned their reputation around because of the pandemic?</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a tough company right now. I think the reason that their reputation has kind of turned around is just because a lot of the things that they were doing that were interesting and kind of counterculture have just fallen by the wayside. All of their assets that they&#8217;ve owned in other countries have been sold off. So Uber in Russia got sold to Yandex. Uber in China got sold to Didi. Uber in the Middle East got sold to Careem. They&#8217;ve really offloaded a lot. Uber in Southeast Asia got sold to Grab.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So they&#8217;ve offloaded a lot of the risk of a lot of these controversial pieces that they were operating, and really it&#8217;s just become &#8230; Right now, Uber is effectively a food delivery service. It competes with DoorDash. It does have ride-sharing, but that&#8217;s not a big part of the business right now because nobody&#8217;s really traveling. So it&#8217;s a tough business to be in. And then also, you&#8217;re in extreme regulatory environment.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Either you&#8217;re driving people around, which has a lot of regulation around it, or you&#8217;re driving food around, and food has a lot more regulation around it. So it&#8217;s a very tough business to be in, and the margins are super low. They&#8217;re razor thin. It&#8217;s just a lot of optimization. When Uber was not really following the regulations, that was kind of what brought it to prominence. Now that Uber&#8217;s just behaving, nobody really cares anymore.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was thinking about that as I was researching for this interview. I&#8217;ve been an Uber customer for over a decade. It&#8217;s amazing. The thing that drew me to Uber was similar to what you were talking about with cabs. I would fly out places, and then I couldn&#8217;t even get a cab to come home when I came to the airport in Atlanta. The cabs were like, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m not going to that neighborhood.&#8221; They&#8217;ll take me to downtown, which is past where I have to go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I could hop on the train, and most of the time I would do that. But it&#8217;s like sometimes you&#8217;re just tired and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;I just want to go home.&#8221; Uber could actually take me to my apartment, where a cab wouldn&#8217;t do that. So I think it was that initial convenience, like you mentioned, that really brought people in. But yeah. Now I was wondering that just because of the pandemic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean yeah, Uber delivers food, which their competitors really don&#8217;t do, at least in the ride-share space. Lyft hasn&#8217;t went out and done that yet. But no, I was wondering if it sort of turned things around because now so many people are using it almost as a utility because of that.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean I think it&#8217;s just gotten to the point where you&#8217;re either taking an Uber or a cab. What it also did was elevate the service of cabs. So cabs have to be more nimble. They need an app. They need to basically increase their service. So that increased competition helped make cabs a little bit better. But for me, I think I&#8217;m still in the same boat where it&#8217;s easier for me to just call an Uber or call a Lyft.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Right now I don&#8217;t work there. So I just basically do what everybody else does. I open the app, figure out which one is cheapest. And then I just pick that one, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s where I am right now. But they&#8217;re in a position where they are trying to do a lot of partnerships and work with a lot of teams. That&#8217;s kind of the new direction is, instead of trying to just dominate the whole scene, they just want to partner and work with other people. That&#8217;s a great position to be in because you make a lot of friends that way. So it&#8217;s a good strategy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So let&#8217;s talk about your current venture, Atomize. I&#8217;m looking at the Atomize website right now. It says, &#8220;Atomize let&#8217;s you deploy and interact with crypto smart contracts on chain without having to write code.&#8221; Now, before-</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a mouthful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a mouthful. Before we get into more about Atomize, tell me how you got into crypto. I mean I think you kind of alluded to it a little bit earlier with flipping that equity from Uber.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Yeah. So the journey actually started with me back in 2013. At the time, I was doing a bunch of contract work. There was a tech crunch reporter named John Biggs, and he wrote this article. It&#8217;s actually from April 8, 2013, and it&#8217;s called How to Mine Bitcoins. So I read the article. I followed all the instructions. I installed this miner basically on my computer, and I let it run all night. My fan went crazy. I ended up mining half of a bitcoin or something in this mining pool called Slush Pool, which is actually still around today.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
And then after that, I just didn&#8217;t think about it because electricity in San Francisco is super expensive. I was just like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to waste my money on this thing,&#8221; that I think at the time it was maybe $20 or $18. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not mining this thing and I&#8217;m paying 40, $50 in electricity to get $20 of coin.&#8221; So I just left it alone. And then fast forward, in 2014, I met this individual in my building, and he was super excited about crypto.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
He was like, &#8220;Oh, you got to check out this new thing. It&#8217;s called Ethereum. You got to check this out. It&#8217;s Ethereum. You&#8217;re going to love this thing. It&#8217;s like bitcoin, but it&#8217;s a decentralized computer. You can run anything on it. You can run any type of program you want. It&#8217;s like bitcoin, but with programming on top.&#8221; I remember telling him. I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not interested in that. All I&#8217;m focused on right now is mobile application development and sensors.&#8221; This is probably maybe six months before we first spoke.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
This guy told me about Ethereum. I just totally blew him off. I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not interested in that. I&#8217;m only interested in mobile sensors and machine learning and stuff like that.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;All right, fine.&#8221; I nicknamed this guy, Oracle Zero now. But he introduced me to Ethereum, and I just totally passed it over. And then in mid-2016, I started hearing a little bit of rumblings, and I went and created a Coinbase account.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
I was like, &#8220;Let me go see what this Ethereum thing is doing.&#8221; It had gone from the 50 cents that he had invested in at the ICO or the 25 cents that he had invested in at the ICO per Ethereum to $12 or something. I was like, &#8220;Man, that seems like a pretty good investment.&#8221; 40, 50, and whatnot. It was 50 extra money, something like that. So I was like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; Maybe a little bit higher, 60, 70 extra money. So I was like, &#8220;Okay, this seems like a pretty interesting concept.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So I ended up borrowing money from two of my really good friends and then taking some of my money and buying a whole tranche of Ethereum in mid-2016. I basically gave them this crazy term sheet. I was like, &#8220;I will pay you back 150% of your money in 2017 with this investment.&#8221; I told them. I was like, &#8220;Where else are you going to get a guaranteed investment of 50% return on investment in six months? Nobody&#8217;s going to give you that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
You go to Allied Bank and they&#8217;re giving you 0.5% interest on your money. So I basically offered them this crazy deal, and they gave me money. They both wrote me checks. I deposited the money. I put it into the Coinbase. I bought crypto with it. And then I ended up paying them back in early 2017, which was actually, looking back, probably a bit of a financial mistake, but it did help introduce them to crypto because they saw the gains happen as I saw the gains happen.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
And then 2017 was just that whirlwind. Ethereum went from $12 a coin to $1,500 a coin by the next year. So you have this thousands of percent run-up of this token. That was my first taste of like, &#8220;Oh, wow. This crypto investment thing is actually pretty interesting.&#8221; I was trading that whole time, but it wasn&#8217;t really fruitful because if you were trading in crypto and it was going up, everybody was making money. So everybody looked like a genius.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
And then in December of 2017, that was when bitcoin hit its top. 28 days later, Ethereum hit its top. And then everything kind of came crashing down. I don&#8217;t know if this is just something innate in me, but I was already scared. So I had actually sold everything near January of 2018. So I was fully out. I had no more crypto. But what I was doing was I started paying attention to a lot of the technology that was being built. I was like, &#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s going on with these smart contracts?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
I actually wrote one of my first decentralized applications or it&#8217;s called a dApp, which it was a dog-renting website where you would go in and you could rent a dog and then put it back and stuff like that. It would all happen on the blockchain. So I built one of those, and I started playing around with it, started listening to a lot of other podcasts that are in the crypto ecosystem and really just started to pay attention to it casually.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Because really, to me, all I saw was people are making these coins. These coins are going up in value, but they don&#8217;t really have any intrinsic utility outside of the original utility of bitcoin, which is a way to send something from one person to another without counterparty risk and without being censored. So I kept playing around. We&#8217;re talking 2018. I was still working at Uber. I&#8217;m still working on self-driving cars. We&#8217;re shipping, I&#8217;m going to Arizona. I&#8217;m going to San Francisco. We&#8217;re deploying our cars in production. So I didn&#8217;t really have a lot of time to really actively manage it.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So what I would do is I would just take part of my paycheck and just start to buy slowly back in. After the price came way down, I was like, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t think this is going away.&#8221; So I started to slowly buy back in. And then in 2019, Uber had its IPO. So the deal that I had received from joining Uber was pretty lucrative. Actually, it was a seven-figure return from the IPO. But after taxes, you pay 50% in taxes. So it ended up being a six-figure return, which was still very good.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
We decided to take that and invest it into crypto. So we just YOLO&#8217;ed all in, I would say. That ended up working out very well in terms of timing just because this last bull run kind of exceeded the intensity of the original bull run, if you were looking at the right types of products. So because I had been paying attention, I had been in the community, I&#8217;d been watching and listening to a lot of creators and influencers, people that are developers, people that are commentators, podcasters, I kind of knew where to look for this next bull run.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So I was able to just kind of get lucky and then also, paying attention, get into this crypto wave. And then what ended up happening is what I realized is that myself and a lot of my friends from this original wave all got to a certain level of wealth where we started to realize we&#8217;ve got a lot of time on our hands. That led us to start to think really more about life and about life decisions. I think it really kind of broke my brain in a good way to have me open up my thought process and think about what do I really want to accomplish?</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
What are some big goals, kind of Elon Musk level? He wants to basically have a colony on Mars that can be fully self-sustaining without Earth. That&#8217;s probably not going to happen in his lifetime, but that&#8217;s one of those big long-term goals. So I started to think about that a lot. But that&#8217;s where my crypto journey kind of came from back in 2013. And then it led me to where I am today. And then what ended up happening is my co-founder, I actually met him at Uber. He was an industrial designer on the same team that I was a software engineer on, and so we decided to pair up.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
We&#8217;ve always been friends. We used to hang out in Pittsburgh and grab drinks together or go to each other&#8217;s homes. So him and I got together. We floated a bunch of ideas back and forth. We tinkered around with a bunch of stuff. And then we decided that since we&#8217;re both doing financially well and we&#8217;re in crypto and we&#8217;re both excited about this field, we want to make it very accessible for somebody who doesn&#8217;t know anything about crypto, somebody who doesn&#8217;t know anything about smart contracts, to be able to build one of these things and put it on the blockchain and retain ownership. That&#8217;s kind of what we&#8217;re focused on right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean it sounds like you really learned about this in a really smart way, which is you had been in the game really kind of learning and studying for a long time, since 2013. You didn&#8217;t just jump right into it after, I don&#8217;t know, buying stocks after Reddit recommendations or something, but you&#8217;ve been in there for a while and was able to kind of see the ebb and flow and see how things go and then find the right time to really get in. With that, you&#8217;ve started this business to help other folks get in.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Yeah. I think for us, what we&#8217;re really focused on is I think there&#8217;s a key thing about crypto, which it&#8217;s a lot of things to a lot of people. There&#8217;s NFTs. There&#8217;s tokens. There&#8217;s metaverse. There&#8217;s DAOs. There&#8217;s all these words that can get floated around. But I think fundamentally what crypto provides is a contrast to the existing system that we&#8217;ve kind of been grown up and raised in if you&#8217;ve been around the internet from basically after the 2000 dot-com crash until now, which is there will be a website, fill in the name of big website dot com.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
They will create a database, and they will entice you to get on that database somehow, some way. What happens is you have these network effects, which the more people that are on that website in their database, the more people want to go to that website and get in their database. So you&#8217;ve got Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Google, Apple. They all have the same kind of network effects. So what happens is these services get to a certain level of scale where you start to realize that if you&#8217;re a consumer, the one individual consumer doesn&#8217;t really matter as much because you don&#8217;t own the data.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
I actually saw this in 2011. The first company that I worked for when I went to Silicon Valley, we were a startup and we used to collect Twitter data as well as other social media network data. And then we would filter the data. Then we would sell insights to companies that were our partners. We had Bentley was one of our partners and a bunch of high-level &#8230; Apple was one of our partners. So we would sell them information about what&#8217;s happening on Twitter.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Well, once Twitter realizes, hey, there&#8217;s a business here, twitter wants to roll that into their business. So they just cut off the pipeline. Twitter had this service called a Firehose. They just stopped the Firehose. And then they just run the Firehose internally. They build this business internally. They sell ads internally. And then they use that as a revenue generator internally.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So there&#8217;s this kind of push and pull between this open source ecosystem of people that are developers and that are creative and that are actually contributing to the platform and the internal team that is trying to make money any way, shape, or form to return the fund for the investors. You started to see this more and more often on the developer side from 2010 until it&#8217;s still actually going on now, where with Facebook, there was the whole App.net controversy where somebody wanted to build an app store for Facebook using Facebook&#8217;s API.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Facebook said, &#8220;No, we&#8217;re building that ourselves, and that violates our terms of service.&#8221; So they had to make something else. They made a different social network. There are tons of examples of this where somebody builds a platform. They build these APIs to allow you to integrate. But as soon as they find that somebody else is building something that has value, they cut that integration off, and then they just build it internally. The reason they&#8217;re allowed to do that is because of the network effects. They own all the data.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
The contrast to what crypto does is crypto tries to take that same database, but instead of the database being inside Facebook or Google or Twitter or Amazon, the database is on everybody&#8217;s computer. So everybody has access to the data. And then it becomes a game of, or not a game, it becomes a challenge of how do you build the experience that solves the person&#8217;s problem? It&#8217;s kind of the Y Combinator&#8217;s slogan of make something people want. How do you make the thing that people want?</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
If you make this product or service that performs the job better than the competitor&#8217;s product or service, where you both have access to the same data, that makes it a more equitable playing field. So the thing that I like about crypto, and this is just all in theory. This could all be invalidated tomorrow for all I know. But right now, there&#8217;s an equal playing field where everybody has access to the same view into the data. Really, you as a creator or you as an engineer or you as a developer, you are just kind of like a deejay where you get to curate the songs.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
You&#8217;re like, &#8220;Today, we&#8217;re playing house music,&#8221; or, &#8220;Today, our site plays house music, or our site plays hip hop, or our site plays jazz, or our site plays classical.&#8221; You get to curate that data and build your community around that curated experience. So we want to help people build products that can be put online. And then we think that as we start helping people get their things online, their software, their products, their smart contracts, it will allow them to then have other services that other people build that we don&#8217;t control, make their experience even more customized and even better just for their community or whatever they want to build.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, where does the smart contract come into play? Why is it important to have that?</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
If we go back to the beginning of bitcoin, bitcoin is a way for me to send you some value, basically like a token, the bitcoin, a way for me to send it from myself to you without having somebody else be able to stop the transaction. The challenge is it&#8217;s just a value. Think of it like a dollar. I&#8217;m just sending you a dollar or sending a dollar back. What people learned early on is that a lot of times value is attached to some sort of condition.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
I want you to have this money after you rake my yard, or I want to give you this money after the stock price goes to $50, or I want to release this money after these six things are accomplished at this speed or whatever. So the smart contract piece is just adding logic to the value transfer. So this is what&#8217;s created this crazy ecosystem in crypto because people are trying to add all types of crazy logic to value.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Economics is the study of value of how goods and services are transported and how they generate value. When you look at crypto, crypto kind of gives you a playground to actually test out these theories. So I could write something that says, &#8220;Okay, Maurice, I&#8217;m going to give you 100 JOE tokens today. And then tomorrow, I&#8217;m going to give you another 100. And then the day after that, I&#8217;m going to give you another 100. And then the day after that, I&#8217;m going to give you another 100.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
I&#8217;m just going to keep doing that forever. As long as you have access to your wallet, my program will keep giving you 100 JOE tokens. You can deploy that onto a blockchain and see what happens. Will that eventually reach some value? Would you eventually say, &#8220;Oh, I have a billion of these, let me give these to somebody else?&#8221; Now two people have these tokens, but you&#8217;re still the only one getting paid those tokens. Does that eventually form a market or a marketplace?</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Do people eventually start to say, &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s actually value, I can actually use these things as a way to barter back and forth for some other asset or for some other thing that&#8217;s in the real world?&#8221; So you basically end up with the social consensus, which looks a lot like money, but it&#8217;s written in a way that the rules are written in code and they effectively can&#8217;t be changed.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like you said, it&#8217;s all on the blockchain. So it&#8217;s decentralized, but it&#8217;s a way where &#8230; Well, I don&#8217;t know. I guess I&#8217;m still trying to wrap my head around smart contracts and NFTs and everything like that. I want to get more people on the show this year that can really explain it because I see it now, all of this being really the next generation of where the web is going to go. I&#8217;m saying last month because we&#8217;re recording in January.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But back in December, I attended a conference about the metaverse in the metaverse. They had people talking about all the different considerations, like interoperability and scalability and commerce. There were so many considerations and things to think about with this upcoming metaverse, which I think had already started to be a part of people&#8217;s minds once Facebook Connect happened back in I think it was October of last year, 2021, when they said, &#8220;We&#8217;re changing our name to Meta. We&#8217;re investing in the metaverse.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then all of a sudden, everyone was like, &#8220;What is the metaverse?&#8221; I think anybody that probably watched anime in the &#8217;90s had probably already heard of metaverse. I don&#8217;t know. I think it was probably on VR Troopers or Sailor Moon or something probably. But they&#8217;ve heard of that concept, but not necessarily what it meant in the real world. So it was something that I think was part of people&#8217;s general mindset saying, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want to be part of the metaverse.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But after I attended that conference, what stuck out to me was that this is the next step. I could see this being potentially the next digital divide because people are putting a ton of money and resources and time into really building whatever this next massive infrastructure is. There&#8217;s so many people that are just like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want any part of it.&#8221; But it feels like the velocity at which we are approaching this is rapidly increasing. So I want to try to learn more about it to try to see where I can fit in with all this stuff.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Yeah. I guess for me, I kind of separate metaverse and crypto into two separate buckets. For me, the metaverse is the next evolution of AR/VR. AR/VR is a technology that was invented in I think the late &#8217;80s, and they&#8217;ve slowly been incrementally trying to push it and make it a reality. This is very similar to self-driving. One of the reasons why I worked at Uber and I went to Pittsburgh is because Carnegie Mellon, they had a self-driving car in 1989 called ALVINN that was able to kind of do some basic navigation. They were one of the pioneers of helping make self-driving a reality.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So I got to learn from some of the best of the best that invented a lot of the processes for self-driving. So you&#8217;ve got this technology vertical, self-driving cars. We don&#8217;t have the human-level self-driving car yet, but we&#8217;re on our way towards that progress, and that&#8217;s something that started in the &#8217;80s. VR/AR is the same thing. It started in the &#8217;80s. We&#8217;re trying to get to that point where we have compute and screens and comfort and battery power that can make this experience good or good enough that you will feel comfortable immersed in this environment, so that your neck doesn&#8217;t hurt, so that you don&#8217;t get dizzy, so that it feels as realistic as possible.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
That&#8217;s another vertical that&#8217;s kind of being developed in what I would say is the newest incarnation, which is the metaverse. And then you&#8217;ve got crypto. Crypto is really about censorship resistance and reducing counterparty risk. Earlier, you were asking about what is a smart contract. If you just think about a regular contract in real life, you go rent a car at Avis. They give you a piece of paper, and you sign your name on it. When you sign your name on it, you&#8217;re agreeing to all of the words that are in that paper.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
If I crash it, I&#8217;m going to have my insurance pay for it or whatever. It doesn&#8217;t have any of these dents or these dings. That&#8217;s what you&#8217;re agreeing to. Now, that contract is adjudicated by some legal entity, probably a judge. So if you violate that contract, there&#8217;s going to be somebody that&#8217;s going to say, &#8220;Oh, Maurice, he borrowed this car. It didn&#8217;t have any scratches. I don&#8217;t know what happened. But all of a sudden, there&#8217;s a big scratch on the driver&#8217;s side door.&#8221; You have to pay whatever the contract stipulates in the contract.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So if you just take all that logic that we just said, if car gets scratched, you have to pay X amount of dollars, if this thing doesn&#8217;t do this, then you have to do this. You write that in code, just like I would say, &#8220;If this happens, then do this.&#8221; You would write that in code. And then you can deploy that code into a database that everybody in the world has access to read and see. That&#8217;s pretty much what the smart contract is.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So the NFT, or a non-fungible token, is a contract that specifies that there is effectively only one of these. Fungibility is this concept in economics that means that if I have something, the one thing that I have is no different than the one thing you have. So the best way to explain it is if I have 10 $1 bills and you have 10 $1 bills and somebody picks up all of them and then they redistribute them and they give you 10 new ones and they give me 10 new ones, you&#8217;re not going to say, &#8220;I want the one with serial number that ends in 05 because that was mine,&#8221; because dollar are fungible, which means I can exchange my dollar for your dollar or your dollar for my dollar and it doesn&#8217;t matter. They&#8217;re exchangeable equally.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Non-fungible means if I have a dollar, my dollar is special and your dollar is not. So that&#8217;s when you get into things like trading cards or Beanie Babies or pet rocks, things that have a unique value. If I have a special anime card or special Magic: The Gathering card and you don&#8217;t have that Magic: The Gathering card, that&#8217;s non-fungible. I can&#8217;t just give you mine and you&#8217;ll give me any other one back. So these non-fungible tokens are representations of unique items.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
The way that they&#8217;re defined is in what&#8217;s called a smart contract. This item only exists and is only owned by this one person, for example.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay, I get it. I understand. Okay. Thank you so much for that explanation.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a lot of economic theory. There are a lot of disciplines that all merge in together to form crypto. You really have to be multidisciplinary, which I was not before I started learning about all this stuff. You really have to learn a lot to try to fit your into what is actually going on in crypto.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, where do you see, I guess, Web3 with all of this? I keep hearing Web3 being called the technological evolution of the internet.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Yeah. So Web3, it&#8217;s funny because, as a software engineer, I&#8217;m always thinking like, &#8220;Okay, what is the most basic thing?&#8221; Web3 is a library that was created that literally all it does is let you interact with this blockchain. So this database that is this ever-growing database that everybody has access to, Web3 is just a library that lets you read and write from that database. Now, what&#8217;s happened is that term has been co-opted to be everything involving crypto.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So Web3 means smart contracts. It means dApps. It means Solana. It means means everything. It means bitcoin. Everything kind of falls into this Web3 umbrella. The mantra behind Web 3.0 is that we&#8217;re going to create a new internet that is not owned by Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, but it&#8217;s owned by the people. That is the charge. The way that the people can own the internet is because of what I mentioned earlier. When you create the smart contract and you deploy the smart contract on the blockchain, you own the contract.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
There&#8217;s nobody else that can go in and take custody of the contract. That design is the genius invention that bitcoin created, but it just created it for money basically, for value. When you own your bitcoin, nobody can just come take it from you. You have to basically give it to somebody else. There&#8217;s no way for somebody to take your bitcoin. You have to voluntarily give it to somebody. Now, a judge can say, &#8220;Hey, you violated this law and you owe us XYZ dollars in bitcoins. If you don&#8217;t pay this fine, then you&#8217;ll go to jail or whatever.&#8221; And then you can hand it over.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
But there&#8217;s no way that they can just go into your account and pull the bitcoin out. You have to hand it over. This Web3 concept just takes that version of you have to give over your bitcoin to you have to give over anything you create in Web3. So I mean you can obviously get tricked out of it. There&#8217;s a lot of people that are getting scammed and hacked because a lot of the tooling is not amazing. But effectively, you have to give something away. Nobody can take anything from you.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the whole concept behind this Web3 movement. We&#8217;re building a version of the internet where Facebook doesn&#8217;t get to block your account or Twitter doesn&#8217;t get to revoke your developer access or YouTube doesn&#8217;t get to take down your video because they thought that this looks very similar to another video even though you did all the work and recreated and remastered and built everything yourself. We&#8217;re building a version of the internet where you own your stuff.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
And then you have to go through the regular legal process. If in the real world, something happens that violates a law, there&#8217;s a legal process that you go through. It&#8217;s the same thing in crypto. Mt. Gox lost a bunch of people&#8217;s money. They did a bunch of shady stuff. They went through a legal process. They got their bitcoin confiscated, and they went through the regular process that anybody who did anything shady would go through.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So it kind of just slows down this network effect process of aggregating data, aggregating user information, and then being able to use that to rent, seek, and kind of take over and start to build this vertically-integrated, monopoly-style business.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So for people that are listening to this now and, hopefully, folks are listening to this and they&#8217;ve been able to wrap their head around these concepts. How can folks start getting involved with smart contracts and Web3? Because it sounds like these are, as you&#8217;ve described them, they&#8217;re kind of different entry points, but still somewhat related.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean there are a lot of resources. It&#8217;s very difficult for me to point to good resources because lots of people have lots of takes on it. I would liken this to the internet in 1997, &#8217;98, where everything looks like a great idea. Pets.com looks like a great idea. Webvan looks like a great idea. All these things look like great Ideas. Maybe when you fast forward 20 years, while Pets.com failed, Amazon now has a pet store as a sub domain of their website, and it&#8217;s effectively what pets.com&#8217;s vision was. It&#8217;s just 20 years later.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So these ideas may be working, but it&#8217;s very hard to really find great information. Maybe I should build some sort of resource. I mean there&#8217;s a gentleman by the name of Jameson Lopp who really organizes a lot of great information around bitcoin. He has a great website, if you just search for Jameson L-O-P-P. I think it&#8217;s lopp.net or something like that. He has a great resource that kind of encapsulates a lot of information about bitcoin.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
I think bitcoin is a good place to start learning because it&#8217;s a very confined space in terms of what bitcoin can actually do. Because once you start getting out of this bitcoin space, everything gets very crazy and very wild very quickly. It&#8217;s just the stuff that people are doing, no financial economics book would have ever predicted this, ever. It&#8217;s like the wild, wild west of finance right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m glad you made that analogy to the early days of the web because that&#8217;s really how I see a lot of the activity right now going on with the metaverse. Calling back to this conference that I had went to, there was one session. I&#8217;ve told this story on the podcast before, but there was this one session I went in where this guy was showing off digital land in a metaverse that he was a part of. He had on this NFT suit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He&#8217;s like, &#8220;I can walk into this NFT, and look at how it changes.&#8221; He&#8217;s saying like, &#8220;You all should really see this.&#8221; We&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, fine, whatever.&#8221; It was just like walking around in VR space or whatever. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;All these plots of digital land are available. If it anybody&#8217;s interested, we can go ahead and start the bidding.&#8221; Someone bought a plot of land inside of this virtual world. It was a 300 square meter plot for $10,000, just bought it right on the spot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In my mind, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What are you going to use that for?&#8221; I guess you could build something on it, I guess, in this particular metaverse world that you can have people come to. But it had me thinking about The Million Dollar Homepage and how people were buying up little pixels just to be on this one page to stake their claim and say, &#8220;Ha, I was a part of the internet at this time when it happened.&#8221; It is very much like the wild, wild west, all of this, because it&#8217;s not regulated.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
People are doing all kinds of just wild &#8230; I mean we&#8217;re using these adjectives wild, and crazy, but it&#8217;s really kind of mind-boggling just how much is going on with a lot of this stuff. It feels like history is being written every day when it comes to these things. It&#8217;s unprecedented. Yeah. Like you said with the analogy about the economics book, no one could have seen any of this stuff really actually, possibly happening, and now it is happening.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Yeah. I think about the whole NFT space because a lot of people have a bunch of different takes on it. Some people are like, &#8220;Why would anybody buy a JPEG online that you could just copy and download?&#8221; I&#8217;m not very big into art collecting or lots of mechanical stuff. I used to really be into mechanical watches, but right now I just wear an Apple Watch. It tells the time perfectly. Mechanical watches have drift. They&#8217;re effectively, to me, just jewelry right now.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
But there are people that they buy things because of the story. Human beings are creatures of story. I&#8217;m sure, as you&#8217;ve been going through the podcast and having these conversations, really what people get captivated by are the story. If you just see a CryptoPunk and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, this is just an eight-bit image that&#8217;s not really that nice,&#8221; that&#8217;s one story you can tell yourself.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
But there&#8217;s another story, which is this CryptoPunk was one of the first ones that got minted. I got it gifted to me. And then it was sold to this other person who was a prolific artist who then sold it to Gary Vee, and now this is Gary Vee&#8217;s CryptoPunk. Now there&#8217;s a story. There&#8217;s this narrative that flows from what this thing represents. People love to buy stories. When you watch football or you watch anything, it&#8217;s all about the story.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Formula 1 was boring to a ton of people until Netflix made that Formula 1 show with all the story about what&#8217;s actually going on behind the scenes, who&#8217;s got problems with whom, who&#8217;s getting fired, who&#8217;s getting hired. It&#8217;s just a story. I think a lot of what NFTs are about right now and what&#8217;s really captivating is a lot of these stories. Somebody just stole $20 million worth of NFTs. That&#8217;s a classic heist story that people love to read.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
This kid who was 12 years old is now a multi-millionaire because he created this little NFT collection, and he became a multi-millionaire off of it. That&#8217;s the rags to richest story. People love to hear those stories. So a lot of what I see in NFTs is really just a reflection of what happens in the real world. It&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s being accelerated because we&#8217;ve got the internet. We&#8217;ve got this technology that really allows us to push this narrative a lot faster.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
A bunch of bloggers and a bunch of YouTubers can come up and tell the story super quickly instead of having to syndicate it through a newspaper network that takes a day to turn over and whatever. So I think that the story is really what is driving a lot of what&#8217;s going on in the crypto space and especially in the NFT space. From that perspective, I get it because I love stories. I love watching movies. I got into the Formula 1 thing just like a lot of my friends did after watching the story behind all the people.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Now I know everybody&#8217;s name. I know who&#8217;s got problems with whom, who started off at what racing firm and went over here and got downgraded to here or got demoted to this team and whatever. So what people are building with these NFTs are really just stories, and people will pay unlimited amounts of money for a great story.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. That&#8217;s a great way to put it. Now that I think about it, especially a lot of the talk I&#8217;ve seen around NFTs, people just starting to sort of get into them and are making astronomical amounts of money. But then even ones, like people that are buying these NFT art pieces and such, which I watched the video, I think it was the other day, that was like, &#8220;Why is most of the NFT art so ugly?&#8221; That had me thinking about, well, is this an opportunity for some designers to try to find a way to make their way into the NFT space?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know a few Black NFT artists that I&#8217;m really trying to get to come on here to really talk about how this is working for them. But yeah, I totally, totally understand what you mean about people buying the story. That makes a ton of sense to me.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Yeah. I have a few friends. This is also to this whole story thing. Back in mid-2017, the CryptoPunks people reached out to them and they said, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re going to give you 26 CryptoPunks.&#8221; Because of the influx of growth in crypto in 2017 where everything looked like a scam, and there was 100 coins coming out a day, these guys were like, &#8220;Nah.&#8221; They just ignored it. And then a few months ago, they went back to look through their emails just to see if anything had come from Larva Labs.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
They saw that they had an opportunity to have 26 CryptoPunks. What&#8217;s the floor on CryptoPunks right now, $250,000 or something like that, some crazy number? So they would have been done. But this is also part of the story, right, the opportunity that I missed. All of these little things are all parts of you can watch any movie or any Disney show or whatever. They&#8217;re all parts of these stories where people love to just kind of tell these stories. That&#8217;s really what I think a lot of what&#8217;s going on is about.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
It&#8217;s really about these stories, the legality. Do you really own this or not? The rags to riches, the heist, the clones, the fakes, there&#8217;s all these like, &#8220;Oh, I took this NFT and I turned everybody that was facing to the right, I made them face to the left,&#8221; and then the controversy around that. So there&#8217;s all these things that are really just that narrative. I think that&#8217;s really what&#8217;s selling with a lot of NFTs. We&#8217;ve had this since the dawn of time. We&#8217;ve been making stories about stuff and selling stories forever.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. Good point. Really good point. What does success look like for you at this point in your career?</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
I feel like I&#8217;m in an interesting and very privileged space right now just because last time we spoke you asked me, &#8220;Are you at the top of your game?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;No, not even close.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t even hesitate to say, &#8220;Not even close.&#8221; I think by working at Amazon with the amazing people that I was able to work with, by working at Uber with the amazing people that I was able to work with, by getting access to a lot of really high-quality individuals in Silicon Valley through angel investor networks and through just socializing, I feel like I&#8217;ve gotten to a point where I would still not say I&#8217;m at the top of my game, but I feel like I know what I&#8217;m shooting for right now. I know where my stride is.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
One of the things that happened actually right before the pandemic, so late 2019, really soon after I sold all my Uber stock and bought all this crypto, my brother and I actually went back to West Africa, which is where my mom&#8217;s from, in Sierra Leone. We get to West Africa. We land. And then my mom wanted to take us to the village and the house that she grew up in. So we ended up getting a car. It takes forever. It&#8217;s not that far if you were in the United States and you were driving on a highway. But in Africa, it&#8217;s a five-hour trip that should be an hour.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So we finally get to this village. On our way there, we saw a bunch of these signs. It&#8217;s hilarious because they have all these cities there called &#8230; They have a New York there. They have a New London. Yeah, it&#8217;s funny. There&#8217;s all these little town names. You would never even think about this. A joke that my brother and I, as we were leaving the town where my mom was born and raised and grew up, my brother and I were like, &#8220;We should start our own city called New Atlanta, and start it in Africa and build the city.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
If we were going to design a city that we wanted to be successful and build it somewhere in West Africa, what would we build? Where would we build it? It was just a joke at the time. But I&#8217;ve been thinking about it a lot recently in terms of the type of &#8230; I know there are lots of other famous people. I think Akon is building a city, and I think Kanye West is building a city. A couple of really famous people are building cities.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
But one of the things that I&#8217;m really excited about is science, engineering, the STEM fields or STEAM fields, science, technology, engineering, art, and math. One of the things that I&#8217;ve noticed about crypto is in, some of the communities that I&#8217;m in, I&#8217;m seeing what happens when you unshackle a person from needing to have money. It really opens up a lot of opportunity and a lot of thought and a lot of creativity to people that have skills, but they can&#8217;t necessarily create in the way that they want to create because they&#8217;re kind of restricted by being an employee at a company and whatever the OKRs or whatever the goals are, or the profitability of the company, or you have some sort of fixed time that you have to be in and be out of work or whatever the constraints are.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So I&#8217;ve really been thinking about this idea. I don&#8217;t really have anything formalized yet, but just thinking about what would it look like to build a modern city. I guess the goal for me would be &#8230; Elon Musk has this program where he wants to have rockets fly from city to city within 30 minutes. What would it be like to have a city where you could host that in West Africa? What does that look like? What does that city look like? What does that design look like? I don&#8217;t have anything working towards it. I have no plans. I have no drafts. I have nothing.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
It&#8217;s just an idea in my head, but that&#8217;s something that I would love to see come to fruition. I think that through the companies that I&#8217;m investing in, the projects that I&#8217;m building, I think that I can start to kind of chip away at that goal and that vision. It&#8217;s going to take, obviously, a lot more trips back to West Africa. It&#8217;s going to take a lot more conversations.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
But I think that&#8217;s something that, for me, if I can get towards the goal, just any way, shape, or form towards the goal of building that city and New Atlanta&#8217;s just a name because my brother and I were like, &#8220;Atlanta is awesome. The Black population and culture there is amazing. So we&#8217;ll just build a new one.&#8221; If I could get to anything towards that, I think that&#8217;s going to be something that I would be really excited about leaving as part of a legacy on planet Earth.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, aside from all of this tech that we just talked about, we didn&#8217;t even really touch on you being an angel investor. How did you wander into that?</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a funny story. So when I was at Uber, I met &#8230; My manager, actually the person who hired me, he told me. I asked him the same question. I was like, &#8220;Hey, how do you become an angel investor?&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Just start writing checks and start losing a lot of money.&#8221; So that&#8217;s effectively what I did. I just started finding companies. I think the first key thing about being an angel is you have to come up with some sort of thesis. Why are you investing? Are you investing to make money? Are you investing to have a social impact? Are you investing for whatever your thesis is?</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
And then you need to know what your constraints on your investments are. I&#8217;m a developer, so I called my investment firm Deploy Capital because it&#8217;s just like deploy code or deploy whatever. I said Deploy Capital. And then the idea is that I want to invest in people that are working at a company. They&#8217;ve got some great idea, but they can&#8217;t execute on their idea or their vision because management is saying like, &#8220;This is not a priority right now.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve seen this time and time and time again in companies where there&#8217;s an idea, there&#8217;s a team, there&#8217;s a group of people that have some idea. They can&#8217;t build their idea. They go out, become successful. They build their idea. But then they get reacquired back into some other company who&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, this is actually working.&#8221; So I really want to help the people that are dreamers, that have ideas, that want to build something, but they&#8217;re constrained from a financial aspect. I want to help them grow, and I want to help them build whatever their vision is.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Building a company is not easy. There&#8217;s lots of little steps, but there are lots of tools out right now that make it a lot easier to build a company than it&#8217;s ever been. So if I can just help in any way, shape, or form, give you some help on tooling, give you some intros to investors, help you find talent, those are the types of things that I want to be able to provide and just be a sounding board. What do you think about this?</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So I got into it because I had some extra money, and I thought lots of people that I know are writing money into these companies. One of the things I realized is that investing is how a lot of the wealth in America is created. You put your money into some company, and then the people that are at the company are doing all of the work. You&#8217;re just sitting there, and the value of your thing is going up because other people think that thing is going to go up.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So I kind of got into it because I wanted to make more money. But now I have more of a thesis around it when it comes to the types of investments that I&#8217;ll do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you want to accomplish this year? I mean it sounds like you&#8217;ve got your hands on a lot of different things. I mean you&#8217;ve got your business. You&#8217;re investing. You&#8217;re doing all these other things. What do you want to come out of 2022 having done?</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
I would say that, from my company perspective, I would want to come out of this year with a team that is the size of about 25 people. We have an exciting, growing business. I think we&#8217;re on trajectory to do that. We obviously want more partners that we&#8217;re working with, the best and the brightest in the software engineering space, whether they&#8217;re smart contract developers or React Web3 developers. We&#8217;re looking for those people. So I would want to have that be successful.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
From a family perspective, I want to make sure that as my children are getting ready for life &#8230; They&#8217;re still young and they&#8217;re going into kindergarten. I want to make sure that they&#8217;re getting the best experience they can. When I went to school, I&#8217;m pretty sure most people went to school like this where it&#8217;s you just go wherever is closest to your house. You&#8217;re just in the room with whomever is there, and the teachers are who the teachers are. You don&#8217;t really have any optionality.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
We&#8217;re fortunate enough to be in a position where we have optionality, and I want to make sure that the experiences that they get are better than the experiences that I got as a child. Just overall in life, I want to make sure that I go through 2022 enjoying it because this year has started off so awesome. I&#8217;m really having a great time. I&#8217;ve met a lot of new people. I&#8217;ve met a lot of great friends. I&#8217;m in this perpetual learning loop. I just want to meet more people, spend more time with people. I want COVID to be over so I can go back and hang out with people in the real world.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
I just want to be able to really enjoy life the way I was enjoying it before, but with a little bit more freedom and a little bit more optionality to celebrate and do things that I want to engage in. And then just meet more people, make more friends, build a business with my friends. People that are looking for help, I want to help them build their businesses and build their dreams as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and your work and everything that you&#8217;re doing online?</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Yeah, for sure. The company that I&#8217;m founding is called Atomize, and we are atomize.xyz. If you have any questions for me specifically, you can send me a message at joe@atomize.xyz, and that&#8217;ll come to me. Last time I spoke, I had @joeblau everywhere except for Twitter. I have a funny story. I was actually able to get @joeblau on Twitter, no underscore.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
I traded it with another person named Joseph Blau as well. The trade was that I had to buy him a HomePod and some AirPods, I think AirPods Pro. He sold me the Twitter handle for that. So it&#8217;s pretty funny because if you look at the shipping, it&#8217;s from Joe Blau in wherever, I think I was in Pittsburgh at the time, to Joe Blau where he lives. So it looks like somebody buying themselves something. And then we just got on a call, and we did the trade.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
So if you&#8217;re looking for me online, at J-O-E-B-L-A-U is pretty much the same address everywhere, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, GitHub, Dribbble, everywhere. And then for my angel investing, that is at deploy.capital. So if you have any great ideas and you have some insight that your leadership is overlooking and you think there&#8217;s going to be a great opportunity to build a business, I would love to chat with you about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Joe Blau, I cannot thank you enough for coming back on the show. This show is our ninth anniversary episode. It&#8217;s really special to me, I told you this a little bit before recording, because when I first had you on the show back in 2015, your interview came out. I think it was in February 2015, and I was ready to throw in the towel on Revision Path. I was getting so much flack from the design community and from just random folks out there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do this anymore.&#8221; Your dad wrote me a letter after the interview. I&#8217;m going to read the letter to you because I don&#8217;t know if he ever shared it with you, but he wrote me this letter. I have it printed out above my desk to look at on those days where I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m tired of Revision Path. I want to give this up.&#8221; So I&#8217;m going to read the letter to you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It says, &#8220;Maurice, please accept this email as kudos for your really excellent interview of Joseph Blau. I am not an impartial listener, but rather Joseph&#8217;s dad, Robert Blau. You may even remember his having mentioned me a few times for exposing him to computers at a young age and taking him around the world as a child of a career foreign service officer. In any case, I was so very proud of Joseph&#8217;s performance, both for the content and for his poise and eloquence.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8220;This is also a tribute to you for asking him the kinds of questions that would get him to make the many intelligent comments that he made over the course of the interview. I was especially pleased with the discussion that success is not usually an accident or God given, but rather the product of hard, painstaking work. His time at Virginia Tech brought out those qualities in him, and life has continued to teach him this lesson over and over.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8220;As you noticed and pointed out, he is already successful, but has his sights set on even greater levels of success. So thanks for doing a great job as interviewer and maybe, in the process, giving Joseph the kind of exposure that will help build his corporate brand.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
That&#8217;s amazing. I love my dad because he has a lot of heart. I always notice that when I hang around with him. He has been a pioneer and really a great inspiration to me just in all the things that he&#8217;s done, whether it&#8217;s work ethic or just integrity, character. I really appreciate him sharing that with you and I also appreciate hearing it because him and I, we&#8217;re very close. So I think that it&#8217;s an amazing letter. I&#8217;m glad that it&#8217;s an inspiration that kind of keeps you going.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It came at a time, I mean I was really set to give this up. And then that very next month, I was at South by Southwest and I presented this talk I did called Where are the Black Designers? And then that just completely skyrocketed my career. It skyrocketed this podcast. I don&#8217;t know if I would have done that if I hadn&#8217;t have gotten that push from your dad writing to say, &#8220;You&#8217;re doing a great job. Keep it up.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So thanks to you. Thanks to your dad. You&#8217;re killing it, man. I can&#8217;t wait to see what you got coming up in the future. But thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Joe Blau:</b><br>
Awesome, yeah. I appreciate you having me. Thanks. I would love to come back and follow up maybe later next year or something. We don&#8217;t have to wait seven years between shows next time.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the start of a new year, and I think we could probably all use something to make us feel more resilient and motivated. Well lucky for you, I&#8217;ve got just the thing &#8212; our conversation with the dynamic and talented Nichelle Pace. As the president and founder of <a href="https://brandenchanting.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Brand Enchanting Media</a>, Nichelle brings over 20 years of experience to the table to help her clients with a variety of creative services.</p>
<p>After a brief 2020 recap, Nichelle talked about her process for working with clients, and we spoke about why she started the consultancy and how the market has changed as culture changes. She also spoke on growing up in New Jersey, as well as her previous careers in film and video production and advertising. We even talked about her popular blog Stylemom and how Black bloggers from the early 2000s grew into some of the cultural trendsetters we know today. Kick off the year with some great inspiring talk from Nichelle!</p>

(Sound familiar?)</p>
<p>We talked about what Gabrielle has learned since starting The:nublk, Black people we should look out for in the British creative scene, some of the coolest projects she&#8217;s worked with, and her advice for creatives who need a push. I&#8217;m really interested in seeing what Gabrielle&#8217;s next move will be!</p>
