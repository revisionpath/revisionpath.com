Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>Joseph Carter-Brown is a man of many titles. He&#8217;s a UX strategist. He&#8217;s a human-centered designer. And by day, he&#8217;s the global UX manager at Stanley Black &amp; Decker, a Fortune 500 company that&#8217;s over 175 years old! Joseph&#8217;s versatility as a design leader extends far beyond titles, as you&#8217;ll definitely discover in this week&#8217;s interview.</p>
<p>We start off with a look at his work and his team, and he shares an anecdote from last year that put him on his current path to success. Joseph also talked to me about how he worked his way into a position at Apple thanks to Steve Jobs, his shift to UX after studying at Full Sail University, and speaks on his time with AIGA Baltimore and about how he wants to bridge the digital divide in Baltimore. Joseph is a prime example of someone who is using his skills to help build a more equitable future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I&#8217;m Joseph Carter-Brown. I am a user experience, service design and design strategy specialist. I&#8217;ve been in design for over 20 years. Started as a kid. I am currently the global UX manager for Stanley Black &#038; Decker, and I&#8217;m leading a team of user experience designers, strategists, and researchers helping to bring user experience in the user-centered design focus toward our digital brand and overall design culture.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. We definitely will talk more about your work at Stanley Black &#038; Decker just a little bit later. But right now, how has 2021 been treating you so far?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
2021 has actually treated me really well. I just bought a house about a few, well, two weeks ago now. So that was coming from a kid who had to be rather scrappy throughout childhood and growing up and get into an opportunity to say I can make that happen for myself was such an honor for me really. So far it&#8217;s been treating me really well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Over this past year or so, have you picked up on any like new habits or behaviors about yourself?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I had this latent introversion that I&#8217;ve regained. It&#8217;s really funny because a lot of my work as we&#8217;ve talked about previously about with AIG Baltimore, and working in this often front facing space where I had to be in front of people, I got used to being an extrovert, and over the pandemic, it reminded me that I actually kind of just like small understated experiences, hiking, getting away from people, not being around a whole lot of people. It&#8217;s been a way of rekindling my love for maybe just myself in those small interactions.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I feel like everyone has gotten closer to their true self in some aspects because of this time, because we just had to spend so much time quarantined or isolated from other people.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. I think it&#8217;s one of those things where I know when the pandemic starting I had, or especially when it really hit, my daughter&#8217;s birthday, my daughter&#8217;s 10th birthday was March 13th, 2020 and I had-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. I had this whole amazing surprise trip for her. We were going to go somewhere we had never been. I designed a website for it. I did all of these things and then I had to cancel that over just the day before we were supposed to leave and it was supposed to happen. I had this new job opportunity lined up that got washed away. My girlfriend is a nurse and so I was nervous about her going into work. My ex-wife got sick with COVID actually. So I&#8217;m concerned about, is she going to be sick? I kind of had to take a step back and just sit and do a lot of reading and look at myself and say, &#8220;No matter what happens, who are you?&#8221; I had to ask myself that question and really go inside for a while and understand my values and myself as a person. So I think that was an important moment. Fortunately, everybody&#8217;s okay. Everybody&#8217;s so safe and healthy in all of that. But it was definitely a moment of reflection for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. I bet. That&#8217;s a lot. Wow.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, just more gray hairs on my head is it seems to [inaudible 00:08:55].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So let&#8217;s talk about your work at Stanley Black &#038; Decker, which, I mean, in case people don&#8217;t know, that is a huge, huge business. Of course, you can probably infer from the name of the company. There&#8217;s two brands, Stanley Black &#038; Decker. There&#8217;s like a dozen or so brands of consumer goods and manufacturing goods and stuff. The business has been around for over 150 years. You serve as their global UX manager. Tell me a bit about what you do.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, so it&#8217;s probably as daunting as it sounds. I am there to really help bring a structure to how they approach digital brand engagements. I have a team of about six or seven designers, strategists and researchers, and we&#8217;re currently working on really working to reshape the way user experience is done throughout the global brand. One of the things I find interesting is with this old, long in the tooth organization, a lot of their understanding of the digital space is also growing. So there&#8217;s a lot of teaching that we have to do, a lot of mindset shift that we have to do. So it&#8217;s a lot of work in helping teams internally understand how to collaborate because so much of it for so long has been about working to&#8230; People build their silos and people working in these very tight knit groups.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I&#8217;m kind of the kick in the door type of person like, &#8220;No, we bring everything together. We show our work. We show our dirt. We show our ugly and we just go and we work together and we build this together.&#8221; Sometimes that&#8217;s a little bit uncomfortable for people and especially for teams that are used to having this very tight-knit, close-fisted environment. So it&#8217;s a lot about really organizational transformation, as much as it&#8217;s about digital transformation within the organization. It feels like we&#8217;re kind of tackling both right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m glad that you mentioned that about kind of the work that you&#8217;re doing, focus on the global brand, because I was even thinking, as I was doing research for this interview, like where does UX come into a company like Stanley Black &#038; Decker? I would imagine maybe for the actual websites or something, I&#8217;m not sure. I mean, when you say the global brand, can you talk about just what some of those touch points are?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. So one of the really tricky things that we&#8217;re dealing with is we&#8217;re a global brand. So we have to think about not just how say Black &#038; Decker site is presented to someone in the US. We have to think about how it presents in Latin America, Germany, Asia, Australia, all of these places. So it really about understanding, dealing with cultural difference, cultural expectation, cultural norms. It has a lot to do with understanding just communication and setting proper expectations. It&#8217;s also about not just control, but flexibility and letting go, like where do you compromise and where do you let go of the reins and understand that you can&#8217;t do everything. So some of it&#8217;s about just creating guides and helping people move in the direction that you like them to be.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
But yeah, so a lot of our work is particularly around the website and the digital experience to start. But when I look at user experience, I like to call user experience the customer service of branding. It&#8217;s the thing that you have to do where you have to think about how every step of the way is managed, and especially now, I mean, the key touch points that we have are digital, right? All of us have probably been in our houses, at home and doing everything virtually. So the experience that you create in the digital space is so much more important now, but it&#8217;s been going that way for so long. So I think that it has a big role to play on the external end, and then on the internal end, I think that there&#8217;s the aspect of user experience or maybe an offshoot of it, which is called service design, which is an area where I tend to specialize, which is really about coordinating teams and internal components to make sure that what you&#8217;re creating is actually feasible for those externally.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So one of my favorite examples or illustrations of that is I used to always work with people, especially when I was in an agency, and everybody would come and say, there was a time where everybody would come and say, &#8220;We want a blog.&#8221; These companies are like, &#8220;We need to engage with people. We&#8217;re going to have a blog and then everybody&#8217;s going to come to our blog.&#8221; But then you start to dig in into it and you say, &#8220;Well, how are you going to support this blog?&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll do a couple of posts a week.&#8221; &#8220;Well, who&#8217;s writing those posts?&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221; &#8220;Okay. Do you have the time to do that?&#8221; &#8220;Not really. I&#8217;ll make my assistant do it.&#8221; &#8220;Okay. Does your assistant know how to write?&#8221; &#8220;No, not really.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Service design is really about making sure that ensuring really, I would say an equitable user experience by making sure that you&#8217;re serving the internal components in a way that&#8217;s feasible, because it&#8217;s like if you&#8217;re going to start a process that you can actually support, or you&#8217;re not willing to put the resources up to support, then what&#8217;s going to happen is you&#8217;re going to put something out there that won&#8217;t support the people that you intend it for and you&#8217;re just going to fall short. So either divert your plan or put your money where your mouth is. I think that&#8217;s another of, important part that user experience plays with the service design discipline and something that I think we play as a role within Stanley Black &#038; Decker is understanding feasibility and not just let&#8217;s create something and throw it out there and hope that users want to interact with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I would say also just because of the types of deliverables, goods, et cetera that you make, because it works in so many different types of fields, in different parts of the country, different parts of the world, et cetera, there&#8217;s almost a expectation of that reliability anyway.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Oh, for sure. I think that really important part of it is that experience extends from the product that you make that&#8217;s tangible to just, again, those intangible interactions that you have. That&#8217;s why, like I said, I think it&#8217;s the customer service of branding. If I need to reach out to customer service, if I need to register a product, if I need to do any of these things, if you hinder my process any way throughout it, I&#8217;m going to get annoyed. I&#8217;m someone who&#8217;s a stickler for poor customer service. I mean, I&#8217;ve grown up in a service environment. My family was service-oriented. I worked for Apple and that was all about customer service. So I&#8217;ve just grown up about service. So when I have bad customer service, when I see bad, just things that aren&#8217;t thoughtful, I tend to get a little bit frustrated. So I try to put that into the work that I do as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does an average day look like for you? I mean, you mentioned you have this team of researchers and strategists, but how many people are reporting to you? Do you have a lot of meetings? How does an average day work?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. We tend to have a whole lot of meetings and that can be a little bit daunting at times. You got to kind of block out your calendar to make sure that you make some time for yourself. On an average day, so I have six reports, four direct reports, and then two other members on my team who also kind of filter up to me. So in total, my entire team, including myself, is seven people with two of them being in the strategist research realm and the rest really being more on design, development, or even engineering side of things. On a given day, it might be batting a number of meetings and working on strategies for some particular projects that are working on being launched. Sometimes it&#8217;s just kind of creating communications because so much of what we do, and I have to often remind my team that there&#8217;s a part of what we do, which is selling. It&#8217;s not just about creating the deliverable and it&#8217;s not just about getting it done, but it&#8217;s about selling to other executives within the company why the work we&#8217;re doing is valuable.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So one of the main things here is that it&#8217;s been&#8230; My team, in fact, I started in September of 2020, and my team really started maybe a month or two before me and then I came in to lead the team. So it&#8217;s still relatively new, but a lot of my day to day is really just working on testing plans, research plans, deliverable plans for visual designs and website launch projects that we&#8217;re working on, kind of looking at what&#8217;s on the horizon and trying to see what a little bit past the horizon to set a plan, making sure&#8230; It&#8217;s kind of like being a coach in a lot of ways, making sure all of the pieces are in the right place so that right in front of your face it can be handled, but also having the other pieces in place looking down the line to see what might be coming and then making a plan for that. So sometimes I like to call it building the plane while you&#8217;re flying it, but that&#8217;s a lot of what my days are like.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. I mean, I can imagine that&#8217;s a lot to sort of juggle even with not that many reports. I mean, it sort of trickles down because of how large your organization is.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, and there&#8217;s so many different stakeholders that you have to take into account. So a lot of times, I&#8217;ll try to make sure I&#8217;m having temperature checks, even today we had our team meeting and I had just a temperatures are like, &#8220;How&#8217;s everybody feeling? Where are you frustrated? Where do you need help? Where can I be providing&#8230;&#8221; Sometimes it&#8217;s kind of like the player-coach idea even. Sometimes it&#8217;s like, all right, I need to stop looking so high level, jump down in the weeds with the rest of the team and just knock some things out. Sometimes it&#8217;s like, okay, let me take a step back, see what&#8217;s on the horizon, help set up a plan, put pieces together. Sometimes it&#8217;s working with other leaders throughout the organization, just kind of understand where their concerns are, where their focus is, and then help set a plan for, okay, this is how we&#8217;re going to kind of help support you. There&#8217;s definitely a lot to juggle.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;ve said you&#8217;ve only been there since September. So you started fairly recently. I bring that up because there was an incident last year that happened that sort of brought you into this new role. Can you talk about what happened?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, so it was a really interesting thing that happened. I was working for a publishing company, and when the pandemic hit, like I mentioned, there was another job opportunity that kind of got nuked because of the pandemic. At the time, I&#8217;d grown a little bit leery of some of the practices, just the way the organization was treating people. As I kind of set and watched again, really had to do that introspection of who am, I would do I believe in, I started noticing that&#8230; We were publishing a site, it was a financial publishing firm, and we had a new site that if you imagine who your common financial investor type might be who has a lot of money and is trying to figure out ways to make more money, you can probably imagine they&#8217;re a little more conservative, a little more right leaning. I&#8217;m someone who believes that, hey, people can have their voice as long as you&#8217;re not challenging anyone or my humanity, then you get to have your views.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
We had a site that I&#8217;d kind of build a strategy around that was geared a little bit more to write conservative views. I noticed that over the time it was getting a little bit more&#8230; The editors were getting a little bit more sensationalist, which was something that I told them ethically I didn&#8217;t agree with early on. As I kind of watched the pandemic unfold and I started watching the conversations around it, and there was this long thread in April into may about the adverse and disproportionate effects of the pandemic on black people, brown people and underrepresented groups in general, I started noticing that this news site never mentioned any of that. So I went, &#8220;Well, this is kind of strange.&#8221; There&#8217;s been a lot of conversation around this. Why wouldn&#8217;t you mention this?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I just kind of kept my eye on it and in some of our team meetings, I was planning to bring it up, but I didn&#8217;t get the opportunity because I had to miss one and some different things happened. But in missing one of those and having to skip a couple, around the time just before our next ones, the Arbery killing had happened.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I said, &#8220;Well, let me go check in and see how they&#8217;re talking about it,&#8221; and there was no mention of it. I go, &#8220;Well, this guy&#8217;s name doesn&#8217;t show up. Why wouldn&#8217;t this be&#8230; This is news. Why aren&#8217;t you talking about this?&#8221; Then around the same time, there was the first mention of the disproportionate effects of the pandemic was labeled as people are getting worse effected in blue states than red states. I go, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a really disgusting way to talk about people, talk about humans and kind of not talk about the&#8230; I&#8217;m going to talk about the race disparity and the systematic racism that provides the reason for some of this, but you can talk about blue versus red as a way to dehumanize.&#8221; So Ahmaud Arbery happened. Then there was the, what was it, Amy Cooper situation that happened with the woman calling-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, in Central Park, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Cooper situation that happened with those [crosstalk 00:23:02].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. In Central Park? Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Right. So that happened. We had Brianna Taylor started to get brought up and no words about any of these and I&#8217;m going, &#8220;There&#8217;s so many reasons to talk about this.&#8221; Then, of course, there was George Floyd and at this point, steam is coming out of my ears and I&#8217;m going, &#8220;There&#8217;s no way you missed this one, right? No way.&#8221; They never talked about it until that Friday after when there were some riots and protests got a little more violent. The first mention of it was, was the headline that said &#8220;Black man&#8217;s death while in police custody sparks riots arson and looting.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
That was when I just banged on the desk and said, &#8220;Come on, guys. This can&#8217;t be the way you&#8217;re doing it. You&#8217;re leaving me no option here.&#8221; So, in one of our next team meetings, the next week, I asked them and I just brought it up, straight up and explained it the way I just explained it to you and said, &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s wrong here?&#8221; First, got a lot of mealy-mouth responses of like, &#8220;Oh, well we just didn&#8217;t know how to explain it and so many of our readers are racist and we don&#8217;t want our advertisers to think that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. So at that point, my heels were dug in and I&#8217;m a pretty stubborn person when I want to be, so I was just like, &#8220;We&#8217;re having this conversation.&#8221; Our organization was rather small. I was one of only two Black people and the other Black person in the organization, she spoke up and said, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ve actually noticed this too and I&#8217;m uncomfortable with it.&#8221; There was a lot of dismissing of the ideas, going, &#8220;Oh, you just don&#8217;t get it. You don&#8217;t understand. Oh, well, who cares? This isn&#8217;t a big deal. You&#8217;re just angry. You&#8217;re just this, that and the other.&#8221; Never was there a moment where somebody said, &#8220;Hey, how about you help us here? How can we fill these blind spots?&#8221; I&#8217;m going, &#8220;You&#8217;re clearly just not valuing the voices.&#8221; So, like I said, that was of that moment where I really had to look at myself and I said, &#8220;Well, I make these websites. I&#8217;m the catalyst that makes this whole thing go.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I said, &#8220;One more minute of time to this organization is supporting this kind of White supremacist culture and racist, if you&#8217;re not overtly racist, you&#8217;re aiding and abetting racists within your readership and you&#8217;re making a comfortable space for them. So I said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do that.&#8221; So the next day I just said, &#8220;I&#8217;m out. I can&#8217;t do it anymore. Effective immediately, I&#8217;m gone,&#8221; and this was beginning of June. So, unfortunately, like I said, there were some things that happened from a just personal/moral standing that made me a little bit questionable about them. So, unfortunately, I was saving as much money as I could and I had enough in the nest to cushion myself for a little while, but yeah, it was definitely a crazy moment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, props to you for not only standing up in that situation, but also being able to walk away from it, especially, during such a unpredictable time. You definitely upgraded, so that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Thank you. Again, it was a scary moment, but the thing is it really also brought to mind for me was it made me really sad because this was an organization that even though I was part of one of the smaller divisions, it was a actually, rather big organization, about 1600 employees in the Baltimore area. They have multiple divisions and a lot of different things that are happening and it just made me sad for the people who didn&#8217;t have that choice, who didn&#8217;t have the cushion or the opportunity, the privilege, to say, &#8220;I can step back on my laurels,&#8221; and they kind of had the grinning bear it.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I thought about all of the Black and Brown, LGBTQ people and all of these different things, women who just have to deal with many of the sexist views that are getting put out there, because you got to survive and it&#8217;s like, I can&#8217;t blame you, but it just really made me kind of sad that people, we still have to deal with that type of thing. I hate to say, we still have to, because I feel like that&#8217;s such a cliche thing to say, but yeah, it just made me really sad that that was a thing that I had to fight over and then leave a job over. It couldn&#8217;t have been a situation where they say, &#8220;Huh, you know what? Let us at least reflect. Let us be honest about it. Let us be open about it.&#8221; It was more of like, &#8220;Eh, too bad, so sad.&#8221; I was even told, &#8220;We work for the mob, get over it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Well, I guess, in a way, that is sort of honest. They&#8217;re not covering it up with a black square on Instagram or anything. They&#8217;re just letting you know right out, flat out. Wow. Let&#8217;s turn the page from that. Now, I know you grew up here in Atlanta, so tell me, what it was like for you growing up here and being exposed to art and design and everything?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I moved from Baltimore when I was about nine or 10 and came to Atlanta. Atlanta was a culture shock for me. Baltimore has this reputation or this nickname of Smalltimore. You have a lot of small little communities and you can interact with a lot of different cultures and a lot of different environments and I really loved a lot of that with within Baltimore. Even though Baltimore has kind of a racist history with a number of things that happened and I think I had rather diverse group of friends I remember as a kid and classmates and different things like that. Coming into Atlanta, it was one of those things where you really saw the way things were separated. We moved just before the Olympics came, so it was &#8217;91, &#8217;92 and there was still the conversation of like the Techwood community in Atlanta getting, basically, a really heavy conversation around gentrification where they moved a whole group of people to make way for the Olympic village. They wanted to, basically, get rid of the undesirables and my family was in community activism.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
My dad was a musician, but also a very active in Black rights and just speaking up for people. If you are familiar with Hosea Williams, Hosea Williams was like my grandfather. I really look at him in that light. We always were doing Hosea&#8217;s Feed the Hungry, Feed the Homeless. We were always doing different things around that and spent a lot of time around him and with him my dad worked with Curtis Mayfield, so I spent some time [crosstalk 00:29:46] with him. So it was an interesting thing to come in and be in this environment where I didn&#8217;t talk like the other other Black kids. I didn&#8217;t have the same type of accent. I didn&#8217;t have all of those types of beings. So it was also interesting because I also had to deal a lot with identity in terms of how people perceived me. A lot of Black kids going, &#8220;Oh, why don&#8217;t you talk so White?&#8217; I was just like, &#8220;&#8221;No, this is how I talk. This is just me. I&#8217;m not trying to be anything. I have zero interest in being anything other than myself, but this is just how I talk.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Having to go to a school in Sandy Springs, in fact, and deal with overtly racist, attitudes and being called the N-word in class and the kid basically getting sent to the principal for a little bit and coming right back with no extra conversation about it. When my dad had asked the principal why there was no further conversation, he just says, &#8220;Ah, Black kids, you got to punish. White kids, you just give them a look and they&#8217;re good.&#8221; So there were so many little things and even just the idea of not getting that opportunity to be recognized for my abilities, having a teacher who I felt like I clashed a lot with, I didn&#8217;t respond to really. Yeah, I really didn&#8217;t have any response to the point where I was missing work and doing all those things, to having a new teacher come in, a substitute, for a little while who really said, &#8220;Oh, actually you&#8217;re pretty good at math. Why are you doing this math class? Why are you doing the remedial math when you should actually be doing advanced math?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Then going, &#8220;Oh, he actually does know something,&#8221; and just those feelings of being ostracized in so many spaces which really led me to being homeschooled. While that was a challenge, it was difficult adjusting to that. I was, what, 10, 11, going, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t have to go to school today? I guess I can just hang out and watch cartoons now, right?&#8221; To having to learn, &#8220;Oh, wait, I got to go and get it on my own. I got to figure this out,&#8221; and that was actually how I got into design. I was a tinkerer. I like to call myself a hacker, in that sense, in the sense of being a tinkerer. I like to take apart electronics and try and put them back together to see if I can get them working again. I like to just mess with things and see what I could figure out about it, see what the underpinnings of things were.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I get an old computer from a thrift store and take it apart and see if I can get it working again. But I was also really interested in journalism. Probably when I was about 14 or 15, I was super into sports in general, but I was really heavily into it then and especially basketball. I wrote these five or six, maybe more, articles of just original content for myself and I designed it in Microsoft Publisher at the time, just on my family&#8217;s a old computer and was really proud of it, printed it out as this newsletter. My dad wanted to share it with everybody and I wanted to print out a new copy of it after he had given all of them away. When I went to open it, the file corrupted and I lost all of my work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, and again, being very service-oriented, the first thing I said to myself was, &#8220;Never, again. I&#8217;m going to figure out how to not have this happen ever again.&#8221; So it really just sent me down this rabbit hole of everything I could learn about computers at that point. I started reading every little thing I could about the inner workings of computers and then it just kind of bubbled up. At that point it was the early stages of the web, really, and I was getting online and I think there was an opportunity. GeoCities was a thing and it was like, &#8220;Well, you can create your own website.&#8221; So I said, &#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll do that,&#8221; and started messing around with it, but the little Wizywig system and it wasn&#8217;t really anything to me and it was very limited. So I said, &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s this Advance tab?&#8221; And it just gave me a blank screen.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I went, &#8220;Well, this is cool. This is kind of what I&#8217;m looking at. This It&#8217;s an opportunity.&#8221; So I started learning HTML and code and just absorbing everything I could, picking up every book. My dad always taught me, &#8220;If you can read it, you can learn it.&#8221; So I was just like, &#8220;Well, let me go and learn everything I can about web design now and coding, HTML and CSS and Java and JavaScript, XML, and all of these different things and what does this do?&#8221; I ended up building some websites and I was like, &#8220;Well, this should probably look good. This is not enough, just HTML and at the time, CSS was barely a speck. So I was like, &#8220;Well, let me learn everything. Let me figure out how to make it look good.&#8221; My mom was really a catalyst for me. She worked at Kinko&#8217;s and this is Kinko&#8217;s still had a computer services department, so I would get in really good with the computer services guys. A lot of them were nerds. They loved computers, so they loved that I liked tinkering with stuff.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So they would show me little tricks and ways of working in the command line and then the more design-oriented guys were like, &#8220;Let me show you this program. We call it Photoshop.&#8221; I started learning how to make things in Photoshop. They had CDs on Illustrator and Photoshop training. So I would just sit and absorb everything I could from that and really just taught myself Photoshop and Illustrator. It went from there. I learned everything I could about everything computers and I thought learning Photoshop, maybe a designer, I&#8217;d learn it the hard way. That was not the case.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
When I realized I didn&#8217;t know what DPI or PPI was and I was trying to print something and it kept coming out really small and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;But on my screen, it&#8217;s so big. It was like, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s because the resolution is off.&#8221; But that really pushed me down this line. I was also a huge lover of Apple and that was really where I found my love of branding. It was seeing something that connected with me where it wasn&#8217;t just this rote memory. It was about a connection and it was about something that made me feel like I had value. I had somebody talking to me and when they were talking to the weird ones and I really got into learning everything I could about Apple, again, immersing myself in that. We talked a little bit about the Art Institute of Atlanta and there was a center right across from that in Northside where there&#8217;s this office building and it had an Apple logo on it.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
It had this Apple Market Center and they did free seminars and so I just started going to those. I&#8217;m 15, 16 years old. I&#8217;d go to the Art Institute with my sister. She&#8217;s seven years older than me and so I&#8217;d go to the school with her and I walk over to the Apple Market Center and hang out with these business owners and learn as much as I could about new software and new products and I started learning all of that. Then I&#8217;d go over to the school and I&#8217;d get in really good with the tech guys and help them rebuild the networks and they&#8217;d let me use the computers. I&#8217;d sit in classes and nobody knew I wasn&#8217;t a student, so that was my way of stealing my education for a little bit. So it was this really unorthodox path that I took and I can keep going on and on, but I&#8217;ve told you more than you need to know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But back in the day, that&#8217;s how you had to learn it. There weren&#8217;t really university programs or things like that. You kind of picked up a little bit from a book or you reverse engineered something by viewing source or you picked things up here and there and that cobbled together into how you learned how to use the web and build the web back then. I remember those times very vividly.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
It definitely was a lot about, again, that hacker mentality, like taking it apart and deconstructing it and trying to rebuild it, seeing if you took this one piece and put it over here, what would happen and what&#8217;s the response you&#8217;d get? I think that was what I really loved about a lot of the design and what I still love about design as part of that, some of the user experience stuff is, I like to call it &#8216;the science of art,&#8217; in a lot of ways. It&#8217;s like that you take a hypothesis and you iterate off of it, you test it, see what happens and you adjust your test and see what reaction you get from that and I just love those types of things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm, nice. Now you attended Full Sail University, but before that, you mentioned this Apple training center, but you actually got your first job at Apple. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. My first job was at Apple. I was 18. I opened the Apple store at Lenox Square Mall, in fact. I probably borderline, stalker energy in that time, but I was so infatuated with Steve Jobs. He was someone who, when you saw the way he talked with so much passion and I just saw the vision that he brought to things and, again, that experience. It was something that just resonated with me and then I just read so much about his story and his struggles. He was someone that I saw as maybe a person that I could emulate, in some ways, or even just someone that I could have. I felt like if he could do it, I could do it. Obviously, it wasn&#8217;t like he was like super poor, but he also went through a lot of hardship in life.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
He had to go through a lot to get to where he was. He got kicked out of Apple early on and had to go through this whole journey and he had this triumph that came back to Apple, because I was always just inspired by him as a person in his story. I read so much on, again, the growth and birth of Silicon Valley, which also included him in those stories. I remember where I mentioned the bordering stalker energy was like, &#8220;I want to reach out to him. I want to make contact with him. I got to send him an email.&#8221; So I searched everywhere to see if I could find his email. What was it? Think I was going to the Apple Market Center. I met a few Apple employees and someone had given me their card and I realized the naming convention for their email addresses. So I was like, &#8220;Well, if this is how your email is patterned, maybe his email is patterned the same way.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I sent an email to Sjobs@apple. I think the first time just emailed and said, &#8220;Hey, is this a person?&#8217; I got no response and then I sent another email and I said, &#8220;Hey, look, if this is actually Steve Jobs, I just want to thank you because I&#8217;m a homeschool kid and the work and creative in education has really inspired me. It&#8217;s helped me find what I want to do in life. I didn&#8217;t know where I was going and now I feel like I have had this path. So I&#8217;m really appreciative of what you&#8217;ve done with the company and the focus you brought, because it&#8217;s really helped give me a direction.&#8221; So, and I was, like I said, 15 or 16 at the time and he responded. He said, &#8220;Thanks,&#8221; and that was all he said.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, for me, it was like a ping. It was like [crosstalk 00:41:24] So I said, &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s someone there.&#8221; So then I just went off and then this was when they were working on the Mac OS X.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh my gosh.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I was following all of the development of Mac OS X and I emailed him and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hey Steve, this would be a great feature to include in Mac OS X.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
This was a wild story. I&#8217;m sorry, I just have to interject. Keep going, Keep going, though, keep going.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I would send him little emails and I&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Hey, what about this feature? What if you added spring loaded folders to this thing?&#8221; I just started giving them all these ideas. He would never respond, but every now and then I would see one of those ideas pop up in a build and I&#8217;d like to take credit for it, but it was when they had announced that they were opening Apple stores and I was super excited for it. I was about 17 and I said, &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s surely going to be a store announced for Atlanta. Why wouldn&#8217;t there be?&#8221; When they announced the first 10, 11 stores, they had all of these stores, LA, Washington, DC, so on and so forth, but none on the roadmap for Atlanta. So I sent him this really angry email and I said, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m really disappointed that Apple does not have a plan for a store in Atlanta. If you&#8217;re saying that your goal for Apple is to double your market share, because at the time Apple was what, two-and-a-half percent market share and you want to double it from two-and-a-half to 5%?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
The fact that you don&#8217;t have Atlanta on your list of stores means that you&#8217;re not that serious about this idea because Atlanta has a huge creative community. It&#8217;s got one of the busiest airports in the country, in the world, if anything, a huge tourist community, a huge creative community, all of the markets and verticals that are within Apple&#8217;s range of market. So for you not to have a store on the pipeline here means that you must not be that serious and especially as someone who really loves these computers, I just want to have some access to them. So I hope that you all change your course and you decide to open a store in Atlanta. So a few hours go by and I get an email from a recruiter and she says, Dear Joseph, Mr. Jobs forwarded your email over to me. Please send your resume and cover letter at your earliest convenience. Again, I&#8217;m a 17-year-old kid and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;A who? A resume and a what?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I went and had to develop that really quickly and sent an email. At this time they actually didn&#8217;t even have a store on the pipeline. Again, that stalker energy, one of the ways you would know where Apple&#8217;s roadmap was, is you would look at their jobs page and they would put out, &#8220;We&#8217;re looking for employees in this place,&#8221; and people would go, &#8220;Oh, that must be a store.&#8221; So there was no openings in Atlanta for anything like that. Then, probably about six months later there was a thing where they had openings for a store or they had employee calls in Atlanta I was reaching out to the recruiter and she reached out and she was like, &#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s going to be slow, but we got your information.&#8221; I think she was just kind of being like, &#8220;Cool out, kid,&#8221; but yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So next thing I know I was getting a call and interviewing with the recruiter at 17 and just about to turn 18. The next thing I know in April of 2002, I was going into the training as the one of only two full-time Mac specialists to open the Apple store at Lenox Square Mall in come I think May, or I think it was about May was when we opened the store and it was all thanks to sending an email to Steve jobs. I was actually kind of sad when he died, just for obvious reasons, but a week prior, I had thought about him. I looked at where I had gone from that point and I said, &#8220;I should email him and say, &#8216;Hey, you probably didn&#8217;t think anything of sending this email over. You probably thought you were just getting me out of your hair, but you really kind of changed a lot for me.'&#8221; So, but yeah, that&#8217;s the Apple story.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
And that was from your first job? Wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Actually, outside of working as a dishwasher in a [crosstalk 00:45:42] restaurant as under the table [crosstalk 00:45:46] my dad, I was 14, but yes, my first legitimate job.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
That is quite a story. Wow. The fact that he even responded back and was forwarding your emails and everything, it just goes to show you, you have to be persistent. Nowadays, I guess that would be a bit stalkery, but-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; days, I guess that kind of would be a bit stalkery, but back then I don&#8217;t know how many people were really using email in that way, like they are now. But wow. That&#8217;s something.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. Again, it goes back to the idea of what I like to call a stealing shots. And sometimes you just got to find that sliver of opportunity and shoot and you might make it, you might miss it, but you got to shoot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So while you were at Apple, is that when you started going to full sale or was it after?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
No, it was actually, well after that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I branded myself as an anti-traditionalist for a long time. I think it was the homeschool [inaudible 00:46:43] and at the time of being homeschooled&#8230; This was before homeschooling got, I guess you could say popular. At the time people didn&#8217;t think&#8230; I would tell them I was homeschooled and they just were like, &#8220;Oh, so you&#8217;re just dumb,&#8221; or whatever. And so there was a lot of stigma around it and I was always like, okay, I&#8217;m going to buck the trend. I tend to try and buck trends. And so I started working at Apple and I was like, well, I&#8217;ve learned all of this stuff. I used to read business books, I used to do this, that and the other. I was like, &#8220;Well, I could figure it out. I&#8217;ll do it on my own.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I just kind of kept trying to do it, I guess you could say the hard way, but it was also cool. You know what I mean? I had an opportunity just from the knowledge and the, I guess the value that I&#8217;d shown even at Apple and things like that. I taught at The Creative Circus in Atlanta, taught some design classes and so forth. I didn&#8217;t even have a degree really. So I just kind of did my own thing for a really long time. And it wasn&#8217;t until 2012 that I attended full sail. And it was really era in which after the great recession, I worked at a newspaper prior. And at the time I started up a small clothing company with some friends, and we ran that for about seven years, from 2007 to 2014.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
But in around 2008, 2009, I had gotten laid off from a job at a newspaper in the ad department because it was a newspaper. So I lost that job. And it was also again around the economic downturn. And so I was this guy who felt confident in my abilities. I felt like, hey, I can figure anything out. You can put anything in front of me and I will tackle it and I will figure it out. But I was now this guy without a degree in environment where there were people who had 10 years experience and a degree, and they had all of this stuff behind them and they were also in the market.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
And so I just kind of found it where I was really struggling to get a lot of opportunities or get a lot of second looks. And I&#8217;d also had a little bit of a chip on my shoulder or a complex even about again. Then you hear a lot of the way people, again, talk bad about being homeschooled. I didn&#8217;t have formal training. I didn&#8217;t have all this. So part of me was like, well, can I do it? Can I figure it out? If I&#8217;m tested, how will I respond? And do I have the foundation?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You kind of felt like you had something to prove in a way to yourself.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. I needed to prove it to myself more than anything that I could just follow through with something and finish it. And so, yeah, I entered into full sales, online graphic design program and had done that from 2012 and then graduated in 2015.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How was the program? I know that as a, I think as a for-profit school full sale kind of tends to get left out of conversations when people talk about design slash art schools to go to, to really sort of get into the industry. But I mean full sale places a lot of people in the creative fields.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. Full sale was interesting for me. And I think that you do see some of that for-profit mentality come in where there is a bit of a what some people might call a degree factory mindset that is there in the sense that, hey, if you are willing to give them your money, they will take it. But if you are willing to hold them accountable for taking your money, you will also get a lot of value out of that. And for me, it was one of those things where again, I was doing the online program and I think that I succeeded because I&#8217;d already had this scrappy mentality. I was already used to figuring things out and going and finding my way. And so when I went to school, it was also, I was always kind of like against the idea of student loans and all of that, especially where I had seen people who had been saddled with all this debt and didn&#8217;t know what they were doing in life, or didn&#8217;t know, had felt like they wasted their time.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I was like, I&#8217;m not wasting my time. If I&#8217;m paying for this, I&#8217;m getting my money&#8217;s worth. And so I kind of went in with this attitude that like, I&#8217;m paying you are going to give me the same treatment you give your students in person. And I think for people who have gone there in person, they got a great experience. I saw a lot of people who went there online and they didn&#8217;t have that mentality, or they didn&#8217;t know how to go out and just dig and be scrappy for what they want it. And they kind of just fell through. Some of them fell off. Some of them were ending their school in some ways graduating and I&#8217;m looking at it going, oh, that work is not that great.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
But like I said, that was the degree factory of it. But like I said, I went in and I had a goal. I knew what I wanted out of it and I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to kind of make you teach me and do what I need you to do because I&#8217;m paying you this money.&#8221; And actually I had some great interactions with teachers. I learned a lot, I got a lot out of it, but I think it&#8217;s really all about what you make it. And I think it was, but I think that&#8217;s with any school, right. It&#8217;s what you make it. And I think they were good for what I wanted to get out of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting how&#8230; I think school in general can be like that, but particularly those for-profit schools so for graduate school, I went to a for-profit university and then later also taught at the for-profit university. I went to Keller Graduate School of Management and taught at the [inaudible 00:52:23]. And it&#8217;s interesting I think one sort of the perception of course, that people have about for-profit universities and what that means about the value of the education, but then to be on the other side of it and being an instructor there, I definitely get what you mean about the online students and you needing to really have that scrappy mentality to get it done because the online instructors do not care. They are, most of them are literally following a script to go through the course.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They&#8217;re teaching in a very abstract way in that most of these classes will have some type of a discussion forum. And so you may have to have a participation requirement where you speak to students three times a week, five times a week, et cetera. It&#8217;s not really the same as giving a lecture because the lecture is often times have already been made for the course. You&#8217;re just the instructor. You&#8217;re not really teaching it. I guess I might be giving away some secrets here, but like, you&#8217;re not really teaching it. You don&#8217;t even get a chance to make the tests or change the tests. When I taught design at the [inaudible 00:53:29] I was teaching design to business students. It was like a BIS course. And this was maybe 2011, 2012, something like that, I think.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I was surprised that they were still teaching students how to make webpages using tables. And I had to take it all the way up to the dean to say, you are setting students up for failure. If they take this course and they think they&#8217;re going to make webpages out of tables and get a job out in the market. And the dean was sort of like, oh, they&#8217;re business students. It doesn&#8217;t matter. I&#8217;m like it does matter. It matters that they&#8217;re paying for this and we&#8217;re deliberately teaching them old information. I really had to lobby to make it happen. And then once they said, no, I just changed it myself and started teaching more CSS and things like that. And I don&#8217;t know necessarily if the students appreciated it. I ended up getting fired. So it wasn&#8217;t necessarily probably the best thing on my end, but like at least I wanted to make sure that students were getting what they paid for in terms of proper information.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. And I think you rather get caught trying.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. And so I think [inaudible 00:54:38] good on you on that. And again, I think that was how I approached it in terms of being a student, which was I had the teacher&#8217;s email address. I had some kind of messenger option. I might&#8217;ve had, sometimes I had a phone number. So if I didn&#8217;t have the information I needed, I would have&#8230; I was always about building community. So I even built out a online, a Facebook community for some of the&#8230; Especially the students that I saw who kind of gave a damn. I said, &#8220;Hey, you seem like you&#8217;re going to be someone that I want to be connected to. Let&#8217;s have this group where we help each other.&#8221; But I saw other people who were like, oh, I can&#8217;t get this. I don&#8217;t know what to do. And I&#8217;m like, well, go ask the teacher like, &#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t talk to the teacher. I can&#8217;t find them.&#8221; Well, okay, well try something.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:55:25] figure it out. I would call the teacher. I would email them. I would message them. I would call my student advisor and say, &#8220;Hey, I need to talk to this teacher.&#8221; I would be a pain in their butt until they reached out to me because I was like this is&#8230; If I were in campus, I would be able to walk up to you and talk to you. But since I can&#8217;t do it, this is what we have to do now. So either take me seriously or I will make you take me seriously.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
For me, I would have loved if you would have been that kind of student because I can tell you, we get all the instructor in you never hear from the students, ever, unless it&#8217;s them trying to weasel their way out of some excuse or if they got caught, I would catch so many students plagiarizing stuff, which you would think would not be that common in a course about web design, but like they would take tests and some of the tests would have essay questions. And it&#8217;s like, you can tell they just copied and pasted this from some companies about page because the response makes no sense in relation to the question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s like I don&#8217;t even have to run this through Turnitin to know that you didn&#8217;t write this. Where are you getting this from? So the fact that you were that proactive as a student, I hope that your professors and instructors appreciated that because I can tell you from the other side, I would have loved that. It would kill me to see students not do well. And I could tell them come see me during office hours. Let me know if you have any questions and I&#8217;m blue in the face and they do nothing and then fail the course. And then they want to get mad at me and leave me a two-star review. [crosstalk 00:56:58]. It&#8217;s wild. So yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I think that one of the things that I learned there probably more than anything was it was one of those things where I look back at it and so I was valedictorian of my class and things like that. And I kind of looked at that with a little bit of like, eh, who cares? It&#8217;s about the work, as a designer is about the work. And I remember when I first started maybe my first couple quarters, I was doing the work that I knew would get me a passing grade. I&#8217;m a competitive person. I want to do the best, I want to be the best, I don&#8217;t like losing, those types of things. And so there was this moment when I first started, again, I knew Photoshop illustrated all those tools, like the back of my hand.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So we would get projects. I understood the coursework. So I would do it well enough to get an A, but I didn&#8217;t necessarily come out of it learning anything. And I remember toward the end of maybe my second quarter or so, I had to kind of look at myself and I said, you&#8217;re about to pay a lot of money to basically learn the same things you already know, is that really worth it? So I said, okay, so now my new model went because again that competitive aspect of me was like I want to be valedictorian. And they also had this, forget what the award was, but it was like you had the best quality of work. And I was like, I wanted both of those. And so I was like really trying to aim for that. And I was like, but you know what really, I want to learn as much as I can out of this.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I adopted this mentality where [inaudible 00:58:34] I&#8217;m going to try and fail. I was like, I&#8217;m going to do things that are so far out of my comfort zone. I&#8217;m going to go way off of what I know and what I know how to do well. And if I get a good grade awesome. But if I fail, I at least learn. And I kind of went at it with that approach. I ended up getting even better grades and coming out with more fulfilling work and ended up getting both the awards that I was kind of put on&#8230; That I was trying to cheat my way to in a way but also kind of gave me that idea of&#8230; I think prior to that, I was doing a lot of things in a safe manner. And I was trying to just, in some ways in a survival mode. I had been in such a survival mode all my life, where I just wanted to do enough to make sure I could go to sleep somewhere and wake up somewhere and eat something.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
If that&#8217;s what I got, that was good. And when I went into and embraced this idea of you know what, I have another slogan, which I don&#8217;t&#8230; Profanity, I&#8217;m not going to use it, but F S U [inaudible 00:59:36] F up is the term I like to use where it&#8217;s like, if I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing, instead of freezing, I&#8217;m just going to go in and go out in a blaze of glory. And if I fail, okay, but you&#8217;re at least going to be like, man, he did it in a way that nobody can look away from. And I found that that&#8217;s kind of paid off more than it has hurt me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve brought up here on the show before about how black designers kind of really need to have that space to fail. Especially if you&#8217;re approaching the design industry through a more, I guess you could say traditional routes, like if you went to a design school and then from there you started working at a product design company or a tech company or advertising agency or a branding agency or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The constraints are so narrow that there&#8217;s not really any space for you to fail. I wouldn&#8217;t even necessarily say fail, we&#8217;re talking about that certainly in the guise of experimentation, but like everything you do has to work, everything has to succeed. And I think while it&#8217;s great to have that track record, sort of like you were saying, you were kind of just getting by. It wasn&#8217;t until you really were able to break out of that space that you were able to do your best work and it&#8217;s rough that the industry unfortunately doesn&#8217;t really allow for those sorts of spaces. I would say mostly for black designers, but I think of designers probably across the board.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. I definitely think it&#8217;s glaring for black designers, but I think that you see that in a lot of spaces in general. Again, I&#8217;m a sports fan. I&#8217;ve noticed where black quarterbacks tend to get criticized more harshly where it&#8217;s a guy who is an average quarterback, average black quarterback will get less chances than an average white quarterback.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
And I&#8217;ve seen that. And I&#8217;ve noticed that even in professional spaces where, yeah, both as a design leader and as a, I guess for lack of a better way of putting it, a design follower where I was looking for guidance and I was looking for how to be a professional, where I was looking for mentorship and I didn&#8217;t always get it. And I&#8217;ve noticed that even in some of my peers who&#8230; There&#8217;s two sides of it. I think as a young black boy, my dad, my mom, everybody really, you tell me if you had the same experience where you kind of told like, hey, you&#8217;re black, you got one shot. They are waiting for you to mess up, don&#8217;t screw up because they&#8217;re just waiting for it because you will be the stereotype who fits the profile. Don&#8217;t fit the profile.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I had that complex, but then if we think about studies that are around how teachers, for instance, police black bodies and they enforce punishment on black children more harshly than white children. Even to my I think, my story about growing up in school and kind of being told the same thing. You see it at all these walks of life and I experienced it as, again, as a professional who wanted to do a lot of things. And I was even in one of my old companies, I was being put out there. I was the person who was really able to speak to business owners because I understood business and I could translate what design was to a business person. And I could translate what design was to a developer. And I could speak all of these languages.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
And I was one of the only people in this organization, in fact, maybe the only person who could do that in a way that was effective, but I was still getting paid like a junior designer. I was still getting&#8230; But when they would take me into these meetings they would say, here&#8217;s our senior designer, Joseph Carter-Brown, but then I was getting paid as a, as a junior designer. And when I said, hey, look, I&#8217;m barely making ends meet. And I was helping to transform how the organization approached design. They didn&#8217;t understand user experience. They weren&#8217;t thinking about design and measuring design. They were just developing and hoping design fell in afterward. And I&#8217;m saying, hey, let&#8217;s build up design [inaudible 01:03:40] helping the company win awards and doing all these things. But I&#8217;m still getting paid as a junior designer.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
And it was one of the lower paid designers there. And when I spoke up and said, &#8220;Hey, I would like some, I would like you to give me a challenge to be who I believe I can be.&#8221; It was like, &#8220;Oh, well, remember this one moment where you slipped up. Yeah. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re not going to help you out here.&#8221; Yeah or be like, hey, we need you to jump this hurdle. And then I&#8217;m the type of person where you tell me something once and I&#8217;m going to do it and you don&#8217;t have to tell me again. So I was like, you gave me a hurdle. I&#8217;m going to jump in there. I&#8217;m going to clear it every time. But then when I say, hey, I cleared that hurdle. They go, oh, but you didn&#8217;t clear that hurdle. And I&#8217;m like, well, you never told me that was a hurdle.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
And it was like the moving of the goalpost and all of these little bangs. So I felt that. And then when I went into a design leadership space and I had a black woman who was reporting to me and I had people coming and going, oh, well, she&#8217;s not doing what she needs to do. And she&#8217;s screwing up here, she messed this up and she messed that up and I&#8217;m going&#8230; And I&#8217;m having conversations with her saying, hey, I&#8217;m hearing these things and she&#8217;s going, nobody told me about this. I didn&#8217;t know I messed that up. I thought everything was okay. And I&#8217;m going, oh, well, who&#8217;s providing you mentorship. And it&#8217;s no one. And I&#8217;m going to them like, well, you guys can&#8217;t expect her to be doing things perfectly if you&#8217;re not showing her how to be there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m trying to work with these people and I&#8217;ve seen it where I&#8217;ve seen other black reports under me coming in and having this fear of pushing themselves or pushing forward and they&#8217;re asking, well&#8230; Before they move, they&#8217;re going, am I getting it right? And then it&#8217;s just like, no, just go. You just need to go and run and if you slip, cool, just get back up and keep moving. But it&#8217;s so heightened and there&#8217;s such a magnification of like, do not screw up that it feels like you can&#8217;t even&#8230; It&#8217;s like that in every creative space. We&#8217;re all creatives, I think.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
But I definitely think for black people is you have this&#8230; You&#8217;re dealing with this history of if you screw up, everybody&#8217;s going to say, yeah, that&#8217;s what we expected. And if you screw up&#8230; It&#8217;s kind of like the saying, where&#8217;s what working twice as hard to get half as far. I like to say that we have twice the expectation in half the time. And I think that&#8217;s one of the key things that I see is like we expect like black designers, black creatives to be twice as good in half the time or else it&#8217;s a negative mark on your character in your professionalism.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You spoke a word there. Wow. Knowing all of this, this is probably an obvious question, but what do you do to make sure that that&#8217;s fostered that feeling of experimentation and such, or I would say even the space to make mistakes in that way is fostered on your teams.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I try to speak to it. I&#8217;m someone that&#8230; I like to say that I have a bit of black privilege and I used to joke to a buddy of mine. I&#8217;d be like you don&#8217;t realize how many spaces you&#8217;ll get access to when you&#8217;re a black person who who speaks proper. I&#8217;ve met so many racist white who think that they can speak to me in certain ways or they can say things they think that I agree with them because of the way I taught. But it also gives you this ability to kind of, to speak truth to power in a way that you don&#8217;t always see room for. So I just tend to speak to it. And I think one of the great things about Stanley Black and Decker actually is when I joined there&#8230; Because of my experience with my last company, I asked them about how they talk about equity and inclusion and to their credit for a hundred plus year old organization, they have a lot of conversations about this.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
They encourage these hard conversations. So one of the first things I did with my team was I got us all together. And my team is made up of black, white, queer, men, women, so forth. And I brought them all. And I had even the person that I report to in this meeting. And I said, let&#8217;s talk about what your identity means to you. What pain points, what do you bring? What baggage do you bring with you? How do you perceive yourself in this space? And I try to have those hard conversations. I talk to different people and I would say, hey, again, I speak straight to it. As a black man sometimes I freak out. If I have a mishap, I give myself a hard time and it scares me because this is the baggage I&#8217;m bringing with me.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
And so I say, hey, I need you to make some room and I need you to let me know where failure is on your scale and what room I have for failure. And I relay that over to my team and I say, hey, fail, fail fast, get up, make a plan and keep moving. And I try to encourage that and I even take one of the [inaudible 01:08:26] on my team, who&#8217;s a black man. And I&#8217;ve had this direct conversation with him. And I said, look man, I deal with this in a different way than you do. But we know what this experience is like. And in any way I can provide that psychological security, I want to at least provide that so that you can grow to be your best self and not trying to be who you think everybody else wants you to be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Wow. I noticed kind of from just what you&#8217;re talking about here, we skipped the little bits because I want to focus on this shift because we talked about your time at full sale. Of course, we&#8217;ve talked about the work&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; shift, because we talked about your time at Full Sail. Of course, we&#8217;ve talked about the work you&#8217;re doing at Stanley Black &#038; Decker. There was some time there in the middle that you were in Atlanta and then eventually, you moved back to the DMV area and you were doing a lot of graphic design work, web design work, et cetera, and you took this shift in 2016 to doing more UX. What prompted that shift?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
It was actually going to Full Sail. Like I said, I started Full Sail in 2012. At the time I was also doing a lot of freelance work. Again, I had been laid off from a company. I was also running a small clothing company by the name of Rogue Squirrel. Me and three partners were doing screen printing, and going to shows, and selling merchandise, and we were doing branding and things like that. I was the web designer, as well as the business person and all the things, like the Jamaicans in In Living Color. I was doing all [crosstalk 01:09:57].</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
When I went to school, I had to reduce a lot of things. I stopped doing freelance for a while to focus on school. I worked part-time at a few different places. I always approached everything like everything was design. In fact, the talk I did at the AIGA Design Conference was called, It&#8217;s Just Fricking Design. It was about how design in all of these areas are basically the same. But when I was at Full Sail, like I said, I stopped doing a lot of web work and freelance work to focus on school. Around the time I was getting close to graduating, I started to get back into the flow of things and doing web work and so forth. It was around that time that there was a whole lot of conversation, a lot of, you saw the word or the term UX being put around.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
So I said, &#8220;Well, I guess I need to go learn UX coding now. I guess I got to go learn how to code in UX.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t know what people were talking about. I started reading about it and it was like, oh, you think about the user and you do blah, blah, blah. And I went, &#8220;That&#8217;s what I already do. That&#8217;s how I already approach design. I don&#8217;t think about this for myself. I think about it for other people. I look at why they need this thing and I try to advocate for them.&#8221; I do X, Y, Z. And so I was like, &#8220;This is basically what I&#8217;ve already done. This is already what I&#8217;m doing.&#8221; So I just kept going in that direction. It made logical sense to me that that was just the route that you went in design, because it&#8217;s like, if you&#8217;re not thinking about who you&#8217;re making it for, then what are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
If you&#8217;re not talking to the business to understand what are their goals or even if it&#8217;s not a business, it&#8217;s a community organization, it&#8217;s a hospital, whatever it is, you&#8217;re not thinking about what it is, what problem they need to solve, it&#8217;s like, well, what are you doing? To me, it was just the natural thing. And as someone who was, again, a techie, a business person, a web developer, a graphic designer, I really loved the process and the logical and the puzzle of it, like detective work. Figuring out where that thread is that other people don&#8217;t see. And figuring out how to pull that out. So to me, it was like user experience, and especially some of the service design stuff, was a natural conclusion of the work I had been doing since I was a kid, really, because it blended all of the things that I was passionate about without having to&#8230; I never viewed myself as a traditional graphic designer.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not the greatest drawer. Sometimes it takes me a minute to find the idea. But if you immerse me in having empathy for the person and thinking about how I make the best thing for someone, I wouldn&#8217;t put too many people&#8217;s ideas ahead of mine. To me, that was just the natural thing. So when I had an opportunity, I was working as a developer/web designer, I said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m just going to make this what I want it to be.&#8221; Again, I just started advocating, saying, &#8220;Well, we got to think about how this measure. We got to think about the user. We got to do this.&#8221; And I just kept pushing in that direction.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. As I&#8217;m listening to your story and as you&#8217;re saying all this, of course, I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn&#8217;t mention that you&#8217;ve also done a lot of work with AIGA, specifically the Baltimore Chapter. Talk to me about how you got started with them.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I got involved in AIGA after I graduated, or around the time I graduated at Full Sail. I had always heard about AIGA as an organization. It was always like, hey, you network. You got to get out there. Again, as someone who was now about to graduate with student debt, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I need to make some money. I need to get a job.&#8221; Really, to start, it was like going into AIGA, it was like I wanted to find a job. I wanted to make some connections in the design community, because I was doing so much freelance stuff. I was living a little further out outside of Baltimore at the time. I didn&#8217;t have a lot of connections and so forth. It was just a way to get connected to the community. But when I got in there, I think, again, I&#8217;m a service person. I love helping people. I love figuring out ways to build things and create systems and so forth. It was just natural that I started getting close to the board.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
If I would show up to an event early, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;All right, well, I&#8217;ll help y&#8217;all up the tables.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to be hanging out later. I&#8217;m going to help you break down tables.&#8221; That was just how I started. It evolved into me really needing to find my identity as well as a designer. Because again, I didn&#8217;t know where I fit. Again, I wasn&#8217;t a graphic designer. I wasn&#8217;t fully a web developer. I wasn&#8217;t always the business person. I had all of these, but I had areas that I could fill in. I just wanted to find how I fit and who I was as a designer. That gave me a space to really hone my leadership skill. I&#8217;ve actually talked with people within AIGA about this a lot, that I think that sometimes they do a disservice to themselves by not embracing themselves, the organization, as a leadership incubator. Because it, more than anything, it seemed like that type of space for me, where it was like I got a chance to take all of these things and learn how to lead with the skills that I had gathered.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
It had given me a bit of, again, a bit of that experimentation space. It gave me a safe space to try things and to test things out. I got involved with the AIGA Baltimore Chapter. It was at the time, like I said, it was about an hour outside of Baltimore. It was an excuse to come back home, to be near water. I love being near water. So it was like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m going to go to the Harbor. I&#8217;m going to go visit my grandmother. I&#8217;m going to do this and I&#8217;ll go to an event.&#8221; I just kept going deeper and deeper. I started as the Programming Chair, developing events, workshops and different ways of reaching out to the community. I moved into Programming Director and then eventually Vice-President. And then President of the chapter. And really, my time there was just again, doing the thing that design did for me, which was gave me access.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I just used it as a space to provide access, because Baltimore has a huge digital divide. I was like, well, how can I provide the platform that we had to lift the voice of the people in the community and use the resources we have? Whether it was Adobe partnerships or IBM partnerships, to bring those into the community and inform people who wouldn&#8217;t normally have access to it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a really good way to think about AIGA, as a leadership incubator. That&#8217;s a good way to think about it. Different chapters in different cities are always different. Folks that have listened to this show for any length, know how I feel about the Atlanta Chapter. I always will tell people that AIGA is only as strong as its weakest chapter. Certainly there are some that do really great work in terms of outreach to the community and other types of programs and things of that nature. I think the organization, even now, it&#8217;s what? It&#8217;s over a hundred year old organization. Even now in this time where we&#8217;re so distanced in terms of being able to meet up and things like that, the organization is, I feel it&#8217;s still trying to find its way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s, of course, having missteps along the way, as I think any organization is. But I still root for AIGA. I&#8217;m not a member, as folks know. I still root for them. I want them to succeed. I want them to do well, because I do see the impact that it has in the community. And the impact that it can have on designers if they really fall into the right space.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I agree one hundred percent. I&#8217;m the same way. As much maligned as it has been over the past few years, and some people who are close to me who have had some public falling outs and so forth with it and it hurt me and saddened me to see those things happen. At the same time, I don&#8217;t know that I would be where I am without the opportunity in AIGA. I still have people within the organization and around the organization, close to the organization that I consider very good and close friends and great collaborators. It was a great space. I definitely don&#8217;t want to see it go anywhere. But I want to see it grow and really build its voice. I think that with AIGA Baltimore, the motto that I left the organization with, the chapter with was, we&#8217;re not AIGA Baltimore, we&#8217;re Baltimore&#8217;s AIGA.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
That was the way we really approached it, is like we went out into the community and we asked people what they wanted. We said, &#8220;Hey, how do we bring you what you need? How do we provide something for the city? How do we support other organizations?&#8221; And it was like we were the cheerleaders, is the way I really started to think of it. We&#8217;re this big organization. We will get the windfall of things. We don&#8217;t need to go out there trying to grub for money. People are going to come to us anyway. We will help other people, who are smaller, build their voice. We will be the platform that they build their voice on. We&#8217;ll do this. I think that idea of AIGA as this incubator space, I think it&#8217;s so stuck in like&#8230; I think there are a lot of people who want to say, &#8220;Hey, we need traditional graphic design and this to be the thing that we are.&#8221; But it&#8217;s like, we&#8217;re moving into such an era now, where it&#8217;s so much about the experience. It&#8217;s so much about the connections that you make.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
If you can be a connector, that is more of a benefit than being an artifact maker. I think AIGA, hopefully, will embrace that and figure that out and push itself as a place that has now the cachet to provide that access. Like I said, they have all of these tools and resources. Get involved in communities. Somebody once said to me at an event, and it really made me think critically about it and thus, about that access point, they were like, &#8220;It&#8217;s expensive to be a designer.&#8221; Yeah, it is! I was like, well, how can I make it a little cheaper for somebody? Because again, I had to steal every shot I had early on. I had to fricking steal zip disks sometimes and fonts and all of those things. It was all in an effort to just be something that I felt like I could be.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
There are so many kids who don&#8217;t get that opportunity. They&#8217;d never even know what the edges of the universe might be. They never explore that. And that&#8217;s going back to the idea of that experimentation space and then providing that access. If AIGA could provide that, I think how much change could they make for equity in the design community that we know we don&#8217;t have?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you want to accomplish this year? Of course, you&#8217;re at this new position that you&#8217;re working with. Now, you&#8217;re probably not as involved with AIGA Baltimore, because there&#8217;s a new president there now. But what do you want to do for this year? Is there anything on your to-do list?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. On my to-do list this year, I took a break from doing a lot of speaking engagements. I was actually really thankful that AIGA, speaking of them, reached out to me to speak at the Design Conference at the end of the year. For me, it&#8217;s about getting back out there as a bit of a thought leader, sharing my experiences and doing more workshops and helping to build more strategy, growing, just continuing to grow my skillset. But also just continue to expand the conversation around what design is and how we use it as a tool for good. The place I always go back to is, how can I use my opportunity to make opportunity for someone else? Whether it&#8217;s getting more involved in community organizations. I&#8217;m really interested in something that&#8217;s been again, stewing in my mind recently, as I get a little more time, hopefully, is to get involved in supporting opportunities to help bridge that digital divide that&#8217;s in the city.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s glaring so heavily, because of what&#8217;s out there with COVID and how it changed things. I&#8217;m thinking about a lot of those things. But ultimately, I&#8217;m just working on getting my feet fully implanted or cemented in this space, helping to really do a lot of organizational transformation within Stanley Black &#038; Decker and then continue to really broaden myself in and put myself a little more out there in that space so that I can use that to propel other voices.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, as we think even more into the future, where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
In the next five years I really want to get into helping communities build equitable spaces for themselves. I&#8217;d love to do more in the civic design space, helping to bridge communication gaps between communities and cities or states, local municipalities and businesses to help provide systems that are again, sustainable and feasible for the people and again, equitable for the people within those communities. Ultimately, that&#8217;s the thing I want to start doing. Another area for me is really diving into the mental health space, is something that I think that there&#8217;s been so much stigma around. I&#8217;m happy that I&#8217;ve pulled, I won&#8217;t say pulled back on it, but I&#8217;ve seen that there&#8217;s been a lot more conversations. So it&#8217;s made me a little more hardened that it&#8217;s not as big a thing to have to tackle completely. But I definitely have a real passion for the conversation around mental health, especially in Black and Brown communities.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
I actually started a small event series within AIGA Baltimore called, Well Aware, where we started having these open and more vulnerable conversations. In fact, before COVID, that was part of my trajectory, is I was going to come back to the board and help foster that type of conversation again. I think I have a lot of different things, as you can probably tell. But I think that those two areas, helping communities build spaces that allow them to take advantage and take ownership of their own mental health and the systems that are there for them, so that they&#8217;re more equitable and in alignment with what is needed is an area that I think will be really important.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
You can find me, I&#8217;m mostly on social media more than anything lately, at abrowncreates on Instagram, as well as on Twitter. On LinkedIn, Joseph Carter-Brown. I&#8217;m always happy to connect with people. And then on my website, anthonybrowncreates.com. So those are the key places that you can find me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Joseph Carter-Brown, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. The stories that you&#8217;ve told about how you have really progressed in this industry and really put your own stamp on it, being in the game for over 20 years and all the things that you talked about, it&#8217;s so clear to me that you have a real passion for this community. Not just for design, but for the community around design. And to be able to help people to see that this can be a space that you can really grow and thrive in, I think is something that is super important and something that you definitely have been able to show through your actions, through your words and through your deeds. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Carter-Brown:</b><br>
Well, thank you. It&#8217;s been an honor and I really appreciate you having me on here.</p>

<p>Navigating the creative industry is a big theme of this podcast. (Why do you think we&#8217;re called Revision Path? Well, that&#8217;s one reason.) For our final interview of the year, I had the opportunity to talk with motion graphics designer Handel Eugene. If you&#8217;ve seen¬†<em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em>¬†or¬†<em>Black Panther</em>, then no doubt you&#8217;ve seen Handel&#8217;s amazing animation work.</p>
<p>Handel talked about his typical day as a visual storyteller, detailing the tools that he uses, as well as how his educational and work experiences have contributed to his career. He also shared what he wanted to see more of in the animation industry, and wrapped up with discussing how he balances work, family, and staying fresh and creative in his work.</p>
<p>2019 has been such an amazing year for Revision Path, and I just have to thank you all for listening, downloading, and supporting the show! 2020 is just around the corner, and I can&#8217;t wait to see what&#8217;s in store!</p>

<span class="thst-toggle-title">Full Transcript</span><div class="thst-toggle-inner">
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: All right. So tell us who you are and what you do?</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah, my name is Handel Eugene. I&#8217;m a Haitian-American, [inaudible 00:00:06] disciplinary artist, animate and designer. I&#8217;m also an instructor. I dabble in public speaking from time to time and I&#8217;m currently residing in the San Francisco, Bay Area.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Nice. And now, you told me, right before we started recording that you were permalancing and you&#8217;re working at a bunch of different companies out there. Can you talk just a little bit about the types of things that you&#8217;re working on?</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah. So right now I&#8217;m freelancing for some different companies out here, basically in Silicon Valley. Right now I&#8217;m currently at Apple, and right now I&#8217;m just&#8230; Obviously Apple being Apple, super secretive, can&#8217;t talk about a whole heck of a lot what I&#8217;m currently working on. But I can touch on a little bit of what I&#8217;ve done in the past for them. I&#8217;m currently working on whenever they have a new product release or they have their events and such, to unveil their new products or their new service and what have you.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: You&#8217;ve got to promote those different aspects. And my job is just to kind of like do creative advertisement, creative promotion, creative material and content to help unveil and roll out some of those different products. I&#8217;ve also worked on in-store content as well, the [inaudible 00:01:23] device content as well for them. Not just on Apple, but also I&#8217;ve gotten the opportunity&#8230; Fortunate to have the opportunity to work at Facebook and Google, doing those same different aspects. Just kind of creative advertisement and also doing some work on the platform internally as well.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Nice. So what is a typical day like for you? I know you&#8217;re kind of bouncing between these different companies, although you&#8217;re mostly at Apple right now, but what&#8217;s a regular day like?</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah, yeah, of course. So yeah, I work in the motion graphics industry. It&#8217;s kind of like more of a specific area that I primarily work in and it&#8217;s called motion graphics, but I guess it falls under the umbrella of creative advertisement. So yeah, like a traditional day, let&#8217;s just say in my free day&#8230; I&#8217;ve worked in LA for seven years. So back then a job would come in through the studio. We&#8217;d have a brief, and a client&#8217;s looking to promote a service or a product or show, a new show.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Or even having the opportunity to have worked on a film. Obviously, that aspect as well. And our job is to service the client&#8217;s needs and provide them with creative solutions, creative designs, creative advertisements to kind of help tell their story and meet their needs of whatever they&#8217;re looking for in particular, and visually. What I like to describe myself, it&#8217;s kind of like a visual storyteller. Basically taking these aspects and these elements that are on paper, these kind of rough ideas and presenting different design options for them.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: It can be design and animation. Either or, or both combined, and delivering that to the client. So I guess a traditional day just to get into the kind of nuts and bolts is yeah, you come in, you&#8217;ve got your brief, you&#8217;ve already been briefed on the project and yeah, you just chipping away at designs. Sometimes you have pitches where those are kind of like short form like, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s just kind of provide a buffet of options to the client for them to pick and choose from.&#8221; And once the client picks a direction, then we&#8217;re kind of like full steam ahead and just into production.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Taking that concept that won us the job and executing it. Executing it into design phase and animation phase, and ultimately delivering the product for the client. So it&#8217;s just kind of working on those different aspects. Again, I guess typical days, I&#8217;m getting more specific, I&#8217;m designing a Photoshop, animating side after-effects or cinema 4D. And I guess, those are primarily where I&#8217;m spending a lot of my time. Also putting pitch desks together, writing briefs and content and material. So yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Okay. Now what&#8217;s kind of been the biggest challenge that you faced with doing a lot of this? Like you&#8217;re working for these large companies, you&#8217;re looking at briefs and pitches and stuff. What&#8217;s the biggest challenge you face with doing all this?</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah, the biggest challenge, I mean, there&#8217;s lots of different ones. I guess trying to figure out what the biggest one would be. Trying to stay fresh and creative. It&#8217;s interesting. We&#8217;re all fortunate as designers and artist to do something creative for a living, which is amazing. But sometimes that can be exhausting especially if you&#8217;re kind of at a rapid pace. Some studios kind of work faster than others and kind of like have a lot of material and content that you kind of just jump on and get pulled on left and right.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: So sometimes, it can be a little taxing. So I think one of the biggest challenges is to stay inspired, stay fresh and stay creative. Not to get burnt out. I think burnout is a real, real issue in our industry just because of the nature of what we do. Can be labor intensive, for sure. I mean if you&#8217;re working long hours, sometimes you can kind of get tunnel vision and it&#8217;s kind of hard to see the big picture. So I think that&#8217;s one of the more challenging aspect, is like trying to find that balance of working hard on something because you want it to be great, but then trying to not burn yourself out, stay inspired and especially be inspired outside of work.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: So that way, the experiences that you&#8217;re having outside of work can kind of fuel and feed and form kind of your ideas internally at work. Because again, yeah, like working in a creative field, you&#8217;re always being asked to create new, fresh creative content all the time. So sometimes that can be a little hard at sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Emotionally, I mean it&#8217;s something that you see anywhere from animation to product reviews to a number of different things. So I can imagine after a while it&#8217;s something&#8230; I&#8217;m just thinking to myself like as a viewer, it&#8217;s something you kind of take for granted. Like you expect everything to be able to move and work well. But certainly I think modern digital design, I should say, features a lot more animation. I would imagine one of the challenge, and you can correct me if I&#8217;m wrong here, but I&#8217;d also imagine one of the challenges is making sure that you stay kind of unique in a way?</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Right. Yeah, absolutely. So what? Like let&#8217;s say 10, 15 years ago, our industry to have as a kind of like for clients was a luxury. It&#8217;s like if you knew how to key frame something from point a to point b, I mean you had a job and you were in demand. But nowadays there&#8217;s just so much content, and the bare bench entry has definitely been lowered. Technologies and applications have become cheaper, things have become more accessible. So there&#8217;s been definitely is a flood of material. Obviously, the way we consume content has changed.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Obviously with content coming straight to our phone with Facebook and Instagram. So yeah, there&#8217;s a lot more, I don&#8217;t want to call it noise, but there&#8217;s a lot more content out there for us to consume and a lot of more content that&#8217;s fighting for our attention. So yeah, to stand out is definitely, absolutely a big challenge. Stand out from the crowd because yeah, you&#8217;re competing against all these other&#8230; Some can be distracting and some can be really good content. Yeah, you&#8217;re competing against lots of other really good content as well.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: So yeah, that&#8217;s always, always a challenge. You want to create something that&#8217;s meaningful, that&#8217;s impactful, that&#8217;s engaging with the audience and that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re always considering and trying to meet and provide for the client. And yeah, that can be super challenging as well because that&#8217;s something you got to stay on top of and understand. And there&#8217;s trends, there&#8217;s aspects that you want to try and fight against, but then also there&#8217;s aspects that you need to incorporate because it&#8217;s new and it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re&#8230; Yeah, it&#8217;s always something that you&#8217;re always balancing.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: And like you said too, you touched on a little bit like it&#8217;s one of those things that requires a whole heck of a lot of work, but people nowadays may take for granted and just kind of like&#8230; Because we just consume so much content nowadays. So it&#8217;s definitely challenging for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: One thing I&#8217;m curious about, and you can let me know how much of this you can speak on or not, is accessibility. So of course we have, like you said, there&#8217;s all this content. Things are always moving and shifting and changing. Even with just I think regular web design now, there&#8217;s a lot of animation that you can do with coding. Like with CSS, you can make things fade in and fade out or transition or stuff like that. How does accessibility play into your work, if it plays into your work at all?</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Now, when you say accessibility, are you saying kind of like how readily available some of these animation techniques are to the general audience and general consumers? Is that what you&#8217;re-</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I&#8217;m thinking more I guess from the viewer end, like say for viewers that have say visual impairments or if a lot of moving things cause motion sickness or something like that or even, you know colorblind. Things like that.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Right. Absolutely. Absolutely. I&#8217;ll tell you, that&#8217;s something that there&#8217;s a team dedicated to that. There&#8217;s always like this struggle between creatives and let&#8217;s say the legal department or so. The creative wants to push this idea forward and be like, &#8220;Okay, we&#8217;ve got to consider this audience, we&#8217;ve got to consider this aspect or this might be too much for this particular audience.&#8221; So I&#8217;ll tell you, just as a creative and an artist, we&#8217;re always putting the creative first and pushing the creative. And then we kind of allow those two different departments that specialize in those areas to kind of rein us in and inform us of different aspects that need to be more accessible or more readable or adjustments and alterations that may need to be made.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: So there are definitely departments that are dedicated to that, that will inform us. And we&#8217;ve definitely got through revisions and made adjustments that have made our content more accessible. I think just in general as a creative, and this is kind of like one of the fun part of the process, especially the pre-production process is you just start broad. You start broad, just kind of like trying to find, come across something. Those happy accidents are really something that you&#8217;re always searching for. And kind of like once you start broad then as you progress through the production pipe, I mean you start to kind of chisel away and get a little bit more narrow, a little bit more focused.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Trying to figure out what you can take away or what you can adjust to kind of make the content as strong as possible, but also reach as much people as possible. So that&#8217;s my angle and my perspective on it a motion graphic standpoint. But there&#8217;s been a lot. I&#8217;m sure lots of people have different experiences with that, but that&#8217;s just my particular experience.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Now, I&#8217;m curious about that just because I know that there are&#8230; I mean we&#8217;ve had people on the show that have accessibility experts that have talk about this sort of thing. I was actually also even thinking of most recently Domino&#8217;s Pizza had filed a case and it even went up to the Supreme Court around accessibility. And I think it was more so just about accessing the site. But then also a lot of modern sites put motion in their transactions and interactions in a lot of ways that sometimes are good, sometimes they get in the way. Like parallax scrolling and scroll jacking and all that sort of stuff where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;I just want to view the page. I don&#8217;t need you to guide my decision.&#8221; And that sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: So I was just curious about how you deal with that or if you deal with that at all. But it&#8217;s interesting that it&#8217;s kind of is a thing with legal that you have to sort of go back and forth with. I didn&#8217;t even consider that.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Right. Yeah because it&#8217;s definitely not our area of expertise. I guess for me as the content that we&#8217;re creating, for example, working at a studio in LA. Whenever we get a brief there actually has been a lot of thought and already a lot of development that has went into the particular idea. And it&#8217;s just kind of like on us to develop and execute it. And once we deliver it to the client or present our first rough draft or first&#8230; Like there is a chain of command as far as where it needs to go and different eyes have to get on it to kind of approve it and get sign off on it, including the legal team as well.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Like this is something that I&#8217;m sure artists can relate, who&#8217;ve gone through this. But it&#8217;s always sucks whenever you get close to the finish line and then that&#8217;s when legal gets their eyes on it and then they ask for changes that should have been brought up ages ago, early on in the process. Again, from just my perspective, I wonder if pure graphic design, like that&#8217;s something that is considered more from the get-go than in my industry, as far as motion graphics and motion design. Yeah, just honestly, it&#8217;s not something that is at the forefront at the beginning of production, but it&#8217;s something that does come up in production and we kind of make adjustments and pivot if it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s not readable or accessible and such.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: And again, most of my content that I create is in video format and stills and such. I don&#8217;t dwell too much into the web design space, because I just designed my own website. But yeah, most of the stuff that you&#8217;ll see that I&#8217;ve done is kind of like on the TV screens or content that you may consume on your phone or it&#8217;s like having&#8230; Fortunate to have to work on a couple films as well, so.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. So it&#8217;s like more media and less web, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Right, right, right.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: So you mentioned being in LA for a number of years. You started out your professional career at Royale, which is the creative agency there. What was your time like at Royale? How did it help prep you for the work you&#8217;re doing now?</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah. So my time there was great. I absolutely, absolutely loved it there. And it was my first job out of school so I interned there for three months. And it was funny because I was just finished up with school. I was in Florida and I&#8217;m trying to convince my parents to be like, &#8220;Hey, can I move to LA?&#8221; And they were like, &#8220;Oh, you got a job up there?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Kind of a job. It&#8217;s an internship. Nothing&#8217;s guaranteed but it&#8217;s pretty promising. If I landed, it&#8217;d be a dream job for me.&#8221; And so thankfully, they were hesitantly supportive of me, encouraging me, supporting me to go out there.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: And yeah, when I got there I just worked my butt off for those three months because this truly was a dream. Is a place I wanted to work since the beginning of school. And thankfully I was able to prove myself to them. I used my time there kind of like&#8230; I like to say this a lot to other people, I used my time there kind of like as grad school where I was still young, fresh and hungry but I still wanted to continue learning. I was like using it as like it&#8217;s a continuing education program to where I was trying to get my hands dirty as possible, testing out.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: And I was also trying to find like my voice and what I really wanted to do because there was so many opportunities to touch different things there. And I was fortunate, grateful. Not all internships are like this, but thankfully at Royale, they do a good job of grooming their interns there by giving them lots of different assignments besides just the drought work or&#8230; Actually I did have to walk a dog once. But majority of the work day I got to do was like working on some real portfolio quality content that was great.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: And yeah, so I was like a sponge, just trying to soak up as much information as possible and as much as possible. Mainly because I didn&#8217;t know how long they were going to keep me and I didn&#8217;t know if I had to go find a job after this. So I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to try and take full advantage.&#8221; Because the saying, take advantage what others take for granted. I was like, I&#8217;m going to just work my butt off and grind as much as possible here so that way, I&#8217;m going to put my best foot forward and if I get [inaudible 00:18:40], great. If not, at least I can take all this experience with me to the next opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Thankfully, they kept me around and eventually went staff there and I worked there for five years.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah. And seriously, up until the point that I ended up leaving, I want to say it still was like grad school and continued education. Like I was always learning, always pushing and always trying to grow and get better and push my skills there. And thankfully it was the perfect environment to allow me to do that. I really feel like if I&#8217;ve achieved any type of success, it&#8217;s primarily due to the foundation that I had during my time at Royale.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: What were some of the projects that you worked on there?</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Man, I remember when I was, not to jump too far ahead, but when I left, I went back and tracked all of the projects that I worked on during the five years I was there. And I&#8217;m blanking on the exact number, but I knew I averaged about two projects a month there, and some of the projects I got to work on were just for clients all across the spectrum. I mean, we worked for Apple we works for Google, we worked for Toyota, Starbucks, Nike, Adidas and all those big brands. And of course like lots of local brands as well, like In the Raw and all kinds of different&#8230; Like video games, EA and the like.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: And just working on creative content for them to kind of help promote, like if it&#8217;s a new shoe or new apparel or it&#8217;s this new promotional program at Starbucks that they&#8217;re rolling out for October, whatever the case may be. So all kinds of different content and it was great because again, having the opportunity to work on all those different projects just kind of got me up to speed so quickly with the industry and helped me learn. And thankfully I had an amazing group of artists and mentors and people who supported me and saw how hungry I was and kind of leaned into that and fed into that and gave me opportunities to continue to challenge and prove myself while I was there.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Now, as I was doing my research, the biggest thing that I saw that came up was that you had even done some work for Marvel, more specifically for Spiderman Homecoming. Can you talk about that a little bit?</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah, yeah, of course. I got the opportunity to work for a Marvel two times, actually, in two different occasions. And the first one being for Spiderman Homecoming in the summer&#8230; No, late spring of 2017. I got the opportunity to fly out to New York and work at a local studio there called Perception, which was working on the titles for Spiderman Homecoming, and it was always my dream. It&#8217;s always my dream, right? To work on a film. Even before knowing that I would ever be in this industry, I was like, &#8220;It&#8217;d be cool to work on a film one day.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: It was cool when Perception reached out saying they&#8217;re interested in bringing me on board. It was for film, but they couldn&#8217;t tell me what film it was for and I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care. Whatever film it is, I&#8217;m your guy. Let me know. I&#8217;ll take the gig.&#8221; And you have to sign the NDA paperwork and such, and finding out what the film was it was like, &#8220;Oh, wow. This is awesome.&#8221; Because it&#8217;s actually a film that I truly want to see. And it&#8217;s cool to be able to help out and work on it. And it was cool because I remember going into the studio and looking at all the storyboards that were onscreen and I remember it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, Donald Glover&#8217;s in this movie.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: I was like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s so dope.&#8221; Yeah. It&#8217;s like just seeing the cast and everything like that and the title itself. The work that I did on the film was the end-title sequence. So it&#8217;s actually the last thing you see before the credits roll. It&#8217;s a glorified version of credits where you see, directed by&#8230; And you see, starring&#8230; And you see the main actors and directors and the high profile figures that worked on the film, that were behind the film and were starring in the film. You&#8217;ll see them in end-title sequence as pretty much just taking the best of the film and interpreting it in a creative medium.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: In this particular case for Spiderman Homecoming, our task was to take basically content from the film and make a title sequence that fell under the theme of high school art class.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah, that was super fun because it was just like going back to your childhood and just like finding these different mediums of clay and plasticine, and colored pencils and watercolors, and all these different fun mediums to just kind of get your hands dirty and just go and just kind of create traditional art, which is great. And then bring that in, scan that in, stop motions, and bring it in and just incorporate it with digital assets and just animating all that together to create this really, really fine title sequence that you see at the end. So that was a whole heck of a lot of fun. And that was the beginning of what allowed me to have the relationship with Perception.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: So I must&#8217;ve done a good job for them because they asked me to come back and work on another high profile film for them, which was Black Panther.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah. And I have to say, when I was working there, I was working on the film. They had already started doing some early development on Black Panther. They were doing some research development, especially in their UI animations and their future tech designs. And while I was working there, I kind of saw that they were working on this. They&#8217;ve been working on it for like a year now. And I was like, &#8220;Guys, look this Spiderman Homecoming job, this is cool. This is cool. But man, would I love to come back and work on this, on whatever you guys are working on for Black Panther. I&#8217;d come back in a heartbeat.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Because I was living in LA, but I flew out to New York to live temporarily there, just to work on that film. And I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it again in a heartbeat.&#8221; And thankfully they did. They called me again and it was like, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;ve got another assignment coming in and we&#8217;d love to have you work on it.&#8221; So yeah, that led to the next opportunity to work on my second film, which wasn&#8217;t a bad film to work on, which was Black Panther.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Nice. We did a whole episode on the art and design of Black Panther. I mean, you love Black Panther clearly. [Crosstalk 00:25:56] but no, I didn&#8217;t know you worked on that movie too. That&#8217;s dope.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that was-</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah, that was probably the highlight of my career. I ask myself this all the time. I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s going to top that. I don&#8217;t know. But it was really a dream project to work on that. And you know, it&#8217;s funny because once she reached out to have me come speak, I&#8217;d been listening to some past guests on the show, and Hannah Beachler, I was listening to her episode and it was cool to work on my aspect, but I was like, wow. Like it&#8217;s how hearing her perspective on the film, which was great.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Like, I got to work on the film but I didn&#8217;t get to hang out with Ryan Coogler, and it&#8217;s actually just seeing how close she was to the production of that film was like, so awe inspiring. So, I just got to be kind of like a small fish, and I got to work on the first and last thing you see on the film, the prologue sequence, and the end title sequence which was a lot of fun, but it was just so, it was just so, because I was like, it was like reliving it all over again. You know, just hearing her perspective and hearing what she had done on the film. But, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Now, one thing I have to really give to Marvel is that they have really started, and I guess I still do in a way, they&#8217;ve trained audiences to sit through the credits.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: So you can actually, and I don&#8217;t know how many people are really paying attention. I would imagine they are because they want to see the mid credits scene, after credits scene. But, you now get to see just how many people have contributed to the work that you just saw. You know, before you watch a movie and it&#8217;s like as soon as those first few credits, people are up and out the door. Marvel movies, people will sit through the whole thing and I&#8217;m assuming they&#8217;re looking at all the names and being like, wow, there are like, thousands of people that went into this. And it wasn&#8217;t just the actors on screen. Like, it was like an almost a city of people that have helped to make all of this happen. I really have to give that to Marvel, in a very subversive way, making moviegoers appreciate, or at least have some sort of a recognition that a lot of people go into the work.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: And you know what? You know what you want? A new found appreciation you&#8217;ll have for the amount of people that work on the film is everybody who came up to me, because my name was in the credits, which was super, super awesome. I was bummed because my name wasn&#8217;t in the credits for the Spiderman homecoming. I wasn&#8217;t sure if was going to be on Black Panther. Like, that&#8217;s one thing I would love to have, because I could show my grandkids this and thankfully it was. Everybody that came out to me, I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I sat in the theater and I had to look for your name for so long that had to go through all [crosstalk 00:29:02] , and it was so long. And then, by the time we saw your name, it was too late. It was like, we screamed like two seconds of your name, scrolled past&#8221;, and it was like, you have a new found appreciation whenever you&#8217;re trying to look for a specific name in the credits. Then, that&#8217;s when it&#8217;s like, wow, you really have a new perspective on how many people really worked on that.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah, I mean the fact that it&#8217;s in there is what&#8217;s important. Whether you got to see it even just for a few seconds, it&#8217;s there. It&#8217;s there for posterity. So, you don&#8217;t have to worry about that. So, you mentioned Florida, that&#8217;s what you grew up, in Florida?</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. Grew up in Florida. Born and raised.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Was art and design and all of this kind of like a big part of your childhood growing up?</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: No, not at all. And it wasn&#8217;t discouraged or anything like that. It was more of, it just wasn&#8217;t introduced. Yeah, we dabbled in art, but it&#8217;s an elective, right. And you take that art&#8230; I had some drawing skills and everything like that, but nobody ever encourages you to like, &#8220;Hey, you&#8217;ve got something there. Maybe you should try to look into the [inaudible 00:30:13] .&#8221; Nobody even knew that you can make a career out of, at least not in my circle of influence. And it&#8217;s funny, because my brother, I always saw him as the creative in the family. He would craze on comic books, and he would sketch all the time, and draw. But it was just always like a hobby thing.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: It was just like a fun thing to do. I kind of got started with all of this&#8230; kind of by accident, because I took TV production for three years in high school, and the only reason I took TV production was because my brother recommended it, because he said it&#8217;s an easy A, and there&#8217;s a couch in the room so you can hang out. So, it was like super chill and [inaudible 00:31:05], he&#8217;s got to do the morning show. And, for two years of the three years I took TV production, I was just chillaxing. I was just hanging out, just like, enjoying the time, easy assignments. And, it was fun. It was cool, but it wasn&#8217;t anything that we were pressured to stress about or anything like that.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: But, for some reason, I ask myself this all the time, for some reason, for the life of me, I don&#8217;t know why. But, at the end of my junior year, I had this quarter life crisis, can&#8217;t even call it quarter life at that point, where I was like, &#8220;Man, I&#8217;m going to college in a year, and I have no idea what I want to be. So I got to figure out.&#8221; I thought when you go to college, as soon as you&#8217;re a freshman you have to know what you want to do, and you have to decide, and spend four years learning that. I thought that&#8217;s what college was, little did I know.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: And so, that summer I was like, &#8220;All right, I&#8217;ve been taking this TV production thing. Let me try to take this thing seriously. I do know a thing or two about cameras, and editing, and I have done a couple of assignments. So, let me try to take it serious this year.&#8221; And, one of the best things anybody&#8217;s ever done in my career is my TV production teacher, Joe Humphrey, which he, this was like probably the simplest gesture, but it meant the world to me, is he saw how hungry and ambitious I was becoming to learn more about TV production, that my senior year he gave me the title Executive Producer of Terrier TV. And, to this day, still the greatest title I&#8217;ve ever been granted, and probably ever will be granted because he bestowed upon me this prestigious honor that I didn&#8217;t think that I was worthy of, and I was executive producer. It was the first time I&#8217;ve ever had a title of anything.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: I felt like, it&#8217;s very empowering. So I was like, &#8220;I got to live up to this title that I now have.&#8221; And, so I took it even more serious and I was kind of like leading the department and doing video editing, and all that. Long story short, I did football highlights that that kind of got me some recognition, and eventually landed me a scholarship to go to University of Central Florida, where I learned and developed, and found after effects there and found that there&#8217;s this whole new industry, this whole new department. I didn&#8217;t know what the industry was. I thought I just wanted to major in after effects. I didn&#8217;t know about motion graphics or motion design at the time, but I started learning more and more and decided that I was at University of Central Florida, which was great.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: I was at UCS sports video. I was kind of like a PA there and learning, and learning, and I was a camera man for their football team and I would record their practices, but the only reason why I was doing that it was because they also have this production department, which isn&#8217;t a job, they don&#8217;t have a job for you, but you can kind of like volunteer your hours. So my primary responsibility was to be this camera man and record practices, and work your way up to recording games and stuff like that, which I wasn&#8217;t too interested in. I love sports, but I just wasn&#8217;t crazy about that. But, I was volunteering my time, especially at nights going into the control room with their production room, like learning, editing and that kind of stuff, like picking up avid at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: And also, that&#8217;s where I met my first motion graphic designer. There was one in the department, and I saw what he was doing. So I picked up after effects to try to make my video highlights better. And then I just opened up this whole new world of possibilities. I was like, &#8220;Oh wow, there&#8217;s people that are actually doing this. Oh, you can actually major in this and go to school for this.&#8221; And so I looked into it more and more and more, and eventually transferred from University of Central Florida to Full Sail. So, I think your question was what started off with Florida. I kind of went on this long little journey leading up to like me getting into Full Sail. But yeah, I grew up in Florida. That&#8217;s kind of how I got into the arts.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Full Sail has a great reputation in the motion graphics and digital design industry, I think probably more so than some. I think, probably a lot of four year, I mean, Full Sail is a four year institution, but you know what I mean, like some traditional liberal arts college kinds of places. And actually, when you were at Full Sail, that&#8217;s when I first heard about you, I&#8217;ve mentioned that I saw, I was a feature in Graphic Design USA. It was you and another student, I think another Full Sail student, maybe at a different location that were being profiled. I think Gordon K., who&#8217;s the publisher had asked a few questions about what are you working on, and that sort of stuff. And Full Sail caught my eye, one, because of its reputation, but two, because for-profit universities kind of get a bad rap in general, I think with education.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Certainly, we&#8217;ve seen in the past three or four years, places like Westwood College and others like that, where they&#8217;ve done all this marketing for students, but they&#8217;re not accredited, and then they get shut down, and then it makes you wonder, &#8220;Well what&#8217;s the value of the degree?&#8221; or anything like that. But, for-profit education has tended to really make an impact in the design industry. General assembly is technically, I&#8217;m using air quotes here, but it is a for-profit model, where people sign up for classes and it ends up becoming a bit of a feeder industry into other positions, and things like that. And it sounds like Full Sail really kind of helped after you went to UCF. Full Sail is kind of what really prepped you for the work that you did at Royale. Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah. So, it&#8217;s interesting that you said that, because there&#8217;s mixed reviews, right? It&#8217;s all just depending on your experience there. And I&#8217;ve had people who wouldn&#8217;t recommend Full Sail to anybody. And then there&#8217;s people like me who had a great experience there. And I think it&#8217;s largely due to the individual. You know, like actually, truthfully, honestly, I would have a hard time recommending Full Sail to anybody, not because of the institution, because more so it&#8217;s about the individual. Art school just in general is expensive, and I highly encourage anybody who&#8217;s looking into it to make sure that you&#8217;re at the right point in your life, to really be committed to something that&#8217;s going to really affect you for the rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Because, I think one of the most tragic things is like having a friend who was a classmate of mine who&#8217;s not in the industry. He&#8217;s not even doing anything remotely close to, motion graphics, emotion design and such, because you don&#8217;t want to go to school to figure out what you art school to figure out what you want to do. That&#8217;s a formula for disaster. You want to make sure that, I think also too, a big thing is maturity. You want to make sure that if you decided to go to Full Sail, or any art institution, that you&#8217;re prepared to be fully committed to it and the more experience you have coming in, the better. That was probably my competitive advantage, but I was there, and why I was able to maximize my time at Full Sail is because I came in and I already knew the tools.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: There&#8217;s one advice I would give to anybody, which is don&#8217;t go to art school to learn the tools. You can learn that anywhere. You can learn that online. There&#8217;s so many resources online to help you learn the tools. So, because I knew the tools, I was already ahead, and I was able to just focus on just creating projects and portfolio quality work. As soon as I got into the door, I didn&#8217;t need the beginning classes that they had you take, I was just spending the whole time just working in designing and animating. I didn&#8217;t have to go through the hurdles of doing the tutorials as any other.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: So, a large part of it. Yeah, for sure, the institution provided me so many resources and was actually gave me access to Jayson Whitmore and Brian Homan who are the owners at Royale. Jayson Whitmore is an alum of Full Sail and he comes back to speak every so often to students at Full Sail. And Full Sail gave me access to him. I was fortunate to be able to show my work to him in a closed room with a couple of other students that were doing good work, and we got to present our work to him, and he eventually recruited me out there to come, and gave me an internship opportunity, which really just kind of jump-started my whole career.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: So, from my personal experience it was great-and I went through the accelerator program. Now, they have the four year institution program. But I went through the accelerated program where it was 21 months, just under two years, and you go to class five days a week, eight hours a day. And it was intense. It was almost like a bootcamp almost. And again, that&#8217;s why I say as I can&#8217;t recommend that to everybody, because everybody isn&#8217;t used to operating under those conditions and everybody isn&#8217;t mature enough to fully take advantage of that particular aspect of it. But it was great for me, because it just got me up to speed. I had already done two years at University of Central Florida, so I already had like an unofficial Associates , as far as just having an experience in my industry and having gone through those early freshman, sophomore hurdles, or what have you. So, as soon as I got to art school, which is where I really wanted to go, I just hit the ground running.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Now you&#8217;ve done work for Marvel, you&#8217;re doing work for Apple and Facebook and Google. So it&#8217;s all really paid off.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, it really has. You know, it&#8217;s funny because I didn&#8217;t have anyone growing up that encouraged me to get again to the arts. But when I did transfer from an accredited university like UCF, University of Central Florida to this, what some may consider as trade school, to pursue the arts. There was definitely some pushback. There was definitely some people who discouraged me from doing that. And there were a lot of people- it&#8217;s interesting to hear you say that you&#8217;ve heard some positive reviews, but there&#8217;s definitely a lot of people, a lot of naysayers who told me the opposite, who gave me a lot of negative feedback. Like, &#8220;Oh, I had a cousin that went there and he just wasted a whole lot of money.&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t go there&#8221;, this, that and the other.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: And that&#8217;s why I say it&#8217;s truly dependent on the individual. So , I went in there a bit hesitant because I was- not hesitant, but fearful of failure. I&#8217;d heard stories of people coming here and having failed, and I kind of used it as fuel to my fire to ensure and make sure that I work my tail off to be as to somewhat ensure some success during my time here. So I was like, &#8220;If that means me being in the top 10% of my class, then that&#8217;s where I need to be for me to be able to get to where I want to go.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: So yeah, getting there definitely was a struggle. And I&#8217;m a Haitian American and I come from a Haitian culture, an immigrant culture where both my parents were born and raised in Haiti. My grandma had eight kids and she came to America first, and she sent for her kids one by one to come to the US and I show that, because you&#8217;ve got this very strong figure in our family, and you&#8217;ve got this hard work ethic that&#8217;s just embedded and rooted in our culture and nobody knows about somebody who is successful in the arts, and you tell them that you want to go pursue that. It&#8217;s really challenging and tough, because you want to make your family proud, and you want to make your parents proud, and you want to do something that they will respect and will support you in.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: And, the fact that nobody knows somebody who&#8217;s successful, there was a lot of pushback on that because you&#8217;re hesitant to give your well wishes to something like that because&#8230; Yeah, it&#8217;s just an exposure thing, and even myself, for example, if I have a cousin who wants to go into the music industry, I&#8217;ll be honest, there&#8217;ll be some cause for pause, some hesitation to encourage them to pursue that at first, because all right, the music industry is great. It&#8217;s a creative field, but you also want to be aware and mindful and you&#8217;ve got to pay your bills and on one hand, obviously, you&#8217;d love to see them to be successful, but also, what are the numbers, what are the statistics is on the other, and for me, for my family came from a good place.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: It was just a place of concern, and so it took me a while to eventually get to Full Sail because I needed my parents&#8217; blessing because I respect them too much to go rogue and just go do my own things. I respect and admire my family and my parents&#8217; opinion. Thankfully, I was able to like gather enough evidence. I think it just pushed me even further. Honestly, I wanted to make my parents proud, and I wanted to prove to them that, &#8220;Hey, your son&#8217;s doing this, and he&#8217;s going to be all right.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: I&#8217;m going to be able to put fo- there&#8217;s the whole &#8220;broke artist&#8221; misconception that&#8217;s prevalent in society. And, it forced me to do as much research as possible and be like, &#8220;Oh look, there&#8217;s this person over here who&#8217;s doing it and you can actually make a living doing it over here.&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I talked to this person on the phone, he&#8217;s doing this.&#8221; I think it forced me to do as much due diligence as possible to ensure that the decision that I was making, was going to pay off. And having had to go through all those hurdles, and those uncomfortable conversations, and trying to convince people that the thing that I&#8217;m doing, I really believe in, and I&#8217;m going to be successful at.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: When I got to Full Sail, college, I just had this burning desire to like make sure that, yeah, there&#8217;s some risk involved, but I&#8217;m betting on myself. And I want to make sure that that bet pays off as much as possible. So, I&#8217;m going to do whatever I got to do to make it during my time here. So, that meant working harder than the next person. I think you&#8217;ve heard this before, just being an African American in general, it&#8217;s been said multiple times, you&#8217;ve got to work twice as hard to get half as much. There&#8217;s not as many African Americans in my industry and that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m definitely cognizant of, and it&#8217;s something that I was aware of, and I use that as extra incentive to be like, &#8220;All right, maybe the odds aren&#8217;t in my favor, but if I&#8217;ve got a chance, then I&#8217;ve got to make those odds work for me as much as possible.&#8221; And that&#8217;s why I just worked as hard as I can. I&#8217;m going on with a long tangent here, but.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: No, no, no. It&#8217;s good to hear that. I was really going to ask this probably a little bit later on about kind of where that ambition comes from, but I mean I think being able to speak on it from, like you said, the perspective of one, not really being exposed to it that much growing up, and it sort of being more of a hobby, but then also having your family that kind of wants you to go into something that&#8217;s more stable because motion graphics or design or whatever you were calling it back then wasn&#8217;t really something they could see as being successful. So, you had to prove it to them in a way, but you also have to prove it to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah, I was telling my mom and dad, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m going to be all right&#8221; without having done it yet. It was like, I don&#8217;t know for sure what the future holds and I&#8217;m taking a big risk here. And so, all those different aspects&#8230;And I&#8217;m thankful I learned this lesson early on, you can use that to prevent you from pursuing something, or you can use that as a driving force as fuel to push you further. And thankfully, I chose the route of allowing that to push me to go above and beyond during my time there.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: So, what is your opinion about, I guess calling it animation was kind of just put a big tie in a big bow, but what is your opinion about diversity in the industry? Like, what do you want to see more of in your industry?</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah, I mean, this goes without saying, but definitely more black representation in general. You know, especially like at the decision making level. I&#8217;ve had to navigate through this industry in this field being the only black individual in my class, for example, or working at a studio, or freelancing at a place, or such, and being the only back individual in the room. And it&#8217;s so funny, because when you do come across those individuals that look like you, they&#8217;re just like the most talented people I know. And, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;man, there should just be more of that around and we need to&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: So, that&#8217;s definitely something that I&#8217;d love to see more of, and I&#8217;ll tell you, I was listening to one of the previous podcasts and I can&#8217;t remember who I was listening to, but there was something that you said that really stuck with me and this is why I&#8217;m really loving the work that you&#8217;re doing is that, you&#8217;ll reach out to some people and maybe they&#8217;ll tell you, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m not in a position to come on the podcast yet&#8221;, or &#8220;No, I&#8217;m maybe not as accomplished, or maybe not as successful or maybe I&#8217;m&#8221;, whatever the case may be. And they&#8217;ll put these barriers on themselves and I love that you say like, &#8220;No, that doesn&#8217;t matter&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: You want to hear from people from all different aspects and all different levels and all different areas in their life. And I love that, because that&#8217;s like, truthfully, honestly, had you asked me, I don&#8217;t know, two years ago, or something like that to come on this podcast, I would&#8217;ve said the same thing. And, it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve learning more and more now that, just in general, I think it&#8217;s so true, because you don&#8217;t see as many people that look like you. So, therefore you&#8217;re more susceptible to like imposter syndrome, like if you&#8217;re the only one here, you wonder if you even belong. And that&#8217;s something that I had to struggle with and had to deal with. It&#8217;s one of the reasons why my voice is&#8230; Like, I was very shy, very timid, not very bulky at all, but thankfully, like that hard</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Thankfully, that hard work and ambition I had in school, that never left me. When I got into the industry, I just continued working hard, working hard, and thankfully my work started to get noticed, and my work started speaking for me, because I wasn&#8217;t screaming it from the hilltops or, &#8220;Hey look at me.&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t doing any of that, but I was sharing my work was in one word and just doing good work started in having that start to travel and, people were liking my work and it was just so, it was just so humbling because more people started reaching out to me, especially people that looked like me and African Americans. I&#8217;m going to say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m rooting for you man&#8221;. &#8220;Like I&#8217;m loving the work that you&#8217;re doing keep up the good work&#8221;. And it, before it was, oh these are just some compliments and like, all right, that&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah, I appreciate it. Thank you. But appreciate this, that and the other. But it just started coming, just the more my work has getting more visible, more people started reaching out. It&#8217;s like I love seeing what you&#8217;re doing. I love seeing that you&#8217;re doing this, that and the other. And it&#8217;s just like I just got back, I just got back from speaking at a pretty big conference, one of the bigger prop conferences, my personal favorite conference called Lift Fest and I got asked to speak this year and come on stage and man, I can&#8217;t tell you the reception that I got after giving a talk on stage from the people in the industry that felt underrepresented and it was like they&#8217;re just love seeing you up there. So what I, what I&#8217;m starting to do more of, and I&#8217;m not perfect at this, but what I&#8217;m starting to do more of is embracing that platform and embracing that voice that I have because I can use that and I can use that to encourage and inspire and represent.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Because you don&#8217;t, they don&#8217;t hear from us that often, and so when they do, I want to make sure that we represent, I represent myself and others and represent the best of what we can be in what we, and so now I&#8217;m more embracing that, that aspect because naturally I&#8217;m out of my comfort zone. I don&#8217;t like attention. I don&#8217;t want to be the poster boy, anything like that. Like I feel like that&#8217;s a lot of pressure, but I&#8217;m learning more and more, especially hearing other people&#8217;s testimonials and people reaching out to me, sending me emails out of the blue. Hey, I just wanted to hear about your experience navigating through this space because just I&#8217;m just being as, as, as African American in this industry, I wonder if you are feeling this particular way because definitely how I&#8217;m feeling and I&#8217;m wondering if I&#8217;m the only one, I was like, nah man, I&#8217;m going through the same, I&#8217;ve got the same thing going through, still going through the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: And so I appreciate again, what you&#8217;re doing with this podcast because it&#8217;s giving a voice to individuals and making it, letting us know that it&#8217;s possible and that we&#8217;re out there and we can be successful in design and in this industry and that we&#8217;re all going through a lot of the same things and experience a lot of the same things.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: So as I&#8217;ve grown into my career, I&#8217;ve realized that I&#8217;m not just doing this for me, but I&#8217;m doing this for people like me. And, and that&#8217;s just something that I&#8217;ve been embracing a whole heck of a lot more as I continue to progress. So I, if there&#8217;s an opportunity for me to speak and voice and speak out, like I no longer shy away from that because even though that is my nature and that&#8217;s my tendency, I no longer shy away from that because if I can use my voice to again reach somebody else and purse somebody else to pursue the arts or to step up to the plate or strive for greatness, then I almost feel obligated to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Because this is the best work that I can do is having the impact on others and influencing others, especially people that look like me to strive for greatness and to continue pushing forward.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Wow. That&#8217;s powerful to hear, man. I mean it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s interesting like you mentioned, because I would imagine a lot of the work that you do, you are sort of behind the scenes as it, as it relates to the work that you do. The work kind of does have to speak for itself. And I get those same kind of emails too, where people just reach out and it&#8217;s a an advantage point because sometimes they&#8217;ll look at you as if you&#8217;ve made it, but you&#8217;re also still navigating through the industry because as your profile changes or as the work gets out there more, it puts you in different rooms and different places and different scenarios and you&#8217;re still trying to navigate all of that. It&#8217;s a really interesting kind of paradigm.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah, for sure. For sure. It&#8217;s interesting because just being, just being in some of those rooms where you&#8217;re the only one representing your background, that&#8217;s the, and especially like in those decision making rooms, especially in those high profile creative environments, those and such, and having the confidence to speak up, especially in those rooms, that&#8217;s something I had to learn to do. I had to, I was just speaking at Ben Fest as I mentioned earlier, and a good friend of mine who&#8217;s also African American, man, where did you get that confidence from to go up there on this stage? And it&#8217;s so ironic and funny to hear her say that to me because I&#8217;m not confident, this is something, this is something that I had to truly work on, work really hard on and break out of my shell and, really kind of overcome that fear of that.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: I think it&#8217;s something that, like you said, it&#8217;s always, you&#8217;re always working on and as you progress through your career, it&#8217;s always a struggle and a challenge. And, and I think I, like I said, we&#8217;re more susceptible to the imposter syndrome just because of how underrepresented we can be. And it&#8217;s not even [inaudible 00:58:16]. Like there&#8217;s real barriers, there&#8217;s real gatekeepers who want to prevent you from getting to where you go. So having to not meet those hurdles is a real struggle. There&#8217;s been like subtle slights that I&#8217;ve experienced for sure where there&#8217;s rooms where I felt like I should of been in or meetings I felt like I should&#8217;ve been in or like, especially like client basing meetings where I was, I felt I could bring a real strong perspective and outlook towards the particular project at hand where that didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: So, yeah. And, and again, like I said earlier, I think there&#8217;s two things. There&#8217;s two responses to that. You can either use that to kind of draw further into your shell, draw back further into your shell and, and, and lower your confidence. Or you can use that as fuel to your fire and use that as a, I wasn&#8217;t asked to be in this particular this room, then you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re passing up on an opportunity that could make you better. I&#8217;m going to go and take, continue to work on me and continue to develop myself to make my skills and my talents and undeniable wherever I go. You know? So, so it just pushes it for me, it just pushes me further to, I don&#8217;t want to, I&#8217;m not looking for, I&#8217;m not looking, I don&#8217;t have a big debtor. I&#8217;m not looking to like prove anybody wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: I&#8217;m trying to prove myself right. Because I know what I&#8217;m capable of, I know my potential and I&#8217;m always constantly, I&#8217;m trying to strive for that and reach that and wherever I go. So it&#8217;s just more fuel to my fire for me.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: What does success look like for you now?</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: I&#8217;ve got somewhat of a controversial response to that. It&#8217;s not really controversial, just more so a topic that&#8217;s not touched or talk about. But like for me in my career I&#8217;m fortunate, I&#8217;ve gotten the opportunity to work on some great projects and I&#8217;ve gotten to work on opportunity work on some high profile projects, films and such. Got to work for high profile clients and such. And now I want to, for me, and I&#8217;m not here by any means, but I, I want to make a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Right? And that sounds, that sounds controversial, but the reason being is it because I desire money in it of itself? That&#8217;s not the reason I want to use money. I want to use the money I earned to buy back my time. At the end of the day, we trade our time for money, right?</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: True.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: In the form of a job, right? We trade the type of money, but yet, what&#8217;s more valuable, right? Time or money. Like most people would say your time is more valuable than money, right? And so if, if time is your most valuable resource, right? So then the more money you have, the more time you can buy back in your day. Right? I want to I want to spend more time with my family for instance. I want to spend more time pursuing creative endeavors that are important to me.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Right now. My most precious resource I have is being allocated to a job, which is the norm, right? That&#8217;s the norm of society. But I&#8217;m working hard to try and create an alternative lifestyle that kind of circumvents the traditional system that we have with what the traditional job and such. So, and I say that and I wanted to, I say that because we make money in this taboo subject, right? But it&#8217;s a topic of discussion we need to have more of and we need more talk more you talk about, especially in our culture in general. Again, I don&#8217;t value money in itself. Money is just a tool. It&#8217;s a resource we can use to buy or trade for something of greater value. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: So yeah, I&#8217;m just working really hard to find, try to find creative ways, trading passive income, residual income, trying to find these different revenue models that allow me to buy back my times, that way I can pursue projects that are important to me without having money being an issue.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: So I want to talk about that, how that discussion, because a lot of people may not realize that that&#8217;s an option.I think people may only considered just having a job being the only way, to navigate through life. But I&#8217;ve learned that I&#8217;ve seen and observed different alternatives. So I&#8217;m working, striving again, not there yet by any means, but I&#8217;m working, striving to try and get to that point. I&#8217;ve like, I&#8217;ve made a step in the right direction already currently.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Right? Like for example, I&#8217;ve always said, and this is just me personally in my, my personal glove, I&#8217;ve always said I don&#8217;t want to, I don&#8217;t want to worry about how many vacation days I have left. That&#8217;s something that&#8217;s always been a goal of mine. And thankfully I&#8217;ve actually achieved that goal somewhat by being freelance now. And having put it like now the ball kind of is in my court, to where I can take as much time as I want off. I feel that though, obviously I feel that financially, but I&#8217;ve kind of taken a step in the right direction and creating a career that is in enough of a demand to be able to take time off and turn down work. So where I can pursue some things that I want to pursue that are important to me and make the impact that I want to have, spend more time with my family.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: I&#8217;ve got a beautiful wife, a young daughter and a young son. And as I mentioned earlier this industry at times can be labor intensive, can be long hours and although it&#8217;s incredibly rewarding and I do enjoy it. When you&#8217;re working in a job, you are building somebody else&#8217;s dream you&#8217;ll work hard to create a business and a machine that&#8217;s a for-profit machine that&#8217;s building up their dreams. And I want to take that time and devote it towards something that I truly, truly believe in and want to work on and pursue and build up my own dreams and my own business, my own in part empire and such. So that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve been thinking of more and more so lately. In the past there were certain priorities that are important to me that maybe aren&#8217;t as important to me now.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: And so that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m currently navigating and currently trying to solve. And like I said, I&#8217;ve made some steps in the right direction. Hopefully in the near future I&#8217;ll be able to have that autonomy to be able to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I mean, speaking of your wife and your kids, how do you balance all of that? Like while still striving to do great work and, and staying relevant in everything in your career?</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah, absolutely. For sure. It&#8217;s an adjustment for sure. It&#8217;s a major adjustment. It&#8217;s funny how much time we take for granted and how much time was a luxury for me and not realizing it. Until you have, until you have kids. I said that very same thing when I had one kid and I was like, man, I took all that time, extra time. I took that off granted, but then when I had two kids, I said it over again. I was like, man, that&#8217;s like what I had one kid. I was like, I was taking all the extra time for granted man. Like even less time now.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: So yeah, well it&#8217;s something that is a major adjustment and it&#8217;s one of those things I&#8217;ve constantly, constantly trying to learn about how I can use this precious asset as effectively and efficiently as possible, so that way I can maximize, when I do have those times to pursue things, I can maximize that time. So there&#8217;ll be things that I&#8217;ve, I have to decide and know what&#8217;s a priority. There&#8217;s a saying that goes don&#8217;t major in the minor things. There&#8217;s some minor things in my life that I&#8217;ve had to be like this isn&#8217;t worth the time commitment.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Like I have my time is a valuable resource and I have less of it now so I can&#8217;t allocate it towards some of these other things that are things. Maybe there&#8217;s some leisurely stuff that weren&#8217;t of incredible importance to me and my family is that I may no longer need to, to indulging, and so I&#8217;m being more and more strict and more tenacious about the different things that I allow to consume my time now, because it&#8217;s becoming, because again, my time is so valuable. Even down to every little aspect. Before, I felt the need to respond back to every email that came into my inbox, and I was realizing how much time that was being that was taking away from, from my, there&#8217;s this small little things in my life that I&#8217;m like, all right, is this, is this a valuable use of my time right now?</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: And so now I don&#8217;t feel bad for responding back to somebody like two weeks later because, that sounds terrible, but it&#8217;s the truth because, because I can&#8217;t respond back to every single email or every inquiry or right away, I&#8217;m not that bad. I&#8217;m not too bad. Maybe a week. But no, but I just being very, without touching on too many sensitive topics, but like social media is another aspect that I&#8217;m like trying to curve as well and all these other different aspects of that conditioner, even distractions that can utilize your time that you can be otherwise using product productivly. Because I want my family to be our priority for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Like it&#8217;s my number one priority and I don&#8217;t want to compromise on that by any means, but also to, I worked really hard to get to this point in my career and I don&#8217;t want to let that subside, and I want to continue. I feel like the older I get, the more I progress in my career, the more ideas and more I feel like I have more ideas now that I want to pursue than ever. And I want to, these are ideas that I want to pursue and I feel like they would have a major impact and I want to work on work that, is greater than me and transcends me and Travis further than anything I&#8217;ve done before.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah, you want to be able to enjoy the fruits of your labor. You work hard, you want to be able to at the end of the day, be able to leave work at work and enjoy your family, enjoy your free time. So we&#8217;re at the end of the year also. The end of the decade. When you look, let&#8217;s say the next five years it&#8217;ll be 2025 before you know it really, you sort of mentioned already the sort of feeling that you want to have, but what sort of projects do you think you&#8217;d want to be working on? Like where do you see yourself in the future?</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah, absolutely. Hopefully in five, ten years or so. My career path has led to the opportunity for me to pick and choose the type of jobs that I want to work on without, I touched on this a little bit earlier, but that without money really being an issue. Hopefully I&#8217;m at a point in my career where I have that autonomy that allows me to be able to take initiative and don&#8217;t develop projects that are important to me and using my skills and God given talent for good for social issues, I&#8217;m working on projects that are bigger than me and make an impact and are meaningful because like it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s one of those things like in my industry, which I&#8217;m incredibly grateful to be able to earn an income and work for some amazing clients.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: But maybe a pessimistic alternative viewpoint of what it is that we do is that we&#8217;re kind of glorifying products, or services and selling to consumers things that they might not necessarily need. And so if anything, I want to offset some of that by just working on projects that are meaningful, that are impactful, that are informative, that are educational and have a purpose and advocating change and raising awareness on particular projects. So, and that&#8217;s not even five, ten I, that&#8217;s actually stuff that I&#8217;m working on now, honestly, that I&#8217;m trying to, to pursue more of. And there&#8217;s always the whole money versus and time issue aspect of it, whenever you&#8217;re pursuing those jobs that necessarily aren&#8217;t for profit but they&#8217;re there for the good of society, so those are the projects that are like incredibly interesting to me and project that I want to pursue.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Because it&#8217;s interesting because as an artist, as artists were uniquely positioned to speak a language that the generation today speaks. We speak it fluently, right? And the language that degeneration today consumes, and there&#8217;s a real power in that and it&#8217;s a cool uncle Ben here to be like super cheesy, but with great power comes great responsibility. If you think about it, like just think about how powerful just, they think about Cambridge Analytica and how powerful having access to those resources and influencing individuals to swing an election that&#8217;s crazy and insane. And to think that&#8217;s how much power you can have just by advertising to two people, well what if we use that power for good too to advertise, and promote and push and encourage ideas that that need to be heard. So that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve been thinking of more and more lately and what I&#8217;m trying to pursue more of is just just pursuing those projects that are more meaningful and using my talents and designs for. Good.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Well just so to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and your work and everything online?</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Yeah, absolutely. My website is in handeleugene.com and you can find all my socials on there and all my work and everything that it is that I do. And, yeah, I just want to say too, like anybody has any questions about, we didn&#8217;t, we didn&#8217;t go into all the different things, millions of things that I could have talked about. But I guess the biggest thing I wanted to leave too with your viewers, if there&#8217;re any questions about navigating this industry, like motion graphics, most of the design, even the creative industry just in general. Just reach out, reach out to me. My email is on my website and you can reach out anytime and, and I&#8217;d love to continue like discussing this further with anybody who&#8217;s interested in and pursuing this, this industry and just in general.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Sounds good. Well handle Eugene. I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. One, not just for sharing about the work that you&#8217;re doing with Apple and other companies is as well as the work that you&#8217;ve done with, with Marvel and in films and everything. Your story and your drive I think or something which is kind of the core of what revision path is about. As it relates to showing that there are people that are in the creative industry that have the same passion and verve and work ethic to really create great things. They just don&#8217;t necessarily always get recognized. And so it&#8217;s important to be able to not only provide a platform for them to shine, but also, as you alluded to, just a few minutes ago to find ways to use those skills to better the world around us.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: A lot of the work that I think we do as, as digital creatives can be very ephemeral. You designed something really great and then a year or two later it&#8217;s been phased out for whatever the next thing is. And then you wonder, I put so much time and energy and effort into this thing that now is no longer existing. So how do you use your skills for something that can be more impactful? And I think your story and everything that you&#8217;ve had to share, it&#8217;s something that is a great thing for us to end up the year on. So, I mean brother, I really want to see where you are in five years. Because like I told you, I&#8217;ve been following you since full sail. I&#8217;m so proud of the work you&#8217;re doing. I really just want to see where you&#8217;re it in the future. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>Handel Eugene</strong>: Thank you man. I appreciate it and thank you for all the work that you&#8217;re doing. Seriously, once I found your podcast, I immediately became a better person, a more informed person, and learned so much. Just from hearing from you and hearing from the guests that you&#8217;ve had on the podcast. I seriously, I recommend it to anybody that I come across that&#8217;s dealing with the same issues that we&#8217;re dealing with. And I can&#8217;t thank you enough for having done over 300 episodes, interviewing so many talented and amazing creatives in the industry and just making us more visible and making more people aware of our potential and, and what we can strive for and what we can do. Seriously. Thank you.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m always excited to find out about great design talent all over the world, so I was really excited to find out about Antonea Nabors while randomly browsing the Web. What a discovery! For the past few years, Antonea has been working at some of the top design agencies in Australia. Currently, she&#8217;s located in Brisbane and working as lead UI designer for Five Good Friends.</p>
<p>During our conversation, Antonea talked about how she first got interested in design, shared how a contest entry ended up changing her life, and discussed some of the cultural and work differences between the United States and Australia. We also talked a little about aboriginal representation, diversity in the Australian design community, and a lot more. Thanks to Antonea for a great chat!</p>
