Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>For our final episode of Revision Path for 2023, I talked with the amazingly brilliant Salih Abdul-Karim. If you&#8217;re a motion designer, then there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ve used <a href="https://airbnb.io/lottie" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Lottie</a>, which Salih co-created during his time at Airbnb and is the new industry standard when it comes to animation on mobile apps and the Web.</p>
<p>Salih talked about his current work at <a href="https://colabgroup.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">C≈çlab</a>, exploring their non-traditional approach which eschews agency hierarchies to maintain a hands-on, skill-diverse team that seamlessly fills in the gaps for startups and other companies. Salih also shared his personal journey of how he found his passion for combining tech and creativity, and we even gave our thoughts on Andre 3000&#8217;s debut solo album, <em>New Black Sun</em>.</p>
<p>Even with such a seasoned career, Salih&#8217;s humility and mindset of constant learning is truly inspiring. From all of us here at Revision Path, consider this episode our holiday gift to you! Merry Christmas!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>So my name is Salih Abdul-Karim, and I am a creative director [and] motion designer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So, Salih, we&#8217;re recording this at the end of the year. When you look back at 2023, if you could pick three words that would describe how this year has been for you, what would those words be?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>I would say‚Ä¶confusing. What&#8217;s the word to say that something went fast, like&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Swift?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Swift. Okay, so I got confusing. I got swift. And maybe lastly, I would say family is what I would say would be maybe the third word when I think about this. And that has to do with both my literal family, but also, like, where I&#8217;m working right now has a lot of family vibes. We all take care of each other, so it always comes up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Do you have any goals that you&#8217;d like to accomplish in 2024?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I think that I don&#8217;t have any kind of specific goals, and I never really been the kind of person to sit down and set goals. I&#8217;ve tried to do it before, but if anything, maybe my number one goal is to really try to foster even more relationships. I think that&#8217;s probably the thing I think about the most right now, is I got a lot of great relationships based on the 20 years I&#8217;ve been doing this. And I kind of have been riding the waves of those relationships for a while. And I just know that there&#8217;s more out there, especially as new industries like AI come out. There&#8217;s people working in it. I want to meet those people. I want to talk to them. I want to foster just some more relationships in some different areas.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it wild to say that you&#8217;ve been in this industry for 20 years? Doesn&#8217;t that feel wild when you look at the grand scheme of things?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s wild. And I feel hella old, man. And then what has happened in those 20 years? It&#8217;s just been such a whirlwind. It&#8217;s interesting, I think about where that 20 years started, and it started in such a kind of ambiguous place where I&#8217;m getting out of school and I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing, and I&#8217;m trying to figure my way around it. And again, I still kind of feel like that. Today I&#8217;m at a company where we&#8217;re working with startups and I&#8217;m trying to find their way. And the feeling almost has not changed from when I got some experience and I have some skills I can lean on, but the feeling when I got out of school, I kind of still feel like that today, 20 years later. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Do you feel like the guru at the top of the mountain? A little bit?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Definitely not. I definitely do not feel like the guru at the top of the mountain. And again, I can&#8217;t say that I don&#8217;t have knowledge or tricks that I lean on or experiences that I lean on, but more often than not, I definitely still feel like I really don&#8217;t know what the heck I&#8217;m doing and I&#8217;m trying to make the best decision I can with the information I have every day. It&#8217;s worked out. I still got a job, I&#8217;m still working, and I got a lot of great colleagues that I&#8217;ve built over the years, but I definitely still don&#8217;t feel like the wise guru or feel like I know what I&#8217;m doing at all.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about C≈çlab, which is where you&#8217;re currently at. It&#8217;s this creative studio that&#8217;s based out of San Francisco. Tell me more about it. Like how did you get started there?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>So C≈çlab is like you mentioned, it&#8217;s a creative studio focused in on marketing, brand design and product design. And C≈çlab kind of sits within a growth equity company called Westcap. And so you imagine Westcap invests in mostly tech startups. They invest in the startup. They say, okay, we&#8217;re going to give you x amount of money, but we&#8217;re also going to have our creative team C≈çlab parachute in and help you with various things. And when I say various things, I mean it could be almost anything. We got 22 people on the C≈çlab team. We have brand designers, product designers, growth marketers, insights.</p>
<p>People do insights and research to better understand companies&#8217; customers. We got me as motion design and creative director. We have brand strategists, we have content strategists, writers, we have pr. So we have a lot of various skill sets. And most of the skill sets we have are exactly the kind of skill sets that a startup shouldn&#8217;t quite have yet. There&#8217;s no reason for a startup to have a motion design, but there is a reason for me to, like I mentioned, parachute in and help out with various things. There are times where we have startups where they don&#8217;t have a CMO, but we have these two VPs of growth marketing. Maria and Diane. Sometimes they&#8217;ll parachute in very well what a CEO does and how to work with one based on all their experience.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll be a temporary CMO for a minute. C≈çlab is really about helping startups reach another level, and sometimes you can only reach that level when there&#8217;s a certain set of skills that you may not need yet. And that&#8217;s what we fill that gap for.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So you mentioned the team, and it has all these sort of different components. I mean, it sounds like almost kind of like a full-fledged agency.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And the only reason why we don&#8217;t call ourselves an agency, and this has been a debate between us since I started, the only reason why we don&#8217;t call ourselves an agency is because, number one, we don&#8217;t have all the layers that an agency has. Account director, senior account director, and all of the, I would say, account services of an agency. What we have are pretty much a couple dozen people who can, again, direct projects and lead projects, but also those people also design. So we don&#8217;t have people who are just managers for managers sake or salespeople or anything like that, that maybe a kind of traditional agency would have. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And I guess, like you said, it&#8217;s coming in from the bigger partner. So everything that comes in is basically like a fully qualified lead. You don&#8217;t have to hunt down work.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s true. And one of the things I do like about Colack is we do have a group of companies that we work with on a regular basis that come in through who Westcap invests in. But we also do take external work as well. So we do sometimes reach out to companies that we&#8217;re interested in doing work for, or it might be a contact that we&#8217;ve known that has decided to start their own company and we&#8217;ll help them. So we do have external companies. Again, the main difference is when you work with us, you&#8217;re not really getting the same kind of, I don&#8217;t know, full fledged, layered agency experience. You oftentimes are working with a smaller group, four or five people. Each of those people is senior enough to do the work, but also to run the project as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay, I got you. So when new work comes in the door, what does the process look like? By the time it comes to you, I should say, what does the process look like?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, when new work comes in the door, usually, obviously there&#8217;s kind of a meeting with me. I serve as a creative director, executive creative director. We also have Brian Wakabayashi, who&#8217;s our head of strategy. He&#8217;s also kind of like our creative studio managing director. And then we have Michelle Ha, who&#8217;s our operations director. So the three of us usually will meet with whoever the company is that is interested in collaborating. And really we start a conversation about what they think they need, what we think we can do, and begin to kind of formulate a plan on how we think we might be able to help them. And from there, depending on what it is, sometimes I fade away altogether and they don&#8217;t see me anymore, because what they need is something that&#8217;s more like strategy.</p>
<p>And then we&#8217;ll bring our other brand strategists in, they&#8217;ll do a strategy process, and that might be the end of the project. Sometimes a thing will come in, like as an example, we had an AI startup approach us to do an explainer video for them that explains their product. That was an instance where I took that project on. I brought on a designer, brought on a writer, and then Brian, our head of strategy, he disappears. Depending on what the project is, you&#8217;re going to get a different combination of people from the team that really focus on the thing that you need.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s funny you mentioned AI. That&#8217;s been a regular theme that we&#8217;ve had on the show probably for the past two years now. We mentioned it at least in every episode in some capacity. Like, how are you using AI or any of this other new tech, like virtual reality, mixed reality, et cetera. Do you use any AI tools in your work, or do you have any just kind of general thoughts about AI with motion design?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I love it. I use them, but honestly, I more or less play with them. I haven&#8217;t yet figured out an exact way of how to integrate it into my day to day workflow. I imagine how I hope to be able to integrate it. Like as an example, if I have a video that I&#8217;ve made that&#8217;s 60 seconds long and it&#8217;s in a 16:9 kind of TV format, I&#8217;d love to just tell AI, :hey, make this into a square format for Instagram. Hey, cut this down to 30 seconds.‚Äù I‚Äôd love to be able to do that and have it just do it. But as of now, more or less any AI tool that I see come out, I try it, I play with it.</p>
<p>I play with mid journey, creating images, sometimes for fun, I definitely play with ChatGPT in terms of asking questions, or sometimes I&#8217;m doing writing for blog posts and I&#8217;ll have a proofread, stuff like that. But I feel a little bit like I&#8217;m just playing. I haven&#8217;t really found a way of integrating it into my work in a real way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, has the AI gotten sophisticated enough to do motion work? I mean, I&#8217;ve seen like, chat, GPT will do text and mid journey and Dolly and things like that, can do images, but has it gotten sophisticated enough to do motion?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>There are some programs that do it. There&#8217;s one called Runway ML.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>They have a whole suite of tools. So sometimes one of the kind of projects that I work on sometimes is like screen replacement, right? So you imagine you have this app, and they need a video to show off what the app does. So obviously you need people walking around using the app, and you&#8217;re showing footage of someone using that app. And usually what happens is I go in and I put in a new screen on top, and I track it, and I do what&#8217;s called rotoscoping, kind of painting out the frames, the fingers in front or whatever, and making a new screen look like it&#8217;s integrated into the shot. And so this thing, Runway ML, they have a bunch of tools that can help you do that. For example, you can click on something and have it track. So if it&#8217;s a footage of like a surfer on a wave, you can click on the surfer&#8217;s body, and it&#8217;ll give you a tracking point as they move along. Then you can use that as you want to put a hat on the surfer or whatever you want to do.</p>
<p>So it has some stuff that are really kind of cool or fun to play with. But again, I&#8217;ve been using certain methods for a pretty long time, and occasionally I&#8217;ll try to use it to replace one of my methods, but it&#8217;s not quite at a place where I feel like it&#8217;s going to take it over quite yet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay. I was curious if it had the capability to do that, because I had a motion designer on the show a couple of weeks ago, Andre Foster. He co-founded a motion graphics design studio and production house called First Fight. And he talked about how he uses it sort of as like a Pinterest board. Like, he uses it for just kind of like inspiration and stuff. But then he said it inspired him enough to actually put together almost like opening credits to a show, not a real show, but just like, oh, let&#8217;s see how far I can sort of push the technology. And honestly, it looked like something I would see on, like FX or something. It looked really good.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Oh, that&#8217;s dope. Yeah. See, I&#8217;ll talk to you when we&#8217;re done on what that is. And play with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>You mentioned this in a past interview that you&#8217;ve done. You said that motion design is so crucial to making high quality digital products on any platform. Why is that the case?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>The case is just because the way, and this is maybe too deep and existential, right? But the way we experience all of our lives is through time, right? You walk outside, you walk down the block. That took 10 seconds. You experience time. You saw a dog, you saw a tree, you saw the sun. The way we experience life is through time. And I know that for years people were reading books and you using your imagination, people reading magazines. There&#8217;s a very static kind of experience. It lives as that thing, like a rock, just lives like that forever.</p>
<p>But now that we have technology, and smartphones are just ubiquitous, they&#8217;re everywhere, and you&#8217;re able to actually interact with them. You put your finger on it and you move it. You&#8217;re adding motion, you&#8217;re adding time to the equation. And the reason why motion is so important is because it helps you do something that feels more natural to what humans should be doing, if that makes any sense. So just as an example, right, if you&#8217;re on a website and you click on a button that&#8217;s going to take you to another page, the old school way is it&#8217;s just going to slam you right to the next page. Now you have to reorient yourself and figure out where you are now. And the way I think about it is motion can actually help you bridge those two things. It can help you understand where you were, it can help you understand where you went, where you&#8217;re going, and it just creates a more natural experience than just kind of blinking.</p>
<p>And now you appear somewhere else.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>That makes sense. Now that you put it that way, it is something that I think humans are used to, that they&#8217;re used to motion. And also, so many things now are skewing towards video, and that&#8217;s nothing but motion. So it kind of makes sense to still put those sorts of animations and interactions in most types of applications because that&#8217;s just what we expect now.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Totally. And it&#8217;s not a surprise that TikTok is as popular as it is with videos. Right. We love to look at things that move. It feels good. In addition, to help you understand how Ui might work, motion just helps you add emotion. We are all emotional. You feel happy, you feel sad.</p>
<p>And the things you interact with, you want them to give you that same thing. So when something you interact with has a little bounce to it, it gives you a feeling. Oh, this is supposed to be fun when something you interact with has a smoother nature to it. Elegant. Oh, this is supposed to be classy, right? So it helps you give emotion to digital products, no matter what the devices are, whether it&#8217;s on a phone or AR or VR or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Motion adds emotion. I like that. That&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s kind of switch gears here a little bit and learn more about you. I&#8217;m curious on where this sort of spark for design and animation sort of came from. So tell me more about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>I grew up in the DC area. Kind of moved back and forth between DC and Philadelphia. And growing up, we always had the latest game thing. I&#8217;m dating myself here. I&#8217;m an old man. But we used to have the Texas instruments, we used to have the Atari 500, or we used to have all these old game systems when I was like a little kid, and I loved playing with them. But I also had this curious mind where I would try to take it apart. I would say, what&#8217;s in here? So I would get a screwdriver.</p>
<p>I would open up the back. My mom would come in a room a week later. She&#8217;d be like, ‚Äúwhy is the cover off of the Nintendo?‚Äù And I&#8217;d be like, ‚Äúwell, I just wanted to see what was in there‚Äù, right? So I actually had a Nintendo that did not have a cover that I played for years because I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to put the thing back on. I just have a love of technology, like a lot of people. And I used to build my own computers when I was in middle school and high school, I&#8217;d buy the RAM, I&#8217;d buy the motherboard. I&#8217;d build them from scratch. It was just a fun thing. And when it&#8217;s time for me to go to college, I thought, okay, let me try to do computer science.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to learn how to program. I&#8217;m going to build. Make games, something like that. And my first year, at the end of my first year, I had a 1.2 GPA, and that was because the math was destroying me. We had, like, this Calculus, or Calculus 2, and I couldn&#8217;t quite wrap my head around it. And not only that, at the time, I just didn&#8217;t know how to learn. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I didn&#8217;t know how to sit down and study. I didn&#8217;t necessarily have the discipline yet to really push through.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know how to tell my homeboys, like, I can&#8217;t go out with you all; I got to get this computer science work in, you know what I&#8217;m saying? So I just ended up almost kind of flunking out of school. And this is a story I&#8217;ve told before. That one evening, my dad came‚Ä¶I used to live in my parents basement. During college, my dad comes downstairs, he&#8217;s like, ‚Äúbro, we saw your grades. Like, look, we don&#8217;t care what you&#8217;re going to do, but either do this right or don&#8217;t do it at all.‚Äù And then he closed the door and walked upstairs.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>And it was just a note. We don&#8217;t care what you do. We&#8217;re going to support you. But don&#8217;t just do something and be flunking and failing out. So I had a moment where I had to really say, am I going to really try to do this, or am I going to look for something else? And the school I went to, George Mason, they had a digital arts degree. It was basically a degree to help people make art using computers. So I thought, oh, well, let me do that. That seems kind of cool.</p>
<p>They have class in Photoshop. They had a class in after effects, which is wild that I still use after effects today. And then they have a class in 3D program that doesn&#8217;t exist anymore. And I took those classes. I was in the art department. I was learning about our history, critical theory, critical thinking, and I was really kind of enveloped in the art world through a technology lens. And from there, I got straight in. So that shift enabled me to kind of see how I could bring some of my creative mind and technology together.</p>
<p>So my senior year, I started to find these motion design companies all around the country that were doing these awesome commercials, and commercials will be animated with all these awesome graphics and characters. And I said, you know what? I want to do that after school. So after college, I packed up my little car, a little Acura, and I drove up to New York, and I moved up there, and I was knocking on doors. I had a little dvd. So funny. My kids, they saw some of my old DVDs in the garage. They were like, what&#8217;s going to use them no more? But I had my old DVD that I made. I burned it and had my reel of student work.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m, like, walking into these shops trying to get work. And luckily, I had this. He kind of became my first mentor. He&#8217;s a creative director at BET right now, Kendrick Reed, and walked into his office, and it was amazing again to see somebody like me, six foot something, Black man, bald head, and he&#8217;s a super fashionable guy, wearing cool clothes. I was like, okay, I see. So I walk in his office, and he&#8217;s like, ‚Äúso tell me, what do you want to do?‚Äù And I was like, ‚Äúwell, I love design. I love animation.‚Äù At the time, he was the creative director at Comedy Central, and so they had a department at Comedy Central that made commercials for Comedy Central that aired on Comedy Central.</p>
<p>So that was the department that he ran. He&#8217;s like, ‚Äúwell, what do you want to do?‚Äù I was like, ‚Äúwell, eventually, I want, you know, like, I want to be creative director at some place with a team like this.‚Äù So he kind of laughed, and he gave me my first job out of college. I was there for a couple of years, built some good relationships with some folks. I ended up going freelance after he left. I was kind of sad when he left. So then I left after he left, and I ended up going freelance for about eight or nine years after that. And I was just designing and animating wherever I could get in the door.</p>
<p>Design shops, ad agencies, TV networks like HBO, Showtime. I just would get in wherever I could. And it was an amazing experience. And some of the people I met back then, I‚Äôm still in contact with today, even though I&#8217;m kind of on the other side of the country, I&#8217;m doing something a little bit different. That was a really important part of kind of what led me to what I&#8217;m doing today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>During that time that you were doing all this freelancing, I mean, yeah, you were at a bunch of different studios, a bunch of different places. Do you feel like there was something that you were trying to attain? Like, were you trying to get to Kendrick? Were you trying to get to his position in terms of moving up the ladder or moving up in your skills?</p>

<p>I think the thing at the time, those ten years, what I really wanted to do was learn how to make my work good. Like, I would make something, and then I would go see someone else&#8217;s project. And it was very clear to me that mine wasn&#8217;t as good. My whole thing for that ten years was, I need to figure out how to make something good, because I see this person over here is crushing it, and mine doesn&#8217;t look like theirs. Why doesn&#8217;t mine look like theirs? And in the industry at that time, there&#8217;s a lot of late nights, and everybody worked from, like, ten to eight. We went out afterwards and come back to work the next day and deal with it. So it was a lot of hard work, but that was really the thing I thought about the most. Just like, why isn&#8217;t mine as good as that other person? It was more of a creative pursuit to make something that I felt was equal to the people I admired at the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, I&#8217;m kind of trying to also place this just like, chronologically. So this was really during the time, I&#8217;m guessing this is like the early 2000s. Like early 2000s to 2010s, pretty much?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. 2002 to 2011.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, during that time, even if you just step back and look at the web, think about how much the web had changed from 2002 to 2011. And of course that would end up invariably being reflected in media and advertising and publishing, because computers are now taking over as, like, the primary way that you do design, and the technology is getting better and the browsers are getting better, and all of a sudden now we&#8217;re using CSS, and now we have to change what we thought we did before with tables into something new. So there was always something new, I think back at that time, and it felt like there were new discoveries or new ways of doing things. Like every month it felt like it was something new and you had to keep going, you had to keep making stuff just to catch up. Like, you couldn&#8217;t really rest on your laurels during that time because of just how fast things were progressing in the industry.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Oh, yeah, that&#8217;s 100% true.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So after you were doing all of this freelancing and everything, you ended up as a motion graphics artist at square, and you were there for, I think, roughly about three years, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s correct. And square was the first place that I ever worked. Number one, that was a startup, but number two, that had, like, a physical product. All the things I had done for the ten years before were all advertising and marketing for tv shows. And the shows have people and Dave Chappelle‚Äôs show. It was interesting to be at a place that they had this little square card reader. And not only that, they had a whole team that worked on it. They had a team that worked on the box.</p>
<p>They had a team that worked on logistics of where the parts come from. They had a team that worked on every aspect of this little physical device. And so it was the first time where I worked at a company like that that I could actually get a peek inside the technology. I mentioned earlier. I was taking apart my Nintendo because I was curious what&#8217;s in there. And so it was really fun for me to be around people who were kind of making things, sending inside out. I think that it was mostly, again, like I mentioned, a little bit scary and daunting. It was comforting that I was on the video team at this company.</p>
<p>So I was still making videos. But when I would go into a meeting with the group who was responsible for the launch of the new Square Reader, and they&#8217;re talking about engineering challenges. I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about. You know what I mean? I feel a little bit lost and confused, but the only thing I could rest on was like, okay, I&#8217;m still here to do the thing I came here to do. That doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t learn about what they&#8217;re doing. But that became my challenge at square was like, how much can I learn about what they&#8217;re doing, what they&#8217;re talking about that can help me do my job better?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And then after that, you ended up at Airbnb, where you started off as the company&#8217;s only motion designer. I bet that had to be pretty daunting, especially at that time when Airbnb was really starting to take off.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, definitely. And so when I was at Square, like I mentioned, I was in the room with all these other functions, physical engineering, but also product designers. Yeah. And there were a couple of times when I was at Square where I collaborated with the product designers. Oh, I would do an animation for the square&#8217;s website. One of those product designers, Jason Mamro, who I still work with today, he left Square and went to Airbnb. He&#8217;s on Airbnb&#8217;s product design team. And at the time, their head of design, Katie Dill, she was, you know thinking, we probably should get a motion designer.</p>
<p>And everybody&#8217;s, all the product designers like, yes, let&#8217;s get a motion designer. And Jason luckily threw my name out and I ended up kind of coming in, interviewing for the role. And it was funny, my first week, I&#8217;m sitting with my manager, and since I&#8217;m the first motion designer, it&#8217;s not exactly clear how I&#8217;m going to plug in. So he asked me, he said, well, what should you work on? I was like, what do you mean, what should I work on? You should tell me what I should work on. Right? He&#8217;s like, well, no. Since we never had a motion designer, you have to help us understand what you can do as well as us telling you what would need you on. So it kind of opened my mind up to like, oh, this is a kind of a role where I kind of get to help create it and it&#8217;s not so cut and dry exactly what I&#8217;m going to be doing all the time. If I see an opportunity, I can pursue it.</p>
<p>If I see something I think I can help out with, I can go help; and likewise, people who think I can help can contact me for help.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What were some of those early things that you were doing?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>So I remember when I first joined, they were about to launch the Airbnb Apple Watch app. And you mentioned earlier how everything was always changing. So I was very much used to working on animations that were for TV. And the Apple Watch screen is tiny. And so I think the first project I ever worked on was the animation for the onboarding for the Airbnb&#8217;s Apple Watch app. We had these little characters and we had the little character, like, tap their watch and then we had a little Airbnb logo. It was very cute. I think that was the first project I ever worked on.</p>
<p>And then from there, I remember working on, they launched the Apple TV app and I worked on an onboarding video for that, or onboarding animation for the Apple TV app for Airbnb. And then from there, really honestly, it spread out to so many different things. Sometimes I was doing the animation for either the website or the app, but other times it was prototyping UI. Okay, we need a prototype. We got a meeting with Brian Chesky in three weeks. We need to put together a prototype to articulate how we want this flow to go. Or it was. Brian Chesky has a presentation about this new feature and he needs an animation for his presentation that shows what the UI is going to do.</p>
<p>And they still do this today. When you see Airbnb&#8217;s launches, they have a couple of motion designers now that they do this all the time where they&#8217;re making prototypes for presentations. So I used to kind of do, there were probably like a dozen different things, ways that I would help out just depending on the time and what was going on at the company.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Man, I mean, it sounds like you really had your hands full, because I know that as Airbnb was growing, and I said, like you said, the tech was also changing. Mean, did you feel like you were stretched thin? I mean, did they eventually hire more motion graphics designers?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, eventually we hired another one. Maybe on my third year we hired another one. Then he kind of subsequently left. So then it was just me again. But I used to tell everybody there were 60 product designers on the team with 60 product designers to one motion designer. I used to tell everybody, like, I&#8217;m just one person, so I&#8217;m going to do what I can and everything else is not going to happen. And everybody again, everybody who&#8217;s very understanding the culture that we had at Airbnb at the time it was real friends and family vibes. It wasn&#8217;t like people were like, oh, man, he&#8217;s not doing his job right.</p>
<p>Everybody knew that there&#8217;s no way that one person could do, you know, for a lot of teams, it was like even me helping a little bit was going to be better than not helping at all. So they would accept any level of engagement that I could give. Everybody&#8217;s really understanding.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s good, because I&#8217;ve definitely worked at some places that are not that. Definitely the opposite, where you&#8217;re the person that does it, they expect you to always be the one to do it. No matter how many times you&#8217;re like, I need help. No matter how many times you&#8217;re throwing out a life preserver, they&#8217;re like, oh, you got it, you&#8217;re good. No, I&#8217;m drowning over here. Can you help me? So while you were at Airbnb, and like you said, they ended up eventually building out the team some more, you were on a team that launched Lottie, which is an open source tool that adds animations to like, iOS, Android, native apps, et cetera. How did the idea for Lottie come about?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>So I mentioned earlier that one of the first things I worked on was the Apple Watch app. I had these little characters animating, and the way I delivered it that delivered the animation to the engineering team was, I&#8217;m pretty sure it was a sequence of PNGs. My engineering partner, an iOS engineer, he had to build a way for the app to play those PNGs in sequence. I think it was like 30 PNGs per animation. And for me, coming from tv, I was like, there has to be a better way for us to do this. The png sequence to do all our animations. The file sizes were pretty big and I think everybody hoped for a better way, but there just wasn&#8217;t anything out at the time. And I developed a really good relationship with an iOS engineer named Brandon Withrow.</p>
<p>He was an iOS engineer, but he went to school for animation. So we clicked right off the bat. And Airbnb used to have these things called Hack Weeks, where during the whole week you could work on anything you wanted. And I remember I approached Brandon, I say, maybe let&#8217;s try to find a way for us to get some data out of after effects, the thing I animated, and get it into iOS playing somehow. So he&#8217;s, I mean, let&#8217;s try it. What do you got? We ended up finding this tool called Bodymovin. It was this engineer named Hernan Torrisi created this tool that could export data out of after effects into a file, JSON file. It just has all the raw data of the animation.</p>
<p>So I send this file to Brandon. I&#8217;m like, what do you think? Bodymovin is open source? Take a look at it. So he said, all right. A couple of days, he came back, and he had a blue square show up on the screen. It wasn&#8217;t moving, wasn&#8217;t animating, just a blue square. And I think that kind of spurred the next step, which was, okay, now he has the square going left to right. Okay, next. Now he has a triangle and a circle.</p>
<p>And he, Brandon himself, just worked on features in his own time, and he got it to a point where we could do some small animations similar to the ones I did on the Apple Watch, and we could actually put know, I could export it from after effects, get the data out, put it into the iOS app, and the file size was much smaller, and it was way more performant. And so we had a little thing for iOS that was working, and we thought, well, we have an Android app. Kind of a bummer to have animations on iOS. Let&#8217;s find an Android engineer that could help us. And we brought in another engineer, Gabriel Peal. He was an Android engineer at the time. And we said, well, look what. Here&#8217;s what Brandon has on iOS.</p>
<p>Maybe we could do something similar on Android. And Gabe was the funniest one because he was like, I don&#8217;t know. He&#8217;s like, if we could do this, somebody would already name it. We gave him the same files, but he did the same thing. First he had a box, then he had a circle, then he had it moving left to right. And the next thing you knew, we had an iOS and Android framework that could play these really small animations in our apps. So we had that for a handful of months. And I think it was February, or I think it was like December of 2017, Facebook open sourced their version of what we had.</p>
<p>It was called Facebook Keyframes. It was exactly the same thing you export from after effects. Your data comes out. It works on iOS and Android. So when we saw that, we said, oh, they made it, too. It wasn&#8217;t open source at the time, so I thought, oh, well, let me try theirs. And I remember exporting one of the animations that worked on ours. I remember exporting it in their format, and there was a whole bunch of stuff broken.</p>
<p>So it was very clear to us that, oh, the thing we have is a little bit better than the thing they have. So we should open source as well. So Brandon came up with the name Lottie. It&#8217;s named after an animation pioneer named Charlotte Reiniger, who&#8217;s German. In the 1920s, she created full length feature movies and we got the name, we open sourced it, we made a little landing page and it just kind of took off from there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow. It sounds like it was a pretty organic thing, though. It didn&#8217;t just sort of come. I mean, it came in a way out of necessity. But the way that it managed to sort of build out and really become a framework was really organic.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. It was really organic. And it was just lucky. It feels a little bit like the right place at the right time. It was lucky that Airbnb had a motion designer at the time. It was lucky that Brandon was an iOS engineer who kind of knew about animation. It&#8217;s lucky that we were friends and he would work on it in his free time. It was lucky that Gabe was so talented that he could jump in and create.</p>
<p>And at the know, we all had other stuff to work on. Our managers really didn&#8217;t care if we worked on Lottie in our free time as long as we got our other stuff done. And so that was the vibe for about a year. It was really a side project.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And now Lottie is used all over the place. It&#8217;s used in hundreds of thousands of different applications and stuff. What does it feel like knowing that something you&#8217;ve created has really caught on like that and made such an impact?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>It blows my mind. It really blows my mind because again, it could have easily not happened or it could have easily been Facebook keyframes that have been the thing that really caught on. So, yeah, it blows my mind. And it&#8217;s just humbling to be a part of something that people like and they use it and all. Full disclosure, I&#8217;m sure someone&#8217;s going to come out with something better than Lottie and then Lottie will disappear. That&#8217;s just the nature of software. That&#8217;s just the nature of creativity. I&#8217;m cool with that.</p>
<p>But to have had a hand in something that people like and use and have been using for the last handful of years is really humbling and amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I can imagine. Just seeing your work make such an impact and then to know that you were really kind of behind it in the beginning is amazing. And it&#8217;s not something that is, I would say, hidden to history. People know that you did it. It&#8217;s not like Lottie just sprung forth anonymously. They know that you&#8217;re one of the people behind.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Really, the thing that I really like now is, like I was saying, at C≈çlab, I&#8217;m working with startups all the time, so I&#8217;ll be working with a startup and they&#8217;ll be like, hey, can we put this animation we do? Can we put this on our app? And they&#8217;ll be like, I heard of this thing. It&#8217;s called Lottie. Maybe we could use that. They don&#8217;t know how. You&#8217;re like talking about my child, you know what I&#8217;m saying? I know this thing so well. I helped build it. I was there from the beginning. But people don&#8217;t know and oftentimes I don&#8217;t say anything.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not that kind of guy to be like, well, that&#8217;s my thing. But it&#8217;s just kind of cute and funny to me that it&#8217;s now coming back to me through other channels I can imagine.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Like, you have to sort of keep yourself in check, like, &#8220;oh, like, I can&#8217;t&#8230;I don&#8217;t want to blow my cover here.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Oh, 100%. But also, you know, design, motion design, this is a small industry of many. And what I did, while it&#8217;s maybe important to a couple hundred thousand people, there&#8217;s probably a ton of other people that don&#8217;t even know about it. So it&#8217;s not that big a deal. It&#8217;s not brain surgery. I&#8217;m not saving lives here. It makes me laugh when that happens, and it does happen every couple of months, which is great to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Is there still active development on it?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>There is some. So Gabriel Peal, the Android engineer; he still works on it. He still works on it. He gets requests through and I think that&#8217;s probably the benefit of being open source. You have other people in the community who contribute, you have other people who change the code and submit it. So yeah, it&#8217;s still being not, I think that for a little while, while I was at Airbnb, after Brandon and Gabe left, it wasn&#8217;t really worked on internally, but there were a couple pushes internally to help develop. So we, I remember it got changed from one language into Swift, and then I think more recently since I&#8217;ve left, they&#8217;ve done a couple small things on the iOS side, but it&#8217;s really honestly mostly being pushed outside of Airbnb. So there&#8217;s a company called Lottie Files.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re based in Malaysia and they&#8217;re doing a ton of development on themselves, bidding on top of it, building state machines on top of it, which is a complicated term. People can google it and they&#8217;re kind of doing all kinds of things with the format and helping develop it outside, mostly because it is open source.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>When you look, sort of, back at the early parts of your career to now, what would you say is the biggest lesson that you&#8217;ve learned about yourself?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Maybe the biggest lesson I learned about myself is that I really do enjoy being in an environment that I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on. Okay. That there&#8217;s things that are new, there are things to learn, there are things I can be curious about. So, for example, like I mentioned, when I joined Airbnb, I was the only motion designer on a team full of product designers and engineers, none of which I had worked with before. I&#8217;d never worked with an engineer before. But it was so interesting to me. I ended up taking an eight week coding class because, again, we were in meetings where I didn&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about. So that part of trying to help myself understand someone else&#8217;s industry to better do my job is fascinating to me.</p>
<p>And now it&#8217;s a similar thing at C≈çlab. I&#8217;m working with startups, I&#8217;m working with ceos, cmos, and founders. I&#8217;m understanding what they care about. I&#8217;m understanding that they care about their business goals, so they don&#8217;t care about how the thing moves or what it looks like. Is this having an impact on the business?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>So now I&#8217;m having a whole different set. And I think every few years in my career, when I start to feel like I&#8217;m pretty competent at the thing I&#8217;m doing, I usually end up moving to something else that puts me a little bit off balance.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m glad you mentioned that because I think that that is a practice that is something that more creatives, I think particularly more Black creatives are starting to embrace. I&#8217;m tying this into something, I promise you. So we&#8217;re recording this right now on the day that Andre 3000 just released his new album, his debut album, debut solo album, New Blue Sun.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>We‚Äôve been talking about it at work all day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>I listened to it this morning, actually. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What do you think about it?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p> I think it‚Äôs‚Ä¶</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>You can be honest! Yeah, be honest. Think about it.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>I mean, I&#8217;m such a big Andre 3000 Outkast fan. Like, I&#8217;ll listen to whatever they put out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>You know what I&#8217;m saying? They could put out themselves beating a bucket and I&#8217;ll listen to it. But the interesting thing, I saw that they had an interview with them last night at GQ, and he was talking about, like, they were at the top of their game, and it loses some of its magic when you feel like you really know what you&#8217;re doing. And I think he was looking for something different where he could feel like a beginner again.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>You know what I&#8217;m saying? But, yeah, I listened to it this morning. I think it&#8217;s cool. I put it on while I was writing something. And honestly, for about 40 minutes ‚Äì the album is like 90 minutes long. For about 40 minutes. I totally forgot it was on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>And I think that&#8217;s the point.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&#8217;s the point, too. And the reason that I was asking about this is because I think sometimes, especially when people know you for a specific thing that you&#8217;ve accomplished in your career, that tends to be a box that they put you in. So anything else that you do is, like, compared to that thing, or they expect that the next thing that you do is going to be the same box-shaped thing that you&#8217;ve done before. So, of course, everyone knows 3000 for his lyrics. They&#8217;re expecting it&#8217;s going to be a fire rap album. Right? Instead, he comes out with some Alice Coltrane, Don Cherry, Yusef Lateef-like flautist sound bath 90 minute journey that&#8217;s like the product of an Ayahuasca trip, right?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Oh, he definitely was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve been seeing some of the reviews. I mean, it just came out. By the time this airs, people will have known about it or. But. But I was thinking, like, man, I bet people are going to clown this album like they did when Solange&#8217;s last album came out. Like, When I Came Home came out and people were like, what is this? Because they expected her to be in this, Beyonc√©‚Äôs&#8217; little sister, kind of like, T.O.N.Y.-shaped, Sol-Angel and the Hadley Street Dream- shaped box. And she comes out with this‚Ä¶I mean, that&#8217;s one of my favorite albums of all time, her last album.</p>
<p>So I really like what you said about you, like, being in these spaces where you don&#8217;t know kind of what to do or what&#8217;s next. And I think that&#8217;s something that creatives in general, particularly Black creatives, should embrace, because it locks you in a box when you&#8217;re always doing the same type of thing over and over and over in a way. And as creatives, there&#8217;s more things that we want to do. There&#8217;s more ways we can sort of express ourselves. I think that&#8217;s a really good practice to have as a creative.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>And it&#8217;s scary.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>You know what I&#8217;m saying? It&#8217;s scary. But I think that&#8217;s part of the point. That&#8217;s the reason why people like roller coasters. It&#8217;s kind of scary.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>But that&#8217;s kind of what&#8217;s fun about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What would you say are, like, your next steps of growth for you as a creative? Like, where do you want to grow into?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I think I have some knowledge from television. I have some knowledge from kind of the product design engineering side at C≈çlab. I&#8217;m kind of putting those two things together. So I get to help startups with brand campaigns that have tv commercials, but also animations within their app. I think after talking with you about it for a little bit, it definitely feels like the thing that I butt up against most that I&#8217;m not always really sure about is really about business goals, how a business runs, how a startup runs, how do you actually make business impact, how do I use my skills in order to actually fundamentally change the direction of a business? You know what I&#8217;m saying? And I think that learning more about things like customer acquisition costs. Right. Learning more about measurement and research and strategy, I think will just help me put my work through a slightly different lens. And these are all things that at the moment, I would say I&#8217;m like a child at, but I think those are the things I&#8217;m starting to butt up against right now, especially when you&#8217;re talking to founders or people running companies.</p>
<p>These are things they care about and probably some things I need to learn there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, and that&#8217;s a good point. I mean, the best designers, I think, eventually end up finding out how to meld the creativity with the business and the strategy to really take it to the next level, because there&#8217;ll be a certain point in your career, and I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve experienced this, but I certainly have, where you just feel like you&#8217;re the hired hand, like you just come in to do this part of the work and that&#8217;s it. And you may or may not see what the impact of it is. It may not be privy to you or you may not be exposed to it, but you know that you can do more. Like, you can feel yourself kind of growing out of that constraint that you have. And so I think that&#8217;s a good place to be, is to try to learn more about the business end. And I think with C≈çlab, you&#8217;re at a great place to do it. You&#8217;re interfacing with startups.</p>
<p>Plus C≈çlab is sort of this creative arm of a larger business entity. I think you&#8217;re in a great place to make that happen.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>I think you&#8217;re right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Where do you pull strength from?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Most of my strength comes from probably just my curiosity, like when I think about, what am I doing? So sometimes it&#8217;ll be like 11:00 and my whole family, my kids, my wife, everybody&#8217;s sleeping, and I&#8217;m just up, can&#8217;t sleep. And I can&#8217;t sleep because I&#8217;m thinking about some project that I&#8217;m involved in. It might be some explainer video where we have a script, but I think the script is not that good. So I&#8217;m really curious about looking up other scripts and good ones and seeing what they did. I&#8217;m really curious about doing, like, let me do, like, ten different versions of this thing and see what they look like. That curiosity, that creative itch. The part of the creative process where you&#8217;re really exploring this blue sky, it could be anything. I think that&#8217;s probably where I draw my strength from, is I&#8217;ll stay up late for those reasons.</p>
<p>And again, when I&#8217;m staying up late and I&#8217;m working hard on something, it does tend to be better.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. If you wouldn&#8217;t have gone into motion design and animation, what do you think you would have ended up doing?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>I have no idea, really. I&#8217;ve been doing this so long, I don&#8217;t know what I would have done. And it all happened so kind of happenstance, you know what I mean? It was like, I rolled the dice, okay, now I&#8217;m in New York. Roll the dice again. Now I&#8217;m in San Francisco. Roll the dice again. I couldn&#8217;t have guessed that I would be where I am today, doing what I&#8217;m doing today. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s like a question I have a really good answer for.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, I guess, to that end, what do you want the next chapter of your story to look like?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>I think I want to continue doing the things I came to C≈çlab to do, wherever it is. I want to keep bringing these two halves of my career together. So how can I use design and animation to entertain people? And also, how can I use design and animation to make people&#8217;s experience better, to make their experience of a product better? And I want to keep kind of jamming those two things together and then put a layer on top of. I want to use design and animation to help businesses achieve their goals. Right? So all three of those things. I want to just get much better at doing those three things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m the worst with social media, so I&#8217;m not really on Instagram or Twitter or X or whatever. Our work is at colabgroup.com. That&#8217;s where our work is. We&#8217;re actually probably going to start releasing some thought leadership pieces, just some things we talk about internally that we want to put out there so you&#8217;ll be able to hear my voice through that. I used to have a website. I used to have a portfolio on a rewl. I took it down because it got kind of old. I was like, man, I don&#8217;t like this work anymore. So I don&#8217;t really have a personal site.</p>
<p>But, yeah, I would say colabgroup[.com]. And the work that&#8217;s there, the things that you see on that site, is probably the best representation of me on the Internet right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, sounds good. Well, Salih Abdul-Karim, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I mean, the work that you&#8217;ve done with creating Lottie, like I said, it&#8217;s had such a huge reach, just in terms of how many people use it. I think there are people that are sort of the benefactors of your work that have no idea that you were sort of the person behind it. But I really love what you had to say about the big takeaway, because I asked you this before we recorded, is like, what do you want the takeaway to be? And it&#8217;s like, you don&#8217;t have to know what you&#8217;re doing. And I think the cosmic happenstance of this episode happening at the end of this year, potentially the end of this podcast, is such a profound way to sort of close things out, because the main thing that I&#8217;ve always wanted to accomplish through Revision Path is that there&#8217;s more than one way to get to be a creative. There&#8217;s more than one way to do this, and you may not know what that is. And so maybe the stories of all these people can give you some insight as to what that thing might know.</p>
<p>So I really like that. That has been sort of a guiding force throughout your career and throughout your life, and I&#8217;ll be excited to see you bring those two halves of your career together in the future. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>No, thank you, Maurice. And thank you for doing all these episodes and putting this together. I think you&#8217;re doing something really special.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And we&#8217;re releasing this episode on Christmas, so it&#8217;s my gift to everybody. That was kind of corny, but, okay.</p>
<p><b>Salih Abdul-Karim:</b></p>
<p>Pour a little rum in it for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Hey, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in the know about the DC design scene, then this week&#8217;s guest probably needs no introduction. Reece Qui√±ones is a force for good when it comes to design, whether it&#8217;s in her role at The Hatcher Group as executive VP and creative director, or by teaching the next generation of designers as an adjunct professor at George Mason University. And she doesn&#8217;t stop there!</p>
<p>Reece talked to me about an average day for her at The Hatcher Group, and talked about growing up in DC and being exposed to architecture and art at a young age. She also spoke on her work experiences before The Hatcher Group, and gave some great perspective about being a long-time design educator, including what she feels design students want from the design industry these days. As a designer, you can never stop learning, and Reece Qui√±ones is a prime example of how you can use your skills to give back to your community!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Hello. My name is Reece Qui√±ones, and I&#8217;m the Executive Vice President and Senior Creative Director for Hatcher, a PR marketing and design firm in the DC area. I&#8217;m also an Adjunct Professor of Design at George Mason University located in Fairfax, Virginia.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2022 been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been great. Very, very busy. We ended 2021 with a bang, and I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s almost the end of January already. It just seems like it&#8217;s flying by, but it&#8217;s been very good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. You and I talked about this before recording, but it seems like the year started and there was no kind of ramping up into anything. Everyone just kind of got to work, which usually I don&#8217;t mind that, but it has been a very busy month so far.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Yes, it has. It has been busy, and I think we&#8217;ve been two years into the pandemic, so there&#8217;s a lot of fatigue out there too. So with everything, with the work continuing to ramp up, with everyone feeling really comfortable with this telework, it just seems there&#8217;s a lot of pressure. There&#8217;s a lot of pressure to still perform as companies are starting to think about how they&#8217;re going to return back to the office. I think a lot of people are really trying to say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m good here.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, we&#8217;re at this, I think really interesting shift in, I want to say it&#8217;s uniquely American, but it&#8217;s really something that&#8217;s happening worldwide. But I mean, we&#8217;re in America, you and I. So I think it affects Americans differently because we have such a symbiotic relationship with work. So the fact that there are going to see these large structures around capitalism and work that have been upended because of the pandemic, companies are trying to see if hybrid is a good deal, if they should still stay remote. They&#8217;re selling office spaces, they&#8217;re buy more office spaces. Companies are really trying to figure out what&#8217;s next, and I think it&#8217;s difficult for them. But then also with workers, we&#8217;re realizing in general that the work is always going to be there, that we have more power as workers than we thought, and so we can advocate for greater, better work experiences. So this is a really transformative time overall.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I think so too. I think Hatcher has done a really great job. They just went flexible first. Meaning if you want to work from home, you can. If you want to work in the office, you can. And if you want to do both, you can. And just really looking at that, I think has been really something that has kept people in the office and just really just love the culture that we&#8217;ve created there. So I&#8217;m just happy that we were able to move forward with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right now, are you able to go back into the office or you&#8217;re still kind of doing things remotely?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
We can if we want to, but most people are remote, and it&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does a average day look like?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
It&#8217;s busy. One of the things that we really worked on during the pandemic when we just immediately switched over to working from home just one day to the next&#8230; I was telling you a little bit earlier, I was the only holdout. I thought for some reason that it would only last a week and then I realized like, &#8220;Oh, wait, I don&#8217;t think this is going to last a week.&#8221; I went back to the office to get my chair, to get my desktop computer and all the things that I needed. But one of the things that we really worked on is communication. So work at Hatcher is really just this wonderful realm. My team in the morning, we always jump on chat. We say, good morning like you would if you just came in the office. This morning, one of my designers saved a dog that was kind of limping in the street and we were hearing about it. The play by play, but that&#8217;s the wonderful thing about it. So we have kept a wonderful relationship. That&#8217;s always really good.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
It&#8217;s really busy. The way I form my team is really in a way that everybody can grow in the way they want to grow. So as a part of their goals, they say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m more interested in DesignOps. Can I move in that role?&#8221; Or, &#8220;I&#8217;m really interested in becoming an art director? Can I move in that role?&#8221; So I try to ensure that all of my designers have the ability to learn from each other and to learn different types of design. So if I have somebody that&#8217;s mostly print that wants to learn UX, they can do that.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Yeah, just a really busy day. We have a great team of production that just keeps the trains moving. I have three art directors that help to ensure that the work looks great. In my senior creative role, I can normally formulate the strategy and just look at high-level creative. But it&#8217;s a busy day full of meetings, but it&#8217;s also one that&#8217;s really exciting and we&#8217;re able to really do some amazing things with amazing clients.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s really great that people are able to be flexible on the team like that. If there&#8217;s other things that they want to get into, they can do that, particularly I think within an agency kind of framework. I&#8217;ve worked largely with startups over the past five years and with those, it can be easy to just bounce from thing to thing because they maybe haven&#8217;t built out a robust network of people that work there yet. It&#8217;s mostly engineers, they may not have that much on creative. So if you want to jump into doing something else, you can just say, &#8220;I want to do something else,&#8221; and you can do it. With firms, it seems like it&#8217;s a bit more regimented because you&#8217;ve got creative directors and art directors and production designers, et cetera. But it sounds like it&#8217;s pretty flexible at Hatcher.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
It is. It&#8217;s really important to me because I realized as I was coming up, the integration of design was really important. I know you remember a day that when there was a job description, they wanted everything like, &#8220;Oh, are you a website designer? Can you do print? Can you do this? Can you do that?&#8221; And we&#8217;re all looking at each other like, &#8220;Come on, really? What do you want?&#8221; So I did. I learned all those things. So over the years, I did UX, I did product design, I&#8217;ve done marketing communications design, advertising, environmental design, digital. So you&#8217;ve done all of it, and I realized that it really encapsulates the importance of design. That the foundational thing that you need to always know about design is basically that good design can transcend whatever medium.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So you need to understand how to design well, how to communicate that, how to understand your user, no matter if it&#8217;s a brochure or you&#8217;re working on a product. It&#8217;s still the same. You still have a user that&#8217;s going to use it that you need to consider. So that&#8217;s how I formulate my team and really pushing them to learn, &#8220;Hey, you want to do motion? Okay, let&#8217;s do motion. Let&#8217;s grab you, and let&#8217;s have you work on this project.&#8221; It just really grows the team so quickly and allows us to have more people that can do a certain type of task.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So given that, how do you approach a new project if seems like designers can be that flexible to bounce between disciplines like that?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
My production team have learned&#8230; Again, we still have kid designers that might be really good at motion, or really good at long-form reports or annual reports, et cetera. Then we also know what designers want. I might have a designer who have asked, &#8220;Hey, I really want to work on an infographic,&#8221; and so we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Great.&#8221; Depending on the project, depending on the level that&#8217;s needed for that project, sometimes I do need a senior designer to work on a project. Sometimes I need an art director to work on the project. Sometimes it&#8217;s a team. We gather together, we look at all the projects and we assign them based on who can best deliver that project. Then if we have somebody that wants to learn, then they are also put on the team as well. And then from there, we schedule out and have a meeting, a launch, and the work gets done, and it&#8217;s always at a high quality. That&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve been known for, for my students as well, as well as my staff, that quality is important.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look at your work, what would you say is the hardest part about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I love design so much. It&#8217;s really a hobby as well when I&#8217;m in my off hours. So as I&#8217;m looking over what the hardest part is, is just making sure that&#8230; I think it&#8217;s more on the client side. So it&#8217;s just making sure that they understand our process and they understand the whys in the decision making that we have. The world is so much more design savvy because of media, because of video, social media. They&#8217;re seeing good design on an every basis. Several times a day, they&#8217;re just seeing good design come to them.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So a lot of clients will come with preconceived notions on what they think will be appropriate for their project, and sometimes it&#8217;s not. Understanding the user, understanding the metrics, understanding the goals and the KPIs they have on the project. So sometimes I have to sit and kind of explain why we came up with a certain direction for them to understand why it works. I will say, even though that is the difficult part, it 99.999% of the time works because when you use design, when you use the foundations of design, the theories of design, and you explain it back to the client, then they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, I get it. Great.&#8221; Because that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re hiring a firm for. So I think it&#8217;s the hardest part, but it&#8217;s also really rewarding as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s so interesting now, because clients, like you said, they&#8217;re exposed to more or we&#8217;re just all exposed to more through television or streaming or whatever. They&#8217;ll come with these very elaborate ideas and oftentimes it&#8217;s like a therapy session in a way where you&#8217;re trying to get to what the actual thing is that they&#8217;re trying to do so they don&#8217;t get so caught up in the visuals or the presentation. Or just letting them know that maybe the visuals and the presentation you&#8217;re looking for, maybe you can&#8217;t get that on your budget, but if there&#8217;s a certain feeling you&#8217;re trying to evoke, then maybe we can get there by doing these other things. And so it is very much this kind of push-pull process with clients sometimes.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Yeah. Always. Always. But you know what? It&#8217;s a rewarding thing. Our firm really is mission forward. We focus on education and opportunity and environment. So for us and just so much more, education is one of our large areas as well. With every single client, even though there&#8217;s that push-pull, there&#8217;s always this satisfaction because everything we&#8217;re doing is really to help them with their mission. At the end of the day, no matter how hard it is, you go home happy or rather you shut off your computer happy since we&#8217;re at home now. But yeah, it&#8217;s just a wonderful place to work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit. I know you&#8217;re a native of the DC metro area. I&#8217;d love to kind of learn more about what it was like growing up there for you.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. Actually I was born in Puerto Rico. My family&#8217;s from there. Have no accent because we came when I was two, and we moved to Silver Spring and throughout the years I&#8217;ve moved to several areas in Silver Spring. But I&#8217;m still here, and I love it.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
The DC area is really a melting pot. I think out of the top 10, there are two cities, maybe three cities that are the most diverse in the country within the DC area. So it was really different. When you grow up in the &#8217;70s, you&#8217;re in school and you have 63 countries represented in your school. That was the school I went to. 63 countries. We had 63 flags in our school. Yes, it was very different. It was very different. The older I got and the more I traveled, the more I realized that the DC area is so special. It is so special. I haven&#8217;t found a place that feels like it where you can have friends that look completely different from you, speak a different language, and nobody looks at you twice. No one. Like no one. They just don&#8217;t look at you twice, because that&#8217;s normal.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Of course being in the DC area, there&#8217;s also almost like a different economy as well too, because you have the government here. And this is one thing that I think people who grow up in the DC area need to realize as designers and just people, that when hardships happen around the country, they&#8217;re not quite as hard here because you have the government here and the government can&#8217;t shut down. So when 2008 happened, just traveling around the country, you could see so many areas with malls closed and strip malls closed and in the DC area, there were still open. The malls aren&#8217;t doing it quite as well now, but&#8230; So it&#8217;s always important for designers and creatives to just always learn and always see outside themselves. Just don&#8217;t live in a bubble, but always look outside of your area. See how other people are living and experiencing the same things you are because it&#8217;ll just make you a better strategic designer in terms of how you can deliver to the audiences you need to reach.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So growing up around all this diversity and this extremely multicultural school. I mean, 63 countries in one school, growing up is a lot. Were the arts and design kind of a big part of your childhood? Were you exposed to that a lot?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I was exposed to art in terms of drawing, and that was really nice. Our school had a really wonderful art program as well as high school. I was introduced to photography. I would make posters and I would draw, but I actually never heard the term graphic designer at all. I went to college first for architecture, and I got into one school, but decided that architecture wasn&#8217;t quite for me. So I graduated Maryland with an art degree because at that time, I found out later their design program was closed. But I had an art degree out of Maryland, and I still didn&#8217;t know the term graphic designer. So I decided to go back to school. I went to Montgomery College just to get a two-year degree in multimedia and design. So that&#8217;s the first time I heard design with multimedia and I was like, &#8220;Okay, this is cool. Let me take it.&#8221; And I just happened to take an elective called Quark.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Yeah. I just happened to take it because I had electives to take and I was like, &#8220;Quark. Hmm. I wonder what this Quark is.&#8221; And that&#8217;s the first time I saw graphic design because it was graphic design, I think like 120, and it was like Quark 101.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I took Quark and I was in the class and I remember just having such a good time. I mean, I was going for it. I was making newsletters. I mean, it was fun. Our screens were only like 15 inches and that was like state-of-the-art back then, because computers had just come in the scene just about three or four years earlier. They kind of became mainstream. And so I was in class and the professor, I will never forget him. Professor [inaudible 00:20:48], he looked at my work one day and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;You&#8217;re really good at this.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Good at what?&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Ah, good at this.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;What is this? I&#8217;m just making a newsletter.&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh dear God.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Can somebody tell this child what class she&#8217;s in?&#8221; And somebody&#8217;s like, &#8220;Graphic design.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Graphic design?&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yes, you can do this for a living.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Wait, what?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And at that moment I knew everything was going to be okay. I had found my passion. I really knew that it was going to be okay. I took every single graphic design class I could from him especially, and I graduated and I got my first job as a graphic designer with the Gazette newspapers, which was owned by The Washington Post at that time. And that&#8217;s how I got my start.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious about Quark. I want to go back to that because that&#8217;s a very&#8230; You said that and my mind immediately went to like&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if this is probably the right timeframe. I&#8217;m guessing this is like mid &#8217;90s probably?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
You are exactly right. You&#8217;re exactly right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
It was &#8217;94.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d have to research. I don&#8217;t even know if Quark is still like a thing now, but I remember first getting into Quark. I was in&#8230; Let&#8217;s see, &#8217;94 I&#8217;d probably just got into high school. So yeah. I remember using Quark and Adobe PageMaker because I designed my high school&#8217;s newspaper or redesign my high school&#8217;s newspaper. Because before that we were using or they were using&#8230; And this is because I grew up in the sticks, but also I think just because publishing hadn&#8217;t reached digital fully yet everywhere, but we were still doing mimeographs.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh wow, yeah. Yep. No, no. You laugh, but my first job, we were waxing down the pages of the newspaper on flats. So it really was the turn of graphic design becoming more digital to it being more mechanical. So using Exacto knives when we needed to change a word.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
But it was such good experience. So I love it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s so interesting because you&#8217;re&#8230; I mean, you&#8217;re learning the tool and you&#8217;re learning how to do this. There&#8217;s no real examples that you can look at. When I think about what designers can do now and how much is out there in terms of education, they can go on YouTube. They could do LinkedIn Learning or they could do Skillshare or whatever. Like there&#8217;s so much out there. We were really winging it back then like just-</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh my God.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; trying to figure it out.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
We were. We were winging it and that&#8217;s why I love that class Quark, because the professor had a saying, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Welcome to my class. Number one, do you know the Mac, or have you ever used a Mac?&#8221; And I wasn&#8217;t sure how to answer that question. Some people raised their hand and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, more importantly, have you never used the Mac?&#8221; And I was about to raise my hand and the person next to me took my hand and said, &#8220;Do not raise your hand or he will kick you up.&#8221; And he kicked out two people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Ooh. Wow.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So I would&#8217;ve never known, I should have been a graphic designer. But the one thing he said is, I&#8217;m going to teach you everything about this application, every dropdown, popup menu. And it&#8217;s up to you to create something that visually communicates an idea.&#8221; And he did. He taught us every single part of that. It was almost like a YouTube in the class. I think the way he taught really did inspire me to teach as well, but you&#8217;re right, we had nothing. We had absolutely zero. We were just going into it like, &#8220;Okay, here&#8217;s a blank page. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). And really trying to figure it out and just see how these tools work. You could read the instruction manual, but the instruction manuals were like these big thick Bibles. It was hard to get your creativity around it when the instruction manuals were just&#8230; Well, I guess that&#8217;s the other thing. There were instruction manuals. There were like printed books that you had to go through and try to figure this stuff out. So it was&#8230; Wow, what a time.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
They were called Bibles.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What a time.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Like what Bible?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Uh-huh (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
The illustrator Bible, I remember, I remember. I know back in the day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about your early career after you graduated. Did you stay around in the DC metro area?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I did. I stayed around in the DC metro area and I worked for the Gazette newspapers. And I just remember just saying, &#8220;Hey, oh, I wish I could do more in design.&#8221; I just think that people are just put around you and you need to listen to their advice. And there was a coworker named Marie. She was awesome. And she was like, &#8220;Reece, you&#8217;re really talented. I don&#8217;t think you should be stuck here.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; this and the other. And she&#8217;s like, &#8220;You know what, I don&#8217;t want to hear you complaining unless you&#8217;re applying.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;What?&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, don&#8217;t complain to me about that you want more, unless you&#8217;re applying for another job.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;There&#8217;s no way I can get a job. I&#8217;m just one year out of school.&#8221; And she&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want to hear it.&#8221; And she was serious. She wouldn&#8217;t let me here until I started applying. I applied and I got my first firm job at HR communications in the DC area. And when I told her, she&#8217;s like, &#8220;There you go.&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad it worked.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;What?&#8221; And that&#8217;s just how she was.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And so I never complained about a job ever again, unless I was doing something about right. That was really good advice. And from HR communications, I went to an in-house marketing firm, which was great, because it was marketing communications and I really learned a lot about marketing. Went to focus groups, helped conduct them. And that was just wonderful experience to learn how your work is really resonating with your audiences. And I think for first time, and this was still the &#8217;90s, I realized that it&#8217;s not what I wanted. It&#8217;s what the customer needed that I needed to deliver. Design early on, was about your skill and how you could deliver it. But when I worked in that marketing group, I really learned that I need to listen to that audience and that was really eyeopening for me and just a wonderful experience there.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And then from there I went to another firm, and that firm was, I think the change in the quality of my work. This firm was called [inaudible 00:27:03]. And again, they were another marketing communications firm, but their designers hailed from around the world. They had a designer from Spain, a designer from Korea, and one from the Philippines and all over. And what was amazing was this being the &#8217;90s, I thought I knew all the programs. They&#8217;re the ones that taught me that, &#8220;Hey, oh my goodness, your program can actually merge with other programs.&#8221; And that&#8217;s when I learned that you could actually merge your files, and get this, from Illustrator into Photoshop. You could merge your layer files into&#8230; And that was way back in the day. It just changed the way I could design because now I could make montages that you could only see in magazines where you&#8217;re just like, &#8220;How&#8217;d they do that.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how they do that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And so they taught me all these really deep tricks and tips about the actual programs that I think really changed the quality of my design. And again, just really an amazing group of very talented designers. I remember when I got that job, I interviewed for it three times. And the first time I went, the owner was like, &#8220;You&#8217;re good, but you&#8217;re just not what we need. It&#8217;s not quite what we need.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Can you tell me about my work? What is it that you like, what is it that you don&#8217;t like? I don&#8217;t have an ego. Let me know how I can improve.&#8221; He told me, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;I like this, but our quality has more depth. It has more layering.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Okay, that sounds great.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So I went back and I kept designing, adding more things into my portfolio. About three months later they called me in. And at that time I told them, &#8220;Well, I have a new job. I&#8217;m not going to come in.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Just come in. Let&#8217;s just have a chat.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll just have a chat.&#8221; So I went and showed them a couple more pieces and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh wow, you listened.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Well, of course.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I love your work.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Of course I listened.&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hmm. All right. Hmm.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So he had me come back to talk to the art director and I realized at that time they were trying to have me leave the job that I had just started. And I wrote a list why I should stay at the job where I was or why I should go. And I realized that even if I stayed in this new firm for six months, the level of work that would come out of it would be so much more than I could ever get at the firm that I had gone to. So I decided to go. The only job that I have ever been in less than a year, but it was life changing. It was honestly life changing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now after that, is that when you ended up joining ASCD?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
That is correct. That is correct. That firm hit the dotcom era. The early 2000s where all the dotcoms kind of lost their funding. And that was 90% of our work. So the firm shut its doors and I was left without a job. And I was like, &#8220;All right.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Okay, what are we going to do here?&#8221; And I told myself, &#8220;Because now you have eight designers looking for work that each have the level of quality you have&#8230;&#8221; So I started looking for work and there were jobs that had a little bit more technical motion, people were getting into flashback then. And so I would just refer other designers and they would be like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, thank you so much,&#8221; because the job wasn&#8217;t right for me.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
But I also told myself, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to look for any job. It doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221; And I applied to a role for an in-house designer with an in-house agency. They called themselves an in-house agency. And that was kind of in the early 2000s. And that was rare to have a team of designers that would call themselves an in-house agency. So I went, I tried and I looked.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And the work, I was like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, what are you guys doing here?&#8221; I realized that they were a midsize publisher for educational book and products. And I was like, &#8220;This is amazing work. I&#8217;ve never done a book before.&#8221; So I showed my portfolio and I got the job. It was such an incredible experience, designing books and just growing within that environment, that I stayed. I also had a wonderful manager. And it&#8217;s true, you stay at a job where you have a great leader. And so he saw leadership potential within myself and would give me opportunities to lead projects. And then I started leading web projects, and then I started to lead applications. So product manage. It&#8217;s a wonderful experience where I was able to do everything from&#8230; Could design applications, as well as apps towards the end of the 15 years. Could design websites, online store, hundreds of books, just everything, run the gamut, including their large annual conference. So I would do the branding around the entire annual conference. And then through the years, I got promoted four times.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So it was just a wonderful opportunity to grow. And I was on vacation when that was a thing, when you left the&#8230; I got a call from a recruiter at LinkedIn for a position and I remember it just wasn&#8217;t right. I was happy where I was. And I said thank you and the recruiter said, &#8220;Well, just take a look at our job description online.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Sure, sure. I&#8217;ll go ahead and do that.&#8221; And so I clicked the link and here I am in France and I&#8217;m scrolling down, I&#8217;m scrolling down. I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I don&#8217;t think this is right.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And then there was in LinkedIn, at least back then, there was a title: Other jobs like these. And I was like, &#8220;Okay, so another job like this.&#8221; So I started looking at those jobs and there was one job there and it was The Hatcher Group. And I was like, &#8220;Huh, let me just read it.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re looking for a senior VP of design. Hmm. All right. Let&#8217;s take a look at what this looks like.&#8221; And it looked good. It was everything I was doing now. And I was like, &#8220;This is good,&#8221; but they really wanted to grow what they had as a design team. So they only had one designer and an intern and they were mostly a communications firm, QPR firm at that time, and they really wanted to grow it into more.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And so I&#8217;m reading the description and there&#8217;s one line and that line stuck out to me. And that line was, &#8220;Above all, we&#8217;re looking for someone who is kind.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Whoa.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I was like, &#8220;Whoa.&#8221; Yes, &#8220;Wow. Who looks for somebody who is kind? This is awesome.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Especially at an agency.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Especially at an agency. I was like, &#8220;Well, if I&#8217;m going to go somewhere, let me go to a place where they want somebody who&#8217;s kind. I think I&#8217;m kind, but I know they&#8217;re kind because they&#8217;re looking for someone who is like them.&#8221; So I knew that just from the job description. And so I applied and I got the job. And so that was four years ago and we&#8217;ve grown from one designer and one intern to a team of 16. So we&#8217;re doing some great things and I have an amazing team.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I focus on hiring diverse designers. I think it&#8217;s important. I think a lot of firms run into trouble when they don&#8217;t hire diverse designers because we can check with each other and say, &#8220;Hey, does this work for this audience?&#8221; Because you don&#8217;t have that lived experience. And that is very critical for me, but what it does too, is it teaches the other designers how to have a critical, but worldwide view of work that we&#8217;re doing, especially because we&#8217;re working with very sensitive topics as well in terms of education and the environment and equity within those spaces. It&#8217;s just really important to understand how the images that you use, the icons that you use, even the way it&#8217;s placed, how that reads to your intended audience and if it portrays them fairly. That&#8217;s actually something that we focus on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to go back briefly to ASCD. I mean, that was such a large part of your career. You were there for 15 years.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at that time, is there anything that really stands out to you that you remember the most?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh, absolutely. We had a wonderful team. It&#8217;s where I learned how to manage. It&#8217;s where my boss gave me the opportunity to take his job as he was promoted into a larger role. And it&#8217;s also where I learned to ensure that your designers can grow in the way that they want to grow. Instead of keeping people siloed into one area, I learned that it works well. It works so well for that team. We were so productive and people grew exactly where they wanted to and they became designers first, and then they learned the mediums second. So that&#8217;s where I learned that.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Quality was actually something that was so key to that team and to my boss. And I learned that quality is actually something that happens when the whole team works together as a unit, when everybody helps each other. And so I also hire people that don&#8217;t have egos, because we really do critique each other and help each other grow and ensure that everything that comes out of our shop has the quality that the customer expects, the client expects. But most important, I learned how to manage. I learned that if you treat your people like you&#8217;re equal, like people, you&#8217;re not their parent and you shouldn&#8217;t be, but you treat them like you&#8217;re equal. And if you&#8217;re having a problem with someone, just have a conversation and say, &#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s going on? Is everything okay? How can I help you? You tell me how I can help you.&#8221; Then you have a team that will come to you first. If anything goes wrong, my team just comes to me and say, &#8220;Hey, here&#8217;s what went down.&#8221; And then I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay. So how did you fix it?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So we work through the solutions and we grow people. And I think that that is such a wonderful quality that I loved during the 15 years. I loved being able to go to my boss and say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s how I screwed up. Here&#8217;s how I think we should fix it. Do you agree?&#8221; And nine times out of 10 he did, &#8220;Oh yeah, that&#8217;s a great call. And you know what? It&#8217;s okay. We all screwed up sometimes.&#8221; And so I managed the same way and I think it&#8217;s really important that folks feel free to grow and to make those mistakes because that&#8217;s how you get exceptional designers. And I have exceptional designers. So I&#8217;m a very lucky person.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, definitely sounds like to be able to have that level of openness among the team like that, that really takes really, I think depthful but also very skillful kind of just management. And with being at ASCD as long as you have, being able to really learn that in that environment has definitely helped out with what you&#8217;re doing at Hatcher.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Absolutely. Absolutely. 100%.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you also are a design educator. We&#8217;ve had several design educators here on Revision Path. You&#8217;re an adjunct professor at George Mason University where you&#8217;ve been since 2008. Tell me about your time teaching there. I&#8217;m curious, what are you teaching now?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Actually now, I start next week. I am teaching UX design as well as design principles and theory. So methods and principles, which is really the theory of design. It&#8217;s their first studio class where they learn how to design. And it&#8217;s one of my favorite classes. I&#8217;ve taught it since 2008 and I love it. I love it. I love it so much. And I love the outcome of not only the program and the students. About a fourth of my staff are my former students.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh really?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh absolutely. Oh absolutely. I snag them when I can. Absolutely. I kind of fell into teaching&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
One of the wonderful parts of working with the in-house firms is that they have lots of benefits. ASCD had tuition reimbursement, so I was like, &#8220;Hey, why don&#8217;t I get my M.F.A. in design?&#8221; And I found a program that had most of their classes at night in the University of Baltimore. I applied and got in, and I went through that there. I learned and worked with the head of the design program at George Mason, and one day I was just sitting around and he said, &#8220;You know, I think you would be a really good professor.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Oh no, not me. There&#8217;s no way,&#8221; because I grew up with a stutter. Just learning how to speak fluently was just really hard for me. And even now, even though I now have lived a little bit more than half my life without the stutter, I still can hear the struggle. So I just doubted myself so much and he just left it alone.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Years later, he called me and he said, &#8220;Hey, how about that teaching gig that I talked to you about?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Oh, it would be wonderful, but&#8230; I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;I really need you.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you call me tomorrow? Think about it.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
The next day, I called him. I couldn&#8217;t sleep that night. I was so nervous about teaching. I just couldn&#8217;t sleep. And so I said, &#8220;You know what, I know it&#8217;s a good opportunity. It&#8217;s hard to get in, but I just don&#8217;t think I can do it.&#8221; And I left him a message and he didn&#8217;t answer me back. So I kept texting. The day after, he called me and said, &#8220;Hey, I got your message. I&#8217;m sorry I got it late. I already put your name in and I can&#8217;t change it.&#8221; And come to find out, he could have changed it. But I thank him every day. His name is Don Star. I thank him every single day for tricking me into a teaching job because the first night I taught, I realized, &#8220;I love this. This is so amazing.&#8221; And you just get this vibe when you teach.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
My mom was a teacher and she told me, she&#8217;s like, &#8220;When one of your students learns how to read, your whole body gets this shiver. You just get this vibe that, &#8216;Wow. What I&#8217;m doing is making a difference.'&#8221; And she&#8217;s right. I got that same vibe when I had a student who really understood a concept, understood a theory and was able to apply it and created something that looked so beautiful. And I was like, yes. And I got hooked. I got to teaching.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So I just got hooked to teaching. And with that first class, which was the design methods and theories class, I just had a great time. I kept teaching. There&#8217;s other classes I teach as well. I&#8217;ve taught typography, infographic design, motion graphics, and I just have a blast with it all. Like I said, I think that teaching is so important and learning how to teach those foundational skills are the critical part that I think is missing in some programs as well. Because I also interview and hire and look at hundreds of portfolios all the time, and just those little things that you can see throughout is what I teach. The things that people don&#8217;t get, or they don&#8217;t understand how to really put their work together or how to continually improve their work. So I just have a great time with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you say things have changed since you started teaching there? Have you grown as an educator?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I have. I don&#8217;t like grades, though I have to grade folks, but I love projects. And so my projects have gotten more complex. They also have introduced a digital aspect to them because everything now has a digital aspect. Even if you do a report, we&#8217;re asked to do social media or a little motion graphic video that will help to launch that report. So I think I use what I see at work as a part of how to improve the way I teach. So when I see shifts in the industry or in the way clients are asking for work, I also change how I teach to mirror that, to ensure where that my students are ready for hire as soon as they graduate</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
From your perspective, and again, you&#8217;ve been teaching since 2008 and you&#8217;ve mentioned these changes, what do design students, and I guess design graduates also, what do they want from the design industry?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
That&#8217;s actually a good question. I&#8217;ve had a couple students, especially during the pandemic really kind of reached out for co-mentoring because we haven&#8217;t been in person for two years. So they want to be ready. They want to be ready to get a job. They want to ensure that they&#8217;re not looked over. They really want to understand how their work applies in the real world. And that&#8217;s actually something that I do. As a part of every single class, I also take one class period to teach them salaries. What are you worth? What are you worth when you go out? Here&#8217;s the salary range. Here&#8217;s how you can adapt it for the DC area. Or let&#8217;s say you were going to New York, here&#8217;s how you adapt it. Let&#8217;s say you were going to Chicago, or let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re going to Alabama or to Mississippi. Here&#8217;s how you can change and see what you&#8217;re worth and how much you can ask for.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I also go over portfolios. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;These portfolios work and here&#8217;s why.&#8221; I go over resumes. &#8220;These resumes work and here&#8217;s why.&#8221; And I explain to them how to get ready for the real world. Why it&#8217;s important that their work is good. How they can self-edit to ensure that you don&#8217;t have one piece that looks really bad with work that looks really good, because I see that all the time. When I&#8217;m looking at the students&#8217; portfolios, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Why did you add that invitation?&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, because I don&#8217;t have an invitation.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;But do you think it looks good?&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;No, it&#8217;s not my best work.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to judge you on that.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, as a creative director, if I look at this, I&#8217;m going to say somebody helped you with everything else. And the one that looks bad is the one you did on your own.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Mm-hmm (affirmative).&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Take that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So I help them learn how to edit their work because as you&#8217;re coming up, you always have a couple of duds in there where you&#8217;re&#8230; They&#8217;re not horrible, but they&#8217;re just not the level of quality as some of your other work. So learn how to edit because your portfolio is the way that someone&#8217;s going to hire you. I really help them with that. And I think that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re really looking for. They&#8217;re looking for help to ensure that they can get a job, because we all know how it feels when you graduate and then you have to like make it on your own.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
That intense feeling of fear like, &#8220;Oh dear God, I&#8217;ve got to pay for everything myself.&#8221; And back then it was harder because you literally left home. Nowadays you can come back, things are changing a little bit. But back then, they were just like, &#8220;Okay, you&#8217;re gone. Bye college. You&#8217;re gone.&#8221; But kids still feel that. They still feel that fear. So just helping them know that these things can help them. And then I also do mock interviews and I do them in class so that people can see how I answer questions. I tell them, &#8220;Just ask me anything.&#8221; And I&#8217;ve gotten some really tough questions for them to see how I answer that so that they can really have a leg up when they go to their first interview.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And even afterwards I will help students. I give them my email address. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hey, you want a mock interview? Let&#8217;s do it. You want me to look at your portfolio? Let&#8217;s do it.&#8221; Just the other day, I had a student who was so nervous about an interview that they had, catchy with Deloitte, and they were just so nervous. And so they just wanted me to go over again&#8230; They just wanted to practice and they wanted to go over it one on one. So I took some time to help that student and they reached out and said that they got the job and I was so excited because there&#8217;s another level that&#8217;s hard here to the pandemic. Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So they just have that nervousness going out. I take the time for that too, because I think it&#8217;s important and I wish I had that when I was first coming out. And so I make sure that I&#8217;m there for them so that they don&#8217;t have to feel like they&#8217;re going out alone.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I think what you&#8217;re doing with reviewing their portfolio and resumes and talking about salaries and doing mock interviews, that stuff is so, so, so important for designers just to get out there and know what it is that they have to do to try to compete in the marketplace, but also to position themselves in the best possible light.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve done some work in the past with the art institutes, particularly the Art Institute of Atlanta here in Atlanta. They sort of do this thing every year where they bring in people from the local design community and they have a dinner at the school. And what they&#8217;re doing with that is one, just trying to meet practitioners out in the city, but also to get a sense of like, &#8220;What do we need to be teaching students? What out there are you seeing in the market that we need to inform them of?&#8221; Whether that&#8217;s about upcoming technologies or certain-</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I love it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; design trends or things like that, to try to stay current and keep up on top of things. It&#8217;s funny, you&#8217;re talking about your adjunct experience and I&#8217;m thinking about, I taught adjunct&#8230; Oh, this was 2012 I think. Like 2011, 2012, I was teaching like a principles of web design course-</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh, love it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; as an adjunct. And what I tell you, it was so dated&#8230; Well, first of all, it was a BIS course. It was a business information systems kind of major. So it already wasn&#8217;t like technically really designed. You were just teaching business students enough design to sort of get by, I guess. But the curriculum was so old.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like when I started, they had students learning how to design web pages using tables. And I&#8217;m like, this is 2011, 2012, sometime around that.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I learned tables in the &#8217;90s.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Me too. I learned tables in the &#8217;90s too. And I&#8217;m like you have to teach because this was in that period where CSS layout design of course was the norm at that point. I remember working at AT&#038;T in 2007-ish and we made the switch from tables to CSS. I mean, you want to talk about seeing grown people cry at work?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I know. I remember that switch. It was emotional for many.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In this teaching thing, I remember going to the Dean and like petitioning to rewrite the curriculum because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You&#8217;re setting these students up to fail-&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8220;&#8230; if you&#8217;re teaching them how to design in tables and then they go out there in the world trying to get some design jobs to say they have some HTML experience and it&#8217;s this dated. We&#8217;re not setting them up in the best light.&#8221; Eventually they did let me rewrite the curriculum. So I did teach them basic CSS and stuff, but I&#8217;m thinking like, &#8220;What if I didn&#8217;t?&#8221; Or what if another educator was just like, &#8220;Oh, this is what I&#8217;m teaching? Okay.&#8221; And just went with it. So the fact that you&#8217;re extending that out, you&#8217;re doing way more than usual. I mean, I certainly commend you for that.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh thank you. But now, what I was going to say is that that&#8217;s really important and that&#8217;s one of the things that I love about George Mason. Is that with the curriculum that I&#8217;m able to continually update it. So every single semester I update everything to ensure&#8230; Including my samples, because I want to make sure that the students have the latest and the greatest of how you can incorporate design into all this new technology. And it&#8217;s just really important to be able to do that because it&#8217;s true. Just like you said, if you don&#8217;t do that, you are setting them up to fail from the beginning and school&#8217;s not cheap, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s make sure they have all the right tools so that they can go out and live their best life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is the design community like for you at this stage in your career?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh, it&#8217;s awesome. The DC area, as well as the Baltimore area, because I&#8217;m still connected through school, they have such a strong design community that they overlap as well at times, but it&#8217;s really strong. I&#8217;m a part of AIGA, I volunteer. I am on The Continuum Fund, which is a scholarship fund for underserved designers, and it&#8217;s just wonderful. It&#8217;s great to grow with designers and also bring up new designers and seeing them grow in leadership roles as well. It&#8217;s actually something that&#8217;s important because no matter how large your city is, the design community is actually small. And that&#8217;s the thing that I think that people need to understand. Like I&#8217;m connected with so many people around the city and know when they&#8217;re looking for someone, I can refer other people. And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to always get connected to the community where you are, because it&#8217;s a great way to help you find jobs or just to grow and design or just to give back, to mentor or to help an upcoming student or designer that joins a group. So I encourage everybody to do that if they can.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you&#8217;re a recent DC design fellow. Congratulations on that.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Thank you so much. I was shocked and honored to be named an AIGA Fellow. It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s given to just a few people and not every year. And for me to be chosen, I was very humbled and just very gracious. It just makes me want to triple my efforts in terms of what I&#8217;m doing and teaching and mentoring, because I realize now that it&#8217;s made a difference. The power of just winning that award is just realizing that you can make a difference. You can help your community just by giving back. It was a really fun experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of your influencers? Who inspires you?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
It&#8217;s actually everyone around me, but including, and I think the most important are my students. I am the creative director I am today, I am the leader I am today because of them. They inspire me to push further. They inspire me and grow&#8230; They just have just great ideas that they use on their projects, that they come forward, that they ask, &#8220;Hey, can I do this?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hmm, I don&#8217;t see why not. Let&#8217;s have a go.&#8221; And so they keep me always growing, learning and searching for new ways to apply design. And they inspire me every day. I think that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m hooked to learning and I&#8217;m hooked to teaching because basically I learn from them. As much as they learn from me, I learn from them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are you the most excited about at the moment?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I think I am the most excited about how technology is informing design, how we can apply design to new things. For example, augmented reality. So AR, VR and how I can apply that within my teaching, as well as within my own firm. I love how the industry and how design has to continually change. I think that that keeps us fresh. It keeps us learning. It keeps us growing. And that&#8217;s important. I mean, I think creativity really requires the pursuit of experiencing learning and observing as much as you can. One of the things I always say is you cannot design what you don&#8217;t know. So you have to continually be curious and open-minded and just always be a student. And just continuing to learn, not only in your field, but what&#8217;s around it, and be ready for it so that you can continue to visually communicate ideas to your clients.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? I mean, with what you&#8217;ve got going on with teaching, as well as your work at The Hatcher Group, it sounds like you&#8217;ve got a very, very bright future in terms of what you want to.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I&#8217;m always living in the present. Right now, I am so excited with the work I&#8217;m doing at The Hatcher Group. I recently got promoted to executive vice president, which actually allows me to do a lot more business development, not only with the firm, but with our clients. So it&#8217;s a wonderful place for me to be. In five years, I can tell you, as long as they&#8217;ll have me, I will still be teaching. That I do know. I love it. It&#8217;s how I actually relax after a long day, is I teach. And the moment I go in and I say, &#8220;Hi class, how are you doing?&#8221; Like all the stress leaves. And we just have a great time and we laugh and just learn together.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
In terms of what I do, I hope that I&#8217;m always going to be tied to design in some way, the next five years for me, just really&#8230; It incorporates me continuing to learn. I&#8217;m always looking at the next program. I know it&#8217;s weird, but I am looking at a doctor&#8217;s program. So I think it&#8217;s important for me to continue just growing and learning within my own field, and right now just doing what I do at Hatcher.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Well, they can go to thehatchergroup.com as well as my own personal website, 09creative.com. And I am also on LinkedIn at linkedin.com/reecequinones</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Reece Qui√±ones, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. I mean, just going through everything that you are doing with The Hatcher Group and with education and your background and everything. I mean, you&#8217;re someone that I think a lot of people in design industry can look up to. It&#8217;s so interesting before we recorded, you were talking about how you don&#8217;t know, or you didn&#8217;t know why you received the DC fellow award. And I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t see how you didn&#8217;t know considering how much you&#8217;ve been, not just a practitioner in design for a very long time, but also how much you&#8217;re giving back to the next generation of design through teaching-</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh, thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; and everything. So I am so glad to have had you on the show and to share your story and I look forward to seeing what comes next. Thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Thank you so much. I had an awesome time.</p>

<p>If your emotions have been up and down for the past few months, trust me&#8230;you&#8217;re not alone. But I&#8217;ve got something to help lift your spirits ‚Äî this week&#8217;s interview with &#8220;human glitter bomb&#8221; Randall Parrish! We talked at an interesting point in his life too; he&#8217;s fresh off of a cross-country move from DC to California and recently started a new job as an art director at Sonos, all during this crazy and unpredictable pandemic.</p>
<p>Randall started off with how he&#8217;s holding up while getting used to the triple whammy of a new job, a new city, and working from home. From there, he spoke on his work with Sonos&#8217; design system, and also talked about his previous agency work at Publicis Sapient and WDG. Randall is also big on giving back to the community, and we talked about his volunteer work with AIGA, as well as his work with some past Revision Path guests ‚Äî <a href="/dian-holton/" data-wpel-link="internal">Dian Holton</a> and <a href="/chanel-james/" data-wpel-link="internal">Chanel James</a>!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Hello there, I&#8217;m Randall Parrish, I&#8217;m an Art Director at Sonos. I work on the interactive experience team, which basically controls the mobile design application for all Sonos speaker systems.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Now for starters, I know you&#8217;re new there, you&#8217;ve been there what, a month, two months now?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve been here about five weeks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, five weeks.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
I took a one way ticket on March 9th, moving 3,000 miles away from everything I&#8217;ve ever known. And I was in the office for about four days before the whole city shut down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Well, first of all, congratulations on the new gig. I know this is probably a very unprecedented time to start a new job. So, how are you holding up?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been really interesting because when I thought about just moving to California, I remember visiting in January and Santa Barbara is just this amazing simulation of just perfection. It&#8217;s this beautiful beach town there&#8217;s flowers everywhere, there&#8217;s wineries and restaurants. And of course the second I get there, all I can do is just unpack really slowly and just take Zoom calls from my couch. So in one sense, it&#8217;s amazing because you still know there&#8217;s all this amazing potential out there. But the other end, you&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Oh, why me? Why now?&#8221; But still very optimistic [inaudible 00:04:04], I&#8217;m still connected with the coworkers, everyone&#8217;s been very friendly and everyone just understands that this is not what anyone imagined for themselves this month or this year at all.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
So [inaudible 00:04:17] just helped me throw myself into the unpacking and the work and just being acquainted and then I guess to make a bit of an itinerary for later. So now I feel a little less guilt about holding still on the weekends.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you were only in the office for four days? Is that even a full work week?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Not even a full week. Technically I was breaking in for another week, but I wasn&#8217;t supposed to because I didn&#8217;t have wifi at the time. Because all services are a little slower than they used to be, so there was a brief week where I had this just gigantic industrial thunder dome to myself where I was the only person in there, just playing with all the hardware really loudly. But the following week, everything was just straight up shut down. It was starting to become a bit of a risk between security, and delivery people, and regular employees. I was there for four real days before I was just completely shut out and just housebound.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you mentioned that you work on the app experience of Sonos. So I know most people know Sonos as the actual physical speakers. You have the little Play:1s, you have the Play:3, which is a larger one, the Play:5 is the huge one. You&#8217;ve got, and I say this because I have them in my apartment, but you have the Playbase, and you have the sub, and you&#8217;ve got the soundbar, there&#8217;s a bunch of different hardware components that go on to it and they&#8217;re all tied together with this mobile app. So talk to me about what your day consists of, because it sounds like you would possibly have to interface with a lot of hardware, but unfortunately you can&#8217;t because you&#8217;re not at the office.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
So let me further numerate and what my title means in relation to the rest of the team. So as of right now, I believe we are about 61 designers or so, we&#8217;re quite a few. I&#8217;ve never worked in a place that was internal, first of all. And I&#8217;ve never quite seen just so many different people with different ownerships of different aspects of the product. So as Art Director, I&#8217;m in this role where my role is supposed to be about owning the design system symphony. So if you know design systems, that&#8217;s a little old hat, but it&#8217;s still like a thing that&#8217;s a bit new and a bit up and coming and still trying to be just regulated within the context of Santos.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
So the idea for my role is to be this very connective tissue between a lot of other teams. So we have a different team that handles setup, or a different team that handles different aspects or sub branches of the app. But people who are also handling some of those sub branches also work on purely hardware or other, maybe non software, angles of the app as well. So my job is to be this person who&#8217;s understanding what are the needs that, one, that the app needs to do, two, how are other teams using the core design system so we have consistency across that, three, I&#8217;m going to also ask, &#8220;What are you all missing? What do you all need me to ingest in the system and also maintain and spit back out? And how can we work together to also have a thing where we can cross between all these 60 designers?&#8221; As well as while we&#8217;re doing that, I&#8217;m also trying to be a connective tissue to marketing. So we&#8217;re asking broad questions, like, &#8220;How can we make the app feel a bit more like the .com? How can we make the .com feel more like the app? How can you basically find consistency inside a brand voice and tonality across these different sorts of channels?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Because this is sa new undertaking for Sonos. Right now we&#8217;re in this really amazing renaissance where we&#8217;ve just been on a great upward hiring tilt. And that&#8217;s mostly because I think we&#8217;re, a lot of organizations the last four to five years, I would say, really started to just really amp up just how seriously they&#8217;re taking design. I think design is starting to really get this seat at the table. People are starting to understand the value and the ROI on design. So we&#8217;re seeing all these different companies who you would have thought were very design centric, like Sonos, but hung it&#8217;s hat on being this almost like the Apple of speakers. But in terms of software, they were, I think I can easily say that maybe they weren&#8217;t kind of as competitive as they should have been at the time-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh no. The Sonos app used to be trash, it was really bad.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
It was super bad, but the hardware was amazing. So you forgave it, right? You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
That&#8217;s good that you were like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care how bad this app is, it sounds so good.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true, that&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
I remember, it was funny, I remember when I interviewed, I outright said, I said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think the Play:1 was a good bite until AirPlay was added,&#8221; and they gave me a fun stat, turns out significantly less people use AirPlay than you might think. I was very blown away by the metric.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can see that. I can see that.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
[crosstalk 00:08:26] lee than I thought.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right now, I have in the living room, I&#8217;ve got to Play:1s and a Playbase and so I have them just connected as a surround sound thing, which is mostly how I use it for gaming. So I can get the really good sound when I&#8217;m playing PlayStation or whatever, which is great, I love it for that. And maybe this is just me, I rarely actually play music on my Sonos speakers, but I think it&#8217;s because I have them hooked up to the television. Now, before I did that and I connected with the Playbase, I think I had one in the living room, no one in the living room and one in the bedroom, and I would use the app to play music to it. I wish, this was before, well, I think Chromecast was out around this time, but the ability to cast to a speaker or something like that, which Google kind of lets you do, Google Play kind of lets you cast to Sono speakers. I don&#8217;t know how that all works out. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn&#8217;t. But it didn&#8217;t use to be such a great harmonious experience. So that&#8217;s interesting to hear that.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
I was just thinking about just all these fun little things I know about just relations or [inaudible 00:09:36], all these different things. Sonos right now exists in this Switzerland kind of state, so you&#8217;re like the Google doesn&#8217;t work that well, oh boy, we got [inaudible 00:09:44].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Yeah, because a lot of what we do is, a lot of what we pride ourselves on is being this amazing connective tissue between hundreds of services. Now some of those are the large partners like Amazon and Google and Apple, but we also have all those like small-time partners. So it&#8217;s always interesting when [inaudible 00:10:02] moments where a big time partner has maybe an integration or something that isn&#8217;t always working quite the way you would expect. And there are all sorts of just wild hijinks and reasons for why something is, or isn&#8217;t a certain way, but it&#8217;s not always up to us.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So, how did you first get started at Sonos?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
So first week or how&#8217;d I get discovered? I guess how I got discovered. So yeah, let me really wind it back a bit. So I want to say it was maybe August of last year I got a ping from a recruiter I had never actually had applied to them. So initially I got a call about a creative director of mobile apps job from them. And I remember when I got the email, they were just like, &#8220;Oh, how do you feel about relocation?&#8221; And I grew up in Northern Virginia, I&#8217;ve lived in the Arlington, DC, Metro area, my entire life. And I remember I was just like, &#8220;Well, you caught me out this very interesting apex moment in my life,&#8221; I was still very fresh off of a breakup.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
It was a very wild, just tumultuous time in my life because I thought I had this plan in my life for what I thought that my following years were going to be and I get this call and I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Huh. You&#8217;re catching it every time in my life. This is suddenly something that suddenly seems on the table.&#8221; If I had gotten this call six months a year ago, I would&#8217;ve been like, &#8220;Oh, sorry, I can&#8217;t do it.&#8221; I would have let go straight to voicemail. But the timing was just impeccable for just making me really take it seriously. The other fun part was when I got in the call, I already had four Pla:1s in the house, so I didn&#8217;t necessarily need coaxing that the hardware was any good or was like actually worth selling or being engaged in.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
And the other part was I was also asking myself, &#8220;Okay, what do I really want to work on?&#8221; I come from an agency background, I&#8217;ve done that for about the last eight years straight. And an agency is, half of the fun was you get to reset your mind pretty often, you get to try a lot of different things, you get to reset pretty frequently. But I asked myself &#8220;If I,&#8221; you don&#8217;t always get to choose the topic and you&#8217;re not guaranteed to love whatever project you&#8217;re on next and, &#8220;What if I could actually choose the thing that I could actually fall in love with? And what if I could do this and this new shiny place just do, not quite a reset, but just like a natural continuation in this very, just amazing, brave, intricate way?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
So yeah. So I got that call in August and just a little upward from there. I can tell you stuff like interview highlights and things like that, but yeah, that&#8217;s how the initial seed.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The fact that they sought you out is amazing, that&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Clearly you were doing something worth, that was worthy of them seeking you out in that way.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative), I do pride myself because back when I left DC, I was in the top 21 designers there, on the trending metrics I think I had more followers than the Capital One design team. I love you Capital One, I have your cards. So it was just funny because I think it was&#8230; Dribble is such a funny, interesting way to generate traffic and just be seen in a city that&#8217;s as, I don&#8217;t want to say small, but the size that DC is, out in LA, I feel like I would have never gotten half the opportunities because I think that the density is so much higher. But in DC, I think that&#8217;s just the right market for just a midsize targeting person, like me, to get picked up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). So you mentioned Symphony, the design system at Sonos. Outside of that, are there other projects that you&#8217;re working on or is that the main thing?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Right now that&#8217;s the main thing, mostly because there&#8217;s still some other things that I might target. There&#8217;s a few things have been shifted around, priorities are still being readjusted all the time, but owning Symphony is expected to be a very large, major undertaking, mostly because it touches so many aspects of what other teams are doing. So for example, it&#8217;s like we have a team that operates on set or we have other teams that own other areas of the app, anytime that they have a new feature that they want to do, it has to still be ingested somewhere, still has to work within the system, and we still have to make sure that we aren&#8217;t creating so much bloat within the system that we just have a million just different unique one off pieces everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
So a lot of that is just about, little bit&#8217;s about managing, but it&#8217;s also about trying to meet in the middle a little bit. So I see it as this great opportunity to a little bit of a negotiator between people, and another reason why I think I was chosen for the job or why I kind of stuck out was they really like how I don&#8217;t ome looking at design system from a pure product design background. A lot of my background is usually about like when I went, when I was at Sapient, what I did was I worked on we&#8217;ll call the digital innovation pod. So basically what we do would do is we were often doing either pitch work or much more pie in the sky type, idea generation for these big billion dollar brands.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
And what that gave me the ability to do in addition with my time at Davey DG was getting really good at just trying to figure out where do I let go of the break, where to really push something in a kind of visual design type way, well also still being held to like the same rules as something that was still had gone through rigorous UX. So I would still be working on teams to make sure that, &#8220;Oh, a financial analyst&#8230; [inaudible 00:15:00] agree that this is all sensible. This makes sense. And also like my associate creative director on UX also agreed, okay, this makes sense. This is like a good use case or a good scenario that we would present it if we were trying to ship. But also while doing this instead of a tight bubble about just making it as unique and different as possible as well to be unlike the rest of the other big billion dollar players in the market. So a lot of what I&#8217;ve been trying to do is I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to basically take marketing design type sensibilities and add them to a very product focused company and kind of meet in the middle to figure out where we can kind find that happy center ground between the two.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative), and before Sonos, you were an art director at Publicis Sapient. So you already had this experience of working with these big million, dollar multimillion dollar brands. But talk to me about what your agency experience was like.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative), I initially got started at this, a very small shop in old town Alexandria now Arlington WTG. So I was there for five years. It was my first real adult job out of college while I interned at it became designer, but it was like they just couldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Out of college while I interned and became a designer it was like I&#8230; They just couldn&#8217;t shake me off. And I feel like I got there at this very fortuitous time. When I got there, it was just like they were very young, very kind of startup-y. There was less than 20 people. It was like a wear your pajamas to work type place. And I think I got in there at a time where they were still very young and still finding themselves. And year over year, we all found ourselves in this more mature way, year over year. So we were just doing very, very small scale marketing sites. And every single year we had a great way of just having new challenges approach.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
So, bigger fish would call. So people like Red Cross were calling or people like the Folger Shakespeare Library were calling or people like the American Enterprise Institute. Just bigger, just names that you might actually see or catch on TV, or are just very notable in the DC area were creeping up. These kind of like AAA for the region type projects came in. And as I started to go from just being in a sort of assistive role to being someone who could kind of take ownership and really run something from conception to deployment.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
That&#8217;s what I think was the best part about my time at WDG was, I don&#8217;t think that I could have done anything that I&#8217;m doing today if I hadn&#8217;t done my time there. But I think that&#8217;s because&#8230; I think if you go somewhere small&#8230; I was one of three designers, by the way. That&#8217;s what I mean when I say small, in terms of this sense, it was a very, very small, tight design team. It was just me, my career director, [Dario Tatish 00:17:22] and my counterpart, [Christina Lakeway 00:01:23].</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
And it basically meant that just about anything that came through would eventually filter through me. So that meant I had to have a feeling or an answer to so many more just problems in my day to day than I think I would have had if I had gone to a very large established product company or a much bigger agency where I would have done a bit more, just like production type work. After five years or so I think that was kind of what made me decide to open up to the Sapient. They had called me first and that was the first time that I felt like I had gotten a call from a place that was so much more bigger and so much more established.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
I had gotten calls from other small agencies or people that were about our size, but it was my first time seeing a place where they had people like Audi and Marriott and like [inaudible 00:02:05], very large, incredibly established brands were just at the front face of their portfolio. And I also knew that if I stayed at WDG I would never be able to make all these other types of tactile deliverables I wanted to do. I really wanted to be able to ship an app. I really wanted to make much larger, more complex systems. I wanted it to be able to&#8230; I also just wanted to try just seeing what it was like to be on a bigger, different kind of team. I loved my team at WDG.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
I always credit a lot of my worldly success to just my old boss Dario&#8217;s ability just to help me just, one develop my taste, but also help me just figure out what questions to ask when I&#8217;m trying to solve for a solution. What I love most about him and just his mentorship was he really taught me how to think for myself. He was never prescriptive whenever he was trying to help you along the way to solve a solution. He would give you just enough of a riddle that you were like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll figure this out on my own.&#8221; And you could feel proud and feel like it wasn&#8217;t given to you, it was still something earned.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice, nice.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Yeah. I get the call for Sapient and they&#8217;re a big established brand and I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll make the plunge. I&#8217;ll take this risk.&#8221; And luckily for me, [inaudible 00:19:09] one Metro stop away. So didn&#8217;t have to change my commute much. As far as the transition over, I would say a lot of it was kind of exactly what I hoped I would be able to do. I did some work for Barclays, I did some work for just all these very kind of, incredibly different types of engagements that I just never would have been able to do at WDG. Mostly because like, part of the scale, but also because there&#8217;s just a big, large mega consultancy. Right. And I also got to work with just all these other people who are just very different kinds of experts.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
So I could meet people who were masters of just finance, but also I guess it might pertain to a mobile app and just all these different types of strategists who would specialize in certain kinds of areas and topics. One of my favorite parts about Sapient was just how it was able to be such a large company, but also just had so many smart people that could just jam into a room. I really love just any kind of moment where we were pitching something or we were on this more sort of discovery type angle for a project, and we were basically just&#8230; Essentially kind of this amazing sort of design SWAT team of all these different skillsets, just really coming together in a real tight timeframe.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Was it a big shift then, going from the agency world at Publicis to working for Sonos, which is like this private company?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. It&#8217;s still something that I&#8217;m very much adjusting to. I haven&#8217;t worked in house, in house since ARP, when I was an intern that was like 2012. That was a full eight years ago. It&#8217;s funny because I remember thinking there was a big dramatic shift between agency to agency based on scale because WDG was about 25 or so people when I left and Publicis was about 30,000 or so. They&#8217;re in 39 countries, about like 30 States they&#8217;re everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Coming to Sonos was very different because as you might imagine, since we&#8217;re all in house, we all worked together because the hardware, the services that is the product. That is how we make money. So what&#8217;s interesting is just, there&#8217;s a lot more just dependencies between departments, between people and a lot of what I&#8217;ve been doing for a lot of my initial onboarding, it was just meeting people, just putting names to faces and understanding what their team does and also what their team&#8217;s impact is on other projects.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
So a lot of what I&#8217;m ramping up is just trying to understand this Game of Thrones type character chart between who is in charge, what do they own and how does what they own affect other parts of different kinds of hardware and software experiences. And that&#8217;s the part that&#8217;s been most fascinating because there is so much different kind of push and pull when you&#8217;re at not just a software company, but also a company that also ships hardware. So there&#8217;s so many more moving pieces that can affect one another.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
And I guess another fun part is just the total volume of designers, because I&#8217;m so used to being this almost sole practitioner type design person on any project I&#8217;m on. I&#8217;ve almost always been the only visual design hand on most projects I&#8217;ve ever done. There&#8217;s maybe been like two or three total where I&#8217;ve ever had any kind of additional assistance. That&#8217;s another thing it&#8217;s kind of interesting to see just how other people can keep the thing going. I think I got used to this almost lone wolf aspect and every point in my career, I told myself I was trying to kind of let go of that. And I think this is a place where I finally can actually commit to that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. So let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit because we went through a lot. [inaudible 00:22:14] so far.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
I can&#8217;t answer things simply.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And what I want to do is kind of take it back. Because I want to see where this drive and this enthusiasm comes from. So you earlier mentioned growing up in Northern Virginia. Tell me what that was like. Were you exposed to a lot of art and design growing up?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve always thought about just the reason why I got into design, I&#8217;ve had all sorts of different answers for myself. I would say I was like an upper average student, I wouldn&#8217;t call myself an amazing smart bad-ass or whatever. I got like, decent honor roll when I was trying, but I remember I was always a music themed kid. I liked doing band and orchestra. I liked kind of these creative type things. And I remember I was terrible at math. I could not stand doing math or anything where an answer was very black and white. What I did love was English. I did advanced English basically from like, I don&#8217;t know, third grade until 12th. As long as I could I&#8217;d always do whatever it was like the absolute most insane version of English.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
What I love most about English was I think it was, I love the idea of just doing anything where just answers weren&#8217;t ever binary. It was always when you write a paper or an essay, you&#8217;re as good as your argument. And I think that was kind of one of the [inaudible 00:23:20] that kind of got me really interested in graphic design later. I saw myself as a kid, as an artist light, like I couldn&#8217;t draw at all, but I knew that I loved creativity. I knew I liked music. I knew I liked to engage with art, but I didn&#8217;t have the means to express in a way that was good enough to be like, &#8220;Oh yeah, I would share this or I think this is actually worth doing.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
So I was very lucky because in high school we had graphic design courses and that kind of got my first taste for a design blood. Because after two years I got to design the course catalog for the school. I think every designer has a moment where they build something and they see it made real. And that&#8217;s kind of like this turning point, right? To see something that just came from nothing. It was just some [inaudible 00:23:58] from your brain and suddenly it&#8217;s here, it&#8217;s everywhere. It&#8217;s in everyone&#8217;s homes and you&#8217;re just, I made that happen.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
And that was just such a just amazing, just indescribable moment just to see something, just to know that it was everywhere. Even though other people wouldn&#8217;t think of it as this like, they&#8217;re like &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s just a catalog, whatever it;s going to collect dust, go in the bin.&#8221; But to me it was my big gig at the time for 11th grade. Right. That was kind of like the big turning point.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
After that, I just went to school for graphic design and the rest is history. As far as other things about growing up. I always like to mention my aunt. She was a fashion designer. She was always a very big, just advocate for creativity. I wouldn&#8217;t say anyone in my family ever was not supportive of creativity or a creative pursuit or anything. I think there probably was maybe small moments of hesitation. But my mother has always been my greatest supporter. If I told her I had plans to go to the moon, she&#8217;d be the first to give me a helmet so I can always count on her support for everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Now you&#8217;ve mentioned going to school for graphic design. You went to George Mason University. What was the experience like? Do you feel like it really prepared you once you went out there in the working world as a designer?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
The state of design school is fascinating. I think I also went to school at this sort of turning point in the whole planet. Because I remember when I was in school, a lot of programs focus a lot on print and very physical media type things. But, so I went to school from between 09 and 13. And I remember around the tail end there was all this talk about like, &#8220;Oh, well, if you want to make any money, you have to be a web designer, you have to learn to [inaudible 00:25:27], you have to learn how to code.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
And I was like, &#8220;I will make any decisions in my life to not have to close the div.&#8221; And I have stood by that for the last nine years. If you&#8217;re like, &#8220;[inaudible 00:25:38] this path involves code.&#8221; I&#8217;ll be, &#8220;Next!&#8221; I will take door number two every single time. But what&#8217;s funny is around the tail end of my time, I think that was when the internet was really changing. I didn&#8217;t have to learn flash because around 2012, 2013, [inaudible 00:25:51] was really starting to really kind of kick into full gear. I think the iPhone had been like, it was starting to mature to the point where we weren&#8217;t getting mobile dot, whatever with reduced [inaudible 00:26:00] website.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
We were starting to get to this point where people are taking smartphones as a very serious platform for growth and money and all sorts of different kinds of business structures. My first internship was at ARP and this kind of coincides with that a little bit because I remember I had this kind of print background, but I knew I still wanted to do more digital. Because I remember print was cool and all, but going to the print shop, going [inaudible 00:10:21], having everything break or not being able to fix things. It was just very frustrating.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
And when I was at AARP, it was kind of around when they were really getting into digital magazines. So using things like digital publishing to basically make like an iPad edition of a magazine issue. So when I was an intern, I was kind of the initial explorer. So basically they would have a draft of the magazine and I would try to convert or try to figure out, &#8220;Okay, if we want to add some interactive pieces or do a little, some custom treatments for the iPad or make this a bit more specialized, how might we do that? What might that look like? How might that manifest? And also how can we also bring that knowledge to the rest of the team?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s around 2011, 12 or so. And so this is kind of this turning point, because at this point in my college career, we&#8217;ve been very told that, &#8220;Okay, you have to make print stuff. You have to make all sorts of kinds of liberals. You have to learn how to make shirts, book covers and posters.&#8221; Just all sorts of stuff. Not necessarily unfocused, but just stuff that like, it was fine. But I remember I was in junior and just felt like I was just making something new all the time and not necessarily making a straight line that was going to build my skillset. Every single class just felt like, &#8220;Okay, you&#8217;re going to make something different, but it&#8217;s not going to build off of the prior skill you&#8217;ve learned.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
AARP kind of gave me just this first taste for building for screens and making a result that was only for a screen. What you saw was what you got in this really just amazing way. There was no more print shops. There was no more lines. There was no more, &#8220;Make sure it&#8217;s done by 9:00 AM so you can line up at USP to go to Kinko&#8217;s.&#8221; It was such a different just&#8230; I love the immediacy. I love the feeling in my hands of just scrolling through something. Very basic interaction just felt amazing because it was something that I had done. The iPad one and two were so amazing when they were new and to do something on that around that age just felt so different.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
I just love the feeling of it and just, I really want to just do more of that. I think part of that was what inspired me to go to my next internship. It was ISL. They were this very cool, full service, digital marketing agency type company in DC. They were known for doing all sorts of just really kind of, very off the wall, intricate work. They would make machines that responded to [inaudible 00:28:30] check-ins, all sorts of other things that were just cool integrations with machinery and hardware and software and apps. I loved the vibe there, but what&#8217;s funny is everyone always assumes that ARP would have been like a slower, more boring, whatever job. But I loved AARP. I think it was the best set up I could have had for framing my success for later.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
I say it mostly because I felt like.., I don&#8217;t mean this as a diss to ISL who no longer exists, but I think it was just&#8230; I think they had a better plan there for just what to do with an intern, how to nurture an intern and build their skill set and give them the tools to move to the next thing. Whereas I felt like I was maybe just not quite understood, not having my time being prioritized, or there was no growth path for me at my second internship. And I think that&#8217;s a tricky thing.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the thing I always try to remind students is just, sometimes all the super cool sexy companies that look great from the outside looking in are always like, it&#8217;s different once you&#8217;re in there, right? It still sounds cool, cool stuff is going on. But there&#8217;s not always a guarantee that it&#8217;s going to help you spread your wings or help you get any smarter or stronger. So don&#8217;t discount the things that you think you might not like. Because that might be where you have the greatest opportunity to grow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now also, while you were at AARP, you got to work with the one and only Dian Holton&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
I did.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230;who&#8217;s a friend to the show here. She&#8217;s also been a guest on the show. Did you work really closely with her as an intern?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
I did. So there is basically&#8230; ARP has two magazines. They have the [inaudible 00:29:55]. I don&#8217;t know how it is nowadays, I don&#8217;t get a subscription I&#8217;m under 50. But at the time&#8230; I&#8217;m pretty sure they still have this. They had the magazine and the bulletin, they were two sub categories of magazine. The magazine&#8217;s the big one, the bulletin is this more I don&#8217;t know, almost reader&#8217;s digest situation.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
And so, but Diana was kind of great because, she would check in regularly, she was asking &#8220;Okay, what are you up to? Here&#8217;s what we should do this week.&#8221; And she would provide feedback week to week. And she&#8217;d also give me side products and just check in often. And that&#8217;s kind of what I mean, just going back to quality of internship is because I felt like I was actually being, one, cared for but also like I was&#8230; That she was trying to actually set me up to succeed for when I was not at ARP. That&#8217;s why I always look back at my time at ARP really fondly because I think she cared to see that growth in me over time. And now here we are eight years later and it&#8217;s just so funny just how things kind of turn out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So it seemed like you were pretty comfortable, well supported in the DMV area. I mean, you were at AARP, then after that WTG after that Publicis Sapient. I know you also did a little bit of work with AIGA, the DC chapter there as well. This Sonos experience must have really been something that made you stop and re-examine things it sounds like. Because that&#8217;s a big jump at the stage you&#8217;re at in your career to be comfortable, established in a place that you know, with people that you know. And then this other opportunity comes, it&#8217;s across the country and it&#8217;s almost like a pie in the sky kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Yeah. I will say there&#8217;s definitely a bit of idealism that kind of had a feel of the whole thing. There is this perfect brew of just weirdness. I think it was just, one they called me right when I was kind of at this low point mentally. I was still trying to refind myself, trying to figure out what do I care about? What matters to me now? What do I want to do as this person who is suddenly this solo creature here and this agency life was still cool, but I was asking myself, I was like, &#8220;What do I really want to work on?&#8221; I was on a particular project for about eight months around when I was leaving Sapient. And I&#8217;ll say that it was nothing that exactly made me want to get up and go to work every day or feel-</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
It was not a thing that exactly made me want to get up and go to work every day or feel a great drive or a great energy in my voice. [inaudible 00:32:07] where I was just like, sure. Every client deserves good design, but it&#8217;s also hard to truly give that 120% for a thing that you are only doing because you&#8217;re in it for the money. And so the [inaudible 00:32:21] cause it was like, I suddenly had this chance on the table to do something that was just as much for me as it was for them. And I think that&#8217;s so incredibly hard to pull off in design, to have a topic or a product or just anything you&#8217;re working on where you feel just as much drive as whoever the founders might be.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Music is a very near and dear topic to me. I grew up on music. I feel like there&#8217;s so many turning points in my life where just access to music or just discovery of different types of artists has just changed my world. It just made me a better, more worldly, more rounded, more interesting person. And I really would just want to just support that kind of mission. I have this feeling that just no matter what kind of amazing design I ever make, I&#8217;ll never be able to make something that&#8217;s as good as a great song. I&#8217;ll never be able to make a design system that makes you cry. But what I can do is help people bridge that gap so they can access things that can give them that feeling of emotion in their heart.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
So I feel like it&#8217;s my way of being the bassist in the band, just being support and just driving that mission. A lot of that call was just about what do I really want to do? What do I want people to feel? What do I want for me, how do I want to feel about the work that I&#8217;m doing? I came from this background where all I wanted to do is just make something that looked cool and just make another thing that looked cool and just keep it moving. But you get to a point now, if you look at my Dribbble, I&#8217;ve done over 60 different clients. I&#8217;ve worked on a lot of different things and it gets to a point now where it&#8217;s cool, it&#8217;s fun, but you start to wonder, what do I really care about?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
What&#8217;s actually emotionally resonant with me? What can I talk about where if no one sees the visual, they still know I care? And that kind of felt like I had this big opportunity for me, cause I was just like, God, I love the idea, just being in a place where a sound experience coming but what I want is just for everyone just to be just a happier person. And this just felt like a job where basically I feel like a lot of what I&#8217;m supposed to do is just almost create happiness, which sounds a little dorky. But when you think about just the ability for you to just access your sound, access your music, access your podcast. What I&#8217;m trying to do is just give people an objectively better day, whatever it is that they want to engage with. The mission just feels so pure, but also just, it&#8217;s so close to the heart, it&#8217;s hard to not love.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Designers and music tend to have a very special kind of relationship, anyway, whether it&#8217;s us listening to the music for inspiration or for productivity, or even just, I think, the opportunities that it allows us to have, whether that&#8217;s designing a flyer or a CD cover or an album cover or a poster or something like that, there&#8217;s a lot to be inspired by with music. I&#8217;ve always been interested in that connection between music and design, because I feel like it&#8217;s a really, really powerful one. I cut my teeth learning design and Photoshop by designing CD covers. This is back in the day. I don&#8217;t even know if kids still do this anymore, they probably don&#8217;t. But back in the day, there used to be two types of, I guess you can call them contests. One of them was called Layer Tennis.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Oh, I know about Layer Tennis.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So you start with one thing and then one designer does, then they pass to the other one and they add onto it and it goes back and forth until it gets to a certain point. And so then that kind of tests your ability to think quickly to work with something that&#8217;s unknown to you in a way, but then also somewhat familiar because you did do some work on it. So how do you work around and add to a design without stripping things away? And then the second thing, they were called blends. They&#8217;re essentially just fan art, essentially. You would make blends of say, an actress and you wanted to make a computer wallpaper. So you would get three pictures of this actress from, I don&#8217;t know, Getty Images or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then you would cut the actress out or you would arrange them in a very artful way to make a wallpaper or something. And so then that teaches you about proportion and scale and opacity and color and a number of different things. And you&#8217;d enter these contests and you&#8217;d see who would get the best contest. Cause they&#8217;d see, okay, these are the source pictures and this is what you ended up turning it into. So it&#8217;s almost like a recipe, in a way. It&#8217;s like Chopped, but for design. You have these raw, basic ingredients that you have to come up with something that&#8217;s greater than the sum of the parts. Right?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. That&#8217;s funny. Chopped is actually how one of my old bosses, he described design. Cause we would get like a funny collide or just a weird thing, he would just be like, &#8220;All right, our job here is to take squid and marshmallow and make this into a nice dish. Good luck.&#8221; [crosstalk 00:36:48] It feels like you&#8217;re just taking these amazing disparate parts. You&#8217;re trying to take a thing that sounds so unglamorous, you&#8217;re just like, I&#8217;m going to find the jazz. And that was what was so fun about just working at a marketing type place.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So now you&#8217;re in Santa Barbara. I know you haven&#8217;t been out much because no one has been out right now. Have you, in any kind of way been able to link up with a design community there or other designers outside of work?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Not just yet. What I want to do is I know that UCSB is nearby and I feel like they probably have an art program or I know we do sometimes send our people to talk there. I&#8217;ve always been a really huge proponent of student causes and talking to students and just letting them visit either my office or me coming to them. So that&#8217;s something that I really want to be able to, I feel like once I have enough that I feel like I can really go all in on. I would love to be able to start doing that. I care a lot about student causes, cause what I remember, all the misinformation about when I was younger and just having to filter through that and find it on my own.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
But too, I think it just helps to have someone come by and just cut through all the noise and tell you straight up as a person who is doing the thing right now, here&#8217;s actually what got me here. Every time I tell students that I don&#8217;t know how to code, I&#8217;ve made websites for years, or I don&#8217;t know how to do XYZ, or I did this instead and that helped me get to XYZ, they&#8217;re always just like what? They get their minds just routinely blown. So I love to just let them know, the way that you might think that it is or the way your teachers might have told you, there is another way. And I like to just disparage the myths or pull back the curtain anytime that I can.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now I have a question here. This is from Chanel James, who has also been on the show. She was episode 325 back in December. She asked this question, you&#8217;ve adjusted to big changes a couple of times over the last few years, which it definitely sounds like you have. When taking on new roles and challenges, how do you prepare for the next step? What advice do you have to someone who is looking for the next new thing?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
That&#8217;s an interesting layer to wind, but my first thought is first I&#8217;m going to be a little dorky with you. So you ever seen Spider-Verse?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Uh-huh (affirmative). Into the Spider-Verse? Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Yep. So for those who don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s a great quote in there where he asks, &#8220;How will I know I&#8217;m ready?&#8221; And he says, &#8220;You never really know. It&#8217;s a leap of faith. That&#8217;s all it is.&#8221; There is so much truth to that statement because anytime you get an offer for an amazing new job far away or even anything that&#8217;s even in your own city, you never feel like you&#8217;re going to be adequately prepared for it. I remember thinking, oh, you mean me? You&#8217;re talking to me? This email&#8217;s for me? [inaudible 00:39:28] turn off the imposter syndrome or assume that, am I even good enough for this kind of thing? So part of it&#8217;s also just, first you&#8217;ve got to acknowledge, you got the call, you got the response, they&#8217;re interested.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
First, you have to believe in your heart that you are actually worth the trouble and worth pursuing and worth investing in. And that&#8217;s a hard thing to sometimes believe. Cause every time you do anything wrong, all you do is assume everyone else sees it. So one, you got to see yourself in the thing. As far as preparing for it and just mentally getting through it, it&#8217;s interesting cause I try and remember, cause every time I&#8217;ve transitioned to any of these major new jobs, it&#8217;s never a one to ones. I don&#8217;t just do what I did two weeks before, just somewhere else. There&#8217;s always going to be this amazing learning curve. I think it&#8217;s just about just be willing to ask questions, be willing to be wrong, be willing to leave your ego somewhere else for a while or a very long time preferably and just be willing to work with people and just ask questions and just be vulnerable to needing to ask for help or being able to say, oh, I&#8217;m not super sure, but I want to be better.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
I want to be useful. I want to be in service of something, but I don&#8217;t always know the best way to do it. I think my greatest philosophy on my whole career, honestly, is that I think I had a paralyzing fear of asking for help sometimes, probably when I needed it most. I think that I had this worry that if I asked for help, that I would be seen as this person who wasn&#8217;t an expert didn&#8217;t understand what was going on, maybe shouldn&#8217;t have been the person tasked for the thing. But what I found, especially at [inaudible 00:08:53], we had this amazing culture of just being willing to ask for help, being willing to admit that you&#8217;re wrong and presuming good intent from people who are asking questions or doing anything. Back when I was at agencies, I often felt that if I asked for help or asked a question that I was going to basically poke a hole in whatever kind of sense of rank or stature that I was trying to prop up for myself.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
And I feel like I&#8217;m trying to chip away at that, just every single year, every single interaction I&#8217;m trying just to be more willing to be wrong, be more willing to let people know that if I am wrong, I want you to let me know and I want us to be able to work on it together so that you don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m trying to be wrong and loud. I would rather be wrong than right together. So a lot of it&#8217;s about just all communication because if you get the call, you are already a good enough designer, but you also have to be a good enough person. That&#8217;s usually the thing that we don&#8217;t always focus in on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is it that keeps you motivated and inspired these days?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Oh boy. So many things. I love just all sorts of kinds of me. I&#8217;m a big movie nerd, I&#8217;m a big music nerd, I love curating my music, I love sneakers, I love games. I love so many just different types of just entertainment, art and media, and just loving to just see all these wild, different, weird aesthetics. One of the hardest parts about moving here is there&#8217;s no AMC out here. So it&#8217;s really hard to be a movie nerd out here. So hard. So what I love about all these different mediums, if you go outside, if you go to museums, you go to malls, you just look at a lot of stuff, you see so many different kinds of just styles and tastes and just ways that things get done and all these really strange ways that tends to leak its way back into your design sensibilities.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
I think that one of the things that&#8217;s made me versatile as a designer is just not minding looking at stuff or going places that I feel like I wouldn&#8217;t ordinarily choose to. So if someone&#8217;s like, oh, let&#8217;s go to the mall, let&#8217;s just window shop. You&#8217;ll see so many different typographic treatments at the mall. If you play games, there are so many ways to deconstruct a UI and think of it for a different application. If you like shoes, there are so many wild color schemes that should not be possible that totally work. Looking at you Yeezy Wave Runners. So a lot of what I&#8217;m thinking about is just, how can I just infuse just what I&#8217;m seeing daily or what I just like to do for myself and how can I repurpose that in the frame of, okay, if I were trying to work this back into a design, how might this change my approach for something, no matter how small or big this thing is?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What do you like to do in your non work time?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
I actually minored in computer game design so originally, I should have mentioned that. It&#8217;s always a little thing that just kind of tucks in, cause I never did much with it. So I minored in game design. So every time you ask a recommendation, it has to be a 90 minute conversation. I&#8217;m one of those. So I love gaming. I tried to start streaming. I would like to start a podcast mostly because, as you can probably tell, I&#8217;m a big talker, I could just go forever. So I tried to figure out how to merge that love of just chitter chatter into something. I got a friend or two who&#8217;s like, oh, maybe we&#8217;ll start some form of podcast, we&#8217;ll just do a little round table kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
I try to be much more of an outdoorsy person out here, out east, in D.C., it&#8217;s not that fun to own a bike cause the only place you&#8217;re going to go to Target or is to get hit by a car. But here, it&#8217;s very different, cause out here it&#8217;s so amazingly picturesque and beautiful out here, you can get to the ocean in like five minutes, there&#8217;s flowers and lavender everywhere. Everything smells beautiful so it&#8217;s just amazing to hike and bike and just be present and outside. And I&#8217;m really looking forward to just being this different, more suntanned version of myself once things settle down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to talk some more about this gaming because right now I feel like as we&#8217;re recording this it&#8217;s April 6th. We&#8217;re kind of in the middle of a-</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Big dry spell?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, no, actually I was going to say we&#8217;re kind of in the middle of a good bit of games right now. Well, I guess it depends on what systems you&#8217;re playing. What systems do you have?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, so you have a Switch?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
I have a Switch, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
PS4?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Yep. PC.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Got a Xbox One? PC?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
You don&#8217;t even need the Xbox if you&#8217;ve got a PC.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Real talk. It is what it is, Windows 10, you know, but I feel like we go with these like amazing, weird ebbs and flows with games. I can get real dorky about this, but&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But we&#8217;re kind of in a good time for games. I hate to say because of the pandemic, but people are at home and they want entertainment. Movies aren&#8217;t out because movie theaters are closed and production is shut down. There&#8217;s no new television shows unless you use Quibi, which I don&#8217;t know if by the time this episode comes out, people will still be using Quibi, but there&#8217;s not a lot of new stuff. And so a lot of people, I think right around the time Animal Crossing: New Horizons came out, everyone was like, yes, a distraction from the world.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
See, what&#8217;s funny is one of my favorite types of games are rhythm games. Once again, just infusing that love of music. I&#8217;m the type that generally plays games to be challenged and to almost just have a hard time. I love that feeling of achievement from overcoming. I like relaxing things also. But I think the ones that I look back with my most vivid memories of are usually things that were hard. I think a lot of that also tends to temper your brain too, to being like, if something doesn&#8217;t go right your way and you&#8217;re used to getting your ass kicked like 80 times in a row, you&#8217;re like, oh whatever. I got to make a hot take here, just say that I think Dark Souls has made me a nicer software designer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
You heard it here first, folks. So for all the nerds on the podcast, give it a whirl.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I saw from looking at your Instagram that you beat Persona 5.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Oh my God, it&#8217;s so long. It&#8217;s 106 hours. Honestly, real talk, I think Persona 5 has some of the most amazing graphic design ever put into a video game.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Agreed. I agree.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
It&#8217;s galaxy brain. Blew my mind. I cannot believe the things that they were able to pull off, the transitions they were able to do. Just the things that they would typography and scale and shape and color. It&#8217;s so hard to describe. I&#8217;m getting all lit up about this cause it&#8217;s just-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No they really stepped it up from Persona 4. Personas 3 and 4 kept a very similar sort of style, I would say. I think 4 was very, very much more colorful because it was just themed yellow and stuff. But they really stepped it up for 5. 5 is just so kinetic, there&#8217;s so much energy in the design.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
That&#8217;s also part of the reason why I feel like video games are a very underrated place to get UI and design inspiration.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
A lot of people think of games as just Call of Duty or very mainstream ones that are commercial, right? But games, oftentimes have to solve very, really interesting kind of UI problems. And they also have to do it without a mouse. So they have to do all these different things to teach a player things, sometimes really extreme or advanced or multilayered concepts, but also that&#8217;s sometimes all these kinds of different items, like how&#8217;s the UI for a team look? How are you communicating things to the player? How are you showing data and information on something that&#8217;s also very busy on the rest of the screen? There are so many different kinds of UX and UI challenges that are happening in games that I feel like just get totally thrown under the radar. Cause people see it as this hobby, whatever, blah, blah, blah. They don&#8217;t understand the level of intricacy that goes with some of these things.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
&#8230; don&#8217;t understand how the level of intricacy that goes with some of these things, but a lot of times, if you were like, man, we need a team page. My first thing to look for inspiration, it wouldn&#8217;t just be look at other team pages on Dribbble. It would just be like, okay, how have games solve this? How have they handled different accounts for a certain amount of units that they need to show on screen? If you have a dashboard, like RTSs are strategy games, how are they showing just large chunks of information that needs to be readily viewable? How are&#8230; all these very different, just very real challenges that actually impact experience are being handled in games and have been handled for a long time. And as well, some of them are also done in a really, really visually amazing way ala Persona 5. So, I think it&#8217;s another part of just finding inspiration in the things that you love and just figuring out how to basically how to pick and choose where to pull them back into the things that you are doing as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you plan on playing Persona 5 Royal?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. It&#8217;s 106 hours and whatever. I mean we&#8217;re in the time of Corona. Of course I&#8217;m going to. But first I got to be God, I need to beat Doom Eternal first that&#8217;s going to be a nice short one. Like what else is in my backlog Astral Chain. Typically I love narrative and very story during games, a lot of things I would like to learn from story during games, this is going to sound like a funny kind of like Agency tangent, but one of the most important things I learned from Agency World was how to tell a compelling story, and if you could play a lot of games with compelling stories that can actually get you to tear up or feel a certain way really quickly that&#8217;s what a good pitch deck is all about.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Well, it sounds like a tangent, but roll with me here for a second. So it&#8217;s like, when you&#8217;re doing a big pitch, someone has got to have, let&#8217;s say $40 million to spend, how are you going to convince them, how are you going to make them feel in their hearts that they should feel a certain way and that you were the right choice?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
And usually you&#8217;re going to tell a very well crafted, but also a convincing story, right? It&#8217;s not about just laying out a bunch of facts. You can&#8217;t just shovel out a bunch of stats. You got to present them in a way, in an order, and a line where they believe it, but they also feel emotionally resonant with it, and I feel like when you think of kind of the story beats of certain games that are big deals for stories. So you Last of Us, your Shadow of the Colossus, your God of War 2018s, your really big, just ones with narratively strong, what are they doing right? What order are they doing that? And, how might you kind of think about the way those beats are handled, both majorly or softly until like also, how are you to change how you tell a compelling story?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Because half of why I think I got the job at Sonos was I feel like when I interviewed, I told a very compelling story when I interviewed because a little bit about that, I&#8217;ll go back to this, but everyone I was interviewing I didn&#8217;t even show work for the first 25 minutes. Yeah, I know. Right. So that sounds weird, right? First third whatever of the interview, first I wanted to kind of introduce, I felt it was weird to be basically jump in and just be like, hello, thanks for meeting me. Here&#8217;s the work that you probably already saw online now. No, that seemed weird.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
So instead what I tried to do was, I was like, how am I going to kind of build this narrative upward? So it&#8217;s a little bit about me. Like what motivates me? What do I like? What am I to the company? What is the company&#8217;s mission to me? And how can I prove this in a way that makes you also know that I&#8217;m not just making it up. So I had a really great slide where in 2017, I bought my mother to Play Ones, and I showed the video of her pulling them open. And that was a muddy moment. That was a narrative moment where they were like, Oh, this guy. Like that was them thinking this guy isn&#8217;t just some dude who bought the speaker, just whatever, he&#8217;s actually a fan. He believes in the mission.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Things that just kind of unite you to whatever is going on in that moment. Right? And, I could have just jumped in and been like, well, my work looks pretty good. I think don&#8217;t you think so? I know I could have just been impersonal about it or just basically just pasted in what I would&#8217;ve done for the next agency, but you know, if you tailor it right, storytelling is actually going to be your most powerful argument when you&#8217;re doing an interview.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
So play video games. Don&#8217;t worry about storytelling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One question that I&#8217;m asking everyone this year, it&#8217;s kind of the theme of the year is about the future. You know, we&#8217;re in 2020, this is by all intents and purposes when you think about pop culture, when people talk about the future, it tends to be 2020 and above. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s because of ABC&#8217;s news show or whatever, but people tend to think of 2020 as the future. How are you helping to use your design skills to build a more equitable future?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Oh, that&#8217;s a great question. I guess that you caught me at a really timely time, because if you had asked me that a year ago, I would&#8217;ve been probably not at all, but now I think part of the Sonos mission is our mission is to empower listeners everywhere. And it&#8217;s very broad, and that&#8217;s kind of on purpose because a lot of what we&#8217;re trying to do here is we&#8217;re trying to basically give people an amazing listening experience no matter where they might be, whether you&#8217;re in your bedroom and your living room, whether you&#8217;re on your patio or you on the go, we were trying to find a way to basically kind of be with you so that you can enjoy the content that you like, however you like, whenever you like, how you like, with whomever services that you like.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
So a lot of what we&#8217;re trying to do is we&#8217;re trying to empower users. We&#8217;re trying to give them choice. We&#8217;re trying to give them more freedom, but we&#8217;re also trying to provide access to things for them. So a lot about what I see as what the best parts about the job is just Sonos is in this rare position where we can actually really help kind of surface a lot of things to users that they might not have known that they wanted. I mean this in a very non advertising kind of way. Why I say this, because a lot of what, what a Sonos does is we are kind of this amazing hub for a lot of services, right?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
So you can use Amazon, Apple Music, and Spotify, and Deezer, and Pandora, and you can use so many different services on our platform. But what&#8217;s great about that is that lets you also surface things that maybe are adjacent to things that you didn&#8217;t know you had, for example, like if you love Fleetwood Mac, there is a potential future where if you search a podcast, maybe you&#8217;ll see the Song Exploder Episode about a Fleetwood Mac song. Maybe you&#8217;ll see a book about the artist, maybe you&#8217;ll be able to catch more content related.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
What I love is this idea of just being able to kind of enrich people&#8217;s experiences with the artists that they love, and with the content that they like, what I love is just this idea of how can we just kind of give people greater access to art, and entertainment, and just media, in these ways that are just going to make them want to do what it did for me to make them just more enriched, more well rounded, more engaged people with all sorts of different types of media.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? It&#8217;s 2025. What kind of work do you want to be doing? What sort of projects do you want to be working on, that sort of stuff?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
You know, my five year plan for right now is, well, if I compare what I would have said a year ago, I&#8217;m just amazed at just how much these can change. So right now my plan is I really want to be in California for a good while. Mostly because moving cross country very much sucks, do not do it. Oh my God actually it&#8217;s worth it, do it. So, moving is a pain in the ass. I think I&#8217;m trying to stay in California for as long as I can, for as long as it&#8217;s reasonable. [crosstalk 00:55:00] retention is amazing in the company. I have met people who have been here for 11, 8, 16 years. Those are numbers that are unfathomable at an agency. Like can not be. It was a constant going away party there.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m very excited about just the path ahead at Sonos just in terms of just the roadmap features, products, everything that we want to do and kind of that core mission, but five years now, just career wise, I would love to figure out, just, what&#8217;s kind of that path towards creative director, or trying to be towards a bit more of this person who essentially empowers the team because right now, I come from this background where what I&#8217;m trying to do is I&#8217;m trying to be this kind of individual power user. I&#8217;m trying to be this amazing individual contributor. But what I love about my new boss, he is just so, what&#8217;s the word, he&#8217;s just so empathetic and so caring, and I just love that about him. He just has this amazing concern and care for people.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
I really want to be able to get some of that into myself as well, and just be able to just take that kind of energy and concern and care for people. And to use that to expand a team, and also while taking what I&#8217;ve learned from design over all the years to make them better designers, but also just make them just better, more impassioned people as well. So I&#8217;d love to figure out how to just get work my way up to that stage. Now, if at this house or somewhere else who knows.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
My rule to myself was if I was going to make any kind of large shifts, it had to be for something that I really, really, really gave a damn about. And I&#8217;m really glad that I landed at this one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Sure. You can catch me on Dribbble at Dribbble.com/rparrish. You can see just about everything reasonable I&#8217;ve ever done. Half of why I keep so much stuff up there is so you can just track my development and just see that, you&#8217;ve got to&#8230; It&#8217;s an uphill battle. If you are new and you don&#8217;t like what you did. You can see the stuff that I wasn&#8217;t great at too. It&#8217;s a process. So, go from bottom to top. It&#8217;s a little journey. I don&#8217;t do any writing, but I do tweet about design sometimes @randallallday, but it&#8217;s mostly goofy, goofy, gobbledy garbage so you&#8217;ve been warned. You&#8217;re welcome to follow me on Apple music. I listen to a lot of what Pitchfork likes, but except I weed out all the nonsense so, you can check what I&#8217;m listening to. So that&#8217;s probably the core of it. I should get into some writing, but maybe we&#8217;ll have a podcast soon, but that&#8217;s all for now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Randall Parrish, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. You know, I mentioned this before we started recording that I had spoken with Diana. She gave me this really long description about the work that you&#8217;ve done. I think it actually was a post or something that you wrote. I want to say it was a post that you wrote about how you were just getting things together to go to Sonos. You were about to start out there, and one thing that I saw as I was doing all of my research was that you refer to yourself as a human glitter bomb.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
That&#8217;s correct.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I would say that, just based off of this conversation, it&#8217;s very clear like you have this enthusiasm inside and out, not just for the work that you do, but also being able to make a difference in people&#8217;s lives, so I can see how that would stick. Once this whole COVID-19, coronavirus, quarantine, self isolation lifts, I am really excited to see you get back to work and see what you can do with Sonos because I think this is just the beginning for you, and I&#8217;m really going to be excited to see what you do from here. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Randall Parrish:</b><br>
Thank you so much for having me. I&#8217;ve had a total blast with you. Believe me, stay in touch and you know, Sonos discounts for everyone. Send me an email.</p>

<p>What does the &#8220;middle&#8221; of a designer&#8217;s career look like? Does the &#8220;middle&#8221; exist outside of a corporate company&#8217;s career ladder? I examine these questions and more with this week&#8217;s guest, the one and only Chanel James. As a designer for EAB, Chanel works on production and design and for a number of different projects, all with the goal of making education smarter and our communities stronger.</p>
<p>Chanel talked about what attracted her to work for EAB, and also spoke on her work with AIGA DC on their board of directors. We also discussed the South and design, how she acquired a love for illustration from a popular kid&#8217;s television show, and yes, we went into the mid-career designer topic I mentioned earlier. Chanel lives by the motto &#8220;make it pretty&#8221;, and no matter her role or profession, she definitely brings the skills and experience to the table that make her motto a fact!</p>

<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Hi. My name is Chanel James. I&#8217;m an In House Designer at a company called EAB, which is like a best practices research, education firm. We essentially help schools, provide schools with research, and best practices to better the experience for students in higher ed, and otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Nice. How long have you been at EAB?</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: I&#8217;m also at my two year mark, I&#8217;ll be at two years in February. It&#8217;s been a really awesome two years, I&#8217;ve learned and grown a lot while I&#8217;ve been here, I&#8217;ve touched a lot of different projects. It&#8217;s in house, but it can sometimes feel like an agency, which is exciting in that way. We get the same projects, but they change almost each year, so that&#8217;s exciting for me.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Nice. What attracted you to working for them?</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: To say that I kind of got to back up a little bit, after graduating I went to go work for a consulting firm, which was not my vibe, not anything I enjoyed doing. Prior to that I was working in house for a nonprofit, still in the education realm and I loved that, it felt like a family, almost felt like school in the sense where I was learning as I was doing projects. But, the other place was not anywhere in the realm of what I wanted to continue doing.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: I came across EAB, I met someone at an AIGA event in 2017 who worked here, and I looked up their work and I was like, &#8220;Oh, this is something I think I can get with.&#8221; I love the culture, like how the culture looks and stuff. I applied, and thankfully I got it, and the rest was history from there. Yeah, I was really attracted to, I&#8217;m a big one on workplace culture and balance, work/life balance because work takes up 85% of our lives essentially. And if you don&#8217;t enjoy it while you&#8217;re there, like if you don&#8217;t enjoy it, that&#8217;s like most of your life you&#8217;re not enjoying.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: I try to focus on that.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: What is the culture like there?</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Very supportive. People here understand that you have like, people know that you have families, and you have life outside of the walls of EAB. PTO is taken seriously, that&#8217;s really hard when it comes to being in anything with design, often times people like, &#8220;Oh, overnight. Oh, we need this tomorrow.&#8221; But here if you&#8217;re like, five o&#8217;clock comes they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, we understand. I&#8217;ll get it from you sometime midday tomorrow,&#8221; type thing. It&#8217;s nice to have like, I mean there are times like right now it&#8217;s like busy season, so things are kind of like we&#8217;ve got to get it done, but there&#8217;s still boundaries. I love how there are boundaries with work/life, and home life. I think that&#8217;s my biggest thing, it&#8217;s like why I love this company so much.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: So far what&#8217;s kind of been the most challenging thing that you&#8217;ve encountered while working there? It can be whether it&#8217;s just the general work culture, or in the job specifically working with a client, anything like that.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: When I first started here it was, it&#8217;s not the most diverse place just in terms of actual diversity. There are not many people of color. They&#8217;re working towards that, but I think that was my biggest struggle when I first started coming from my back &#8230; you know, I went to George Mason University, I graduated from there, which is all about diversity. You know, celebrating people&#8217;s differences, and so there were always different types of people. But when I started on my team, my manager is a black woman, but then that&#8217;s it. Everyone else is white, which is okay, but I found myself not feeling like I fit in quite well, or wanting to do things the way other people do things.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: I&#8217;m a very, I consider myself a very colorful black woman. I like wearing scarves, I have natural hair, my hair is like a big piece of my identity. Coming into a space where I don&#8217;t see anybody else who looks like me, dresses like me, talks like me, it&#8217;s tough because you don&#8217;t feel validated. And so, you kind of have to break out of that. It&#8217;s a mind game almost, you&#8217;ve got to remember that you can celebrate who you are even though there aren&#8217;t other people who look like you in the room. But that still takes practice, and it&#8217;s tough. Often times people leave places because they&#8217;re like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see anybody here who looks like me, I&#8217;m going to dip out.&#8221; But I&#8217;m really proud of myself that I saw it through while I&#8217;ve been here because it&#8217;s gotten a lot better for me, but it&#8217;s still tough. I think we all, all designer&#8217;s kind of feel the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: You&#8217;re usually like the only designer in a space, but when you&#8217;re the only designer, and the only black person or person of color in general it&#8217;s tough, it&#8217;s hard.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah, I&#8217;ve been in situations like that certainly where you end up being the, I don&#8217;t want to say the token, that&#8217;s not really the best way to put it. But, you end up being the only one kind of by default, and so it takes really a strong sense of self to know that you&#8217;re supposed to be here, you&#8217;re here for a reason, because imposter syndrome can really set in fairly quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: And it set in really hard for me, and I think it was something I had to get over in college too because I came from, so I grew up in Richmond Virginia. Which, whoever is from Virginia in general knows that Richmond is a, it&#8217;s like a predominantly black city. I grew up in like an all black elementary school, all black middle school, all black high school. Because that&#8217;s the way counties are set up, and we know that gentrification, redlining, all of the histories behind that, why certain neighborhoods are more black than others.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: But, I got into my college which is in Northern Virginia, and that&#8217;s an entirely different space to be in. There are streetlights that are constantly on. I know that it&#8217;s a small detail, but it was something that &#8230; it was small, but it impacted me because I was like, &#8220;Wow, these people got streetlights, they got sidewalks, they&#8217;re encouraged to be outside, the houses look all nice and clean.&#8221; This is where I always pictured my &#8230; I&#8217;m not saying I grew up in the hood, but when you grow up in areas that are predominantly black, things are different.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: That&#8217;s just how it is, it&#8217;s just different.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: College for me was a little bit of a culture shock because it was beautiful, the campus was beautiful. Again, predominantly white, so I had to find my community while I was there. I was like, &#8220;Where do I belong?&#8221; Then I started meeting not just black, but African people so I was like, &#8220;Wow, then what am I?&#8221; Then my identity started like, I started having this identity crisis. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, people are starting to say they&#8217;re from this country. Oh, I&#8217;m from Ghana, I&#8217;m from Nigeria, I&#8217;m from Germany,&#8221; people at Mason were very big about repping their countries. Then people would ask where I was from and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;America? Virginia?&#8221; I feel like I really had to find myself getting into college. That&#8217;s why I say my hair is my biggest part of my identity, because during that time, freshman year, I shaved my head. I cut all my hair off.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Oh wow.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Went natural, and I decided, I was like, &#8220;This is going to be my thesis while I&#8217;m here. Let&#8217;s talk about the identity of black Americans,&#8221; and things like that. Now, did that end up being my actual thesis in senior year? No, but it was a big part of who I was. People knew me for my different hairstyles, my art was kind of centered around my hair, I always brought up some type &#8230; because again, I was the only black person in my classes, it was like one or two of us. That college was like the first time that I was the only person who looked like me in classrooms and things like that, and that took a lot of personality shifting on my part.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: And I thought for some reason that when I graduated, things would change. I would go back into spaces where I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s the black boss, black CEO, or Spanish CEO,&#8221; you know? Different type of people, but I was wrong. I mean, so far everywhere I went, it&#8217;s been like &#8230; or everyplace I&#8217;ve worked at so far has been not too many people of color in general. I don&#8217;t really know why yet, I&#8217;m still trying to figure that out.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: When you look back at your past experiences, is that the main thing that stands out to you is the diversity of the teams that you&#8217;ve been on?</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Yeah, I think so. Now, sometimes it can reflect the experience I have with working. When I first started at EAB I was not confident at all. I knew I was talented, people told me I&#8217;m talented, but I felt like I was doing everything wrong. We have a lot of processes here, and we&#8217;re very organized, we&#8217;re a very process driven team. When someone came to me and told me, &#8220;Oh, this is wrong.&#8221; Or, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t how we do things.&#8221; I would get discouraged because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Ugh, I did it wrong again.&#8221; I would focus only on what I did wrong. On top of the fact that I was the only black person, so I was like-</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: &#8230; &#8220;I&#8217;m being looked at differently because if I get it wrong, then that reflects not only on me, but everyone.&#8221; You know?</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah, and that&#8217;s such an unfair-</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Burden&#8217;s a good word.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: &#8230; Yeah, it&#8217;s an unfair burden to even have on your mind. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not just messing up for me, I&#8217;m messing up for all black people.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Right? [crosstalk 00:10:29].</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: That&#8217;s, ugh, I hate that.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Yeah, and I started finding myself wanting to find spaces where there were other people who looked like me, or who thought like me.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: I was still pretty hesitant to be my full self around other than my boss whose black, I think it was just me and her going into like having our biweekly check ins. I kind of, like I was able to unfold a little bit. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Girl, let me tell you about this week.&#8221; Or, [inaudible 00:11:01]. &#8220;Oh, did you see Black Panther? How did you like that?&#8221; Type thing.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: But when I&#8217;m in this, I had to &#8230; it was a huge challenge for me to call out things. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Guys, we shouldn&#8217;t be doing &#8230;&#8221; It&#8217;s still a challenge, because you don&#8217;t want to be that person.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Like again, I&#8217;m black, but do I have to call out the things that might offend people of color?</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Or, do I seem like I&#8217;m whining a little bit? It goes back to the point of validation. Sometimes you don&#8217;t feel validated when you&#8217;re in spaces when you&#8217;re the only one who looks like you.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah, and I mean I think companies should realize that, that&#8217;s sort of like, or that should be seen as an advantage, or a cultural advantage in some way. You&#8217;re being able to see something that perhaps not everyone else is seeing because of the homogeneity of the team, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Mm-hmm (affirmative), mm-hmm (affirmative). One of the things that ended up happening for me to really feel like myself here was the fact that I found, we have employee resource groups, which I think most companies have. But, it&#8217;s groups that are for veterans, for parents, for just different groups of people to celebrate themselves, and things like that. We have the group called Mosaic, and I found, it was like two other black women on my team, some director level women, some entry level women, and men. And I was able to kind of find more of myself in them whenever I felt like I was running into an issue at work, or I wasn&#8217;t confident. I&#8217;d run up to one of their desks, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Ugh, I can&#8217;t believe this,&#8221; type thing.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: They would kind of help me feel a little bit better about whatever situation I was going through.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Now, I notice that all of the black people come to my desk during the day. They&#8217;ll come by, &#8220;Hey Chanel, hey girl.&#8221; It&#8217;s kind of become like we have a network, a system. I hate to say it, I think everyone has some type of Slack group, or group chat.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Like a black &#8230; I mean you don&#8217;t name it that, but you kind of treat it like a black Slack, just going, &#8220;Hey-&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: &#8230; &#8220;Did y&#8217;all see this in the news, pop culture?&#8221; Things that you can talk about freely without feeling judged in a sense. Finding that community here was really important for me, but that took a while. Prior to that I started going to Meetups. AIGA&#8217;s been a really big part of my identity too, so I in 2018 applied to sit on the board of the DC, AIGA DC chapter, and I ended up getting it. I started off as a Program Coordinator, and now I&#8217;m Woman Lead. And that-</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: &#8230; Yeah, thank you. That&#8217;s been a really big part of my identity as well, because I am able to create spaces, find other young designers, even like non designers who are just looking for a community, and help build that sense of community for them. Just to help them push through the end of the work week. We create programs that I think build people up, and I think that&#8217;s why-</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: &#8230; I&#8217;m such a big fan.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit because I&#8217;m curious to know, you mentioned growing up sort of in the DMV area earlier, was design, and art, and tech, were those a big part of your upbringing? Were you exposed to them early?</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Yes, yes, and no, I&#8217;m just going to say yes.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Not design specifically because I think we get that &#8230; a lot of people growing up would be like, &#8220;Oh, design, computer.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not a computer whiz.&#8221; But, let&#8217;s see. I had a speech impediment growing up, like when I was really young. I took speech classes in elementary school, it was so bad that my parents sometimes didn&#8217;t even understand what I was saying, it was like only my big &#8230; I have two older sisters.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: One of my sisters who I roomed with would have to translate for me. I watched Blue&#8217;s Clue&#8217;s a lot, and that taught me how to take basic shapes and build these complex forms, right? I would illustrate sometimes to communicate, and then I started becoming more inspired by, you know how you go into black homes, you go on family reunions and things like that, and you realize everyone has the same piece of art?</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: I think I was also pretty taken back about that, so my mom introduced me &#8230; not introduced me, but showed me some pieces by Jacob Lawrence who was, anything in the Harlem Renaissance I was a huge nerd for. I hate to bring him up, but Bill Cosby, Little Bill, that cartoon.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Those pieces of works really inspired me growing up. Then, I got into middle school, I was introduced to animating. But not using any Adobe programs, I think we just used like iMovie and the Paint app. I can&#8217;t tell you what exactly we used, but it was frame by frame. My art teacher Mr. [Epps 00:16:24], really saw something in me, and so he encouraged me to keep doing these digital illustrations. Which again, I didn&#8217;t connect that to design because no one was using that terminology around me back then. I was really inspired by doing that, art has always been a really big part of my life, to the point where I applied to the Center for the Arts High School in my area but I didn&#8217;t get in. Which crushed me, but I had a pep talk by my mom. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;No, you can do it, la, la, la. Just keep going to the regular high school, make things happen for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: I think my parents both encouraged me in art, but my mom told me I had to pair it with something. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to be an artist, you have to make it profitable, so go work for a company &#8230;&#8221; again, she&#8217;s describing graphic design, but she&#8217;s not using the terms graphic design. She&#8217;s just kind of like, &#8220;You can work for a company and make maybe advertising, and things like that.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay yeah, I can do that.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: I ended up senior year applying to VCU Arts, which again, I didn&#8217;t get into. My world was crushed again, my validation was crushed again and I was like, &#8220;Is this what I&#8217;m supposed to be doing?&#8221; Found George Mason, applied there, and got in. That&#8217;s when, I think it was in one of my entry level design classes, someone &#8230; they started teaching us about design, and Bauhaus, and all the histories. That is when I started, like I was introduced to the programs, and I just kept practicing.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: I think the biggest turning point for me was meeting my professor Reese Quinones, who walked in the room, and it was the first time I saw a black professor walk into a room up to that point. I think this was my sophomore year, and I was shook. I was just kind of like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, I have a black professor.&#8221; And she was so talented. She spoke with &#8230; Now, she&#8217;s Puerto Rican but just looking at her you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s black.&#8221; You know? It&#8217;s black, it&#8217;s Puerto Rican, we&#8217;re all the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: But, she spoke with such passion about what she did. She would build things, and it was almost like watching a movie. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Here, we can just take this shape here, add some transparency here, align here, and boom.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;How did you do that? I want to be just like you.&#8221; She inspired me so much that I would sit and practice on weekends, just copying things that were in the media and things like that, going to museums, and just trying to understand &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Going to museums and just trying to understand why I liked what I liked, and stuff like that. So I think, yeah, that was my biggest introduction to design. But growing up I&#8217;ve always been a little Chanel artist. That never changed to me.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Okay. When did you sort of get the sense that this was something that you could do for a career? Because it sounds like George Mason was a time that really was formative in shaping the fact that you kind of could do this-</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Full time.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Just as a scale. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Yeah. Let&#8217;s see. I was able to sign up as like different school groups that we&#8230; I was in fashion society and I&#8217;m not a fashionista but they wanted me to make some of their flyers and social media ads and things like that-</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: You were just saying you, you have the colorful scarves and everything [crosstalk 00:19:55] not a fashionista.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: [crosstalk 00:19:56] to be colorful and do your own thing. But I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m an influencer, [crosstalk 00:20:05] more stylish than I am but I would do things for them. And eventually some people from there would be like, &#8220;oh actually,&#8221; some girls would be like, &#8220;hey, I need a logo for this. Do you think you can do it?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;yeah I can.&#8221; In my head I&#8217;m like, no I can&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t know how to do anything. And I would just kind of go for it. Open up Illustrator, which was at that time was like my best friend and put some texts and things together. Now, looking back on it, some of those things I did was, I mean I was just starting out so it wasn&#8217;t the best stuff, but that&#8217;s when I started doing things for profit and then if one person heard from another person that, oh yeah Chanel&#8217;s the graphic designer. In Black Mason, people would know me as the graphic designer.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: So because our community was so small, you had maybe three designers who you&#8217;d be like, or three artists in a sense who would kind of do things for the black programming and things like that. And I also ended up getting a job on campus working with our housing department as a graphic designer, which was I think a pretty, that helped me figure out how to work on a team. It was kind of set up in house where we would be doing things for just housing and things like that. We&#8217;d create illustrative posters for our campus residence fairs and things for, what&#8217;s it called, freshmen move in was a really big campaign that we would have to create marketing materials, signage, flyers and all of these sorts of collateral pieces was when I started building that skillset of time management, sending things to print and things like that.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: So that molded me a lot. By the time I finished that role there, I think I was able to intern with my mentor who was Risa [Kanyonez 00:22:15], the professor who I was drooling over [inaudible 00:22:21] I interned at her company and then ended up contracting for a little while and I&#8217;m going down the line of my timeline, but that&#8217;s essentially how I started, realized how to make a profit. People just kept referring me by word of mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. Now you graduated in 2017. You&#8217;ve been working here in the industry for a few years and we spoke about this a little bit before we started recording about the notion of kind of being a mid level slash mid career designer, I suppose. Where do you see yourself, like right now we&#8217;re recording this 2019, where do you see yourself in the design industry at this level?</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: I see myself, I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m in the middle of it. I don&#8217;t see myself as a expert by any means. Right. And I said this before, but I also don&#8217;t see myself as&#8230; I see myself as a [inaudible 00:23:18] I don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s so hard because I&#8217;m still trying to figure that out essentially. And I think a lot of us mid level designers are just still trying to figure that out. I am a part of a lot of things, mainly because of my job, AIGA, I do freelance and I use all of these different avenues and tools and people and volunteering and things like that so that I can say, yeah, like I&#8217;ve worked on, I know how to put a team together. I know how to run a program, I know how to ask for donations and things like that. But I haven&#8217;t been doing it as long as other people, so I get nervous to say, yes refer me for this or see me as an expert. You don&#8217;t have to use the word expert, if you&#8217;re not using the word expert, what else do you use?</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Right. It&#8217;s something where it feels like the, it&#8217;s the mid part that is kind of I think a little bit trippy because certainly when you see entry level positions, I see entry level positions that require as much as five years experience. That is not entry level if you&#8217;ve got five years of experience under your belt. But in the same vein, what is the middle of a designer&#8217;s career at this stage in the game because the tech is changing. The roles are changing. I mean 10 years ago there weren&#8217;t product designers. Everyone was a web designer or a graphic designer, so the roles are changing, the structures are changing within companies. What if you are a really strong individual contributor but you don&#8217;t want to go into managing a team or managing people? Where do you go from there? It&#8217;s a lot of sort of nebulous nebulousness in the middle of the design kind of career because I think even the ones that are the experts, I feel like they, I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s tough to say.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: It&#8217;s a-</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I certainly. No sorry go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: I was going to say you&#8217;re really just looking at the time of how long I&#8217;ve been doing this or if I&#8217;ve been doing this too long, have I refreshed up my skills? How long has it been since I&#8217;ve learned the latest, newest thing about this topic. And I also think with being mid level, you&#8217;re trying to move away from the negative notion that comes with being new or being labeled as new, labeled as entry because a lot of people who I&#8217;ve&#8230; Even this summer I was able to mentor two amazing individuals for our marketing department, but they both expressed to me how weird they felt, how much negativity came with the word intern, came with the word new, came with the word college grad or college student. Because people kind of brush you off into thinking that you&#8217;re not, oh, she&#8217;s not skilled or she doesn&#8217;t have, but because I mean they both were Black women. I think that sometimes young White people can get away with being new, but also being something that people gravitate towards as experts or go to&#8217;s in that sense. I mean look at-</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: They&#8217;re a fresh new voice-</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: A fresh new voice. Look at, what&#8217;s his name? Facebook dude. What&#8217;s his name, the CEO.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Mark, yeah. He was this college level, new, wet behind the ears guy and then like, hey, I want this app. Him and his other dudes are like&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry I&#8217;m using such basic terminology, but [inaudible 00:27:08] But when new people come up with an idea, sometimes it&#8217;s like, oh, they&#8217;re so ski&#8230; Yeah, let&#8217;s give them a chance. But I feel like as a person of color, if you&#8217;re coming in as new, young and of color, it can be really hard for people to take you seriously. It can be so hard for people to take, you unless you have a bunch of awards behind your name. You, oh, I interned at Google, I interned at Facebook. I got into the center for the arts at my high school. I went to VCUarts and because I didn&#8217;t have those names, I didn&#8217;t start having many titles behind my name until a year or two ago, it made me feel like I didn&#8217;t have much of a space in the industry to give advice or to really just kind of be seen as a person in the industry. I was still like a student of the industry, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: That makes sense. I&#8217;ll tell you a secret, even, and this is just not only from people who I&#8217;ve had on the show, but also speaking from personal experience, even when you get to that level of having the awards and the accolades and all that stuff, guess what? People still don&#8217;t take you seriously. It doesn&#8217;t really get, I don&#8217;t want to say it doesn&#8217;t get that much better. You sort of have a little bit of an advantage depending on the communities that you&#8217;re speaking to. But I run into some of the same issues of credibility at this stage in my career as I did 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Why do you think that is? What issues of credibility come up? Like who would-</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I mean, how real can we get? I mean&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: For me, I started listening to this podcast when I started this job, actually before I started this. Every day when I was at the job that wasn&#8217;t for me, to be very frank, I was very unhappy. I would listen to this podcast Revision Path every day, I would go back and I would listen to all&#8230; Though, this is maybe like summer of 2017 because I felt so inspired by all of the individuals who looked like me who came from places like me, who, they almost seemed like, I was like, okay, they have these accolades and they have these medals, these badges, they are taken seriously in these spaces. Even when people spoke about their struggles of getting to where they were, they still got to where they were.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: So that pushed me and knowing that you&#8217;re the voice behind it, and knowing all&#8230; Of course we can list a bunch of things about Maurice Cherry and all the things that he&#8217;s done for the community in the task, I know you were on the task force many years ago, things like that [crosstalk 00:30:00] I met Jacinda. Jacinda was a really big part of pushing me back in like 2017 or 2016 so that community, right? I&#8217;m like, oh you guys made it, you are it. But to hear you say like, &#8220;ah no, we&#8217;re still trying.&#8221; It&#8217;s interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I might be telling some secrets here, but I feel like some of us, and I&#8217;m not speaking for everyone, some of us try to do a good job of obscuring that. I think from those that are coming up because we don&#8217;t want you to have that baggage. We don&#8217;t want you to come into it knowing like, oh, you can even still get this far and still run into issues because the hope is that the work that we&#8217;re doing clears the path, makes it easier for the next generation. I wouldn&#8217;t even say next generation. I mean it&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re that far apart, but I mean it makes the road easier by walking it. So that&#8217;s the hope, is to just not talk about all the negative stuff that happens and just try to focus on the more positive things to be that inspiration because it can be, there are still a lot of isms out there and I&#8217;m not just talking about the isms that have cropped up, I&#8217;d say even more vibrantly because of our current political system. But I mean racism is still very much a thing. Sexism is still very much a thing. Other isms-</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Ageism yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Homophobia, et cetera. Ageism, yes. Even location. I mean, I&#8217;m in Atlanta and I get so many sort of small microaggressions about being from the South. Or being in the South and doing tech and design-</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Like if I&#8217;m not in New York or if I&#8217;m not in an LA, these capitals?</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Where are you? What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah, yeah. It&#8217;s like, oh, Atlanta. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: But at least in Atlanta, I mean, sorry to change the subject a little bit, but Tyler Perry, the studio, I feel like, I don&#8217;t know, Atlanta is on the come up with a lot of things.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: It is on the come up of a lot of things. I think particularly as it relates to entertainment. I would even say as it relates to tech, but it certainly doesn&#8217;t get the same level of, I think-</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Respect.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Oh absolutely not. It doesn&#8217;t get the same level of respect at all as like what&#8217;s happening in California or what&#8217;s happening in New York, Georgia still, because you know what ends up happening, I mean Atlanta is still very much a blue dot in a red state if we&#8217;re talking politically. So there are political issues which crop up that will overshadow a lot of other good things that are happening here. Like for example, the abortion heartbeat bill from earlier this year, that came up and then people from Hollywood wanted to boycott Georgia, boycott Atlanta really. And Atlanta is, because we&#8217;re that like blue dot in the red state, we get the brunt of that. It&#8217;s very much a different world once you leave Atlanta in terms of being in Georgia. So to that effect there are a lot of things that happen here that oftentimes will just get overlooked because it doesn&#8217;t come in the, I guess in the right package. I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s an odd thing-</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: I mean and that sucks too because I&#8217;m still pretty young. I mean, it doesn&#8217;t even matter about age, but essentially I have time to go anywhere. I have time to explore everything. But when I think about, I&#8217;m like, okay, so where can I go? What&#8217;s next after this? DC is hot and happening. There&#8217;s always jobs, there&#8217;s always things going on. But do I want to live in DC forever? Probably not. Absolutely not. And I&#8217;m like, do I want to move back home to Richmond? Probably not. There&#8217;s no jobs. I don&#8217;t consider jobs there.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: And so then I&#8217;m like, oh, I don&#8217;t want to move to New York. I don&#8217;t want to be that girl. I don&#8217;t want to be that person right now. Who knows what&#8217;s going to happen in like two or three years. But when I think about Midwest and things like that, South, what&#8217;s happening in the South, you&#8217;re right. I mean other than Atlanta, because I think about different companies and things like that&#8217;s there. I don&#8217;t see myself in many other places and then it just puts me back on like, well, let me see what&#8217;s happening here in DC, which is unfortunate because I feel like there&#8217;s so many amazing things that each city can bring in terms of design life and culture.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. You have to really kind of work hard to make and carve out whatever that space looks like. I remember when I was 29, 30, I was really trying to move out of Atlanta hardcore. I was like, this is not working. My career has hit a plateau. Well, at that point, let&#8217;s say I was 29, 30, I had started my studio. I had just finished up this political campaign that I was working on and so things were kind of on an uptick, but I still felt like I was hitting a wall and I was like, I am not going to get better in my career until I leave and go to New York.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: So I had a friend of mine in New York who was sending me all these apartment listings and everything and I mean, long story short, I didn&#8217;t move to New York, but I ended up finding a way to make it work here, which is not to say that I gave up, but certainly I just couldn&#8217;t, I personally couldn&#8217;t see myself in New York. I mean I&#8217;m a Southern boy through and through. I know that about me and I mean I&#8217;ve visited New York a ton of times. New York is just, I wouldn&#8217;t vibe with the city. Like that&#8217;s just not how my whole, my energy would not vibe with New York. So I was like, I can&#8217;t do New York. I can visit, but I can&#8217;t live there.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Same. And I&#8217;m from New Jersey originally. All my family&#8217;s in New Jersey. And before that, Alabama. So, I mean, I never lived in Alabama, but my family has. And so I also am the same way about like the North. I&#8217;m like, no, thank you. But I think that that&#8217;s also another thing with being a mid level designer. You mentioned how you saw yourself somewhere and you tried to go for&#8230; So when you&#8217;re in the middle of it, I&#8217;m going to call it in the middle of it, you&#8217;re essentially looking at multiple roads in front of you and you&#8217;re like, my actions right now can affect where I am by the time I&#8217;m 30 or by the time I&#8217;m 35 and things like that. I just turned 24 so I&#8217;m always cautious and thinking of what&#8217;s going to happen if I do jump job, do find another&#8230; Should I try to work abroad for a few years like some of the other people you&#8217;ve interviewed?</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: I listened to some people who are moving to China and going to Germany, I&#8217;m like, maybe I should try, is that something I should try to do before I&#8217;m X amount of years old? Or maybe I should, I don&#8217;t have a family. I have no ties to anything. So I&#8217;m like, I should do this, or maybe I should do this. I&#8217;m looking at all of these different paths that I can take and it can sometimes be really overwhelming. And I think that&#8217;s the other part about being in the middle of your career because you&#8217;re not quite sure what can happen and what can change. And that&#8217;s with life in general, obviously, but it&#8217;s a bigger thing when you&#8217;re looking at like all of your idols and the people you look up to. You&#8217;re like, okay, I see that they made this decision, but what&#8217;s going to be right for me type thing so.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. And I think, I mean that involves a lot of introspection. It involves really sitting down with yourself and saying, or answering the question, what does success look like for me? What is the space? And this is.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: What is the space, and this is something that we actually explored at Black in Design this past weekend, but there was one of the things about how do we carve out a space for wellness and for joy. Because I mean certainly in America, I mean we black folks in America, we know what the deal is in terms of how we&#8217;re perceived by society, treated by society and law enforcement, incarceration, a number of different things that are set up to go against us as just basic human beings. Does that change if we move overseas? Maybe. I think certainly from the folks I&#8217;ve talked to on the show, it&#8217;s a trade off.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: You certainly gain some things, but you lose other things. I remember I was talking to Douglas Turner, I think he was episode 107 or something like that. He lived in Iceland for a number of years and he was talking about how the Icelandic society is very tribal in that, everyone kind of knows each other and he&#8217;s the only black man in Iceland.[laughter]</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: And saying how for him it didn&#8217;t feel like racism really existed there.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Which I thought was interesting considering he&#8217;d be one of the few people of color there. And then coming back to the States and seeing how it was different. Another interview with Qa&#8217;id Jacobs, who&#8217;s a UX designer in Amsterdam. Originally from, I think he&#8217;s from Jersey, New York. He&#8217;s originally from the Northeast U.S. But him and his family are in Amsterdam and we actually had a two part episode. The first part was, Hey, you know, you&#8217;re out there in Amsterdam, what&#8217;s it like working out there, et cetera. And then we recorded the second episode right after Trump was elected and it was a pretty heavy episode. I think it&#8217;s episode 179, but I remember cause it came right at the end of 2016. We had this conversation like, well do you think you would come back?</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Now given the state of how things are, what would that look like? And I know, now I&#8217;ve been talking to several people who are really seriously considering moving abroad; moving to another country; going to Ghana or going to.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Isaac Hayes, who I interviewed a couple of months ago, is in China right now with his family. A friend of mine right now is currently going through Thailand.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Just coworking. He says it&#8217;s like a black coworking space in Thailand in Chiang Mai.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: What? Where? How?</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I have a passport. [laughter] We can go. We need to make this happen. If we need to start doing Black Design ex-pac trips, we can make that happen. I think about that a lot as just the industry is changing, the wages that the world is changing and what does that mean for like our safety and our sanctity. Not just as practitioners of this craft in this industry, but just as people in this world. It&#8217;s heavy stuff. It&#8217;s a lot of heavy stuff cause especially when I think about what is it that is stopping black designers from becoming leaders of design? Clearly we&#8217;re out there and we&#8217;ve had a couple of them on the show, but it&#8217;s very few and far in between. Even even.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Oh no, I&#8217;m sorry, go ahead. No, go, keep going.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I was going to say even some of the projects that I&#8217;ve done, most recently, the literary anthology I did, Recognize, is about trying to set up what does the next generation look like because yeah, we have the big names now. And I&#8217;m not singling them out, but we have Debbie Millman, we have Stefan Seigmaster, Polisher. We have these big names, but they&#8217;re not going to live forever.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: No that&#8217;s.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: What does the next generation of design criticism, design thought, design leadership look like for this industry? Cause a lot of people from around the world do take their cues from what&#8217;s happening in design in America. So if we&#8217;re putting forth this monolithic, monocultural view of what design is based on the people that are practicing it, then where does that leave us?</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Right. And I think on that note, with who the next leaders are for me, my focus used to be so much on who&#8217;s already there. Right. I&#8217;m looking at, for me, some of my idols, Diane Holton, who I used to fangirl over all the time and now I work alongside her. We&#8217;re both on the same programming team for AIGA. When I was looking at these large names in my eyes, I&#8217;m like, well they&#8217;re already there. That&#8217;s when I switched my thought process a little bit to who&#8217;s alongside me. Who&#8217;s with me right now? Who&#8217;s doing amazing work? Who&#8217;s doing amazing things, who&#8217;s probably going to be the next big thing in terms of our industry. I don&#8217;t know if like you listen to this quote that Issa Ray, who I also stan. She said instead of networking up, network across.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: We just had our DC design week a few weeks ago and I was able to create a program; an event around my friend Bria Taylor. She does these amazing, she started out as a designer.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: She&#8217;s still a designer, but she designs these kick ass looking cakes. It&#8217;s called Killer Cakes and she is so talented to the point where I&#8217;m like you need to have your own show on TLC or something or wherever they&#8217;re doing the baking things nowadays. [laughter] I was using my leadership role at AIG. On our chapter board, I was able to create a program that sold out, oversold out actually around her speaking about her process, her story, what she does, and then selling had her make a little bit extra money by doing a pop up shop with brownies and cakes and things like that. And I was like, that&#8217;s what I feel like we mid level designers should be trying to do. Instead of step on each other.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Use each other to build each other up. Refer each other for projects that we can&#8217;t take instead of just letting the project fall through. Telling each other about, Hey Bria is having an event happening on Saturday, or Simone&#8217;s having an event tomorrow. Building a network within ourselves and then that eventually the eyes are going to start turning on us and it&#8217;s like, Oh these, this is what this person is doing in the industry. And then that&#8217;s when the shift happens. Some people still can have a competitive mindset of, Oh, I&#8217;m not going to tell you about this opportunity. Oh, I&#8217;m not going to tell you about this stuff. And then it can be even harder than what it already is. I had a friend recently tell me about the Add Color Conference.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. They&#8217;re like a conference and an award show.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Right. But there&#8217;s also an opportunity some type of fellowship opportunity. I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m going to say fellowship, but it&#8217;s a really cool opportunity for young people who are creatives to, or in the marketing. Some people worked at Facebook and things like that, who get mentored for a week gets to take these classes, gets to take back these it&#8217;s like workshopping and things like that. And then they get sponsored to go to the award show and meet some of the leaders in that industry and things like that. My friend could&#8217;ve kept it a secret and be like, Oh, I&#8217;m going to apply when that time comes. But she instead shared that information with me and was like, yeah, you should also do. I see you also in this space able to do that. And I think that type of mindset is important for where we are in our careers right now because it&#8217;s the only way that we&#8217;ll be seen.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: No, I agree. I think so there&#8217;s two examples when you talk about that networking across. One is this sort of, and sorry, I don&#8217;t know if anyone has written about this. This may be a free idea if there are any journalists that are listening, but over the past five years there&#8217;s been this emergence of are you familiar with the Brack Pack? Does that name sound familiar?</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: No, not at all.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: So the Brack Pack was a group of actors in the eighties and nineties that all ended up starring in the same similar types of movies as Molly Ringwald, Andrew McCarthy, Patrick Dempsey, Rob Lowe, some folks like this. They all were friends, but then they also were in all these movies together and stuff like that. The name sort of comes from the Rat Pack, which were a group of musicians in the 50s and 60s. Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Junior, Dean Martin, couple of other folks.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: But now I feel like there was this emergence of a black path in a way. Where it&#8217;s like Issa Ray, who you mentioned earlier. Melina Mitsui SKUs, Quinta Brunson. I&#8217;m thinking of people that have started on the web and have moved up into larger areas of media and they all work.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Together.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: With and across each other together in a really interesting way because you see them in each other&#8217;s projects and you&#8217;re like, okay, they&#8217;re working together. That sort of thing. I also see that honestly in the podcasting world too. Are you familiar with The Read?</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Yes, absolutely. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: So The Read, there&#8217;s a number of shows that are in the same orbit of The Read, but they&#8217;re all friends. There&#8217;s The Friend Zone with Hey Fran, Hey and Dustin and Asante. There&#8217;s Getting Grown with Jane and Kia. There&#8217;s Jade and XD, and they all are friends, but they all have their own separate shows and platforms. But they all cross pollinate [chuckle] with each other. And I&#8217;m like, that is so dope. I would love to see what a black sort of design collective of some sort will look like if we were doing that. [inaudible 00:48:34] What could we accomplish and put out in the world with that sort of thing?</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Right. I talk about that all the time with some of my friends. I have a friend in New York, Tavis Northam, who is a designer, director, photographer, and we are always collaborating on projects and then he came out with this indie short called Bakari about this runaway slave. And I created the poster for it. He&#8217;s always referring me all the time. I&#8217;m referring him. Same with, Oh man, it&#8217;s so funny. I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m printing your name, but some of my friends who actually went to Black and Design, I&#8217;m the same way with them and I think, that that emergence is already kind of happening. When you look on certain channels on Instagram, certain things popping up. People are creating a lot. There&#8217;s a lot of things like Well Read Black Girl. I don&#8217;t know if that</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Oh yeah, yeah, I&#8217;m familiar with that.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Things like that; platforms like that that are black creatives also on Instagram. Things that you can hashtag and tag. It&#8217;s a feed that you can kind of scroll through that is getting larger and larger by the month where you&#8217;re seeing people support each other. I gained a lot of my followers I think by my different hat. I always hashtag in on my art on Instagram and then I get people messaging me, deeming me, and all of a sudden I have a whole network of new friends who are enjoying the same things like type arts and things like that as I am. So yeah, I think that&#8217;s cool and it&#8217;s really important.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah, I would really like to see more of that; working together, collaborating on projects and things like that. I mean I even try to help out where I can. Certainly, for people who I&#8217;ve had on the show. If there is something they&#8217;re interested in, I try to make those connections. Sometimes they work. Sometimes they don&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: To be honest I&#8217;m not afraid. For a long time I would write notes from the PI. The different episodes that really inspired me and I would message, I would go on in LinkedIn or wherever they said at the end of the show to talk to them. I would message and be like, Hey, my name is Chanel. You really inspired me with this thing that you said. Just wanted to let you know that effected me. One girl who you interviewed, I think she was from Boston. Her name started with a D and I&#8217;m blanking on exactly what it was, but maybe last year I reached out to her on Instagram and we actually ended up becoming like, I&#8217;m not going to say friend friends, but like IgE friends and I would comment on her work and stuff like that. But she was, I think she was also my age. So I was super excited to hear her story and hear her process and hear how what she was able to do after school.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: In Boston? I&#8217;m trying to think who that is.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Okay. Boston. Maybe Connecticut? She [inaudible] but I don&#8217;t think she went to [inaudible].</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Oh! Daniqua Rambert her name.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Deniqua. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: She goes by Willow now, but yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Oh Okay. She definitely was a big inspiration to me and I think I caught her off guard when I messaged her. [laughter] I was like, hey girl. [laughter] I&#8217;m a fan! She was probably like, who is this girl? I mean, she seemed cool with it. I was cool with it. I know. [laughter].</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Nice. Well when you look at, I mean we&#8217;re coming up at not just the end of a year, but the end of a decade right now. What do you see yourself doing in the next five years? Like it&#8217;s 2025 what is Chanel James working on?</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Wow. Okay. So I definitely wrote out my five year plan.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Okay. [laughter].</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: This was actually on my five year plan. So Pat on the back for me for making a revision path. [laughter] I&#8217;d say I don&#8217;t ever say where I am because I don&#8217;t like jinxing it. I say how I feel and what I&#8217;m doing for other people. So I&#8217;m financially able to support myself and my family. Me and my parents. [chuckle] And I am continuing to create spaces for specifically black and brown youth to enter specifically the design realm; a creative space to encourage them to be creative and educating them on what design is and looks like. I think that&#8217;s my biggest hope for myself on these next couple of years. Especially entering the new decade is to introduce design as a possibility to more people; young people of color and older people of color. Because you can always switch careers and just create spaces where they able to be there, their fullest self.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Well just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and your work and everything online?</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: So I am on Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn and not Facebook. LinkedIn. You can find me on Instagram at Chanel Niari, C H A N E L N Y R E and on Twitter at Chanel_Niari and there&#8217;s also my website, chaneljames.com.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: All right, sounds good. Well Chanel James, I want to thank you for coming on the show and not just sharing your story, but also really for first of all, really illuminating conversation. I love being able to really talk and go into these sorts of issues around identity, and the industry, and motivation, and all that sort of stuff and I hope that others that listen to it will get inspired too. I feel like there&#8217;s a lot of folks that are in the middle, but the thing is the middle is very vast as we sort of discussed. It can be a few years in to a decade or more. There&#8217;s a big gap there where a lot of us are in the middle of it, as you put it earlier and I&#8217;m just really glad to be able to talk about these things with you. Glad you&#8217;re able to mark this off your five year plan. But this was really, really great. Thank you so much for coming on the show.</p>
<p><strong>Chanel James</strong>: Yeah, no, thanks for having me. And I encourage anyone to, if you felt inspired by this, to reach out. I&#8217;m always excited to chat and network with people. Let&#8217;s make this, what did you call it? Black Pack. [laughter] Let&#8217;s make it happen. Let&#8217;s make it real. So thanks so much for Maurice, for having me on the show.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a minute since we&#8217;ve had someone at Google on the show, so I was really excited to have the chance to interview Melissa Smith, a user experience researcher at Google working primarily on the YouTube mobile and desktop products.</p>
<p>We talked about how user experience research factors into her work, why it&#8217;s an important part of the design process, and talk about how she shifted from studying engineering towards her current work. There&#8217;s even a conversation about self-driving cars! It&#8217;s great knowing women like Melissa are at the forefront of helping make better experiences for all of us online!</p>
