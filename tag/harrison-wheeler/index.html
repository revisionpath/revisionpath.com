Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>If you&#8217;ve been a longtime listener of Revision Path, then you probably already recognize this week&#8217;s guest, Harrison Wheeler. Along with being a senior design manager at LinkedIn, he&#8217;s also a podcaster with his own show called Technically Speaking. (And I&#8217;ve been a guest twice!) </p>
<p>Our conversation started off with a peek into life at LinkedIn, and he talked about working and managing remotely, as well as about how he&#8217;s changed as a manager over the years. We also talked shop about podcasting, the metaverse, the future of design in business, and Harrison shared some of the best career advice he&#8217;s received. I love checking back in with guests and seeing just how they&#8217;ve grown over their career, and Harrison is proof that hard work and dedication pays off in the long run! </p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Hey, Maurice. My name is Harrison Wheeler. I am a senior prog design manager at LinkedIn, and I&#8217;m going on four and a half, five years. Time flies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Welcome back to the show, man. It&#8217;s good to have you back.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
I know. Yeah, we were just chatting beforehand. It&#8217;s been what, almost four or five years since I &#8230; No, it&#8217;s been longer than that. What I&#8217;m talking about, I&#8217;ve been at LinkedIn for, like I said, almost five years. So it&#8217;s almost been like seven years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. You were at Base when we last talked, which is now part of Zendesk, I believe.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But yeah, it&#8217;s been a while. So we definitely got a lot to catch up on in terms of your career and everything.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s funny. I&#8217;m trying to think. I think I might have been in Chicago or had just moved to California back when that was recorded.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You had just moved to California.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Oh, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2021 been for you? What did you learn about yourself over this past year?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Look, if 2020 was rough, so I think I&#8217;m a glass half full kind of person. So I will say that 2021 definitely felt like a bit of emergence out of that. Just looking back, I mean, a few things. And so I think really being unapologetic in terms of just turning things off and making time for myself. I think making time in the space for yourself is super important for that. I think, additionally, we all know this, but your voice matters. And I think probably it&#8217;s a bit of a reflection in terms of where I&#8217;ve grown and the position and the role that I have within my organization, within the design community. It&#8217;s important to have that voice and then also give back. Perspective is very important. And I will say many things have also accelerated within the last couple of years.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
And so when you think about how a lot of the workforce is now, like tele commuting, what sort of constraints does that create? Are we creating opportunities for people to get in? Are we also conscious of some of the effects of the work that we do? And so how can we bring more consciousness to the work that we&#8217;re doing, to the decisions that we&#8217;re making on a day to day basis?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I think really also with this past year, because &#8230; and I want to say this partially because of the vaccine in a way. It&#8217;s really thrown workplaces in general into a bit of a learning moment in a way. Because of course in 2020, when we didn&#8217;t have the vaccine, everything was like, we&#8217;re going to move to remote work, we&#8217;re going to do this. And then the vaccine comes and then offices are like, well, I guess maybe we can start going back. And then the variants come through and they&#8217;re like, well, maybe you should stay at home. There&#8217;s been this weird push, pull. Of course there&#8217;s been the creation of these hybrid schedules, but I still think companies are trying to figure out what they&#8217;re going to do next and they&#8217;re not doing well at that. But I think that&#8217;s to be expected because this is so unprecedented.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I&#8217;ve had a few thoughts on that. I&#8217;ve had an opportunity to at least exercise what the hybrid concept is like. And just reflecting, again, over the past couple of years, I think we&#8217;ve seen a lot of evolution, at least from a design perspective, the tools that we use. You have the online multiplayer, you&#8217;ve got tools like Loom where you can do asynchronous video recordings. Obviously Slack is a big part of it. Having soundboards or sound rooms as a way of communicating without necessarily needing to be on camera. I think the list really goes on in terms of how remote work has been optimized. But the moment that you step into an office, it is a relic of where we left off. And so there is a gap there.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
And so, one of the things that actually I&#8217;ve been thinking about is, how does this play a role in the design rituals that we have. Not necessarily from a remote perspective, but when we have folks in an office and then we have folks on camera. Because there are some really interesting nuances. Like, we&#8217;ve all had pretty good high fidelity cameras at home, but the moment you&#8217;re in an office, you now see someone in three dimensions. So maybe their voice sounds different, maybe the audio is a little bit distorted. Folks might not see what&#8217;s going on in the chat. Folks might be having side conversations. Some of these things aren&#8217;t new per se, but now we&#8217;ve got a more equitable type of situation that we need to be considerate of. And so, how can we build in process, practice? How can we ingrain it? I think for me, how do you think about that at scale? And so, there&#8217;s a software component, there&#8217;s a hardware component and then there&#8217;s also just the general human to human communication component. So yeah, it&#8217;s really interesting, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s funny now that I think about that, because when the pandemic really started, I was working for a company that was very much remote first. And they had an office and I had been to the office. I don&#8217;t even remember the last time I was in their office, maybe 2019 I think. But that was three or four jobs ago. Since then, now I&#8217;ve worked at a number of different companies in remote positions with people who I&#8217;ve never met, who I&#8217;ve had to work with oftentimes across very wide time zone births to try to get creative work done. And yeah, it&#8217;s a change, it&#8217;s a big change. And just trying to adjust to it, making sure you&#8217;re getting the best work out of people. Of course, I think, one, with being sensitive to just the general overall global issue that we&#8217;re going through with the pandemic. But also, it&#8217;s going to be a different kind of thing when you meet them in person. At the other places, I&#8217;ve not met a single one of my coworkers in person in over a year.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s truly fascinating, that social component. I think on the show, I don&#8217;t know if I had gone to this point yet, but a lot of the engineering team that I was working with was based in Poland. And so I think we hadn&#8217;t developed ways to communicate. Technology wasn&#8217;t there, so the ways to communicate were extremely difficult. So then you really had to see and visit somebody to understand their body language. But I think now, we&#8217;re so good at communicating with each other. I think seeing each other in the flesh it sort of like, oh, how do we compute this now?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;m running into that a bit now because the place where I currently work, we&#8217;re split between San Francisco and Paris. And so I&#8217;m working with Europeans in the morning, working with the US folks in the afternoon trying to &#8230; And it is all very much a sync. I mean, I&#8217;m right in the middle. So when I start my day at 9:00 AM, it&#8217;s the afternoon already in Paris and it&#8217;s still early morning in San Francisco. So I have to try to juggle how I work now based on that, because we&#8217;re not all on that same eight-hour block.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you think about 2022, are there any certain resolutions or goals that you have that you want to try to accomplish?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Oh, resolutions or goals. I would probably say I need to do a better job at taking a vacation. I&#8217;ve been saying that for a long time, but I think this past couple of years, I think from a mental health perspective, haven&#8217;t been easy. And I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s been easy for most folks. And so again, I think be able to create that time and space where you can reflect. You don&#8217;t need to, you can also be in the moment. You don&#8217;t have to necessarily reflect. But I think we need to just create the space. That&#8217;s how I recharge. I&#8217;m doing a lot of really awesome stuff with my podcast, Technically Speaking. So I&#8217;m looking forward to really expanding that. I know we&#8217;re going to get into that a little bit later. But I would also say like, move a little bit more. Really be conscious about getting movement in. I mean, I&#8217;m in meetings all day. And so going for that. Walk around the block, heading on the bike, lifting some weights. In some way, shape or form, committing to that every day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I want a vacation. Well, I think I need one certainly, because the last time I was really out on a plane somewhere was February 2020. I just haven&#8217;t went anywhere because of the pandemic. But now it&#8217;s, I&#8217;m feeling it now. I need to disconnect on a beach in another country somewhere like nobody&#8217;s business.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
You&#8217;re in the hub, man. I think you can fly anywhere in the world from Atlanta.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s true. I&#8217;ve just been wary of it because &#8230; I mean, you&#8217;ve been seeing all this stuff with people fighting on planes and stuff. I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m not trying [crosstalk 00:12:33]. I&#8217;m not trying to get caught up somewhere having to try to go somewhere. But we can&#8217;t because back in 25B, they&#8217;re [dooking 00:12:41] it out. Like, come on, you&#8217;re holding up everybody. We are all trying to get somewhere.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
I mean, this is a sad state of affairs. But it&#8217;s sad when airlines have to take away the alcohol because folks can&#8217;t handle themselves in the air.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wait, have they taken away the alcohol on planes for real?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. I think now, probably around mid-December, early January, I think some airlines are looking at bringing it back. But yeah. Folks were getting lit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh my God. Wow. I didn&#8217;t know it was that bad. Geez.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hopefully we can get it together, but I don&#8217;t know. Humanity has been &#8230; it&#8217;s been a very interesting experiment of humanity over this past year or so. Just seeing how folks have acted, especially with these vaccines. We&#8217;re not going to make this political, getting into it, but it&#8217;s been a lot. So yeah. When you were last on the show, which as we talked about was way back on episode 140, you were at Base, which is now part of Zendesk. And since then, you&#8217;ve went on to LinkedIn where now you are a senior design manager. What has your time at LinkedIn been like.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Wow. Yeah, this is great. I love reflecting on this. So I mean, look, I want to maybe touch on &#8230; maybe we can give a brief overview of what Base was. Because I think a lot of times I get a lot of questions in terms of, what attracted you to LinkedIn? And I also get questioned around, yo, it&#8217;s been five years. And tech speak, five years, man, you&#8217;re an OG at that point because the average length of folks is usually around two years at a job. And that number is probably going down over time. I mean, we see that there are so many opportunities out in the market these days. But when I started at Base, I was a manager for basically a 300-person startup. And so my design team at the time was around five directs on the product side, one on marketing. And then I reported up directly into the CEO and then eventually the chief of product.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
And so I think for me, that was an amazing experience. I got to really build something from zero to one. I got to experience what growth looked like. Had some really amazing experiences being able to go to Europe and create lasting connections with folks back on that project. I think for me when I was looking &#8230; And I wasn&#8217;t even looking, to be honest, Maurice. I think I&#8217;d probably taken a moment to sit down and understand, what is the general experience that I want to have? And I think for me, I was pretty simple. I want to be able to have impact in the organization on the product and eventually grow a team. But most importantly, I wanted to have the support to grow as a manager. I didn&#8217;t really have the tools, in my opinion, to lead with confidence. And I will say that what attracted me was the fact that there was a good amount of folks that were experienced and seasoned from a managerial perspective. The company had a lot of amazing programs to help foster that connection.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
And on top of that, there were folks that I&#8217;ve been able to meet that have also played a big role in my development. And of course, I&#8217;ve had some awesome coworkers. I think in terms of the opportunity, so right now the team I&#8217;m on is called LinkedIn marketing solutions. And so if you aren&#8217;t familiar with our enterprise products, there&#8217;s obviously the flagship product that most folks on LinkedIn are on. It&#8217;s where you post, that&#8217;s where you see jobs, you&#8217;ve got the feed. And then we have really four different product areas. Sales navigator, so that&#8217;s usually for sales folks. We have LinkedIn talent solutions for our recruiters. And sometimes you might get those inboxes from recruiters trying to hit you up for a new gig. We&#8217;ve got LinkedIn learning and then we got LinkedIn marketing solutions. And so LinkedIn marketing solutions is really our ad platform and one of the fastest growing lines of &#8230; actually, I think it is the fastest growing line of business at LinkedIn.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
And so for me, I have had an experience very similar to a startup because we&#8217;ve seen a lot of growth in terms of folks using our product. A lot of growth in terms of the team growing. And also, the acceleration of our experiences from a maturity perspective. I think going in, LinkedIn was around 15 years old. So I think most people would be like, oh, man, that company is old, 15 years. But over the past four years that I&#8217;ve been there, we&#8217;ve invested a lot. And honestly, it&#8217;s evolved like night and day. It&#8217;s been really fun to be a part of that ride, because I know that I&#8217;ve had some part in doing that. Being able to have that impact for me and seeing that growth was really core to my decision-making there.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
And look, I mean, when you&#8217;re in the tech game, I think it&#8217;s important to understand really &#8230; on top of the work, understand what are the things that are going to help bring value to your life. We all know that over the past two years, if you&#8217;re working in tech, going into the office, not having benefits, not being able to focus on your physical and mental health as a part of that package, you know there&#8217;s somebody out there offering better. Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the beauty of the situation right now. And for me, I can confidently say there&#8217;s not really too many companies that would offer support in that way any better than LinkedIn. And so honestly, that&#8217;s really kept me around.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I mean, you came on at the time &#8230; I think it might have been right around the time that LinkedIn was bought by Microsoft.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah. So I came in actually a little bit after that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
But I believe the acquisition had happened earlier that year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So even with that, I mean, you&#8217;ve got that big tech juggernaut behind LinkedIn. So I&#8217;m sure that in terms of just like, I think one job security, but two also just the &#8230; Like you said, if you&#8217;re in the Bay, probably just if you&#8217;re in tech in general, you&#8217;re always looking to try to level up. I mean, that&#8217;s a great place to do so.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
100%.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Can you talk a bit about what you do as a senior design manager?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah. I get a lot of questions around, what does IC growth look like? What does a manager growth look like? And so, as I mentioned before on my team, I have eight designers &#8230; excuse me, seven designers, one manager. And then soon I&#8217;ve got two roles opening up. So for folks listening and you&#8217;re interested, definitely check out the job listings. But it&#8217;s really interesting because I think a lot of times when you think about managers, the people side of things. But honestly, for me, I think about, how can we create an organization that is really based on outcomes around how we approach design? And so a lot of that is making sure that my team has a time and space to thoroughly think through their problem space. I&#8217;ll give you an example of a few initiatives that I generally work on.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
So number one, we&#8217;re working really hard in terms of trying to really double down and protect our design rituals. And that&#8217;s from our weekly standups to our feedback. How can we give better feedback? How can we provide even safer spaces for feedback? How can we make sure the process is inclusive for everyone on the team to have a voice and be able to scale that in different areas? How are we thinking about what growth paths on the team look like? How can we be consistent in terms of creating expectations? How can we create different opportunities and modules for designers to have a better understanding about the situations that they&#8217;re in? So as they have the autonomy to really start to lead projects, they&#8217;re equipped with the proper tools to have the right conversations to be able to say no, and also understand when to prioritize.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
And so those are just a few of them. Obviously, there&#8217;s the planning side of things, there&#8217;s the performance review side of things. But ultimately, how can we also think about having more of a thoughtfulness in terms of thinking horizontally? So as I mentioned before, we&#8217;ve got the flagship experience, we&#8217;ve got these four other enterprise experiences. How can we bring some of that goodness or how can we bring in some of the initiatives that they&#8217;re working on into some of the things that we&#8217;re trying to achieve. And so a lot of that is honestly, I think, fairly similar regardless of the size, the organization that you&#8217;re at. I will say, LinkedIn, being that it is about an 18-year-old company now, there&#8217;s around 13,000 employees globally. There&#8217;s a little bit more conversations that you&#8217;ll have to have, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s any different from most organizations this size.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so, with the team make up like it is, I mean, do you get a chance to really work one-on-one with designers or are you mostly working more with upper management and leadership?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Honestly, it really is a mix. At least for my designers that are my reports, we do have our one-on-ones. So we do have an opportunity to go through individual designs. We do have opportunities to really think about what growth looks like. As I mentioned before, we have rituals that I always attend. So if I can, at least. And so that is our design reviews, our standups. Those are the things that I really try to do. I try my best to make sure that our team is equipped, like I said, to be autonomous, to be able to work with their teams. Because I am not able to be in every single situation. Also, my manager isn&#8217;t available to be in every single situation all the time as well.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
So there&#8217;s a bit of that. There&#8217;s a lot of back and forth at least from a leadership perspective as well. And so, we have a growing design organization. We need to also understand at least as a manager too, that whether it&#8217;s coming from product or inch, that we&#8217;re not only managing down to the team, but also managing up and giving our executive team visibility. We might be working on vision work and so I might be a little bit more involved there working with other VPs or directors involved in that as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, speaking of design management, when we had you on the show back in 2016, you were a design manager at Base.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you say you&#8217;ve grown as a design manager since then? I mean, is it different in this larger organization or what&#8217;s changed?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, 1000%, I&#8217;m a totally different manager than I was back then. There are times where I&#8217;m like, if I could take situations back in the day and pair it with what I know now, I guarantee you the outcomes would be totally different. And so I think a lot of times when I started out is like, you&#8217;d read all the books or you have this idea of what a manager is supposed to do and you try to be like. Or at least for me, I can&#8217;t speak for other folks. I had this misnomer that I had to be right. That I had to know what I was doing. That it was important that people knew that I knew what I was doing, when that was not the case.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
And I think really coming to terms with like, hey, I have no idea how this is going to turn out, I think for me became pretty transformational. And then I had a moment too where I had an opportunity to have a professional coach, shout out to Brooks. He was actually on one of my episodes on Technically Speaking. But the sessions that I had with him really changed, honestly, my mindset on being a manager. And a lot of it really came down to understanding when to have conversations and how to have those conversations. A lot of what we do as designers really comes down to communication. And sometimes it might not be comfortable, it might be uncomfortable. But usually when you do feel that, you&#8217;re usually at a crossroad. There is a decision that needs to be made. And on the other side of it, it&#8217;s going to be beneficial no matter what.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). And I would say, it sounds like you at least had that &#8230; and I&#8217;m not saying you didn&#8217;t have this at Base, but it certainly sounds like you&#8217;ve had support to grow at as a manager while you&#8217;ve been at LinkedIn. You haven&#8217;t just been winging it. I say that to say, I&#8217;ve been in design management situations where it was very clear I was winging it. The company was not really trying to offer any support in that area. But these were startups, it&#8217;s not an established company like LinkedIn. But it sounds like they are invested in your growth as a design manager.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, 100%. And I think one thing, you asked what I do on the day to day. But there are definitely things that I look at in terms of, how can we evolve as an organization? And so those are things that we&#8217;re constantly chipping away. And I think having that north star and being able to have your team align on that, I think does help quite a bit in terms of making sound and constructive conversations and decisions as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, have you encountered any other black design managers while you&#8217;ve been &#8230; not necessarily at LinkedIn, but just in your career in general?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
You mean as far as being my manager, or?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Just in general.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
In general. Honestly, I will probably say, not since I&#8217;ve been at LinkedIn. How should I phrase this? I will say that there are a few that I&#8217;ve known and heard of from afar, but I will say I haven&#8217;t been able to personally meet any until I was at LinkedIn. And we&#8217;ve seen really a lot of growth in terms of representation as far as black folks go at the manager level. And so I think that&#8217;s been really, really special. Because I think for me, it just felt really inaccessible in terms of meeting other black design managers. And so now to have that presence where I work, I think is extremely special to me. Because I always think about, the first manager that I&#8217;ve had technically was my mom because my mom had hired me to do web design at the elementary school that she worked with. And so I always tell people, my mom was the first black manager that I directly had. And I think what was really interesting, the lesson in that for me was, I was able to reflect on this.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
I was like, my mom literally advocated for me in terms of making a budget. And then on top of that, she gave me the space to grow. It&#8217;s funny when you think about the lessons in some of these areas in your life that you don&#8217;t really think of until you are a lot older. And so I don&#8217;t know. That for me was really groundbreaking. Because I think in the discussion that we had in terms of that growth piece, you mentioned something around black designers need to have the opportunity to fail. And I think it&#8217;s so important to have representation as a black designer, as a black design manager, because now you can actually discuss these things. You can fail, you can have mentorship within your organization. And we all know this, that the representation numbers are extremely low. I think it&#8217;s really special when you can have a community like that to support along the way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, it&#8217;s interesting. Even as I&#8217;ve done this show over the years and I&#8217;ve talked to people from other organizations and such, it&#8217;s still pretty fragmented when you think about other black design managers or even just &#8230; Someone had asked me, oh, is there a professional group of black designers that I can join? And I was like, well, not really. I mean, you could join the organization. And I have to preface this because I don&#8217;t want anyone from OBD coming after me. But look, I&#8217;m not saying the Organization of Black Designers is not doing great things. What I am saying is that for current black designers that are in the industry, they do not know that you exists. So I can mention, like for example, I can say AIGA. Or if you are regional, I can say, well, there&#8217;s Bay Area Black Designers or there&#8217;s I think Black Design Seattle, I think is what it&#8217;s called or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There are some regional groups, but a national organization kind of thing. It&#8217;s still pretty fragmented. I mean, there are shows like mine and shows like yours, which of course we&#8217;ll get into, that I think do a good job of highlighting who we are and what we&#8217;re doing out here. But it&#8217;s still, for I think the average designer, it still is pretty hard to find that community.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah, it is. It is. Yeah. And I will say it&#8217;s probably even more complex given how fragmented it is. It&#8217;s actually even harder to find, as you mentioned, because consistency is key. And so even over the past couple of years, I&#8217;ve seen things pop up, but then really quiet down. And so it&#8217;s not only finding the group, but it&#8217;s making sure that it&#8217;s active. Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Absolutely. I&#8217;ve certainly run into a few that have been in that same fashion. They start up one way and then it just dies out. It&#8217;s a marathon, it&#8217;s not a sprint. It takes a lot to keep those things going. So then just in terms of initiatives and things, are there any particular initiatives that you&#8217;re involved in at LinkedIn?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
It&#8217;s real funny because I go back to &#8230; I was thinking or reflecting on the first episode that we had. I think for me being a black designer in tech, it felt like a sense of accomplishment. I mean, it definitely was. Coming from the Midwest, really trudging along and just taking risks, not knowing what&#8217;s on the other side and not necessarily having those perspectives. I think it was definitely something to celebrate and to be able to do this. But I think that quickly went away because at the end of the day you&#8217;re still one of, who knows? Hundreds, thousands in an organization.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
And so in the moments around Trayvon Martin. And it was tough, it was very isolating. And I think not having a community to be able to go to or at least just talk it out, I thought was, I don&#8217;t know, it was very isolating. And so I think moving into LinkedIn, I didn&#8217;t want to go through that again. I&#8217;ll put it like that. You know who Renee Reid is? Shout out to Renee Reid.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. Tech Wrap Queen, of course.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah. Tech Wrap Queen, check it out. So we actually joined LinkedIn actually the same year. So myself, her and George Hay, shout out to George, we actually got together and we were like, we should put something on. We should try and create some representation within the organization. We should also have some external representation to let folks know that we&#8217;re here. And so we started with a lot of small things. I remember Renee was really passionate about having a week during Black History where the cafeteria served food from all over the African diaspora. And by the way, LinkedIn, I mean, we don&#8217;t have cafeterias right now because it&#8217;s kind of &#8230; Well, we do, but it&#8217;s not operating in the same capacity. LinkedIn has some bomb food. I think if you&#8217;re ever in the Bay Area, if you ask somebody which tech company has the best food, LinkedIn is definitely up there nine times out of 10.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
And so what they cook tastes pretty good. We got together and designed the LinkedIn [nberg 00:33:15], that&#8217;s the LinkedIn logo. I designed that with the kente pattern and we got those printed. And so whenever LinkedIn showed up, we showed up for sure. AfroTech, we came in deep with the kente cloth pattern and people were like, this is what LinkedIn is about. And one of the most amazing things about it is that it resonated with black folks all over the country. But LinkedIn has global offices around the world. So we had folks down in Brazil repping the LinkedIn kente nberg. So I think it was really great to see that movement. And then we had a little bit of a coming out party about three years ago during the week of AfroTech, the second week of AfroTech, where we had designers come to LinkedIn. And we just chuffed it out.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
We had a panel with research and design and we basically called that black by design. That was really a big moment for us. And it was great because we got to show people what design was like. Inside LinkedIn, people had an opportunity to see what we look like and what we were talking about. And there was a relational piece to it. And then we also eventually made hires from some of the folks that attended. And so here we are, we&#8217;re strong. I think 15 plus folks, it might be even more, but we started out being only three of us. And so it&#8217;s been really great to see that evolve over time. And over the past year, we&#8217;ve been doing a lot to really organize and really keep it growing. Because obviously we want this to keep growing, whether we&#8217;re at LinkedIn or when we move on. They call that the next play.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
And so we have really three pillars that we focus on. So we got a set of folks working on growth and retention. And so that&#8217;s really around, how can we keep folks in? How can we provide opportunities for people to grow outside of their traditional day to day job? We have another pillar called brand building and community. So that&#8217;s when we go out and we have these happy hours. So when we show up to events like AfroTech, this is when we have an opportunity to really be able to not only push some of the amazing initiatives that LinkedIn is doing, but also elevate the folks within the group to the community. And then we have a third pillar called product experience.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
And so actually a couple of weeks ago, we had a presentation around company pages that we invited black creative businesses to join. And so how can we elevate our products to benefit the black community and also learn about how people are using them, and bring that feedback directly into the product. So it&#8217;s been really fun to see that evolve. Really be able to create a space for our members to be able to kick back, talk about anything and everything, and go live in the Slack channel. So it&#8217;s been really great to see that evolution over time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I would say this is a testament probably to the longevity and the structure of LinkedIn, that you are able to have such a robust employee resource group like that, that will allow you to do things that directly touch the brand. A different version of the logo. I mean, that&#8217;s a lot just in and of itself because that&#8217;s something that goes out globally, like you said, across LinkedIn in a number of different countries.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah. Look, I will say, I mean, it&#8217;s been a journey, but definitely shout out to the exec team that supports us. We have two executive sponsors. I&#8217;ve had an opportunity to talk with other folks within the company that have been super supportive and be willing to work with us and iterate as we go. And I think with that kind of mentality, that&#8217;s extremely empowering in allowing really that expression to be able to happen. And so it&#8217;s really been, honestly for me, I&#8217;m humbled. I&#8217;m honored to really be able to be a part of creating that platform where &#8230; I was thinking of this. To some folks, this is their first experience in tech. I mean, that&#8217;s mind blowing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, switching gears here. Of course, we&#8217;ve mentioned before about your podcast, Technically Speaking. Which is one big thing that&#8217;s changed since you were last on the show, is you do podcasting now too. So why don&#8217;t you tell the folks here about your show and what it&#8217;s about?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, look, man, I mean, I kind of touched on this a little bit earlier, I think. We both touched on this. I think the representation in the industry for black folks is fairly small. Still small. Very small. I shouldn&#8217;t even say fairly small. And I think what&#8217;s important is like, I think a lot of times when we tend to see each other, we always ask, what&#8217;s your story? How did you get to where you are? I think at least in the product design space, I thought that was extremely important to really be able to provide a platform for. I&#8217;ve been considering this for a while, but I honestly think a lot of the events from last year really was a bit of a catalyst to move that forward.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
And so to be honest with you, I didn&#8217;t think I could do a podcast. I think I&#8217;d asked people so many questions on how to do it and I for sure was procrastinating much of the time. But yeah, I went ahead and did it. And honestly, it&#8217;s been a game changer for me to be able to meet so many people and have many different perspectives. As much of a tool as it is for folks that are listening for them to learn, it&#8217;s been a tool for me to also learn about their stories. I think the production element of the podcast is also another area that I&#8217;m always striving to improve and learn on and iterate. But yeah, I think &#8230; let&#8217;s see, I mean, we&#8217;re about a year and a half in, almost 10,000 downloads throughout the lifetime, within a year and a half, which I think is a huge milestone. And I think we&#8217;ve recorded around 38 episodes.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
So yeah, man, it&#8217;s been fun. And look, you&#8217;ve been an inspiration along that journey as well. I think we&#8217;ve mentioned this on the episodes, but it really meant a lot to have you on the show, especially during San Francisco Design Week. Because I can remember when we were chopping up before the show, I was like, man, we got to get you out here and do something. So we still need to do something live at some point, but that&#8217;ll be post pandemic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What has podcasting really taught you? I mean, you mentioned the thing about people being able to tell their own stories, but have you gained any personal insight from doing this?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah. I think some of the personal insight, again, it&#8217;s like this weird perfectionism thing. Some of it I&#8217;ll also go into where I was coming in the Base. When I was going in my last job, it was definitely a career pivot for me. Moving from a more graphic design oriented web design career into product design. And so I didn&#8217;t really have the vernacular to be able to express design concepts, research concepts, et cetera. And I think for me, I have this idea of what an archetype of a designer was. And honestly, that could really go to hell at this point in time because there isn&#8217;t an ideal archetype for a designer. And I think a lot of the folks that are on the show are at a point where they&#8217;re having the same kind of realizations.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
But I think you&#8217;re seeing this evolution where people are really starting to prioritize their own ideals and beliefs, which I think has really been &#8230; I think to be able to have folks that have been in the industry for a while, but then on top of that to see that as the starting point for the younger generation, I think is an amazing learning. And I&#8217;m super hopeful that that can transform a lot of how we think about the folks in the industry who we&#8217;re solving for. And understanding that some of the things that we&#8217;ve perpetuated for years and years are extremely toxic and we need to move past that. But we also need to evolve in a way. We need to have these discussions, whether it be to tear it all down, whether it be to reform some of these things. But we need to be having these discussions followed up by action. And I think a lot of these storylines can really help people understand what that angle is in terms of moving in that direction.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well said. Well said. I mean, podcasting for me, I think, has been something really which has given me a deep level of, not just introspection into people&#8217;s processes, but also how they come to the decisions that they do in terms of their career and the work that they do and everything like that. Have you found that there&#8217;s been a bit of a common thread among your guests?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
No. I think there are some folks that have definitely done the linear approach. I think there are some folks that have figured it out along the way and had a very meandering path. And so I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s important. There&#8217;s not one way to do things. Did that answer your question?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, absolutely. It did. Now, you talked about LinkedIn and even venturing onto these different spaces, like you&#8217;ve mentioned with black and design. And one thing that LinkedIn did recently was that they participated in AfroTech world, which was like a metaverse essentially. It&#8217;s like a conference in the metaverse. Now, I know you told me that you didn&#8217;t get a chance to attend that, but what did you hear back from how that experience was?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah. This was the second year that AfroTech had done the metaverse thing. So for folks that aren&#8217;t familiar, AfroTech world is a conference. I think they had 10,000 folks buy tickets, I think 7,000 showed up. But it&#8217;s a global conference where folks talk about a lot of different topics around technology, design, engineering, product management, venture capital, all that. And so the experience is in a virtual world and so you could basically dress up your avatar, you could network with folks, you could have one-on-one meetings on a beach, in a jet ski, on a boat. It&#8217;s whatever you want to make it. And so I think a lot of folks were excited at the concept because you could have folks have an experience together without physically being in the same place. I think definitely it is just novel. It&#8217;s great to see it at a very large scale. I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m super curious to see how it&#8217;s going to evolve over time. Were there some other conferences doing something in the metaverse as well?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I went to one last week. And for people that are recording, we&#8217;re recording this early December. But I went to one at the beginning of December from this company called Tech Circus that was called Enter the Metaverse. And they had an online component, but you could also, I think, attend inside the metaverse that they set up for the conference. And so there were all these panels about just all the different things dealing with the metaverse. The economy, virtual wellbeing, real estate. The founder for Second Life was there and he gave a really great presentation. There was this guy, I think he works for Microsoft in Berlin, and he gave this really just overarching talk about, these are the things we need to think about when we talk about the metaverse. And it&#8217;s given me so much to think about with like, there&#8217;s all this talk about how the metaverse is going to be the future of the internet and the future of the workplace. But then hearing people talk about it in this conference, seeing the reality that the current metaverse is. First of all, there&#8217;s no one metaverse, there&#8217;s multiple metaverses. And-</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Metaverses. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Metaverses. The multi-metaverse, I guess. But there&#8217;s dozens to hundreds of them and that we&#8217;ve actually already experienced some versions of metaverses, even though they haven&#8217;t been called that. And the one that they pointed to most that got me was Foursquare. So Foursquare circa 2010. Because what it was is that you had this information layer of data layered on top of real world maps and things like that. You could get these badges that were not really NFTs but were because they could really only belong to one person or certain people. And it&#8217;s interesting when you think about the concept of Foursquare badges.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They&#8217;re kind of like these prototypes of what NFTs are in a way. Because for this metaverse conference I went to, they were like, oh, everyone gets a free NFT. And I was like, what do I do with that? They sent me an email like, here is how you claim your NFT. Okay, and do what with it? But the NFT was issued. They issued it through something called a POAP, P-O-A-P, proof of attendance protocol. And so it essentially was a badge that said you attended this conference at this time. And I&#8217;m like, oh, I can&#8217;t do anything with this.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s, I guess, good to have. They were like, oh, well, you can connect it to your blockchain wall. And then they just lost me after that. I was like, I don&#8217;t know what to do with it after that. But-</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Look, I will say this, I&#8217;ve been dabbling into it. So I think what&#8217;s really interesting about this is, for one, the Foursquare thing really blows my mind, but it totally makes sense in a way. And I think if you&#8217;re going to learn about the metaverse, you should understand how the blockchain plays a role in it, where the NFT plays a role in terms of maybe something that you get to keep that identifies that you were there or not. I think it&#8217;s all extremely fascinating and it seems like even I haven&#8217;t heard of it, like the proof of attendance. But even that is super fascinating. Because now you can think of, I always think about it like this. It&#8217;s like when we were growing up, if we went to a basketball game or we went to a concert, we had a paper ticket, we might frame it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
And now everything is like a digital thing on your iPhone or your Android device, and you can&#8217;t really do anything with that. And so I think nowadays it&#8217;s like, huh, if I go to a concert, I have a token or I have an NFT from it. And maybe if that&#8217;s tied to Ethereum or whatever digital coin, then that can be valued over time. I think it&#8217;s really interesting that you&#8217;ve got this economy. It really adds another layer to like, hey, who are you? Oh, I&#8217;m famous on the internet. Because yeah, we were talking about this before, you got people that can make $300,000 in a week, millions in a month just selling NFTs online. Never do a gallery show. Not in a museum. I think it&#8217;s super fascinating.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The other part that&#8217;s super fascinating too is, for many people, the entry point into the metaverse are NFTs, like we&#8217;ve mentioned. But what I saw from this conference with there being these multiple metaverses is that there&#8217;s a huge problem with interoperability. So there&#8217;s all these metaverses. But if you buy NFT, for example, and it&#8217;s locked to a particular metaverse, you can&#8217;t necessarily &#8230; Or it&#8217;s minted with a certain metaverse, I guess that&#8217;s the terminology. But you can&#8217;t use it with another metaverse. And they were like, oh yeah, it&#8217;s like if you go to Foot Locker and buy shoes, but you can only wear them in the store. And so they&#8217;re thinking of like, well, what are ways that we can tie some intrinsic, real world value to an NFT to make it more of a lucrative thing?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I mean, this conference touched on land ownership in the metaverse, it touched on things about digital wellbeing, cultural appropriation. Because one thing with being in the metaverse is that you&#8217;re represented by an avatar. But these avatars, well, of course we&#8217;ll, I think just like regular avatars that we see in terms of profile pictures and things, are not wholly representative of the diversity of body size and gender expression and race and ethnicity. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And what I saw from looking at all this was like, oh, this is a huge opportunity for POC designers or particularly black designers to really try to get in on the ground floor of this and find a way to carve a niche in. Because I could easily see how we could get left behind in some digital divide sort of way. I mean, the fact that Facebook has renamed itself to meta, to subconsciously &#8230; And that was the other thing that I thought was great. Is that everyone on the entire conference was just shitting on Facebook. They were just like, what meta is doing is insidious. Because people are going to think metaverse and think that Facebook is the-</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Brand association.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Brand association. They&#8217;re going to think that they are the company that is the underpinning of the entire metaverse, when that is not the case. And the other thing about how even experiencing the metaverse is not something that you necessarily have to do through a $300 VR headset or something like that. So it was such an interesting conference. I&#8217;m going to have to go back and listen to some of the different talks from it. Because it really got me to thinking about, well, what is our place going to be in this new internet or whatever that they&#8217;re trying to call it. Because another portion of this was, how do we make sure we don&#8217;t carry over the issues from the current internet into the metaverse in terms of trolling and all of that sort of stuff. People don&#8217;t have any of this stuff figured out.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
By a long shot. And the actual infrastructure for it can&#8217;t even support everyone like the internet can largely support people. Maybe hundreds of users per server. Some workplace metaverse situations can maybe only support about two dozen people. It&#8217;s not a revolutionary thing, by far.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But people are throwing enough money at it that it almost feels like it&#8217;s a possibility. It reminded me a bit of the Million Dollar Homepage during this one particular talk. And for people that are listing that don&#8217;t know, back in the day, there was &#8230; Actually, I think the Million Dollar Homepage is still up. You went to this site and people basically bought pixels to be represented on the page. I think it was like a dollar per pixel. And so the goal, I guess, of it was to have a webpage that was worth a million dollars. But there were people in one of the talks that were buying up plots of land in a metaverse for thousands of dollars. This one person bought a 300 square meter plot of land for $10,000 in one of the talks. And I was just like, what are you going to do with that?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You just had $10,000 sitting around one afternoon in the metaverse like, you know what? I&#8217;m just going to buy this plot of land. What are you going to put on it?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who can visit it? It&#8217;s abstract in that way where you&#8217;re like, this doesn&#8217;t make any sense. But there are so many smaller companies that are trying to get in on this before the &#8220;brands&#8221; get in on it. I.E, a Facebook/meta.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Well, I think Nike or Adidas actually, they&#8217;re launching their own concept of a metaverse. So it&#8217;s already starting to happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s already starting to happen. And it&#8217;s definitely at a point where, like I said, I can feel like we could be left behind in that. So I don&#8217;t know. One thing that I&#8217;m going to try to do this year on the show is bring on some designers that are doing NFTs, just to try to get the audience that listens to the show up on like, what is it and how can we get involved? Because I see it. I was in this conference and I was just like, I can see the future and we could very easily be left behind. Because the fervor around the metaverse reminded me so much of late &#8217;90s, early 2000s internet. Before internet advertising really became a big thing and companies trying to figure out, well, how can I conduct business on the internet?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now it&#8217;s like, how can I conduct business on the metaverse? The same conversations, you just swap out internet for metaverse. How are we going to work on the internet? Email, what is that? Now it&#8217;s like, how are we going to work on the metaverse? It&#8217;s the same conversation, different times. And I&#8217;m just like &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if anyone&#8217;s seen it, but there&#8217;s this old clip of Bryant Gumbel talk from the Today Show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I know the exactly one you&#8217;re talking. It&#8217;s Bryant Gumbel and Katie Couric pontificating about email or something.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s going to be this episode. What is web 3.0 in NFTs, in blockchain, and all of that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
I hope there are entry points where the barriers aren&#8217;t as expensive as it is right now. Because I think for me, I&#8217;ve been dabbling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve been trying to explore, how do you get an NFT project off the ground? I&#8217;ve bought a few NFTs myself. And for anybody that has bought an NFT, having to do the wallet thing and then the gas fees, it&#8217;s not cheap. And so-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
&#8230; to even get in the game to play, I think it still requires a decent amount of capital to really participate. So I hope there&#8217;s a bit more development, like you said, and ways for folks to get involved before the massive wave that folks are talking about actually happens.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I think it will happen. Because honestly, again, thinking back to early 2000s, one of the things about, well, how are people really going to get onto the internet? Oh, well, you can use a personal computer. So people were thinking about things like that. But then there were also any different number of web enabled. Like smartphone devices, you had BlackBerries, you had Treos, you had Palm. I&#8217;m really dating myself now. But you had all these personal things that were like, oh, we can get on the internet. And on this little device that&#8217;s in the palm of my hand. Things like that. So, oh, man.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
The World Wide Web. I think we were still calling it the World Wide Web back then.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. We very much were still calling it the World Wide Web. So it&#8217;s happening. It&#8217;s happening, but-</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
It&#8217;s the meta wide verse.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And speaking of web 3, I think that&#8217;s another thing. Because back then, this conversation was happening around the time prior to web 2.0, because web 1.0 hadn&#8217;t really been named as such. But web 2.0 really came about with the advent of social media and user generated content. And now with web 3, it&#8217;s decentralized, it&#8217;s the blockchain. And I&#8217;m actually going to a web 3 conference in January. I think it may have passed by the time this episode airs, but people can definitely look it up. I&#8217;m pretty sure there&#8217;ll be more web 3 conferences in the future. Because I&#8217;m like, I want to know where we are going to get in on this.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So much of what we&#8217;ve done now has been steeped in web 2.0. Like, where do we get in on this next thing?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s real interesting that you talk about that. You mentioned Second Life and Second Life was around before web 2.0. And this is the same story. We are now at a point where the ideas and technology are now at a crossroads. They are finally intersecting. And so I always think of, we were talking about the Palms and the Treos, but then once we got processors and graphic interface that were fast enough, then that&#8217;s when we got the iPhone. Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yep.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
And so, this is another one of those moments where the price of headsets are significantly cheaper than they were before. Now we&#8217;ve got this blockchain technology, we now have these different currencies that you can use in these different worlds. And so it feels like everything is there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. With metaverse and cryptocurrency and all of this starting to mesh together, I can see where it confuses a lot of people. But also, this is happening. It&#8217;s not a, oh well, maybe. No, it&#8217;s happening and it&#8217;s happening right under our noses. I mean, this sounds almost apocalyptic in a way, but it&#8217;s happening. It&#8217;s happening and it&#8217;s either you need to figure out where you fit in in this or you get left behind.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Or you&#8217;re going to be the 50-year-old on TikTok.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Or you&#8217;re going to be like my mom who is completely tech averse. And it&#8217;s like, I give her a cell phone and she turns it off until I have to tell her when I&#8217;m calling. Like that sort of thing. Because, I don&#8217;t want to get tracked, I don&#8217;t want them tracking me. I&#8217;m like, okay. But it&#8217;s getting to that. I see it getting there. And yeah, I could even see smart phones starting to do more with VR and AR and mixed reality, which we&#8217;re even starting to see with Google. Google has their maps that layer their own way. Finding on top of what you view out in the camera. It&#8217;s happening.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
It&#8217;s happening.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s happening.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah. No, it&#8217;s definitely happening. I think in the tech sense, it feels like that moment when the iPhone came out, if folks can remember. People see what the possibilities are, people are doing a lot of experimentation. People are okay if it works and if it doesn&#8217;t, and I think that&#8217;s the way to do it. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to work. I think it&#8217;s good to see folks really doubling down to really push the boundaries. And so I will say, for anybody listening that is well versed in all of this, definitely tweet myself and Maurice and let us know if we are getting the solid good grasp on it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Please do. I don&#8217;t want to be sounding crazy out here, but I also want to make sure we&#8217;re informed because we both have our respective audiences too. We want to make sure that people are being informed about what this next thing is because it&#8217;s coming. And we either need to find a way to become a part of it, or once again, just get left behind with it.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yep.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
To that end, we&#8217;ve discussed all of this. What do you see as the future of design and business?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Oh, that is a million dollar webpage right there. I have many thoughts on this. We&#8217;ve been working from home for the past couple of years, so I&#8217;ve had an opportunity to really do a bit of introspection and really thinking about the conversations that we&#8217;re having. If we reflect, again, when I first started working in tech, when I first started doing web design, when I first started doing graphic design, I think the foundations and the way that we approach the craft, I think those foundations really still exists. But I think in terms of what we need to be conscious of to create inclusive environments, whether it be around make ups of team, we had talked about the different working spaces that people are in, thinking about what the consequences of design decisions are. Shout out to Ron, he actually just did a talk on consequence design. I think he was also a guest on your show, Maurice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah. Ron Bronson. He is cool. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah. So I can keep going. We talk about equity, we talk about bias and whatnot. The list of things that we have to be conscious of, even on the business sense of things, research. I mean, I could keep going. I personally do not think a single designer is going to be able to comprehend all of that. But it is also very important to the work and central to the work that we do. And so moving forward, the industry itself, and that&#8217;s not just design, but we&#8217;ve got to say, hey, look, some of these things are not just in the discipline of design. We should be having design. We should be thinking and all encompassing about the elements that play a role in design across different business areas. This means your CEO should understand it. This means your product managers, engineers, they should understand it.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
How can we bring these types of things into the schools that they&#8217;re working at, into the conferences that they&#8217;re going into, because it&#8217;s a lot to put on the shoulders of design. And I think that if folks can really understand what the value is, we&#8217;re seeing a lot of growth now, I think the growth of the industry could honestly double. Most people you talk to, they&#8217;re always like, man, we need more designers. I&#8217;ve never heard of a situation where it&#8217;s like, we got too many designers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
And so I think it&#8217;s really important for our industry to start really transforming the discussion there and thinking about design as an afterthought. If we&#8217;re still talking about design getting a seat at the table, I mean, that&#8217;s some web 2.0 stuff. Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
We got to have organizations that are design centric. And so that&#8217;s where I see it going. I mean, I think whether it&#8217;s on the metaverse, whether it&#8217;s on web 3, virtual reality, augmented reality, the way that we operationalize still to this certain point needs to be the responsibility of everybody. And so I think that is where I see design going. I know that&#8217;s not a super trendy answer, but I think organizations really do have to do a better job of just thinking design is a service. I think there are some companies that are doing really great things, but I don&#8217;t want that to necessarily think that the industry as a whole is evolving. So yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say has been the best career advice that you&#8217;ve gotten?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know. This is tough. Because I think some of the best career advice I&#8217;ve had is super simple, it&#8217;s the matter of me executing. But yeah. I mean, I think honestly, it really comes down to asking questions. Being curious, asking questions. And I think the question piece is not necessarily in a place where you are not in a normal onboarding sense, but questioning why things are the way that they are. Why are they the way that they are? Because I think we&#8217;ve operated so long in a world where we don&#8217;t question those things and we have to deal with the consequences. And the consequences may directly, indirectly affect us. Or we are around a bunch of folks that don&#8217;t care. And that in itself is already destructive in its nature.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
You&#8217;re bringing out all the hard questions. To be honest, I have not thought about that. So we have the former CEO or co-founder of LinkedIn coin this term called tour duty. I&#8217;m not one for military terms in a workplace environment. I think that&#8217;s extremely unhealthy and anxiety inducing, especially just given, again, just how crazy the past few years have been. People are definitely feeling it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
But I think the idea around is really being on a path of, I don&#8217;t know, learning, a journey. And I think for me, I mean, I talked about this before. I think being able to transform an organization to be able to think about design, kind of like how I had mentioned in the question earlier. For me, that&#8217;s the mission that I&#8217;m on right now. And it&#8217;s great to really see the progress of it. In that sense, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s on the docket five years from now. I would love to lead the team. But I will say that I also get super excited about Technically Speaking. Moving into technically the third calendar year of the project, I will say that I&#8217;m looking forward to just iterating on it. So definitely more guests, more episodes. I&#8217;ll be introducing some writing, a lot of really cool mini project on that. So definitely stay tuned. That&#8217;s on technicallyspeakinghw.com.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve really started to look back at some of my older work. I think for so long I had this thought that my writing wasn&#8217;t good enough. And so I&#8217;ve been bringing back a lot of things that I&#8217;ve written down in notebooks or in notes or in slide decks that I never presented because I didn&#8217;t think it was there or somebody told me it wasn&#8217;t all the way there. I was like, man, this stuff is really good. And so I might have a book that comes out. I love talking about management. I love talking about how it can be more conscious around the things that we&#8217;re doing. I love having discussions around different tactics you can have. Because in my journey, I didn&#8217;t really have much of that.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
And so, I would really love to have something that the next generation of managers can have in their toolkit. And they don&#8217;t have to use it, but at least it helps them start to think about ways they can do things that are authentically them, that represents their nature and really helps build a healthy community around what they&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about the show and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Yeah. So you can look at my random tweets on Twitter, twitter.com/H-M-W-H-E-E-L-E. And then for the show, it&#8217;s called Technically Speaking, so that&#8217;s available wherever. Technically Speaking with Harrison Wheeler. So that&#8217;s available wherever you listen to podcast. And then on social media, if you follow Technically Speaking HW on Instagram and LinkedIn you should be able to find us there and at technicallyspeakinghw.com. So just remember Technically Speaking HW and you should be able to figure it out. And of course, you can find me on LinkedIn @harrisonwheeler. So feel free to connect. As I mentioned before, I&#8217;ll be looking at hiring a couple of roles. They should be up by the time this episode is live. So feel free to reach out if you&#8217;re interested. And of course, we&#8217;re always hiring designers, design managers, researchers, project managers, product operations, all that. So definitely check out the job listings on LinkedIn.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, like you said, companies are always looking for designers. Right?</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
100%.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Harrison Wheeler, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. It&#8217;s been, I just have to say from a personal standpoint, it&#8217;s been so great seeing your growth and your progression since we first met back in 2016 up to now, and just how much you&#8217;ve managed to do. I mean, in your personal career and especially what you&#8217;re doing at LinkedIn, but also now branching out into podcasting and really putting that message forward and opening up more opportunities for other people to tell their stories. I think it&#8217;s such a natural extension of just the amount of patience and I think thoughtfulness that you bring to your work. So I&#8217;m excited to see what you do certainly for the next five years. And again, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Harrison Wheeler:</b><br>
Appreciate you, Maurice. Have a good one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Regardless of your dreams, don&#8217;t let anyone stop you.&#8221; When Harrison Wheeler, told me this before our interview, I knew that we were going to have a good conversation on our hands. Harrison is the design manager at <a href="https://getbase.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Base</a>, a customer relationship management tool used by entrepreneurs to help track clients and set up a sales process so your business runs more efficiently.</p>
<p>We started off by going through a typical day for Harrison, and he shared what he thinks makes someone a good design manager. From there, he talked about how he first got involved in design, his entrepreneurial days at the University of Iowa, and we talked a bit about diversity in design as it relates to hiring. (And he is hiring!) Harrison really had a lot of great information to share, and I think anyone interested in more about product design or design management should definitely give this episode a listen. Thanks to <a href="/ron-bronson/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ron Bronson</a> for the introduction!</p>
