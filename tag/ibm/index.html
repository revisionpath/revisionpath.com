Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>I love that Manny Ikomi has adopted a philosophy of &#8220;lift as you climb&#8221; as it relates to his career. Manny works as a UX design consultant for IBM iX, but he&#8217;s also a design educator and even streams some of his personal web development and UX projects on Twitch. It was great chatting it up and learning about how he balances his work with community outreach.</p>
<p>We started off diving into Manny&#8217;s journey from discovering interactive design and UX, to hitting a career ceiling and pursuing further education. Manny also spoke about teaching at his alma mater, his aspirations on working for public sector institutions, and his podcast <a href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/ggtpod" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Gay, Geeky + Tired</a>. Hopefully Manny&#8217;s story will inspire you to make a positive impact in the world!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>So my name is Manny Ikomi. I&#8217;m a UX designer at IBM currently, and also recently, I am adjunct faculty teaching an interactive design course at Bunker Hill Community College.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Nice. How&#8217;s your year been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>So far, it&#8217;s been a bit of a whirlwind. I think there&#8217;s definitely been some really good ups and some really low downs. But at the end of the day, I think the net ending of that is still growing and succeeding in the things that I want to do so far. And there&#8217;s still more to come, I guess. So, still with a lot of optimism, it&#8217;s been going well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>How would you say you&#8217;ve grown and improved over the past year? Have you noticed anything in particular?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>So I started at IBM in June of last year of 2022. That first year was like a little trial by fire because of the project that I was working on. But I also had access to a lot of really great mentors; people in my network, both inside and outside of the company. And so professionally, I think there was just such an immense growth in that stretch zone, that I like to call it, within my first year. And so now that I&#8217;m a little bit over a year in, as of June of this year, I&#8217;ve kind of, like, leveled out. The honeymoon phase is a bit over, and I&#8217;m kind of just like doing the thing now. Things that I thought maybe I wasn&#8217;t capable of, like a year ago. I guess I&#8217;m capable of now &#8212; teaching being one of them.</p>
<p>I think probably most recent, a little bit of recency bias. But teaching has been something that has been on my mind to do for a little while, ever since a professor of mine kind of planted the seeds, like when I graduated from the college that I&#8217;m teaching at now, which is another story. But it&#8217;s been a really great experience so far, like, teaching IBM only like four weeks into my class. It&#8217;s my first time teaching ever, and for the most part, it&#8217;s also been going really well on top of just working at IBM and doing other things. And interestingly enough, there&#8217;s also a lot of overlap between some of the work that I&#8217;m doing now and some of the things I&#8217;m doing for my course this year has been definitely a year of growth and stretching and learning and teaching. So sometimes teaching also is a really great way to learn. So it&#8217;s been really great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Nice. Let&#8217;s talk about your work at IBM, specifically IBM iX, where you work, like you said, as a UX designer. Tell me more about that.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>So yeah. IBM iX. So IBM, for those of you who maybe don&#8217;t know, because they&#8217;re not as recognized, I guess, of a brand anymore, especially for younger folks, it stands for International Business Machines. It&#8217;s a very old company. There&#8217;s lots of history. They hold a lot of patents for things interestingly that I learned about. Most notably, I think, like the magnetic stripe on credit cards is something that I never realized that they had essentially invented. And so they&#8217;ve been a very large technology company for a very long time.</p>
<p>And over the years, I think they evolved from more like hardware and stuff. And then now they do mostly software and consulting, so they have their own cloud offerings. And then I&#8217;m in the Consulting part of the business. And then iX, which stands for Interactive Experience, is a smaller bubble within IBM Consulting. And what I do there as a UX designer, I guess, like all of us will say, it depends. It depends on the project, it depends on the client. Because ultimately I&#8217;m considered a consultant as opposed to an in house designer. So I don&#8217;t necessarily work on IBM&#8217;s cloud services and software and products.</p>
<p>I actually work on clients of IBM who come to the company and say, &#8220;hey, we need UX designers for this&#8221;, or &#8220;we need design services for some sort of initiative&#8221;. And through that, I&#8217;ve really gotten to do a whole bunch of stuff, particularly within my first year, I could be doing anything from contextual inquiry and design research, traveling to clients on site doing observational research, typical, like user interface prototyping, working in Figma, doing demos and things like that. Usability testing, enterprise design thinking, which is kind of like their methodology around design thinking and how we deliver design services. Yeah, I&#8217;ve pretty much done, I think, the whole gamut of user experience, design and really just design in general. I&#8217;ve really expanded my view, I think, kind of going back to the other question about how I&#8217;ve grown. My view of what design is and how it works and what I do has definitely been a lot more expansive beyond just the tangible artifacts and things that we make.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, it sounds like your day to day work is pretty varied then. Like you said, you&#8217;re either researching, you&#8217;re doing site visits, et cetera. It sounds like there&#8217;s a lot of variety in the work that you&#8217;re able to do.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, there definitely is. And some of that is for better or for worse, I guess, because it turns you into a little bit of a generalist, which some people have opinions about. But I think at least at this point in my career, because it&#8217;s a little bit more earlier on, it&#8217;s good for me to have that kind of exposure and growth opportunities to try and do different things, especially when the risk is low for me personally. Right? Yeah, I mean, I get to work on a whole bunch of stuff. Most recently, the project that I&#8217;ve been working on is a little bit more on the strategic end and getting a local state government to actually adopt some of IBM&#8217;s design thinking methodology, which really kind of lines up to what I was talking about earlier, about teaching people about design now as like an adjunct faculty instructor. So there&#8217;s also been some really interesting overlap and ways in which I&#8217;m now delivering design that I never really considered possible up until recently. So that&#8217;s been interesting. But yeah, it&#8217;s been a really great growth and learning experience so far.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I kind of want to talk a little bit about that generalist part that you just mentioned there. I know there&#8217;s this book by David Epstein called &#8220;Range&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard about it.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>You know what, it sounds familiar now that you say that. I think I might have saved a sample to my Kindle at one point and never ended up buying it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>But it&#8217;s called &#8220;Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World&#8221;. And it does sort of make the case for why generalists are&#8230;they&#8217;re really sort of sought after in a way. I&#8217;m curious though, because you do so much, are you finding there&#8217;s a particular part of UX that you prefer over others?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been kind of thinking about a little bit lately ,and I guess due to the fact of my generalist nature, it kind of goes beyond just design and also into web development too. And so this area that I&#8217;ve been kind of occupying, at least not necessarily within IBM, but just in general as I upskill and just learn different things. I&#8217;m also like a self taught front-end web developer and so I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about the intersections of experience, design and web development and the opportunities there for people who have that kind of hybrid skill set and can really, I guess, specialize in there. Despite considering myself a generalist in some ways, I specialize in others. So the areas that I think I&#8217;m really liking the most is research. </p>
<p>There are things that I&#8217;ve learned about design research and psychology and humans and their behaviors just from watching them interact with designs that I&#8217;ve made or others that I just find so fascinating that just kind of lends itself to my own just like innate sense of curiosity and wanting to learn. But then there&#8217;s also, interestingly enough, the complete flip side of that, which is like the more logistical, I guess, x and y&#8217;s ones and zeros codes and things like actually developing and building the things that I design in some tool and actually making it a real thing, because that&#8217;s kind of where I started. And that&#8217;s how I really transitioned into the work that I do now, is I started as a graphic designer and then I became interested in web design and then I would create these web designs, but I couldn&#8217;t actually put it on the Internet and have it be a website.</p>
<p>And all kind of roads, basically, no matter how hard I tried to avoid coding, were just like, basically &#8220;if you want to do it, you got to do it yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>So I learned coding through that and then now it&#8217;s just kind of been a skill that&#8217;s really stuck with me, I guess, along the way. It&#8217;s not a skill that I get to use or a muscle that I get to flex all the time, but it does surface in some other interesting ways, especially when it comes to collaborating with other developers and just thinking a little bit more logically about the designs that I&#8217;m creating and their ability to be feasibly implemented. So I would say between the design engineering part&#8230;so that kind of hybrid of making a design and actually being able to build it, but also some of the user research aspects of it and strategy, which I guess is kind of everything, but also specifically at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, I think it&#8217;s good to have that sort of generalist, I think, sort of mindset as well as skill set. I mean, back in the day when the Web was really just first starting to become something, everyone sort of had to become a generalist in some way. Like you designed it, you had to code it, you had to slice it up, et cetera, and put it on the Web. Of course, now it&#8217;s so interesting with companies because it seems like companies want specialists and yet when you look at their job descriptions, what they really want is a generalist that has a specialization. So they kind of want that&#8230;what do they call it? </p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>T-shaped. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, like the T-shaped designer or whatever where you&#8217;ve got this broad set of skills. Like, I saw something for this company; they wanted like a social media manager, but then they also needed them to be a graphic designer and they also needed to know motion design. And I was like, those are entirely different things. What you want is a designer. It sounds like you want a designer that has social media experience, but they were like, no, we want a social media manager, but then you want this person doing motion design. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s also just a byproduct of how messed up the job market is right now, but I&#8217;ve seen a lot of that.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Definitely, I&#8217;ve seen a lot of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What are some of the projects that you&#8217;ve worked on that you can talk about?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>For a lot of reasons, obviously, I can&#8217;t talk about a lot of details. Probably the level to what I can say is the first project that I worked on while I was at IBM was basically in the realm of safety. And so the idea was that people who were working in a manufacturing facility could record and take pictures of safety violations or safety issues that they might find and then be able to report that through a system that we developed. So the application of actually reporting and observing safety issues, and then like a whole process and chain of people involved essentially like a service design around people on the front end actually recording issues, and then all the way in the back end, actually analyzing issues and doing some predictive analytics and things like that. And then the most recent project that I&#8217;m on right now with a local state government is basically helping them adopt human-centered design thinking processes and methods and frameworks. And the way that IBM does that is through their enterprise design thinking framework, which I&#8217;ve come to really like and appreciate. It was one of those things that I wish I had known about as a student and definitely kind of opened my world to the possibilities of what design can be and how it can manifest itself, I think. And then ever since then, it&#8217;s kind of just become this thing where I&#8217;m like, &#8220;wow, it&#8217;s more than just the artifacts that we make.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also the way that we think and how we convey our ideas to others, how people interpret our ideas. And it&#8217;s really just kind of expanded my view, I guess, of what it is. But yeah, those are probably the highest level I can get with those two specific projects. The first one I was on for just under a year, and that was pretty much the majority of my entry level experience, getting hired into IBM as an entry level professional hire. And that first project was really great. I had a great team that I worked with. I got to travel a little bit as part of it, and it was a really great experience. There were parts of it that were challenging, definitely, as with any project or design engagement. But ultimately I&#8217;m really thankful for that first project and the people that I got to work with and I&#8217;m hoping to reach out to them again the end of this year to just kind of check in and see where the work has gone since I&#8217;ve left the project. </p>
<p>And then this more recent project that I was talking about in terms of design adoption, that one just recently kicked off like a few weeks ago. So we&#8217;re still in the early stages, but the team is also looking really great to work with and so far it&#8217;s been great. So the work has just been very varied and interesting and every time I just feel like I&#8217;m learning something new or learning something different about design than I thought was ever possible, like maybe like two or three years ago. So it&#8217;s just fascinating.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, you talked just a little bit there about one of the projects having predictive analytics, which of course makes me think about sort of this current era that we&#8217;re in of artificial intelligence and machine learning. And there&#8217;s a number of different sort of cutting edge technologies now that have clearly bled into the mainstream that I think have been going on for a while, like AR, VR, et cetera, but now they&#8217;re becoming mainstream sort of things.</p>
<p>How do you see UX evolving with these new technologies?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t put too much thought into this. I think, obviously you know, obviously the glaring kind of observation here is with generative AI, right? And like ChatGPT and OpenAI and all this stuff that&#8217;s come out recently. I think ultimately, at least in the specific realm of generative AI, it kind of offers an opportunity to actually augment the work that we do as designers. And in some places, I guess, yeah, it will replace some jobs, but I think ultimately it will also kind of augment the way that we do work. And there are products now that are out that kind of help user researchers find patterns in their interviews and the transcripts using AI and things like that that are just really interesting. So there are areas where AI is kind of like enhancing the work that we do and allows us to kind of augment the work and be more productive. Things like AR and VR. I actually haven&#8217;t had too many experiences with, not really even in college. However, the Apple Vision Pro device that was announced by Apple earlier this year, I thought that was really interesting and had a bit of a rabbit hole of thoughts around that in terms of experience, design, and how.</p>
<p>For the longest time, a lot of our designs for user interfaces have kind of been at least for digital user interfaces have been kind of confined to these rectangles that you&#8217;re probably looking at right now in these screens. And so with AR and VR experiences and mixed reality with products like the Apple Vision Pro, it&#8217;s kind of like it allows us to step outside of those bounds, really, of that rectangle screen that we&#8217;re so used to designer for. And it really opens up a lot more possibilities for a lot more intuitive and natural interfaces for us that maybe we just have not developed even usability patterns for yet, or rules of thumb for. And so I find that like a very interesting area that&#8217;s kind of opening up. I imagine there are much more qualified people than me to talk about that, but it is something that I&#8217;ve been thinking about, especially since technology, it&#8217;s kind of hard to stop progress in that sense. And so as experience designers, I guess we&#8217;re also kind of well positioned in the sense that almost everything is an experience and almost everything is designed in one shape or another. I think we&#8217;ll end up having a hand in it and potentially not only just consuming the technology, but also producing ways for people to interact with it too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, I think, as you mentioned, the way that the technology is rapidly advancing, I mean, I feel like this time last year, companies were just starting to kind of test the waters a little bit to see what they could do. And now I think within that past year, every major tech company has made some sort of announcement about how they&#8217;re using AI or they&#8217;re using like a ChatGPT or some sort of generative type of new technology in the work that they&#8217;re doing, almost kind of shoehorning it in in some mean. Let&#8217;s just talk about the obvious &#8212; Google Search. Google Search now will bring up AI stuff right along with these SEO-optimized results that will come up in your regular search engine results page, and it&#8217;s a little difficult, I think sometimes to be able to discern what is good with that and what&#8217;s bad with that. Like, I think everyone&#8217;s trying to sort of race to find how they can use technology, how they can make it work without really stopping to think, is it necessary? Do we have to do this?</p>
<p>Is it just a competition thing? Like business competition? Maybe it is, maybe it isn&#8217;t. I mean, I feel like after a while we&#8217;ll start seeing appliances that have AI. We already have stuff like smart fridges and smart toasters and stuff, but I don&#8217;t need my toaster to have ChatGPT or whatever, just toast the bread. I mean, that&#8217;s an extreme case, but you know what I mean.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>I totally get what you mean. I think that&#8217;s where I have the negative sort of perspective on AI particularly, is really with any sort of emerging technology, especially for these really larger tech companies, like IBM included. it&#8217;s kind of like the rat race to figure out who&#8217;s going to be able to monetize it and make the most revenue with the technology and kind of have their moat. So to speak. In that case, that&#8217;s where we end up with like, oh, let&#8217;s just slap AI on everything and see what happens. Without really, to your point, stopping to think about the impact, whether it&#8217;s positive or negative, to the people that AI is being deployed on, in the same way that it can be a really immense help and benefit to society in some case, it can also be very dangerous. And I don&#8217;t think companies are really incentivized right now to really think about it in that more ethical or social impact lens because that&#8217;s just not going to make the money. And that&#8217;s the way the world turns, essentially, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So there&#8217;s this startup, I&#8217;ll say it now, I was thinking about if I should even mention this, but I&#8217;ll go ahead and say it. There&#8217;s a startup based out of Seattle that does like AI text to speech. Essentially they cloned one of the host voices of Planet Money for NPR and did like a whole episode with this person&#8217;s voice and it sounds pretty mean. You know, I think there are still going to be certain eccentricities in the human voice that humans will be able to discern, but of course the models are getting better for it and things like that. But they&#8217;re one of the few companies, the company is called WellSaid Labs. They&#8217;re one of the few companies I&#8217;ve seen that actually has like a code of ethics behind the work that they do because it could be so easy for someone to use their service that they offer use that technology for extremely nefarious purposes.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>But they actually have a code of ethics behind about what customers do with that technology and how they even plan on implementing and using it, which I would like to see more companies if they&#8217;re going to be implementing. These features I would like to also have them talk about, like we said before, those ramifications of what it means to include all of this. And who is it really serving? And this is something that we saw with, like, Bitcoin and with Web three and all this sort of stuff, where the use of all this generative AI also uses a lot of natural resources, which is something that I don&#8217;t think we regularly would think about because computers have been such an ever present just an ever present sort of thing. But I remember I was reading something I want to say, I don&#8217;t know, a couple of days ago about how Microsoft&#8217;s water usage or something has increased by 30% because of the fact that they&#8217;re like using AI within oh wait, I&#8217;m looking at it now. AI usage fuel spike in Microsoft&#8217;s water consumption, it spiked 34% because they&#8217;re using it in all these other types of programs and stuff, which you would think water, why water? But it takes more servers, space and power to do all this AI stuff, which means it has to be cooled in some way with air conditioning. It&#8217;s all tied in, so it&#8217;s not really happening in a vacuum. I would just like to see more companies talk about the ethics behind why they&#8217;re doing what they&#8217;re doing instead of just rolling out innovation after innovation that I guess we&#8217;re supposed to OOH and awe over in some fancy presentation.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. My perspective is obviously kind of biased because I work for IBM. But recently, with the whole Watson X announcement thing that you may or may not have heard of, I think part of it, and IBM does, I think. Have pretty decent programming and ethics and training around the use of AI, because that&#8217;s kind of like, one of our strategic areas that we&#8217;re trying to be leaders in. And so the whole rollout for Watson X was kind of centered around three different areas. There was Watson X AI data and then governance. And governance, I think, is really that part of it that kind of talks about making sure that it&#8217;s responsible and transparent and explainable. And then we also have even like an enterprise design thinking course where the methodology for design thinking is tailored around.</p>
<p>Like if you want to implement AI and you&#8217;re using a design thinking framework or initiative to do that, there&#8217;s also training that&#8217;s kind of specific to that as well. That kind of goes into some of the what is the ideal outcome or impact that we want to have, and is AI really even necessary for that in the first place? Right, so it wants you to think about those things. Now, in my personal experience, have know deployed AI in some way with IBM? Not really. So I haven&#8217;t actually gotten the chance to user these learning materials, but I think at the very least, they&#8217;re there as a resource for us employees to use. And it is in IBM&#8217;s interest for us to be very smart about the user of AI because in some ways we are kind of seen as leaders or innovators in that space. There is definitely an aspect of companies need to have more ethics and intent around how they&#8217;re using AI, where it gets deployed, what the impact is, who&#8217;s using it, who&#8217;s being affected by it. I think I would like to see more from that from every company, IBM included. But from what I&#8217;ve seen so far, I think at least at a programming and learning level, IBM seems to be very aware of that.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s also from a risk and compliance perspective because we&#8217;re mostly operate as a B2B or enterprise to enterprise business. Privacy, security and compliance are things that really large businesses that IBM really care about because it kind of is what amounts to their risk and being litigated against. Right. And so when we deploy AI for a client that uses IBM&#8217;s technology, we do have to have a certain amount of ownership over what the technology does and who it impacts because we&#8217;re. Like, the designers and deployers of those things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, we all have to, I just think, be a bit more cognizant of the usage of these tools and what they mean and what the greater sort of impact of it is. But I think we&#8217;ve nerded out enough about that. So let&#8217;s kind of shift the focus here and talk more about you. Let&#8217;s learn more about Manny. Tell me about where you&#8217;re from.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m mostly from the Boston area. I grew up mostly in towns called Saugas and Malden, and a little bit in Revere. And that&#8217;s kind of like, known as, like, the North Shore area of Boston, I guess you could say. But I&#8217;ve pretty much lived like, within 20 to 15 minutes outside of Boston for my entire life. And I&#8217;ve worked around the same area pretty much my entire life. I went to school around the area pretty much throughout my entire life, too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, growing up, were you always kind of interested in technology? Was it something that your parents kind of tried to get you into?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>I would say I&#8217;ve always been interested in it. I think what led me to becoming a designer and my interest in it was that combination of being able to merge my creative interests and creative outputs and curiosity with more technical implementations and things like that. I remember in high school, I went to a vocational high school for context. So we had kind of like vocational programs as part of the regular high school programming.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>And so that&#8217;s kind of where I got my first taste of, like, I can be creative and make something and have it be like a physical, tangible thing. And I just thought that was so cool because, one, I was really bad at drawing, even though I was trying to be creative. But I did find that I had an affinity for things like the software and tooling that was available in the computer labs that we have. The shop was called Graphic Communications, by the way. So that&#8217;s kind of what led into my whole six years at a printing company and things like that. But that&#8217;s really where I started to develop that interest for the combination of creativity and technology. Although at the time the technology was printing, not as we would think about it, I guess today from a UX standpoint.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk more about Bunker Hill. Of course, you mentioned earlier that you are a teacher there, which we&#8217;ll get into, but that&#8217;s where you started off in college. You went to Bunker Hill Community College, majored in graphic arts and visual communications. Tell me, what was your time like there? Do you feel like it really kind of prepared you?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Bunker Hill was kind of interesting because I was kind of facing some, I guess, conflicting realities. That was actually a very huge period of growth for me, I think, relatively to where I&#8217;m at now. If I really reflect on it so with Bunker Hill, I think the programming that they had there at the time was pretty good. I think from a design perspective, it was definitely skewed more towards those kind of typical graphic design programs where your first year is kind of like your foundation year, you&#8217;re required to do a whole bunch of drawing and painting and kind of like more artsy stuff. And then in your, I guess, second year of the Associates program, that&#8217;s where you start getting into more specific studio level courses around typography, which is where I think my trajectory in design kind of started to skyrocket when I finally recognized the importance of it and my ability to influence that as a designer. Now that&#8217;s always the one thing I tell people if they learn nothing about design is Typography is like 90 or 80% of the stuff that you need to know if you want to become a designer or at least design something well if you&#8217;re not formally trained as one from there. I spent quite a few years there because I was a part time student and then I was working full time at the Print Shop, and that was mostly because I couldn&#8217;t afford to go to a full four year institution. I didn&#8217;t really feel comfortable with the idea of taking out a whole bunch of student loans.</p>
<p>And although I had pretty decent support from my parents, it wasn&#8217;t something that I also felt like, I guess I didn&#8217;t want them to be fiscally responsible. I don&#8217;t really think we were in a position to do that, especially at the time that I was doing community college classes. So it was really just kind of me like, finding my way, figuring it out. When I first started there, I tried to take twelve credits worth of courses and work full time at the print shop, which lasted maybe all of like four to six weeks before I was, this is definitely not going to work because that was just a lot. And then finally I found like a good balance between two classes a semester, which ultimately ended up requiring me to go twice as long to finish my associate&#8217;s degree. So it actually took me four years as opposed to two, but for the most part I was able to go through community college without any loans whatsoever, which was extremely helpful to me. Now I&#8217;m thanking myself much later in the future for being smart enough to think about that during that time because I had to be so, I guess, independent in that sense and really think about myself and my needs and ultimately my own personal finances. That&#8217;s kind of where I started to really think about my personal finance money, what success meant to me, becoming more financially literate in the decisions that I was making and the impact that it might have on me later.</p>
<p>Learning about debt and compound interest and investing and all those things. And luckily I made a lot of really smart choices during that time to the point where now, financially, I&#8217;m doing things less so out of fear, which was kind of like the original motivation for me to do that because I didn&#8217;t want to be broke. And I had some minorly traumatic experience around involving money and things like that when I was growing up. So it kind of started from that place of fear. And then now that I&#8217;m finally in a place where I feel much more well established, much more secure, not only in my professional life, but also my personal life and just who I am, those things are more so. They&#8217;re not top of mind for me and I don&#8217;t have to obsess about them, but I have enough of a foundation to think about it more as an opportunity rather than a risk, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>No, that makes a lot of sense. I mean, college is a transitory time for a lot of people for a lot of different reasons. And for you, you were going to college and working at the same time. Tell me about how you sort of balance that.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>I was not very good at it. I guess work-life balance, I guess, is something that I&#8217;ve always kind of struggled with a little bit. It originally stemmed from like, I always need to have something to do. I always need to be busy, I always need to be productive. And that was kind of a very unhealthy way of thinking about it because I was kind of motivated by that fear of not having money or opportunity. But the way that I balanced it was thankfully the company that I was working with at the time, they were actually pretty supportive of me going to college and doing what I needed to do. So there were some days where I had class during the middle of the day and they had no problem with me leaving the office to I was working in the office five days a week for that job. They had no problem with me leaving work to go to class for like four hours and then do what I needed to do to get my degree at Bunker Hill. And so that was really helpful because it gave me a lot of autonomy and really, as long as I got my work done, it really wasn&#8217;t a big deal for them.</p>
<p>So that was like a huge help. And I know a lot of people just don&#8217;t have that sort of opportunity or luxury. That being said, they definitely did not subsidize, nor were they in a position to help me subsidize my education, but it definitely gave me, I think, the flexibility I needed. And then it was really up to me to just be very good about time management, make sure I was keeping up with my assignments, making sure my work obligations were taken care of. Sometimes that required really long nights. Other times it required really early mornings. I wasn&#8217;t as much of a social butterfly, or I didn&#8217;t really get to do all of the social things that are part of a college experience that people might want or be accustomed to. I didn&#8217;t really have a dormitory experience.</p>
<p>There were sacrifices in that, but I think ultimately I came out better for it, and I would definitely do it again if I had to. I just might be a little bit more forgiving with myself in terms of working myself too hard, I guess you could say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Trust me, you missed nothing about the dorm experience. There&#8217;s nothing about that you have missed. I don&#8217;t know if you have siblings or not, but you&#8217;ve missed nothing. Consider yourself lucky.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. It ended up working out, I think, a little bit, because once I transferred to Lesley and finished my bachelor&#8217;s degree there, although I didn&#8217;t get the full know experience there either, I did end up, you know, slowly making friends throughout the entire college experience who did have the dorm life. And we did go over each other&#8217;s places and play video games and hang out and do homework together. And not all of them were from the same college. But Boston is&#8230;there&#8217;s a lot of college-level institutions here, so I got to do some of that. But I guess you&#8217;re right. I didn&#8217;t really miss much, either.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I feel like Boston is a pretty extremely diverse college mean. Of course, you have the well known colleges like MIT, Harvard, et cetera, but then you&#8217;ve got, like you said, Lesley, you got Bunker Hill. There&#8217;s other universities in and around the sort of Boston metro area, so it makes sense that there would be a lot of commingling like that. Yeah, I mean, Atlanta, in a way is sort of like that, too. I mean, I went to Morehouse and there were opportunities where you would, of course, hang out with students from Georgia Tech, from Georgia State. Spelman is right across the street, Clark-Atlanta is right across the street. So you&#8217;re just all kind of commingling together. I mean, Atlanta really is a big college town. I don&#8217;t know if a lot of folks realize that it&#8217;s a pretty unique college town because the number of HBCUs we have, but it&#8217;s really a big college town, so you have all these opportunities to meet people doing all sorts of things at all sorts of different places.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I never really thought of ATL like that, to be honest. I think one person who I met was from the Savannah College of Art and Design, which I think is in Georgia, if correctly based out of Savannah, Georgia. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>We have a campus here in Atlanta, too, right? Yeah. And you mentioned this kind of before we started recording, but one of your professors at Lesley was actually a recent guest on Revision Path.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yes. So, yeah, shout out to Shanae Chapman. Ever since you reached out to me and I discovered the podcast, I&#8217;ve definitely gone in and done my due diligence. And I just think what you&#8217;re doing is really cool again. And it&#8217;s really kind of surreal, actually, I think, to kind of be part of this in the same way that they were, knowing that some of those people I either looked up to or I learned from or had some sort of influence in my life, personally or professionally. And we&#8217;ve also had some other IBM designers on the podcast as, like, I listened to a couple episodes way back with Oen Hammonds and Shani Sandy, who are both, like, design executives at IBM still. Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of a very small, interesting world, I guess, as we were speaking earlier. But, yeah, it was a really full circle moment.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t talked to Shanae in a little while, but recently we did kind of have a bit of a go back and forth because she was interested in the talk that I had done earlier this year. But, yeah, I just think it&#8217;s really cool and it&#8217;s honestly kind of an honor to be doing this right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m kind of&#8230;I have a question about sort of&#8230;I just kind of want to go back to your college experience for a bit because, like we said before, you were working and you were going to college at the same time. What made you want to continue your studies in design? Because it sounds like you already had &#8212; if I&#8217;m wrong here, please correct me &#8212; but it sounds like you had a nice kind of set up because the company was very flexible about you going to class and still working for them. It sounded like they really supported you. What made you want to continue your educational career?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, so that was a combination of quite a few things. I think, for context, the company that I worked at for six years, it was a small, family-owned business. We weren&#8217;t like some large&#8230;we weren&#8217;t like a Vistaprint or anything like that. And although it was a really great experience, I think I hit my ceiling there in terms of growth and opportunity relatively quickly, probably in hindsight, within the first three years. But the reason I stayed was, like you said, because of that flexibility that I really liked, and also the pay was decent enough to get me through college, do the things that I needed to do, have a little fun on the side. It was good for what it was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>And then I think as I started to become more interested in things like interactive design and user experience and things like that, that I really didn&#8217;t even know existed as career paths, really, I kind of stumbled upon them by virtue of learning how to code and kind of self teaching myself that stuff on the side. Hill I was working there. I just basically hit a ceiling there. And then when COVID happened. I graduated Bunker Hill in the fall of 2019, and I had applied to Lesley. I had got my transfer papers, and thankfully they had a matriculation agreement, which made it really easy for me that they just take your associate&#8217;s degree, no questions asked, that the credits all get applied where they should, and you start as a junior in their bachelor&#8217;s program. And at the time, I was reluctant about doing it because it was going to require that I took out student loans, but I did get a really great scholarship. And the fact that they took all of my credits was really huge, because when I did the math, financially speaking, it actually made it lower cost for me to go there and do the program that I wanted than, say, to transfer and go to a state school like Salem State or Mass Art were probably the other alternatives that I looked into.</p>
<p>So even though the sticker price of Lesley was a lot higher, it was actually going to be net cheaper because of the scholarship that I got. And they took all of my credits, which some of the other colleges may not have been willing to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And so from there, that kind of made the decision really easy for me. And then when COVID happened, the world blew up in the spring of 2020. I actually decided to take a gap for like a semester and then start in the fall of 2020. Of course, when I had planned to do that, I didn&#8217;t know COVID was going to blow up the entire world, but thus it did. And so in some ways, I actually kind of avoided that initial shock to my education experience, because, like everywhere else in the world, everyone was trying to figure out how to do virtual class instruction if they&#8217;ve never done that before. There was a whole bunch of new challenges that happened as a result of that. And so I kind of skid by those for the most part.</p>
<p>And then when I started in fall of 2020, I was still working at the print shop. But because I was working at the print shop remotely now, because it just wasn&#8217;t safe for us to be in the office, still, I was able to do Lesley full time and work remotely for the print shop.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>And then in 2021, in January, because my hours and income from the print shop was drastically reduced just because business was slow and it was really tough time for everyone. And so, thankfully, I had prepared for some of this. Because going back to financial literacy stuff, I had prepared an emergency fund and kind of knew, worst case scenario, I would be able to make it through college for the most part, even if I wasn&#8217;t working a full time gig. And I could just find maybe some freelance work and stuff on the side. So in 2021, I decided to leave. I put in my notice. I left on really great terms with them overall. Actually, recently, I ended up asking them to do some print work for me for a side thing with IBM.</p>
<p>But, yeah, from there it was just like full steam ahead with Lesley. I was like, I just want to get my education done. Out of the way. I know interactive design is the area that IBM interested in. I know it will somehow bring me to some interesting path with coding in some way. And at the time, I didn&#8217;t really know what user experience was until a particular studio course that I had, which just so happened to be with two IBM distinguished designers who were my faculty and they were the ones who ended up asking me to apply, like, a year later when I was a senior into the role that I&#8217;m in now, essentially.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, nice. I was going to ask how you sort of came across IBM with the work that you were doing, but it sounds like you already had this kind of support system in.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I think it really started kind of like, way back in vocational school because I had a pretty good technical understanding of the tooling and the software and some of the processes for design in terms of the tactical aspects and visual design, working in hind design, all that stuff. And so for me, the real value that I got out of college was the networking, the mentorship, the one on one time. And a lot of the theory and history behind design was most valuable to me, so I could really focus on that rather than trying to struggle with some of the tooling and learning new methods that I was already familiar with. And so when it came time to really work on projects, the technical aspects of doing the design work and making the artifacts and deliverables was actually relatively easy for me. What I was most challenged by was, like, the strategic parts of it and kind of training myself to think like a designer, not just make pretty designs.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I hear you. Okay. And now, let&#8217;s talk about what you sort of mentioned before about teaching at Bunker Hill. I feel like that might be an interesting experience to go back to your alma mater years later and now teach. What made you decide to go that route?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s definitely been a full circle moment that I&#8217;m still kind of, I guess, pinching myself for a long time ago. So when I had graduated from Bunker Hill in 2019, a professor of mine who I developed, like, a really great relationship with while I was there for four years, she asked me when I graduated. She said, when you finish your bachelor&#8217;s degree, I would love for you to come back and teach the college. And when she said that to me, I was kind of like, what? Because I was like, I just never really considered that as a possibility before. And then ever since she said that, I have kind of noticed getting really positive signals from people that I might be good at doing that. And so over, like, I guess it was kind of like a self-fulfilling prophecy in a way, where if I found it interesting and I thought it was nice, maybe it would happen. I maintained a relationship with that professor for quite a while, and even while I was going through Lesley and doing things, I would always go back to the college and even before I got the role there, do design crits with some of their students and provide networking and opportunities and portfolio reviews, things like that, to kind of give back.</p>
<p>And earlier this year, I had went to a design conference. It was like the first in-person design conference I got to go to since COVID kind of unleashed everything she had just so happened to be there. The professor ended up asking me to teach, and we were just kind of, like, catching up a little bit because we hadn&#8217;t talked in a little while, but we email back and forth every once in a while, and she had told me, like, hey, we have adjunct positions opening. We&#8217;re looking for people to teach certain courses. I want you to apply, basically. And even still, I was kind of like, well, I&#8217;m still just barely my first year into this role at IBM. Am I really even qualified or ready to do this? I was hoping, I think, realistically, to get another maybe four years or five years or so in the industry and doing more practice as a practitioner. But I kind of just kind of said to myself, self, take your own advice.</p>
<p>Like, if the opportunity presents itself, just apply and see what happens, just like I did with IBM. And so, long story short, it was like the worst that they can say is no. Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>So I applied. I did the interview, I did the teaching demo, and then, yeah, now here I am. So I&#8217;m only teaching one class. It&#8217;s Wednesday evenings, which works really well with my schedule, considering I also tend to go into the office on Wednesdays, and it&#8217;s right down the street from my office pretty much too. And the topic that I&#8217;m teaching is interactive design, which is kind of right up my alley since that&#8217;s what I studied in college, and now that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing for my job, pretty much. So the stars aligned, I guess you could say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>How&#8217;s the teaching experience been so far?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>So far it&#8217;s been, I think, a net positive. I think the teaching aspects of it, working with students, kind of like digging back in some of my own archives and coming up with my own content and assignments. I also spent a lot of time reaching out to some of my own professors and also students that I went to Bunker Hill with and at Lesley as well and kind of doing my own design research. I kind of just approached it as like, well, if I was to design a student experience, I just kind of treated it like any other experience design project, except my users are now students. So approaching it with that mindset kind of really helped me. And from there, I think the parts of it that I like are really going well as far as in class instruction, working with the students, providing feedback on their work. I think it&#8217;s probably one of the most valuable things I got out of my design education is like, getting critiques and feedback from other people and getting that other perspective on your work that you might not otherwise get if you&#8217;re trying to learn by yourself. And then the parts of it that I don&#8217;t like so much really are kind of like the more logistics and administrative stuff around it.</p>
<p>I really struggled with grading in the first two weeks to kind of figure out, like, I probably need a rubric. And then also the learning management system that we use isn&#8217;t the most user friendly thing either, which is kind of meta hilarious in a sense because I&#8217;m trying to teach my students how to design interactive systems like that. There are parts of it that are bad that come with the good, but I&#8217;d say overall it&#8217;s been going well. And despite currently maybe potentially having to fail one student if they don&#8217;t show up next week, it&#8217;s been going overwhelmingly good, I think. But ideally I would like to make it to the end of semester without failing anyone. I definitely did not set out to do that when I started teaching, so it&#8217;s kind of unfortunate that they&#8217;re just not participating or engaging. And I certainly don&#8217;t want to make any assumptions as to why they&#8217;re not doing it or assuming that they&#8217;re a delinquent of some kind because they may have things going on as a student that I just don&#8217;t know about and probably never will. But I did try to make an effort to reach out to that person and be as supportive as possible, as opposed to being punitive and penalizing, despite having to uphold the rules of my syllabus in the classroom and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I was an adjunct for two years. I think I taught for two years. It&#8217;s 2012 through 2014, I think. I taught a web development course to business majors, and it was a BIS course, like business information systems. And I get that struggle that you&#8217;re talking about, like, you go into it. Well, for me, I think the Virgo in me wanted to be like, &#8220;hey, this is all wrong.&#8221; Like, the way that you&#8217;re teaching. I remember going to the dean, like, the first week saying, &#8220;we are setting these students up to fail if this is what we&#8217;re teaching them, because this is not what we use out in the real world.&#8221; Like, if this is what you&#8217;re teaching business students, they&#8217;re going to go to a company and get laughed at, or they&#8217;re going to try to apply for a job and no one&#8217;s going to hire them.</p>
<p>And I offered to redo the whole rubric. I&#8217;m talking about the grading, the tests, the lessons. I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;ll redo it and make this into my course that I think they should have.&#8221; And they were like, &#8220;okay, it&#8217;s fine. We don&#8217;t care.&#8221; And also in that same vein, yeah, you go into it not wanting to fail anyone, and it&#8217;s going to happen. It&#8217;s going to happen. It&#8217;s one of those sad eventualities, and it&#8217;s because, oh, how could I put this and I don&#8217;t mean this in a derisive way, but students will always try to get one over on their professor. They always will. It doesn&#8217;t matter how old they are or anything. They will always try to get one over on their professor. They will give you all kinds of excuses just out of everywhere as to why something did get done, why something didn&#8217;t get done. In this case, the syllabus is your friend. The syllabus is the contract between the professor and the student to say, if you&#8217;re in this class, these are the things that you have to do in order to succeed in the class. And we had office hours. Students would come to office hours and would wonder why. And it&#8217;s not that office hours were included in their grade, but then they would come at the last minute, like, &#8220;oh, well, can we meet on this day?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;well, that&#8217;s not my office hours. &#8220;My office hours are on the syllabus because I&#8217;m also a working designer, so I can&#8217;t go out of my way.&#8221; You want to help the students because you&#8217;re their teacher, so I get that.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s going to be an inevitability that you&#8217;re going to have to fail someone. Students are going to go cry bloody murder to the dean or to whatever, because you&#8217;re not fair. You&#8217;re a bad teacher. They&#8217;re going to leave bad reviews. It&#8217;s going to happen. It&#8217;s going to happen.</p>
<p>The best thing that you can do is to follow your syllabus, teach the students that are receptive, because there&#8217;s just going to be some people you&#8217;re just not going to reach. Because I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;re doing this in person. Yes, there&#8217;s just going to be people that you&#8217;re just not going to reach. I think ours was a mix of in person and online, and the online students were the worst. I mean, copying straight from Wikipedia. I&#8217;d run it through TurnItIn and get 99% plagiarized. I&#8217;m just like, oh my God. And they would swear to you up and down that they wrote it. And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;I can look at the quality of your written posts in the forum and tell that you didn&#8217;t write this. Don&#8217;t lie to me.&#8221; But it&#8217;s one of those things, unfortunately, that&#8217;s just going to happen.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting that you say that because one of the things that I had done that I had conversations with some people about when I was developing all the content, because the college basically kind of they didn&#8217;t really direct me on. Basically, it was like, here&#8217;s the course description. Here&#8217;s a sample of a syllabus that&#8217;s been used previously. Make it your own. So I had a lot of academic freedom, I guess, in that sense of being able to develop the materials the way I wanted to do it. Because, like you were kind of saying when I took this very same course when I was a student, it was not very good. One of the courses I actually took ended up being so bad that I actually went to the dean as a student, complained about the course, got a refund and then still got the credits for the course.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>But I was also a fairly advanced student because I had already had prior experience. I had already kind of known some of the things that were out there that were happening. I also spent a lot of time investing in my learning and education outside of the classroom. So I was very aware of where the college was doing well and not doing so well at the time. And so now coming back into it, I kind of had the same mindset of like, there is no way I&#8217;m doing it this way, I&#8217;m going to do it my way. Which ultimately creates a lot of work for me in terms of having to come up with all the content and things like that. But it&#8217;s also just been kind of like an interesting way to think about my design skills in a different light in terms of designing for instruction and learning as opposed to making profit off of people, I guess. Yeah, so that&#8217;s been kind of interesting.</p>
<p>And then on the topic of plagiarism, one of the areas that I talked to people about is, like, using generative AI. I kind of went into it with a mindset of, like, I would rather students use it and use it liberally and experiment with it and not be afraid of it. But come to me with questions because I think ultimately, if I was to put in my syllabus, there&#8217;s no use of generative AI allowed one. It&#8217;s really hard to detect whether someone&#8217;s using it or not, unless, to your point, you&#8217;ve kind of gotten to know them a few weeks in. You can kind of see where people are at and kind of what they&#8217;re capable of to a certain extent. Right. But for me, it was kind of just like, I know. And I told them on the first day, I was like, when we were going over key parts of the syllabus, I was like, I know that you are going to use generative AI probably whether I allow you to or not.</p>
<p>So just use it, but be conscious of how you&#8217;re using it. Cite your usage of it when you do, and provide documentation to me so that I can see how you&#8217;re using it. Because there may be parts like kind of we were talking about where it could be harmful or misleading or maybe it&#8217;s not giving them the right information that they need and things like that. So that&#8217;s been kind of an interesting thing to also navigate. There are a few students who I suspect of using generative AI without disclosing it according to the rules of our syllabus. But for now, I&#8217;m kind of letting it slide, mostly because I just haven&#8217;t gotten that sense of familiarity with where they&#8217;re at and being able to tell one way or another. And I also have seen the negative effects of accusing students of plagiarizing their work or doing something that they are capable of that you just don&#8217;t believe. And that can leave a really lasting and poor impression on students because I remember experiencing that once a little bit where because I was working at the printing company, I had access to all kinds of printing equipment, tools, materials, and quality paper, quality design.</p>
<p>I also did a lot of prepress. And so I knew what it took to design something and actually have it be printed in a way that is high quality. And for one of my first projects I did that, I tried to pull out all the stops, like my work let me use what was available. And when I brought in my project, I remember they didn&#8217;t believe the work that I did was really mine and that I actually bound the book, printed the book, designed it, and did all of that. And although it wasn&#8217;t as relevant to the conversation on generative AI, I still remember that to this day and feeling like, well, if I&#8217;m in a student in this scenario who&#8217;s really excelling at their projects and doing to the point where you don&#8217;t even believe the work is mine, then why am I here, right? You know what I mean? So I try to be very careful about who I accuse or not of using it. And I think ultimately at the end, if they are going to use generative AI to essentially cheat their way through my course, they&#8217;re not going to get the return on the educator investment that they&#8217;re putting in. So I think ultimately it all ends up in my favor anyway, but the initial impact of that may work in their favor in the short term.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t teach in the age of AI. I&#8217;m so glad because I can only imagine now that it&#8217;s and I mean, that was sort of a thing that came up a lot as sort of a stopping point for educators. Like, I think maybe about a year or so ago when Chad GPT really started to become used more commonly was in educational spaces. Professors really being like, prohibiting it, of course, but then also curious about it because the work is sometimes actually kind of good.</p>
<p>And yeah, it&#8217;s like if a student is going to mortgage their future away by using generative AI, why are you in school? Why are you even doing it? I mean, I taught business students, so these weren&#8217;t even design students. So maybe I came into it with a little bit of a bias because they really were just like, &#8220;look, this is an elective. I just need to take this so I can get my business degree and go get my MBA or whatever.&#8221; They didn&#8217;t really care about design. And not to say that I wanted to make them care about design, but I also didn&#8217;t want them to think this was going to just be a cakewalk for them.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Not to say I made it hard on well, I might have made it a little hard on purpose. I would kind of change the course as things went along because like I said, I came in and I really wanted to change things up. I would edit it from like, semester to semester. I would change some things up. And I remember this one student who I failed three times. Not on purpose. I didn&#8217;t fail them on purpose. What I&#8217;m trying to say but they failed the course three times, and it was because I would change the course slightly, like change certain things, and they would keep using the same homework and materials from the first time that they failed the course.</p>
<p>I would change the nature of the assignment, and they would just turn in the same thing. I&#8217;m like, did you not read what the assignment was? Why would you turn in something that&#8217;s completely different? Just&#8230;students. </p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Oh, my God, that&#8217;s so funny. I hope a year or two from now, when I&#8217;ve hopefully taught this class again, more in the future, that I don&#8217;t have students like that because I am a very patient and lenient person, and I often see the big picture of these things, I think, more than my students do. But I really hope I don&#8217;t get to that point because that&#8217;s when it&#8217;ll really start. Like, the shade will start coming out and&#8230;are you for real for real? You&#8217;re just gonna submit the whole same thing? I really hope I don&#8217;t get to that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll get to that point. Again, you&#8217;re teaching design students, so they want to be there for that for the most part. I think you&#8217;ll be fine.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it is a requirement. And one of the things that I did on our first day was do, like, a little intro survey to kind of understand where they&#8217;re at in terms of their interest in the topic of the course, but also how many hours they&#8217;re working outside of the college versus how many credits they&#8217;re taking. Mostly to make sure I&#8217;m saving students from the mistakes that I made when I started college, because I had no idea what I was doing. But it&#8217;s also just good contextually for me to know a little bit about each individual student because that may be one reason or another why they aren&#8217;t participating as much or miss a few deadlines here and there and things like that. So it&#8217;s good for me to have that kind of in mind here and there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Nice. Now along with teaching, along with your work at IBM, you not only stream on Twitch, which I really want to get into, but you have a podcast also. What made you decide to kind of branch out into these other forms of media?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>The way that I describe it to people is&#8230;I just like making shit and putting it on the internet. Oh, sorry, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m allowed to swear, but&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, you&#8217;re fine, you can curse. It&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>So that&#8217;s really kind of the mindset that I guess I kind of approached it with is just, I just want to make stuff and put it out there. Well, I guess I&#8217;ll start with, I don&#8217;t know, should I start with streaming or the podcast? Which one do you want?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about streaming first.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Okay, so for streaming, the way that it kind of happened is during the pandemic, like at the height of lockdown and quarantines and things like that, we were all stuck inside for the most part. And originally I had started as a viewer on Twitch like most people do, and I would primarily watch people play video games and they were mostly within the queer community. I am a gay man for context. I don&#8217;t know if I talked about that yet, but yeah, I&#8217;m queer as fuck. And I just started watching queer streamers on Twitch who play games and I started playing with them and then I forget what it was that really kind of crossed me over in terms of the boundary of going from Twitch to entertainment, but now as a way to learn more about web development and design, because there are a few of us that stream about design on Twitch, myself included. And then there&#8217;s also quite a few and quite a bit more people who stream web development and software engineering within the software and game development category, which is typically where I stream as well. And probably like a year into being a viewer, that&#8217;s when I started to think about, well, I&#8217;m stuck at home, I&#8217;m doing some freelance and consulting work here and there, I&#8217;m doing my own thing. Let me just start like a co-working stream and see what happens and just share my work. </p>
<p>And then, because I had been so embedded in the Twitch community and the streamers that I had watched some of which who were still very much my good Judys, as I like to say to this day, even outside of streaming. One of them actually, coincidentally ended up living down the street from me during parts of the COVID quarantine, which is also hilariously coincidental. But those people from the queer gaming community really gave me the viewership that I needed and that initial push of support to become a Twitch affiliate. So that&#8217;s basically at the point where you can monetize your stream a little bit, you can have subscribers make emotes and do things like that. That happened within the first two weeks of me streaming and everyone was just so extremely supportive despite having little to no idea what my content was or what I was actually streaming because I was streaming my design work and some of my process. And then one thing led to another and probably now I&#8217;m a little bit more removed from that kind of like queer gaming part, but I still do participate in some of the communities and lurk in some streams here that I like to support here and there.</p>
<p>But then I started to really find more of the software and game development community and all of the streamers, and now some of them are also like my friends. I met some of them at TwitchCon last year for the first time, which was really great, and actually this year, later this month or in October, I&#8217;m going to TwitchCon again and we&#8217;re actually going to do a panel about programming on Twitch. And so I don&#8217;t have a significantly huge viewership around my stream or anything like that, but the people who do come and who hang out and who stay, whether it&#8217;s other streamer or viewers that I&#8217;ve had for years now, some of them have been subscribed to me for over, like, three years. And I&#8217;m like, oh, wow, this is crazy. Thank you so much for your support. And some of those people still to this day have no idea what I do, but they just support me and who I am and what I like to share and put out there. And so it&#8217;s been a really interesting and net positive way of putting myself out there. Kind of like how you&#8217;re talking about in terms of building my personal brand, I guess you could say.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of taken on, I guess its own thing, I guess. I definitely don&#8217;t do it as much as I used to just because now that I work full time and IBM doing my own course, it&#8217;s really hard for me to stream on a regular basis as much as I used to. And so as a result, my viewership and other metrics have kind of gone down since the kind of height of my streaming career, if you want to call it that. But I still do it for funsies and I always did it for fun and I never really cared about the metrics anyway because all I really just wanted to do was just make stuff and put it on the Internet. And so streaming just happened to be the lowest barrier to entry, coincidentally enough for me to do that because when you&#8217;re live, you&#8217;re live. It&#8217;s not like a recording like this where maybe we could potentially edit out some things or something like that. For me, it&#8217;s like what you see is what you get. And also, at the same token, I don&#8217;t have to worry about editing, I don&#8217;t have to worry about scripting or being like a perfectionist on it, which kind of can take away the fun because sometimes I do have that nature about my work.</p>
<p>And so for me, it&#8217;s a fun way to put myself out there to share what I know. And also it&#8217;s part of the reason why I think I&#8217;ve become a bit of a better public speaker, why IBM more willing to engage with public speaking opportunities, do things like this. And also people have learned things from my stream, which kind of goes back to the whole you might be a good teacher someday. And so people on my stream have literally told me like, oh, I&#8217;ve learned so much from you, or thank you so much for your feedback on my work, or something like that. And it&#8217;s just become a really positive outlet, I think, for me whenever I get to do it, just not as frequently as I used to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Is there like a big web development community on Twitch? I mean, like you said before, there&#8217;s obviously gamers and such, but it sounds like there might be a pretty big community there for web development.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I would say so. We&#8217;re relatively unknown, I would say, in terms of the grand scheme of Twitch, but there are some people who have an upwards of an average of 200 viewers and there are some people who have upwards of 1500 viewers when they&#8217;re live.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>And they could be doing anything from coding in Rust or building a silly website with animations and things like that. One of my really good friends, mewtru, I think she&#8217;s like the perfect example of how you can be a streamer and a content creator and have fun and just like, she&#8217;s just really awesome. And I met her through streaming and we&#8217;ve kind of become good friends since then. And we&#8217;ve always been supportive of one another despite not really even knowing or meeting each other up until Twitch last year. And so, yeah, it&#8217;s just interactions like that with people, whether they&#8217;re fellow streamers or viewers, it creates a community around what we&#8217;re doing. And even though I&#8217;m a designer mostly by trade, I still kind of, I guess, hold my own in terms of programming and web development. And my stream is kind of unique in the sense where I add a design lens to things from that. Again, how are you talking about the design, engineering and hybrid perspective that I think a lot of people in the category may not have except for a very small handful of us.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Twitch sounds like one of the rare places online now, like in 2023, one of the rare places where you can really carve out a niche for yourself. Because with things like Instagram and Twitter and things like that, a lot of stuff is very algorithmically driven. And it feels like, at least from what you&#8217;re telling me, Twitch is really more community based in that way.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&#8217;s actually perfect because that was going to be like my next soapbox to get on. When it comes to creating content on Twitch is&#8230;the way that I frame it to people is Twitch is kind of unique as its own brand of social media, like you were kind of thinking about earlier, because it has kind of its own unique culture, to be quite honest around it with emotes and chat and how people interact with the streamer while they&#8217;re live. There&#8217;s also the kind of aspects like you were talking about around community where people who are creating content on TikTok and YouTube and podcasts and even blog articles, any form of media that you put out there. A lot of it is a one way interaction and a lot of people do it with the goal of building an audience that then they can later monetize. But with streaming on Twitch specifically, what I found is that what you&#8217;re really doing is building a community because discovery and algorithms and search on Twitch kind of suck, to be quite honest. That&#8217;s why a lot of people don&#8217;t really know there&#8217;s a whole community of us out there. But for the ones that do know and for the ones that discover us, they tend to stick around and they tend to support what we do, even if they may not like all of the content that we stream.</p>
<p>When I first started streaming one day out of the week, on Sundays, I would just stream League of Legends, which is a game that I like to play for fun with some of my friends. It had nothing to do with the content that I streamed two days a week during the day when I was coworking and things like that. But for the people who wanted that, they came and they stuck around and then when I was streaming other stuff, sometimes they would still come and hang out anyway. And so it really builds on that two-way interaction that I think a lot of people don&#8217;t get from other social media platforms that Twitch is really good at enabling. And in hindsight, it also kind of really aligns with, I guess, desire, you could say, to have a two way interaction with people and not feel like it&#8217;s just a transaction of like this post or subscribe to my newsletter and things like that. It really is a two-way interaction and I&#8217;ve created some really great friends out of it, some of which have helped me with the course that I&#8217;m doing right now, some of which I&#8217;ve helped with their content and vice versa. And it&#8217;s really created a nice little community around what I do, even if my particular streamer and viewership isn&#8217;t as strong as it used to be, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Interesting. There was a time when I was thinking of doing a live show via Twitch for Revision Path. Like I was thinking of doing Revision Path Live like one day a week. This was before the pandemic. If we manage to get the resources to be able to do it, I would love to try to branch into doing something like that because like you mentioned, it&#8217;s a totally different sort of dimension in terms of reaching people and then also in terms of communicating. </p>
<p>Like this conversation that you and I are having will be edited. If it was live, it could be a totally different thing in terms of where the conversation goes and what we talk about or anything like that. So I&#8217;ve been thinking about it, I&#8217;ve really been putting a little bit of thought into it, if we are able to do it. I&#8217;m kind of working on some things behind the scenes just in terms of securing funding for the show and stuff. So I would love to do a live thing maybe like once a week or something as sort of a supplement to the podcast because the podcast has been such a constant thing over the past ten years and we&#8217;ve had blog articles here and there. We did a literary anthology for a couple of years and I would love to sort of add a different sort of component to Revision Path. But yeah, Twitch sounds like it could be it.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s great. And honestly, it may not even have to be Twitch. It could be another live platform. I mean, obviously if you want help with that, definitely feel free to reach out to me. I could probably help you in some way or another. One of the things that just in hindsight that I caution people about is there are some people who maybe come from other platforms and they&#8217;re trying to diversify their viewership, their audience and things like that. And one of the mistakes that I&#8217;ve seen and that people make, what they tend to do, especially if they come from YouTube, is they still treat Twitch like an audience and not a two-way interaction.</p>
<p>And so what you get is people streaming their content and talking into the void, but they&#8217;re not interacting with chat, they&#8217;re not engaging with the people that are there. And that&#8217;s where I think a lot of people tend to maybe fail, I guess you could say, or not get the results or outcomes that they want out of streaming. And mostly it stems from, I feel from my very limited anecdotal evidence and observations that the reason is because a lot of them just aren&#8217;t used to that mindset shift, whereas for me it just kind of happened naturally because I started my content creator journey on Twitch. And so now when people come from other platforms, it may not, I mean people in general tend not to convert between one platform for another. So if you have a really strong audience in one type of media or platform, like the podcast for example, it&#8217;s going to be really hard to get people to move over to something else and that&#8217;s universally regardless of which type of social media or interaction you have with your audience. But it is challenging and it&#8217;s especially challenging for people to go into live streaming on Twitch for that reason I believe too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>No, that&#8217;s good to know. I mean, like I said, if I did it, it would be a supplement to the show and also honestly for scheduling it would be so much easier. I think it will be so much easier but in the future we&#8217;ll see. But since we&#8217;re talking about podcasting, you also have a podcast that you said you started kind of during the pandemic.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. So that kind of ended up just starting as kind of like an inside joke between me and a really close friend of mine, Kevin, who&#8217;s my co-host on our podcast Gay + Geeky and Tired. Hashtag ad. And we started, you know, during the height of the pandemic amongst all the other content creation things I was doing for fun. A lot of times the way I would socialize with my friends during the pandemic was through discord and with my friend Kevin in particular, we would have a group of us, some of us, I met my friend Kevin while I was in college, which was part of Know ancillary college experience. And so a lot of our friends would just joke with me and him about how we should make our own podcast and how we talk about so many things around current events and pop culture and queer culture and society and things like that. And so particularly music and gaming are like two kind of key areas that we tend to talk about a lot. And at one point I think we were kind of just like &#8220;should we do it? Should we do this? Is this for real? Should we really make a podcast?&#8221; And then long story short, we did. We ended up releasing the first episode, I think on my birthday in June of 2021.</p>
<p>It started as Gay + Graphic and Tired because initially, well, we&#8217;re kind of both in the design trade but he more approaches it from like an architecture perspective where I&#8217;m more user experience and so we thought that would be a cute title and then we ended up changing it to what it is now. But we talk about all kinds of stuff. I just explain it to people. It&#8217;s like we just talk about gay shit. We do it very casually. It&#8217;s very unscripted, unfiltered. We come prepared with some topics; we tend to rant a lot. It&#8217;s a little all over the place and you probably won&#8217;t like it, but for the people that do, and some of them have come from my twitch audience as well, they listen to it whenever we release an episode because it is something we do for fun and something we don&#8217;t really monetize.</p>
<p>We have had some spurts and lack of consistently or consistency around posting, especially recently now because of my adjunct role and the kind of demands that both of our jobs now require of us. But we are looking into getting back into it and for the most part we&#8217;ve been putting out episodes pretty consistently now since then. So we don&#8217;t really have a posting schedule or anything at the scale that you&#8217;re doing with Revision Path. But again, it just kind of started as one of those things that we wanted to do for fun and we still do it for fun and probably will until we don&#8217;t want to anymore. That&#8217;s what it is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now have you found that that sort of helped you out in a similar way that Twitch streaming has in terms of communication?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>I think so. I would say Twitch definitely moreso because there is kind of like you&#8217;re talking about that multisensory experience of like you&#8217;re visually there talking to people and then they can obviously hear you because it&#8217;s a video format. I would say, with a podcast, because we have the luxury of being able to edit it and because they can&#8217;t see us. There&#8217;s aspects of it that outside of the technical parts of learning what it takes to produce a podcast a little bit and some tips and tricks here to edit audio and understanding what that process looks like. I&#8217;m not, like, an audio engineer or anything, and I&#8217;m sure your editor could probably do way better than I can at editing our pod, but it&#8217;s just one of those little technical skills that I&#8217;ve always just been able to pick up really quickly just to do something and get it out there. And nobody really complains about our audio, so I think it&#8217;s okay. And outside of that, I would say I&#8217;ve definitely gotten more personal growth and value out of streaming. But for the podcaster thing, I think it&#8217;s also just half of it is just an excuse for me and my friend to get together on Discord and just talk a bunch of crap.</p>
<p>So it has had value but in less, I guess, tangible monetary ways.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s more like it&#8217;s a personal thing. It&#8217;s cathartic. I got you. Okay, what does success look like to you at this point in your career?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>When I was listening to some of the episodes with some other people, I figured this one was coming and of course I did not prepare a very well-worded response. I think success is a really tricky word and the way that I tend to think about it and the way that I frame it to people is that success is different for everyone. And for me, it&#8217;s not necessarily tied to a monetary amount of money or becoming a millionaire or doing anything like that. I think ultimately my idea of success is being able to have a positive impact on the world and the people around me, whether that&#8217;s in small ways or big ways, whether I become some notable designer, Lord, someday or something, I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t care. But just being able to have a positive impact with people, preferably through my profession and personally, and being able to do that sustainably, I think. So although money is not like a motivating factor for me, it is just a reality of the world that we live in. And there are certain ways, like when it comes to the lifestyle that I want and the flexibility that I want and the security and things like that, to where money does play a role in it. But it&#8217;s not necessarily my sole motivator, I guess, like kind of going back to the key takeaway that we were talking about, it&#8217;s really lifting as I climb.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s just been something that especially ever since I got my job at IBM, it&#8217;s something that I take maybe a little too seriously. Because I recognize that there is an immense amount for someone like me who is a queer black person who may not have had the most affluent upbringing, but somehow managed to have this beautiful story of overcoming adversity and all that stuff. There are elements that I still recognize are due to elements of privilege in some way because it&#8217;s on a spectrum. And so there are privileges that I&#8217;ve had, there are opportunities that I&#8217;ve had because of that. But there are also ways that I may have been disenfranchised or oppressed, whether internalized myself or externally.</p>
<p>And so lifting as I climb is kind of a way that I like to give back and uplift people in ways that I can, where I have the power and privilege to do so. Like, one of the ways that I try to do that is, right before coming on the podcast, someone who I&#8217;d went to college with at Bunker Hill actually reached out to me and said, like, &#8220;hey, I saw you posted about consulting opportunities at IBM. I want to learn more about your role and what you do and how to apply and things like that.&#8221; And although I&#8217;m not in a position to hire them outright, I can at least meet with them, give them feedback on their portfolio, give them some advice, insight into what it&#8217;s like, and really just mentoring people. And that brings me joy, that brings me satisfaction. I feel like I&#8217;m helping people. I think that&#8217;s why I also like teaching so much. It&#8217;s a way to just be successful, but also make others successful with me as I go. I guess. Does that make sense?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>If it makes sense to you, it makes sense. It makes sense. It makes sense. I&#8217;m not messing with you. If you didn&#8217;t get into UX, what do you think you&#8217;d be doing?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Oh boy. To be honest, if it had started the other way around, I probably would have been a web developer. It&#8217;s probably the closest alternative, I guess. And then maybe my roads would have crossed elsewhere into UX design later on. Probably, like, out of the wild the answer would be maybe working somewhere in a nonprofit or in healthcare or in the public market somewhere like either, again, teaching &#8212; maybe not teaching design &#8212; but teaching in some form or fashion design. And it&#8217;s just something that&#8217;s been with me that I known I&#8217;ve wanted to do in some fashion or another ever since my vocational training in 9th grade. And that kind of hyper fixation and just knowing what I want to do that early has really propelled me to go really far, at least relatively to people in my age group, I guess you could say.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;d never really considered alternatives outside of maybe becoming a web developer and leaving design or potentially becoming a teacher. But all of those things still include design, I guess, in some way, now that I&#8217;m doing both of those things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Where do you see yourself in the next five years? Like what kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>One of the things that I&#8217;ve been thinking about recently, aside from my craft and that intersection of design and engineering is just putting my design skills and knowledge to work in places where I feel like it aligns with my values. And so I&#8217;m trying to move towards, at least within the short term in some way, moving towards doing more consulting projects and gigs with public sector institutions, so education institutions, colleges, local and state governments, healthcare providers, things like that. And I want to do that because as close as I can get to, I guess, public service, while still very much maintaining what I do as a designer and being able to bring value there in terms of inclusive design where I can add intersectionality and a lot of those things, like socially, that some people don&#8217;t always get the opportunity to bring to their work or maybe just aren&#8217;t to because they don&#8217;t represent or have the identities that intersect in the way for the people that they&#8217;re designing for, I guess. So I guess it would be being a design consultant in some shape or form, working with local and state governments, educational institutions or healthcare.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, your work, your streaming, your podcaster? Where can they find that information?</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Online I basically compiled if you want to know where I am on the Internet, basically just go to mannyikomi.com/links. It&#8217;s kind of like my own IBM a web developer, so I&#8217;m going to make it myself version of Linktree essentially. And that just lists all of my links to places where I show up online, including my blog, my stream, my podcaster, my portfolio is also there on my website if it&#8217;s even vaguely up to date. Yeah, I would say mannyikomi.com/links will take you to anywhere I am on the internet that you may also be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Sounds good.</p>
<p>Well, Manny Ikomi, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. </p>
<p>I think one for talking about your story, talking know, just sort of what you&#8217;re working on and even what you&#8217;re teaching and everything. I feel like you&#8217;re kind of at this point in your career where it&#8217;s all going to start to come together for you like in the next few years. I feel like it&#8217;s all going to gel. I&#8217;m listening to what you&#8217;re doing now and that it sounds like kind of what I was doing back in the day. Like I was trying to do all these different things and creating stuff and putting it online. I feel like you&#8217;re at that point where it&#8217;s really going to start to come together and gel in a really positive way and I&#8217;ll be really excited to see what you come up with when that happens.</p>
<p>So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Manny Ikomi:</b></p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me. This was fantastic. I&#8217;m just so obsessed with what you&#8217;re doing. I think this is great and maybe hopefully one day I&#8217;ll have the kind of impact that you&#8217;re having right now on the community. I think it&#8217;s really cool what you&#8217;re doing. So thank you so much for having me. This is really an honor to be here.</p>

<p>December is a good time to take stock and think about how to approach the new year ahead. And for this week&#8217;s guest, Lawrence Humphrey, this year was about striking out on his own and starting <a href="https://www.pearl.us.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Pearl</a>, a peer-based leadership consulting platform where he serves as CEO.</p>
<p>We began by talking about the origin story of Pearl, and Lawrence walked me through the platform and spoke on how collaboration is a big part of how he makes everything work. He also shared how he started out as an engineer, talked about how his tenure at IBM inspired him to found <a href="https://tcdb.webflow.io/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Tech Can [Do] Better</a>, and gave recognition to those who have helped him achieve the success he has today. According to Lawrence, the best outcomes are a result of bringing diverse people together &#8212; a great message that we can all take to heart!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Hi, yeah, so I&#8217;m Lawrence Humphrey. I&#8217;m founder, CEO of Pearl, and I as a very new startup, very stereotypically, I do everything from setting the strategy, building the team, to executing against the strategy, executing it against myself, to taken out the trash and cleaning up the floor, so to speak. So very much the stereotypical start-up journey right now. But yeah, I do it all. It&#8217;s been really exciting. As a nosy person, I love being able to stick my nose in everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2022 been going so far? I feel like the second half of this year has been plagued by news about tech layoffs and things like that. How have you been holding up?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, this has been a very, let&#8217;s say, uncomfortable year, but not, obviously there are the greater, as you mentioned, societal forces making people uncomfortable, the job uncertainty. I am one of the people that quit my job this year to go full-time with Pearl. So my discomfort is more for from, and I get discomfort and excitement for having taken that leap. And I mean this is my first rodeo, so to speak. So I&#8217;m excited, and it&#8217;s very much, and I don&#8217;t have kids, but I have so much optimism for this kid and I&#8217;d want to make sure I raise them in order to be, I want it to be successful. So that&#8217;s been a super fulfilling journey and definitely a venture into uncharted territory for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, anytime you step out there and do your own thing for the first time, it is equal parts like exhilarating and terrifying. You have so much freedom, but you also really want to make sure that it actually succeeds.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
And I&#8217;ve been telling people that both the highs and lows are much more, they have a higher magnitude. I feel the highs more. I mean, because they&#8217;re my doing, this is because of direct output from my input, which the same could be said for the lows. So I&#8217;m getting used to the swings and trying to approach them with more equanimity, so not get necessarily as whipped around by them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, going into next year into 2023, do you have any kind of big resolutions or goals that you want to accomplish?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I mean, the big one and very practically is to be working on Pearl and that&#8217;s like the low-hanging fruit. Ideally, and I haven&#8217;t quantified this yet, I haven&#8217;t actually run the projections, but I would like for there to be a healthy amount of organic collaboration instead of me, let&#8217;s say heavy handedly really, really guiding people&#8217;s hand using the platform. Ideally we would have some early evangelists and the early adopters, just really giving us good data, using it, driving value from it. Beyond that, I mean I&#8217;m very shortsighted right now with just making sure that the business is set up for success long term and doing what, and I haven&#8217;t done my 2023 strategic planning yet. That&#8217;s going to be the next few weeks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s talk more about Pearl, which I see here is described as &#8220;a platform that makes finding actionable hiring solutions from vetted and diverse leaders easy.&#8221; Tell me more about it.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
So this is born from, and it&#8217;s kind of without getting into the full origin story, maybe we&#8217;ll get there. The observations that I&#8217;ve seen, are we have no shortage of collaboration tools, a lot of which come to mind, let&#8217;s say the Slacks, the Teams, even HBR articles to get thought leadership.</p>
<p>But there is a shortage of solutions that A, get us out of our own echo chambers into finding, I mean really practically, let&#8217;s say what do women think about hiring? Where are women hiring, et cetera. And also the follow-up to that is a lot of it is quote unquote like thought leadership and not the boots on the ground practical work, the practical instructions and recipes that these users or these leaders have used in order to drive results.</p>
<p>And I see these both working together in this very pernicious cycle of we continue to reinvent the wheel, we&#8217;re slower in terms of delivering outcomes, we deliver worse outcomes. People feel like worse leaders because they&#8217;re not getting connected to the work that in most cases already exist from the leaders that have done it. So that&#8217;s the opportunity that I see with Pearl. And we&#8217;re starting with a problem that all leaders have or will face hiring. So this is where we&#8217;re at the first step of our journey in proving out our value prop. So without getting into the origin story, that&#8217;s what Pearl is here to solve.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, look, get into the origin story. Where did the ideas sort of come from?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
So for that, it starts two years ago and the name of that org was Tech Can [Do] Better. And the week after George Floyd was murdered, I was still working at IBM and I noticed how my company at the time and the tech industry, and not just the tech industry, but that&#8217;s just where I live and breathe. They threw their hands up and they were bemused about what could be done to drive racial equity and what ways are we perpetuating it, how could this happen? And I got really frustrated at the confusion and how frantic the industry was knowing that I&#8217;d been on the inside with some of my coworkers, predominantly other black tech employees, advocating for what racial equity looked like within our company. And it felt like at the time we just got pats on the head. And Tech Can [Do] Better was my response to basically remove any obstacle that a tech company could have, like I don&#8217;t know what to do, where to go.</p>
<p>And I co-authored essentially a white paper with other black and brown folks from across the industry to outline very actionable steps about how to drive racial equity, whether you were an executive middle manager, independent contributor, anywhere in between, this is how you can get started with racial equity. And I think we hosted a dozen community calls, had people representing 50 companies from across the industry to help get each other unstuck. And that was when I realized that there was a demand and let&#8217;s say an overlooked opportunity and unsolved pain point for having very actionable perspective from black and brown perspectives, but even more broadly, it just exposed a lot of collaboration hiccups and we weren&#8217;t making it easy to get the answers we need. So it started there. And the other half of the story, I&#8217;ve been a leader with Pearl for almost two years, or a little over two years now.</p>
<p>And I find myself reinventing the wheel every day. And I mean hiring is just one of them. And I wrote the white paper for what diverse hiring looks like, and I assembled all of these diverse hiring sources and I still have trouble doing it. So even for me, very selfishly, I&#8217;m creating this tool to hopefully mitigate reinventing the wheel over and over again for all of these what I perceive to be mostly solved problems. I have to imagine hiring in any capacity is roughly 80% solved. And it&#8217;s just a matter of getting that answer and putting my own little Lawrence Humphrey customization on it, or Maurice, you customize it that last 20%, but I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of starting from 20% and then building out 80%, which is an abject waste of time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I see. I mean it&#8217;s interesting because you know mentioned that this sort of came out from the summer of 2020 and a lot of companies certainly had those pledges to quote unquote &#8220;do better&#8221; in whatever way that meant for them in terms of diversity and inclusion. And it feels like now two plus years out from it that some of those promises have kind of started to wane a little bit. Is Pearl kind of a way to hold companies like this accountable?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I will agree that I&#8217;ve seen the demand and let&#8217;s say the attention wane, and I wouldn&#8217;t say Pearl is a way to hold them accountable. I think Tech Can [Do] Better was more that than Pearl is. One of my philosophies is I think that as a designer, my design background here is if users will do whatever is easiest in most cases or whatever the system sets them up to do, and Pearl is an aim to make doing the right thing easier, I&#8217;d venture to say in my learnings with Tech Can [Do] Better, there are no shortage of people who want to be practicing racial equity at work, showing up in a more human way, building diverse teams, fostering inclusive collaboration.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just that they don&#8217;t have the tools, and let&#8217;s say the literal practical tools like the software and let&#8217;s say the soft skills tools to actually do those things. So Pearl is trying to make doing the right thing easier and less about accountability, pointing fingers, et cetera, et cetera. It&#8217;s assuming positive intent, and connecting people that want to be doing the right thing but not, might not know where to start.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m looking at the website now. I see you&#8217;ve got a great diverse team of advisors behind you. What does a regular day look like for you working on Pearl?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Being so early, and I&#8217;m sure it changes at some point, but every day looks really different and to the extent that I have any sort of consistency in my routine, it&#8217;s more location based. I love going to coffee shops, so I&#8217;ll go in the AM to the coffee shop to do my heads down, deep thinking work where I will do everything from craft social media, marketing outreach, to working on the product itself, to planning out what features need to be added, prioritizing from feedback that I heard in user interviews, what releases need to happen and when. And then in the afternoon, usually I have my calls either with my team, with potential customer discovery interviews, with my advisors, and that&#8217;s usually when I do my more, let&#8217;s say, not heads down work, but by and large the shape of each day from the outside might look similar. But what I&#8217;m doing is very different day to day. I mean, I can&#8217;t say I take many podcast calls right now, so already [inaudible 00:14:09] quite the variety that I&#8217;m getting right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, you got to get the word out about what you&#8217;re doing, so you have to do a little bit of press here and there.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, no, I 100% agree. And I had a release last Monday where I opened up Pearl to close family friends, I mean the social media, the people within my first, second degree connections. And I was joking that I feel like I need to go on tour now. I dropped my little EP and I&#8217;m shopping it around and seeing how it lands, getting people to listen to it, getting them to download my mix tape and all that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So let&#8217;s say that I&#8217;m a company or I&#8217;m a leader of a company that&#8217;s interested in Pearl, what does the onboarding process look like?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, so right now, and I guess it&#8217;s worth backing up and just talking through Pearl is a B2B and B2C, you can think of a GitHub or even a FigMore or Slack or something like that. So there are two avenues for which you can get engaged and I know you were talking about that B2B version. For that you can reach out to us and pilot with us and you can do that from our website. But the onboarding looks like an opening call where we can do some intros. I can tell you, I mean maybe if you are listening to this, I won&#8217;t have to tell you as much about Pearl, but we do some discovery to hear which pain points are you most struggling with. The few use cases that I identified are basically we&#8217;re helpful in smoothing out the transition between either people joining or leaving your team.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s say you are getting rid of some folks, which is timely, whether they&#8217;re either leaving or they got laid off, that work doesn&#8217;t just evaporate, it usually gets reallocated somewhere between the team. And it&#8217;s about helping them codify that work such that whomever is picking it up, it minimizes the time between zero to 60 and getting up to speed.</p>
<p>And then whenever they backfill that person, minimizing the friction of getting them caught up to speed. So that&#8217;s one use case. We&#8217;re also useful in kicking off projects that have multiple stakeholders either within or outside the company that require frequent and high-touch collaboration. So a couple of use cases that we talk out on that call and then fleshing out what success looks like at the end of a two to four-week sprint, it&#8217;s very much responding in the in-person just live in the meeting for where we can add the most value. Like I said, it&#8217;s more important to me to add value and see how folks are using Pearl, and it&#8217;s about figuring out where that sweet spot is between what problems they&#8217;re having and what I see Pearl being poised to solve.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the most challenging parts about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Oh, boy. I think that this might be, I&#8217;m just going to think out loud here and I might have to, I might discover the answer, so just more talking it out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Because this is my first rodeo, I feel like I have a strong intuitive sense for what I feel like needs to be done at any given time. At the same time, I&#8217;m grappling with the fact that practically and in reality, because I&#8217;ve not done this, I cannot fully trust my intuition for what should be done. And for that I have advisors and knowing when to pull them in, and I usually bounce ideas off of them, but it is just truly the, I&#8217;m meandering, like I said, into this uncharted territory with very little visibility of what&#8217;s in front of me. And it&#8217;s just navigating the ambiguity in a way that it makes me feel like I can confidently chart the course and bring other people in.</p>
<p>Luckily, I&#8217;ve had great advisors and because I don&#8217;t have a team of 100, I don&#8217;t really have to justify my decisions to many people. But sometimes it&#8217;s just like the day-to-day, I have no clue if this is going to work and I just try something, and if it doesn&#8217;t work, and I don&#8217;t mean no one likes failing, but it&#8217;s just I&#8217;m getting used to things not going according to plan more so than they do go according to plan. The self-management, I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the right way to say it, but just that keeping my own, keeping the wind in my own sails. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the way to say it now, I&#8217;ll probably think of a more eloquent way to say it as soon as we [inaudible 00:18:45]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But to keep that but to keep that motivation going essentially, right?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, and just like it is the age old, all right, &#8220;I tried six things, none of them went according to plan,&#8221; and you know have that day you get off a call where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;That did not go like I wanted it to go,&#8221; and at the same time tomorrow I&#8217;m going to get up and do it all over again. You got to keep pushing through. But yeah, that motivation&#8217;s huge.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I don&#8217;t know, as you were describing that, it sort of reminded me of that old Donald Rumsfeld quote about how there&#8217;s &#8220;known knowns&#8221; and there&#8217;s &#8220;unknown unknowns.&#8221; And it sounds like certainly I think with venturing into a start-up of something like this where you&#8217;re trying to, you don&#8217;t know what you don&#8217;t know, so even as you&#8217;re trying to build this product and build this company, there are other things down the line that you may encounter that you don&#8217;t really have an idea of. But that&#8217;s why you&#8217;ve got advisors to hopefully kind of help you out and to give you that foresight.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Exactly, and I mean it&#8217;s not an unknown phenomenon. There is, it always doesn&#8217;t work right before it does. And that&#8217;s what keeping me going. And I read another quote and I think it was, and this might be exposing one of my little guilty pleasures here, but there is this book called &#8220;Tiny Beautiful Things.&#8221; Cheryl Strayed, is this amazing writer, and I think she said in one of her books that &#8220;You just have to show up and do the work.&#8221; Like miners don&#8217;t show up and self-doubt like, &#8220;Oh I&#8217;m not a great miner, I don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m not good at this. What should I do about it?&#8221; They just show up and dig, and I just tell myself literally I have it written down. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;show up and dig.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I like that.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
It doesn&#8217;t really matter how you feel about it. Just do the work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, ultimately what would you see as success with Pearl? Let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know, a couple of years down the line, what do you see as being Pearl&#8217;s biggest success?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
A few years out, I would like to have the most actionable stop for workplace or leadership questions period, or challenges period. And those two pain points that I mentioned at the start, I do think they&#8217;re inextricably linked. So very practically, I am a pretty early mid-career professional black leader in a SaaS-based business, SaaS-based startup.</p>
<p>Disproportionately the solutions that you could find on the internet that you could talk to mentors about, all of its skews towards a couple of the majority demographics. So most leaders are white, most leaders are male, most companies are enterprises. These aren&#8217;t as helpful for me with all of those attributes that I mentioned. So if I could create a platform that allows you to find the most actionable solutions by the people who have done the work and are living it, I would consider that a huge win. And speeding up time and quality of outcomes or time to task, time to delivery, quality of outcomes, but also making leaders feel like, okay, I&#8217;m not the only one struggling with this.</p>
<p>There, I can find my little pocket of other similar leaders, and also burst, look outside of my bubble to see, &#8220;Okay, for this challenge I want to know how women are solving it.&#8221; I mean there are just some challenges that certain demographics are more poised at addressing than others.</p>
<p>I mean, rewind to 2020, I don&#8217;t want necessarily to know how let&#8217;s say white folks are solving racial equity in their workplace. I think that most people were looking for what are black and brown folks&#8217; solutions to hiring, to doing or to measuring impact of my product those sorts of things similar to the Me-Too era, men didn&#8217;t have as much of a place in that. That was a woman&#8217;s conversation. So if I can do that, that&#8217;s a huge win.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, we&#8217;ve talked a lot about your work, of course we&#8217;ve learned more about Pearl, but I want to learn more about you, about Lawrence. Tell me about where you grew up?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
So I grew up and Nashville, Tennessee. And it&#8217;s funny because I&#8217;m living in two of the trendiest places in the US right now, but back when I was growing up in Nashville, I was both underaged and it was underdeveloped. So I didn&#8217;t really experience the cool Nashville that a lot of people experience today. But I moved around a lot growing up, landed in Nashville in third grade and was there through graduation, and I was pretty into STEM but didn&#8217;t really know. And I think that this is a through line of my story, I didn&#8217;t really know what I wanted to do for a long time. I had a vague idea of I wanted to create something that impacts a lot of people. And at the time it was the scientist of the time, Nicola Tesla and Leonardo DaVinci and Newton and all these people that create things that change the world.</p>
<p>And then as I went through high school, I had a vague idea of what computer science was because I watched &#8220;The Social Network&#8221; all the time and I was like, this seems dope. Just being able to create stuff from your dorm room that scales, it impacts just millions, tens, hundreds of millions of people. This is awesome. And it just all started as a series of guesses. And I had a friend that we would just dream up these big ideas and he was more the design business guy. I was the tech person. And it wasn&#8217;t until, I mean honestly late college that I realized that okay, entrepreneurship, it is possible even though the path to do that was unclear. But yeah, I think that if I had to reflect on my story, I didn&#8217;t really feel like I had a lot of clear direction for what was possible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But you had that interest I guess from early on, like you said, right?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Oh yeah, I had the interest and a lot of it was gained through just guessing. And I guess media, as weird as that is, just like movies. I thought hackers were cool, I thought computer people were cool, people that built, like people in the STEM, I mean STEM always seemed like magic to me. So I was like, &#8220;This is dope.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know, I mean this might not be cool, like conventionally the cool thing to do, but it always felt really just impactful and magical.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, I think that&#8217;s really interesting. You know, mentioned the movie, &#8220;The Social Network,&#8221; that was, let&#8217;s see, that came out in 2010?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Like 2010, yeah,.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
2010? So that means you were probably in elementary and middle school in the early to mid-2000s, I&#8217;m guessing?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
So let me walk it back. I was definitely in high school when The Social Network came out because I was [inaudible 00:25:55]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, you were in high school then. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, I was doing my, I think my AP Bio homework. I had &#8220;The Social Network,&#8221; on my laptop and I would just play that movie over and over again, like that one and &#8220;Inception,&#8221; I watched those movies over and over again playing them while I was doing my homework.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s interesting that you mentioned that media was also kind of a thing that motivated you about this, because when I think about a lot of the media that sort of depicted tech during that time, I can go back probably as far as say like 1999 with &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; and then &#8220;Matrix Revolution,&#8221; or I forget what the others were.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Those movies were huge.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I remember even then, that was one of the movies I was watching a ton at the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But also the world wide web really started to, I don&#8217;t want to say mature during that time, but I graduated college in 2003 and I just remember that time from 2003 three to 2010 how there were new innovations in tech and design. It felt like every week there was something new. So progress was being made in such a quick pace that whether you were in it as an actual practitioner or even on the outside of it being the beneficiary of this technology, things were just moving at such a rapid pace. I mean, you think about print magazines, print magazines from 2000 to 2010 took such a sharp decline because of the rise of desktop publishing. And people could write blogs, they could make websites, they could use content management systems. So why would they have a print magazine?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Exactly. And I feel like the people, and obviously, I was mean, I don&#8217;t want to say obviously, but I was pretty young at the time, and I feel like there were beneficiaries of people who just got to create and go very hands on, and they rode that wave of let&#8217;s say digital literacy, and just that scrappy entrepreneurship and the Wild West of the worldwide web that was a mouthful.</p>
<p>But there are people that just made a lot of money and influence and clout and learned a ton, and that compounds. And I still think that there is a lot of opportunity in tech, which is why I&#8217;m so passionate about scaling my knowledge, and especially for black and brown people, underserved people, underrepresented folks, of raising our technical literacy because, I mean this, any sort of privilege it all compounds. So yeah, I just think that that was always so cool.</p>
<p>And I kind of keep going back to magic, like &#8220;Matrix&#8221; was literally just people defying physics and cracking the code. And &#8220;Social Network&#8221; just felt larger than life of how this, these gawky kids created this social network that literally changed the world of tech and connected everyone everywhere all at once. It was crazy. And I think that that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m really passionate about, is just scaling that knowledge, like I said, because it&#8217;s magic and it&#8217;s making a lot of people a lot of money and changing the landscape in ways that are for better and worse for some people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, and I think what it also did is it, I would say not just for black and brown people, but if we look at black and brown folks specifically, also really kind of helped change the mindset of us from being consumers to creators. Because now the tools, whether it&#8217;s the personal computer, or whether it&#8217;s even just learning the languages themselves, had become so easy to access that you could do these things now that you were seeing other folks do, and there weren&#8217;t any sort of real gatekeepers to get a lot of these things done.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking back, you mentioned 2010, CNN had this, they used to do this series on CNN called &#8220;Black in America,&#8221; and they would do &#8220;Black in America Two,&#8221; Black in America Three,&#8221; Black in America, Four.&#8221; And they would be focused on different things. And they had one that was &#8220;Black in America, Four&#8221; that focused on the rise of black folks trying to get into Silicon Valley. They called it the &#8220;New Promised Land,&#8221; and&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Is that like the &#8220;If you build it, they&#8217;ll come,&#8221; mentality?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. And it was so&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:30:11] age.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It was so interesting because I was watching that and not only were these people on there that were my age, Angela Benton and Wayne Sutton, et cetera, but I personally knew these people. I had met them, I had sat down and had dinner with them, and it&#8217;s like now they&#8217;re trying to accomplish these big huge, monumental goals, now. It&#8217;s really hard to capture that feeling or to recapture that feeling I think now maybe, but certainly back then it could have been very easy to really get swept up in the feeling that you could do this too, because you also just saw people that looked like you that were doing it Exactly.</p>
<p>And the tools were available, the opportunity was there. It was just a perfect storm.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
And I feel I very much subscribed to that last point you&#8217;re on, you can&#8217;t be what you can&#8217;t see. And I think especially when I was getting started, I kind of always consider myself a little out of the loop, but I struggle to find just role models that really fit tightly to my trajectory, let&#8217;s say.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been a little too counterculture for my own good. So it&#8217;s never been sufficient for me to just necessarily cut and paste someone else&#8217;s trajectory. But even still like, okay, I want to find someone who is threading the needle between being conventionally successful in business and obviously meeting the needs of the business, while also taking this social responsibility lens, who is also a young black leader who also, it&#8217;s all of these Venn diagrams that I&#8217;ve just struggled to find, and which is why I try to be, and I definitely jump at the opportunity to be something of a role model if I can, through mentorship, through podcasts like these, just to be the person that I wish I had.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now you mentioned going to college, you went to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. What was your time like there?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I think that it was, if I had to summarize it still me getting closer to what I felt like my fit was, maybe it is for a lot of people and for some people it clicks more than others. But I started in engineering, so my undergrad was in computer science and I realized pretty quickly that I didn&#8217;t feel like I fit there. Cultural reasons, and I mean demographic, I was one of the few black kids in my class, and in some cases one of the only black students in hundred-plus lecture halls, which exacerbated things a little bit.<br>
But even just the culture of it, in my opinion, the egomania of some of engineers, this wasn&#8217;t for me. And also it just didn&#8217;t feel very tactile. I didn&#8217;t feel, it all felt kind of abstract from time to time. But through that, met a lot of designers which began, light bulbs started firing, and so what that world looked like, found web development, which was the sweet spot of, okay, I can be an engineer that can think more about the user, what their needs are, what can add value for them.</p>
<p>And it was honestly through that web development, I rode that out for a while, and found the world of design through an internship at IBM, which you know in my opinion completely, I think everyone has like landmark milestones in their life. And interning at IBM was absolutely one of them, of &#8220;This is what design looks like at scale,&#8221; this is how these multidisciplinary teams collaborate.</p>
<p>It was so eye-opening, and I love the work that was being done there, and I guess I won&#8217;t say moreover, but equally loved the people from very junior to senior designers, Just all incredibly talented people, and with just huge hearts, great character. And that was around my senior year of college that I did that internship. And it was then that I was like, &#8220;Okay,&#8221; I felt like it started to click, that was the first time in my four or whatever years there that I felt like, &#8220;Okay,&#8221; this is the click that I was looking for. And I guess the three years before that where, I mean obviously I did projects here, I did a class there, but it was a lot of meandering, let&#8217;s say in hindsight until I found that click.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So after you graduated, you&#8217;d mentioned this sort of IBM internship and you stayed there for a long time. You were there for almost six years, starting off as an intern and then working your way up to becoming a strategist. When you look back at that time, what do you remember? Are there any sort of specific takeaways?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
So it can kind of be broken down into a couple chapters. So there was my early career internship, then we went through another onboarding, let&#8217;s say experience, they call them &#8220;boot camps.&#8221; That&#8217;s the one phase where it&#8217;s like starry-eyed early career, Lawrence, &#8220;the world is my oyster,&#8221; the same traps that all of these early 20 somethings succumb to. And then I was on a team for around three years. It was basically IBM design for AI, which is the intersection of design AI and basically consulting and facilitation.</p>
<p>But in essence we were creating technical, so how can non-technical teams get started with AI and create compelling, honest in the sense that this is what the technology can actually do implementation with AI. And amazing experience, and maybe one of the best ways that I could have started my career, on that team in terms of the work that I was doing.</p>
<p>And my boss at the time, extremely encouraging and just gave me a long leash. So I mean there was that chapter, and the next chapter was my tenure on the transformation team, which worked on enterprise wide transformation efforts predominantly in hybrid cloud AI and culture.</p>
<p>So the net of it was, I was doing a lot more consultative work, even on my AI team, the IBM design for AI. And that was when I realized that I just loved sitting in the middle and working in cross-disciplinary teams or multi-disciplinary teams, having high visibility projects, working with a lot of different stakeholders with big personalities. Basically translating the technical needs into layman speak into the needs of the business. And the kind of glib and story that I tell about it is I started in engineering, and then realized that designers tell engineers what to do. So I went into design and then in, or designers get told what to do by PMs and the business people. So I went into that lane. So I don&#8217;t know what you can make of that story, but that was how I decided to hop through those roles</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
From designer to engineer, I feel like that&#8217;s a journey of itself.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Engineer to designer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Oh, engineer to designer.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah. And even now I feel like both are pretty misunderstood titles. I would say design a little more so than engineering, but a lot of times people think, oh, shapes, colors, make things pop as a designer, which I am not that kind of designer. It was, I mentioned my first boss, and I just think that that was a great place for me to start because he built my, I mean both, he was a design executive, so he practically sharpened my skills as a designer, but really just gave me the confidence to go into rooms with very senior people and feel like my perspective had a place there.</p>
<p>So when I think about leadership, and I&#8217;m really passionate about leadership, there was a lot to be learned from the myriad of actual leaders, like reporting chain leaders, and just some of my mentors and peers. Everyone was just so generous with their perspective. There was a lot to learn in how to lead teams.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now when you started the organization, Tech Can [Do] Better, were you still at IBM or is this after you left?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
It was at IBM. So fun fact, and I recommend this to anyone that can pull this off, I ended up taking two leaves of absence to work on, the first one was Tech Can [Do] Better and work on that full time for three months. And the second one, I took a four-month leave of absence to work on what was Pearl, and I mean we reorged right in the middle of my leave of absence, but to work on that full time. And that second leave of absence was earlier this year when we got accepted into a start-up accelerator.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow. So IBM was pretty, it sounds like they were pretty supportive of what you were trying to do?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. And I mean even more specifically, my managers at the time, my leadership, and I mean if you know me, I don&#8217;t, for better or for worse, I think that I&#8217;m pretty obvious with what my intentions are and what my feelings are about, I think. It&#8217;s no secret how passionate I was about this, and how much Tech Can [Do] Better and Pearl meant to me, and I explained it to my managers that I felt like this was a once in a lifetime opportunity for Tech Can [Do] Better.</p>
<p>It was maybe a month or a couple months, I&#8217;m losing track of the time after the George Floyd incident and I was like, &#8220;Okay, the attention&#8217;s waning. I only have so much time before people move on and focus on the next thing. I need to focus on this in order to capitalize in this window.&#8221; And I mean they were receptive to that. And then the second one was, like I mentioned, I got accepted to a startup accelerator and I was like, this is a once in a lifetime thing. And I mean I was like, &#8220;I need to focus on this or I won&#8217;t be able to forgive myself.&#8221; So they were supportive of that. So to their credit, IBM and especially my leaders at the time, I give them nothing but my gratitude for that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Shout out to IBM.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I know, big shout out. And it&#8217;s so easy to just be greedy with talent like that. And I realized that I think I took two leaves of absence, maybe less than a year and a half or something apart I think. So that was, they didn&#8217;t have to do that, shout out to them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has both Tech Can [Do] Better and Pearl kind of been received by the tech community? Have you gotten any sort of valuable feedback to go into either the organization or to the product?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Oh, definitely. I mean, I kind of joked that I accidentally ended up in this leadership role, because when I was starting way back, 2020, when I was starting Tech Can [Do] Better, I would&#8217;ve never predicted that I would be on here right now still talking about it by any means, I mean you always hope so.</p>
<p>But that was unprecedented for me. I&#8217;d never done anything of that scale. And I put out a proposal, I mean I asked some of my usual suspects and some of my closest friends and confidants at the time, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m doing this thing, do you want in? I really could appreciate your help.&#8221; They helped out. I kept asking more people for help. Other people were asking if I needed help, and I was like, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Months later I ended up in Fast Company not knowing how I had got here in the first place.</p>
<p>And it was just overwhelmingly positive and people saying they spun up Tech Can [Do] Better chapters of their company, they gave the proposal to their executive leadership. I mean, it was incredibly surreal for me. I mean, like I said, everything was so novel, and I keep going back to, I have to imagine a lot of that came from just how actionable it was. I get personally really frustrated with all of the noise and just the content generation machine valuing quantity over quality.</p>
<p>And I like to think that a differentiator can just be okay, this is something that takes us beyond that 20%. If I hear another takeaway that&#8217;s like &#8220;Make sure to talk to your team,&#8221; or like, &#8220;Listen, or do your education, it&#8217;s all well intentioned, but it&#8217;s just so ambiguous and doesn&#8217;t help people get started,&#8221; that I have to imagine with Tech Can [Do] Better it was a breath of fresh air because we were going one level deeper, if not like two levels deeper, which informed Pearl.</p>
<p>I mean Pearl is the tech solution that is Tech Can [Do] Better at scale. So driving actionable change from diverse leaders, helping each other get unstuck and unblocked. I mean, it&#8217;s the product that allows that matchmaking to happen. So it is those learnings that I brought even into this new org. But yeah, it&#8217;s a lot of great feedback that, I mean a lot of this has just been listening and responding and reflecting, and doing my best to take in what the signal is, and what can make the product better and more valuable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In recent years, what would you say has been the biggest lesson that you&#8217;ve learned about yourself?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Oh man, I was not expecting that question, but I will say, and I think that just off the cuff there is a very thin line between what is a strength and what is a weakness and vice versa. I think that that&#8217;s the high level what I&#8217;ve learned about myself. And even more practically, and I have friends and advisors call me out about this all the time. I am a very big picture thinker and great, a lot of times people love visionary thinkers, big picture thinkers.</p>
<p>But I am slow and I struggle to get into the details and make it very, very real, and make it maybe in another way like very small so that you can touch it. For me, it has to exist in this universal principles, the big picture, this applies to everyone sort of thing. That&#8217;s like one example, of my what I think is a strength becoming a weakness.</p>
<p>I have other ones too, but it really is such a thin line. And also it&#8217;s just reinforcing to me that in order to change anything, any external thing, it really does start with you. I mean, right now I&#8217;m leading the org. I&#8217;m the first full-time hire, let&#8217;s say, I jumped full-time. But I have to manage my own morale, my own boundaries, my own timeline, my own organization.</p>
<p>And that predicts how well I can manage all of those other things for a team of people or one other person. And let&#8217;s say if I don&#8217;t take the five minutes before the call to get my talking points, it tends to not go well when I bring in whomever I want to bring in. So everything just starts with me. And obviously, I can only control me, but I&#8217;m just front and center every single day, for how my own actions manifest and shape the outcomes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the people that have really helped you get to this point in your career? I mean, no person is an island of course, but I&#8217;m curious who your support system has been throughout all this?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
It is kind of chapter dependent, early career, the people that got me at IBM, Adam Cutler, Greg Story, Phil Gilbert, a huge, Devin O&#8217;Brien. I mean really, either they got me to go into IBM or just really hands-on mentorship, far more than they needed to be for an intern at the time. Huge people. Then just naming names like Brad Neal, one of my co-founders of Tech Can [Do] Better. I mean, honestly, a big brother, if there is one.</p>
<p>He is just such a role model in composure and equanimity. And he and I chat pretty regularly and I always love his perspective. Moses Harris, Jill Soley, one of my advisors, Suresh, Fallon, Wayne, so my advisors now. I mean by and large, I need perspective, and I don&#8217;t do well just working by myself. So even if I&#8217;m not day-to-day working with someone, I&#8217;m always bouncing ideas off of people.</p>
<p>I mean, it might be a little trite or corny to say it, but my mom is such a reliable just, I mean she is my bedrock. I go to her for both practical and emotional support. So I mean, she is just the absolute best. So I mean her as well. I mean, of all the people who are the most reliable through lines, I mean she&#8217;s it. I love her to death.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If there&#8217;s someone out there that&#8217;s listening that kind of wants to follow in your footsteps, what advice would you give them?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I would say, and I was reflecting on this recently, that it&#8217;s not too early to start. I know a lot of people say it&#8217;s not too late to start, but I would say it&#8217;s not ever too early to start. I do think that, I know that a lot of people would say, I&#8217;m young, but I still spent time feeling like I needed permission to do things or I needed the credentials or credibility or I needed something.</p>
<p>I was missing something in order to just do that thing, and I regret it. And I wish that I just had&#8230; I heard it best once, &#8220;the confidence to be imperfect and the courage to be imperfect.&#8221; And I just think that life is short. You just got to do it. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for help. Don&#8217;t be afraid of failing or looking bad. Honestly, you are, by doing your own thing and following your path, you&#8217;re doing what a lot of people don&#8217;t, and I won&#8217;t say can&#8217;t do, but are slow to do it. And just following that fire that exists inside of you and just staying true to whatever that is. So it&#8217;ll be really fulfilling, and it&#8217;ll be a hell of a rollercoaster, but I think that that&#8217;s what makes life worthwhile. If you&#8217;re 80 years old and looking back at your time here that you&#8217;re going to be happy you did that stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything that you haven&#8217;t done yet that you want to do professionally?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I mean, get Tech-, I mean now Pearl to a place where it is I mean, it&#8217;s a mainstay, it&#8217;s a household name. I mean, that&#8217;s the obvious one. I just feel like there&#8217;s a lot of impact I haven&#8217;t yet made that is just ripe for the taking. I have also, I mean on a side note, and this could be a subject of a whole other thing, I have gotten really obsessed with writing comedy, and that is basically filming a show, that is a whole other thing, we don&#8217;t have to get into it here, but I&#8217;ve always&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, let&#8217;s get into it. Let&#8217;s get into it!</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I love the idea of, I mean, just writing a show or a movie or shorts and filming it, and specifically some sort of a comedy. Maybe like Atlanta Meets Nathan For You or something like that, I love stuff like that. But I honestly have no shortage of projects. But that&#8217;s been one of the ones that I haven&#8217;t been able to shake.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, the comedy writing sounds, I like that idea. Would it be something like, I don&#8217;t know for some reason when you said that, &#8220;Abbott Elementary&#8221; immediately came to mind, but would it be some kind of workplace comedy, something like that?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I&#8217;m honestly scared. I have a show that, I mean, I might actually film and every time, I&#8217;ve shopped it to a dozen or so people and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Dude, why aren&#8217;t you making this?&#8221; I&#8217;m honestly scared to give away my game right now. But I have a show, that let&#8217;s say is the style of the show will be more like mockumentary, let&#8217;s say. So it wouldn&#8217;t be a necessarily workplace, but I have maybe the whole first season stubbed out. Definitely, I&#8217;ve talked about it with a friend just shooting the pilot, because I even think I have the pilot mostly stubbed out. It&#8217;s just a matter of doing it. I don&#8217;t know, I just I&#8217;ve always wanted to try my hand at it. I mean, I know I&#8217;m being very vague, but&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, no, I get it. You don&#8217;t want someone listening to poach your idea. I totally get that.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I feel like I could be over-hyping it. I could be delusional, but this is such a good idea. Maybe someone&#8217;s already done it, but I need to release the pilot before I&#8217;m just out here talking about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look, that could be a good side project. You could work on that in your downtime.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, maybe these holidays when things slow down a little bit, I can get out there and just shoot a crappy pilot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There you go.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
But no, I think that that&#8217;s one of the ones, but I think that realistically, I just want to see Pearl succeed, obviously. And there are some quantitative milestones that I would love to hit. And there are some kind of qualitative things, I guess side missions, if you will, that are in support of that goal. Some of those goals that I would like to hit, I want to create a successful company, IPOs, exits or exits.</p>
<p>Obviously this is a long journey. I want to have a tool that is used by let&#8217;s say tens, hundreds, millions of people, that adds value, that changes the landscape, that spawns competitors, let&#8217;s say collaborative companies that do similar things. I just think that the land of the better collaborative software that focuses in on identity and personal context, because this matters, is pretty underexplored. And I say it&#8217;s to all of our detriment, and I&#8217;m going to see it through given this everything that I have. So to the extent that I have a life&#8217;s purpose, I feel like that&#8217;s my calling in addition to shooting the other show that I mentioned, but.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Well, this is kind of a good, I guess follow-up to that then, where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want your legacy to be?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I see those as two different questions, but five years, I would hope to have a team and wherever Pearl evolves from this, because obviously it will evolve. I&#8217;ll use Pearl as a shorthand for the mission that I&#8217;m on now. I want to have a strong leadership team, and I mean just both be practically doing good work, but even, I&#8217;ll say equally importantly, to the work that we&#8217;re doing, the value that we&#8217;re driving through our business, be role modeling a way of better leadership.</p>
<p>So I started Pearl because I felt like it would be more impactful to demonstrate through our actions, all of the recommendations and that we were espousing through Tech Can [Do] Better, than it was just to say them and recommend them. So I want the team to just be a team of all-stars who are just devoted to demonstrating a higher degree of leadership and holding ourselves the industry to a higher standard and five years.</p>
<p>I want that to be even stronger than I&#8217;m doing it today with an awesome just all-star group of people, many of whom I&#8217;ve already collaborated with and potentially some who might be listening to this, hopefully we all find each other.<br>
My legacy, I mean, as that&#8217;s a huge question. I do hope that in line with what I was mentioning before, I very much believe in the idea of leaving things better than we found it. And what that looks like for me is I feel like I owe so much to my ancestors, mostly black ancestors, very directly in my lineage. And let&#8217;s say my cousins, aunts, the folks around me who sacrificed a lot to get me here to where I am right now.</p>
<p>And I want to contribute to that chain of progress of making it easier for black and brown folks younger than me who follow me. Making it easier for them to have the opportunities to create widescale change and showing them that it&#8217;s possible, showing them that you don&#8217;t have to conform to someone else&#8217;s trajectory to do that.</p>
<p>You have the freedom to do it the way that is right for you, basically widening what is possible for people to be conventionally successful and what that actually means. And hopefully never sacrificing, I won&#8217;t say hopefully, hopefully this is conveyed through my actions, threading that needle between doing what&#8217;s right for the business and what is just societally responsible, whatever that looks like.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about Pearl, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, so best starting place for that is our website. So pearl.us.com, and you can find all of our links there to our LinkedIn, to our Instagram, to our app itself. Everything is, that&#8217;s the best place to start for my work. If you want to follow me similarly, you can follow me at lawrencehumphrey.com, so L-A-W-R-E-N-C-E.com. Hopefully, I think this will probably, be shared out in the description, but that also has all of my links and basically anywhere websites are found, you can find those links and find everything else.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Lawrence Humphrey, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I think first of all, just thank you for sharing your story of really kind of building a company. I think it&#8217;s something that we see a lot. I think we have seen a lot over the years, just what does it look like to really step out and try to do your own thing, but I think it&#8217;s really important to also kind of build in public in a way.</p>
<p>And based off what you&#8217;ve kind of been saying, how IBM kind of allows you the time to do this, and now you&#8217;re building it out in public with advisors and such, I think that&#8217;s really important for people to see that they can achieve their own dreams in this way. And of course, what you&#8217;re doing is not only just helping you out as a founder, but also helping out the industry as a whole and hopefully helping generations of people to come, so.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Exactly, and that&#8217;s important to me for exactly the reasons I said before. I want to be really honest about this story too, that it&#8217;s fulfilling, that it&#8217;s hard. The self-doubt is to come and it&#8217;s just that more important to just keep doing it anyway. I have to imagine something. Only good things can come if you just keep doing the work and surrounding yourself with good people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Exactly. Lawrence, thank you so much for coming on the show, man. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Maurice, thank you for hosting. This was a pleasure.</p>

<p>Azeez Alli-Balogun came highly recommended by several former guests, so I knew that a great conversation was going to happen. Azeez currently works as a lead product designer on the globalization team at Netflix, and he&#8217;s also a co-founder of <a href="https://www.designtodivest.com/" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Design to Divest</a>. But if you think that&#8217;s all there is to Azeez&#8217;s story, then think again!</p>
<p>We started off with a quick 2022 check-in, and then he talked about his plan to work on more Black-focused design projects, and also gave a glimpse at what it&#8217;s like working at Netflix. From there, Azeez spoke about growing up in Louisiana, becoming a jewelry designer, and how he transitioned into product design. We also spent some time talking about Design to Divest and Azeez shared what he wants the organization to accomplish in the future. Everyone has the power to make change with design, and Azeez is a prime example of this!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
My name is Azeez Alli-Balogun. I am a product designer at Netflix, a product design lead at Netflix on the globalization team. What that really entails is that we&#8217;re looking at how do we enable Netflix products and the content that we create to live in local markets, but also experience global audiences.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So I work a lot on the enterprise tools or the tools that help us create the subtitling assets, the dubbing assets, and all of those things that actually help our content become very, very locally resonant in local markets and local geographies, but also accessible to global audiences.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2022 been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been going really great. It&#8217;s interesting. We&#8217;re in the end of January, and it&#8217;s been incredibly productive, quite a lot of work that I&#8217;ve been doing in the beginning of the year. I&#8217;ve been invited to do a couple of different types of projects that I feel were very, very impactful. I think it&#8217;s just there&#8217;s so many seeds and so many things that have been planted in 2020 and 2021 that are starting to kind of blossom a little bit, which is both good and, also, I&#8217;m getting to a point where I need to make sure I&#8217;m prioritizing myself and my rest. I want to make sure that 2020 doesn&#8217;t lead to burnout for me with opportunities coming my way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything special in particular that you want to achieve this year?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I mean the biggest thing that I think is really focusing on some of the work that I&#8217;m doing with Design to Divest, but really starting to produce more content or areas in where people from marginalized backgrounds, particularly the Black communities and African communities and indigenous communities, to be able to access design differently, access learning differently, and be able to participate in the creation of the world that we live in through their own cultural knowledge base.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So that type of work is something that I&#8217;m looking to start to really tangibilize in more meaningful ways. So I&#8217;m pretty hopeful that with all of the work that I&#8217;m doing and the projects and the communities that I&#8217;m a part of, that I&#8217;ll be able to create these platforms that allow or bring in more Black, African, and indigenous creatives to the forefront of creating some of the institutions that are going to shape the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, let&#8217;s talk about the work that you&#8217;re doing at Netflix. You&#8217;re the product design lead for the globalization team there. Now, you mentioned what you&#8217;re doing has to do with subtitles and dubbing. I can only imagine probably after the success of titles like Squid Game and Lupin and stuff that you probably have had a lot on your plate. But tell me more about the work that you do.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s a lot of stakeholder management. So it&#8217;s interesting in the sense that the team that I&#8217;m working on really crosses so much of what Netflix does. It&#8217;s an integral part to growth. As Netflix grows our global subscriber base and grows into global markets, it&#8217;s incredibly important that we&#8217;re effective in the way that we localize our content as we start to even increase the volume of content that we produce, the volume of film and the volume of movies, and really trying to create platforms for different geographical spaces outside of Hollywood to be able to share their stories.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So a lot of the work is when you go into Netflix and you&#8217;re able to see the option to choose 20 different subtitles or watch things in dubbing, all of that stuff is work that I&#8217;m directly impacting and the team that I work on directly impacts. We&#8217;re working with linguists. We&#8217;re working with project managers. We&#8217;re working across the board with so many different types of stakeholders to ensure that there is quality attached to the subtitles and the dubbing and that if a director in Nigeria creates a television show or a movie, that same movie can be enjoyed by somebody in Swedish and it doesn&#8217;t lose a lot of the cultural nuances that represent how that content or how that TV show or film was created.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s a heavy task because it&#8217;s very difficult to even measure things, like what is a good subtitle? What is a good dubbing or voiceover? Can we make sure that we are staying true to the content? Because when you think about different languages, it&#8217;s very, very &#8230; If you&#8217;re lucky enough to be able to speak multiple languages, then you know that there are certain nuances and certain kind of things that just don&#8217;t translate.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
You want to be able to translate those cultural nuances so people start to really understand what it actually means to experience the culture that that film or that television show or those characters are actually situated in. So there&#8217;s a lot of really trying to figure out how do we communicate, also creating a lot of the workflows that allow our stakeholders, the project managers internally at Netflix with the linguists and the other vendors that we use in order to create all of these assets, how do we allow them to do this work very, very effectively and at the volume and scale of the amount of content that we produce on a yearly basis?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So talk to me more about the team. What does the makeup look like?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a typical product team. I mean you have your designers. I lead a particular area of the globalization design side. I have two other design partners who are also design leads in other areas. I work with a product manager, and I&#8217;m in constant contact with the globalization project managers and program managers as well as vendors and linguists in order to really understand what is necessary and how to create the best conditions for their workflows to be successful in delivering on the subtitling and dubbing and other localization assets.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So the core team is I&#8217;ll have my UI front end team and backend team designer and me, as a designer, project manager. We&#8217;re the core product team building out all of the tools. And then we&#8217;re in constant communication with the project managers, the vendor managers, the linguists who are actually authoring and creating a lot of the subtitling and localization assets in order to ensure that we&#8217;re providing the tools that are really supporting their workflows in a positive way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So Netflix has linguists that are doing the translating, I mean as they&#8217;re listening through to the content and making sure that those subtitles, like you said, are kind of accurate to the plot, culturally accurate, et cetera.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean there&#8217;s a whole process there of subtitle authoring. I can&#8217;t get too deep into lots of that stuff because I think it&#8217;s one of the things that does set Netflix apart from some of the other services that you might encounter, the level of detail that we go into trying to create good subtitles. There&#8217;s a lot of experimentation and things that we&#8217;re doing right now in order to enable that process to be better for our members.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I remember when Squid Game had come out and there had been some kind of talk about like, &#8220;Oh, well, if you&#8217;re watching Squid Game, don&#8217;t watch it with subtitles because the subtitles aren&#8217;t right,&#8221; or something like that. Or no, it wasn&#8217;t the subtitles. It was the dubbing, I think, one of those two things. But I mean I can imagine even with a show like that, there&#8217;s still going to be some sort of cultural differences or things like that that get lost in translation.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean that&#8217;s exactly right. I mean there&#8217;s always going to be some dissonance. We&#8217;re always testing things out to try to get it right. I think the one thing that&#8217;s really great about the culture at Netflix and how we go about designing and building product is we experiment in order to figure out how we can learn and improve and constantly improve. So if we don&#8217;t get something right the first time, it&#8217;s a learning experience for us. We take all of that feedback and use it to ensure that we&#8217;re doing better as we move forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does an average day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Average day? I try to segment a little bit of my days or my week. Some days I load up with meetings, so I&#8217;m meeting with engineers and my product manager partner and other stakeholders. And then other days, I create that space for me to kind of just work and I&#8217;m designing and creating different concepts that are related to the conversations that I&#8217;ve been having, so kind of going through the whole design process, but in very, very short cycles.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It&#8217;s not spending three months or two weeks or just doing nothing but research, but do longer cycles of discovery research on a particular area that we&#8217;re trying to improve operational efficiency on and then take that, summarize that research into some opportunities, create some concepts behind that, and then start to socialize that with engineering and product in order to start to tweak and do more of &#8230; I try to do much more co-creation, co-designing with the stakeholders, the engineers, and product all together.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That way the decisions that are being made are made with the right amount of input from the different internal stakeholders that influence how the product actually tangibilizes itself. So my typical days typically would be I have some times where I&#8217;m dedicated. I need time to intake all the information that I&#8217;ve gotten and then start to visualize that into some sort of concept.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
And then a lot of the times, I am taking those concepts in meetings and doing a lot of co-design in order to fulfill requirements and understand what the needs are directly with both the users and then my product stakeholders as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the most challenging part about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Stakeholder management maybe. The reason that I would say that is when I think about the idea of complexity, what really makes anything complex is that you have a bunch of different competing priorities that happen at scale. So being able to really clearly align all the different priorities that are happening from different parts of the process and different stakeholders into something that works, I think, is the most difficult part because I&#8217;m also constantly listening and observing what people are saying, what people are doing, and then trying to translate that down into a language that can be understood by everyone who is involved.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
As you know, it&#8217;s interesting as we talk about language and linguistics, not only in different languages. There are different languages within different industries. There are different languages within different professions. So everyone might have a different way of communicating the same thing. Oftentimes, you can be in meetings where people are trying to communicate an idea or a concept with the language of their own profession.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So engineers might be communicating things in a certain way that&#8217;s different from product. That&#8217;s also slightly different from the way that the type of language that design would use to communicate something. And then our end users are using a different type of language and trying to wrangle all of those different concepts and in the way that people are trying to express what it is that they&#8217;re trying to think of in a way that everyone&#8217;s aligned on and everyone kind of understands.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That&#8217;s where I feel like a lot of the true power of design comes because once you start to take the language and start to visualize things, then people can have something to have an opinion about. They can have something to kind of analyze and say, &#8220;That&#8217;s not it,&#8221; or, &#8220;That is it,&#8221; or, &#8220;It&#8217;s this and this. Add this or that or the other.&#8221; But bringing life to the words that are being said by all of the people in the room and then allowing people to kind of mold what&#8217;s been created to make sure that everyone&#8217;s voices is really being heard.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I would imagine language and linguistics probably influence a lot of the design work in general, right?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean just really trying to understand the nuances of it and how those nuances can be misinterpreted because, as you know, a misinterpretation of even body language or a language or just a word or a concept can have dire consequences. So it&#8217;s important operationally as well as it is tangibly when we&#8217;re trying to create the product and making sure that the things that we create are very, very clear and transparent.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Netflix, it&#8217;s been an interesting place working. It&#8217;s been the most different place that I&#8217;ve worked at in my career because of the culture. The culture at Netflix is very unique. As I mentioned a little bit before about the experimentation culture of just trying to do things to learn, to get feedback, and then course correct. That also kind of goes into how we&#8217;re managed as employees. There&#8217;s a lot of the idea of freedom and responsibility and then the culture of feedback. All of those feed into the way that we&#8217;re able to work and the way that we&#8217;re able to kind of explore different areas of our profession in ways that we may have been restricted in other organizations.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So I think that that&#8217;s a huge part that I typically really enjoy at Netflix and enjoy working with a bunch of other people who have similar mindset of growth and discovery and learning. It really shows through whenever we&#8217;re able to create, learn from the products and the things that we create, and prove it for our members.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. That&#8217;s pretty cool. It sounds like Netflix does give you that freedom. I know there&#8217;s some companies of people whom I would love to interview, but they have a strict embargo on their employees cannot do podcasts or anything like that. So it&#8217;s good that at least they let you all be able to talk about your work and do other things freely.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean it&#8217;s definitely encouraged, but I mean there&#8217;s definitely tons of stuff that we can&#8217;t say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I walk a line a lot of times trying to make sure that &#8230; Because there&#8217;s so much transparency at Netflix and I think that that&#8217;s one of the really great parts of the culture at Netflix is that, as an employee there, the leadership from the top down is always going to be as transparent as possible. But with that comes responsibility of we&#8217;re letting you know all of this information. We don&#8217;t expect you to go out and tell the world all of the secrets and things. This is internal information that we are providing you context so you&#8217;re able to really do your job to the best of your ability. We don&#8217;t want to hide things from you.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
But it comes with a lot of responsibility, that level of transparency and that level of trust that our leaders kind of put in us as contributors to the mission that the company is trying to achieve.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Gotcha. I&#8217;m curious to learn more about you, your particular origin story. Tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Both of my parents are from Nigeria, and I was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. So I grew up in Louisiana. I spent most of my childhood in Louisiana and went there to high school. I went to Southern University when I graduated high school for a couple of semesters before switching over to design and going to University of Louisiana at Lafayette. But growing up, I wouldn&#8217;t have thought of myself as being a designer. I wasn&#8217;t exposed to it in that way. I mean my dad was in school for architecture, so I was exposed to that.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
But the ideas of industrial design or other aspects of design weren&#8217;t really things that came across. I played basketball, growing up. I was more interested in trying to go to the NBA than I was with anything else. But I was also an avid reader. I read quite a lot, and I did a lot of writing, drawing. So there was always that creative aspect, but I imagined myself going into medical school rather than design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So when you went to University of Louisiana at Lafayette though, you ended up majoring in industrial design. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean that was really the reason that I left Southern University because they didn&#8217;t have an industrial design program. So initially, whenever I was in school, my intention was to be a pediatric surgeon. Actually, I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to study biomedical engineering and then go to medical school to be a pediatric surgeon.&#8221; That was my intention. At the time, too, biomedical engineering was a fairly new field of study within the higher education to where if you really wanted to do that, you had to get a master&#8217;s degree.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So while I was at Southern University, I needed to kind of create a curriculum for myself, working with my engineering faculty. I was doing mechanical engineering and double majoring in cellular molecular biology. But after a while, I was just like, &#8220;Something about this is not really what I want to do. I would love to create the medical tools and the medical devices. I&#8217;d love to design those things.&#8221; But it was just something that just didn&#8217;t feel right in terms of the education for me while I was in engineering.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I started doing some research. Maybe I might like automotive design. Through that, I found what industrial design was, and I was like, &#8220;Whoa. With this field, I can actually design medical devices. I can actually go and design prosthetic legs and all of these different things that I was interested in kind of creating.&#8221; That&#8217;s how I found University of Louisiana at Lafayette because that was the only school in Louisiana, at the time, that had an industrial design program. So I ended up going there and studying industrial design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So you kind of, I guess, looked at another way to get into the medical field then by looking at industrial design.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So in your early post-grad career after you left school, you ended up going into jewelry design. I&#8217;m curious. What drew you to that?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It wasn&#8217;t anything that really drew me. It was literally I graduated shortly after a recession in Louisiana. There were no jobs, really. It was really difficult to get a design job, especially in the South, in Louisiana. So really, what happened was that my portfolio was a bunch of &#8230; It was pediatric medical tools and prosthetics and stuff like that. The jewelry company, which had a connection to some of our professors at University of Louisiana, looked at my work and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;We really like your aesthetic visually. You have a really good sense of style and taste,&#8221; even looking at the medical tools, the medical stuff that I designed.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That&#8217;s literally how I jumped into jewelry design. I was interested in fashion. I was interested in design in general, but I wasn&#8217;t intending to go be a jewelry designer. If anything, I would have wanted to go to do something in footwear design at Nike because that would have merged a lot of the biomechanics and technical medical things that I was thinking about in terms of design with human performance. So yeah. Jewelry design just kind of came about. It was an opportunity that kind of came about, but it really allowed me to start to understand what it meant to design for things that were going to be worn on people&#8217;s bodies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That makes sense. How long were you a jewelry designer?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I was there for about two to two and a half years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It was quite an interesting experience, but even though while I was there &#8230; This is also the field of user experience design or a lot of the digital product design, all of that stuff. That was still fairly in its infancy. So even while I was there, I participated in some things, some interface things that were very interesting. From there, after I left that company, I wanted to discover what is it that I really wanted to do, but I also needed to look at where the market was going.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Industrial design jobs weren&#8217;t en masse. A lot of these jobs that when you&#8217;re designing physical things, they don&#8217;t have incredibly large teams. Just seeing the digital world kind of pick up, I started to make some pivots over into really learning that particular skillset, branched off to try to do a little bit of my own freelance work, both as an industrial designer. But then what I found was that I was getting more clients, more people looking for branding and web development and more digital kind of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That&#8217;s kind of how I ended up pivoting or going to grad school to learn really more of a service design kind of method to incorporate both to be more agnostic about what my skillsets delivered and more focused on what the outcome needed to be of whatever it is that a client or somebody wanted to create.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good way to put it in terms of trying to be more agnostic because what I&#8217;m hearing, and you can please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong here, it sounds like you were just trying to find where you were going to fit in. You&#8217;ve graduated. You have these design skills. While there certainly were things that you wanted to do in terms of design, those opportunities just weren&#8217;t available. So you were trying to see what could maybe your skills transfer into.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean I think that that&#8217;s a good characterization. I&#8217;m a person who is always ready to adapt to a situation. I have my core values and principles that I&#8217;m going to stay in those, and I&#8217;m not going to allow my value set and my principles to be swayed. But those principles aren&#8217;t rigid outcomes. They just help guide me in terms of the decisions that I need to make in life. But at the same time, I don&#8217;t create a level of rigidity to what it is that I can be and what it is that I can do.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Because it in the same way of when you&#8217;re designing a product or a service for someone or for people or a community, you need to allow it to be what it needs to be rather than always trying to force it into being something that you envisioned from the beginning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, when did you decide to go to grad school? Was that during this time as well?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. That was during this time. I was looking at a handful of schools. I was looking at Pratt, RISD. I almost went to SCAD for the service design program because I had a friend who I was in undergrad with who was there, and he told me it was a great program. Service design&#8217;s still kind of a fairly newer field in design in the United States. It&#8217;s still catching on. You&#8217;re starting to see it more so now than it was years ago. I mean it&#8217;s definitely been something that&#8217;s far more developed in Europe than it has been in the United States. That&#8217;s just a reflection of the market and how we view the utility of design here at organizations.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Hearing the service design methods and methodologies, that was very interesting to me, and I was ready to go to SCAD. But also, another friend of mine who I was in undergrad with had mentioned ArtCenter to me before, and I really liked the rigor that ArtCenter placed on developing your technical skills and the level of polish that a lot of the portfolios and a lot of the students had the capacity for after graduating from ArtCenter. And then also, ArtCenter had this program with the Drucker School of Management where the graduate industrial design program also could be a dual MBA degree.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Once I got there, I didn&#8217;t see the usefulness not necessarily in an MBA because I did take MBA classes at UCLA. I do see a benefit in that, but I didn&#8217;t see the benefit for that particular school that ArtCenter was partnering with. So I didn&#8217;t actually go forward with that, though it was a decision that I made to go to ArtCenter in the first place because that option was available.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
While you were there, you also managed to work on an internship which let you transition into product design, right?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I did a couple of internships there. The education, too, in grad ID, the name can be misleading because it&#8217;s industrial design. But really a lot of the training was for us to be innovation leaders, to be able to come in and really understand what the business needs are for a company and help them pivot into creating products and services that now are able to accommodate the changing landscape. So we would routinely have different companies come in. This is part of the ArtCenter education where different companies come in and do these studio projects.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
We did one with Uber whenever I was in maybe my fourth semester or something like that, where Uber was creating their Uber Air platform. We worked in groups with other students from other departments. So we had transportation designers, automotive designers, as well as interaction designers, in addition to us in graduate industrial design and worked with some of the key executives for that particular unit doing the Uber Air. Our task was really to design what that whole experience would be if we were to create air taxis.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
If Uber were to go into this business, how do we start to visualize what that whole experience would be, all the way from understanding what the airport security type situation would be to what is the interior of the electric vertical landing takeoff vehicle going to be, all the way to really understanding the market. So if you create this type of service, well, who are going to be the people to use this service and who are going to be the early adopters all the way down to the late adopters in order to get this service off of the ground?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So it was a pretty involved project that took a whole semester where we built life-sized mock-ups to test out what the interior of the vehicle could be and could look like. We did a lot of architectural design and sketches to understand where would we create and put some of these what we call sky ports, which would be the airports for people to access these vehicles, designing also how would we implement or integrate this into the existing application, so if somebody wanted to catch an Uber Air vehicle. So it was a pretty involved project that spanned the scope of a bunch of different design skills from automotive design to interaction design to industrial design and whatnot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Kind of sounds like a air taxi, in a way.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Exactly. It was an air taxi. There&#8217;s so many different nuances in terms of what that whole experience could or would be. And also, there are limitations to the technology that existed at the time, still even to right now. A lot of that technology is still being developed in a way that could make it really feasible and economical to launch a service like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I would imagine also even just getting FAA certification because, unlike something like UberX where anyone that has a driver&#8217;s license can drive, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean anyone with a pilot&#8217;s license, I would imagine, would do Uber Air or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. There&#8217;s definitely some technical and some licensing, piloting things there, especially, also, I mean you&#8217;re thinking about just air traffic control as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, that&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I mean that&#8217;s been there for a while. There&#8217;d be some adjustments and things that would need to be made in order to allow for another set of vehicles to be in the air.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So after you graduated from ArtCenter College of Design for grad school, you ended up working at a couple of other places before Netflix. You worked at a biotech company called Script Health. So you, I guess, in a way managed to get around to doing some work in the medical field, even in this sort of roundabout way. But then you also worked at IBM working on products on their data, AI, and cloud integration teams. When you look back at those two experiences specifically, what do you remember the most?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It was interesting because with Script Health, one of my friends who&#8217;s a pharmacist, that was his startup that he was creating. I was actually working on that while I was in grad school and helping him really design and bring to life the vision of that product and that service that he was trying to create. So I won&#8217;t go too deep into it, but the gist of that really was building out a service to deal with the opioid epidemic and providing the right type of medication for overdoses, things like naloxone, to places in rural communities.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a huge lack of access to the right types of drugs and services in the most marginalized communities or the most affected communities. And then that learning, kind of taking a product from zero to one, the amount of work and effort that it takes to do the research and then finding a market fit, pivots and things that need to happen, partnerships that need to be made and created, and then visualizing the concept and telling the story and the narrative in a way that is going to inspire and communicate what it is about.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That was also a crash course for me, really working with engineers as well as working with outside agencies that were taking my design work and starting to code it into something and really understanding what are the specific things that I need to communicate in order to make sure that what I do design ends up being the thing that gets created and it not being some kind of mangled version of that because there are details that I left out or things that I didn&#8217;t communicate that they just had to make a decision on, and it may not be the right decision.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
When it comes to IBM, the thing that I learned at IBM really was a lot of stakeholder management and also a lot of leadership skills, what it means to manage up, as well as how to align people and influence people around a shared objective and a shared goal and then trying to get things done within a short period of time. I feel like those were some of the key things. I mean I can dive really deep into aspects of that, but I think those were the main things that I&#8217;ve learned.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Working with people, I think, is an incredibly important part of being a designer, and understanding how to do that effectively, I think, is something that it takes a lot of designers a lot of time to really understand what it actually means to do that beyond just your hard technical skills.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, another thing that you sort of created that came about while you were at ArtCenter was Critical Discourse in Design. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. That happened while I was at IBM. So this was after my graduate program. I still have a lot of really great connections with a lot of the faculty at ArtCenter. After the murder of George Floyd, there was just a lot of energy around something needs to be done. I&#8217;m in the design community. Think about racism. When we think about prejudice, when we think about all of the things, these institutions that are perpetuating these things, they are designed institutions. They&#8217;re created.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
For me, in addition to, okay, well, protesting is one thing. But based off of my own skillsets and my own proximity to the type of work and things that I do, how can I start to impact or influence the change that I want to see in the world? So I started these conversations with some of my friends who are still faculty at ArtCenter to try to uncover what is something that we can do. We didn&#8217;t really have an idea of what it was going to be.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
But through the conversations and through a lot of the things that I was talking about in terms of how &#8230; A quote that I constantly say is that, &#8220;Design is the invisible hand that shapes all lived experience.&#8221; So Critical Discourse in Design came about when we started really thinking about when you think about oppression, oppression needs physical tools and objects. It needs a physical space. It needs to be designed.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So when you think about you can go throughout history and you can look at what are the tools or the innovations of oppression? A noose, a prison cell, all of these different things. So if you can design for oppression, then you can design for liberation. Critical Discourse in Design came about like, &#8220;Well, what does that conversation of designing for liberation, what does that actually mean? How do we start to translate theory into action? And then who are the voices that we need to bring to the table in order to be able to have these conversations?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Because when you think about the design industry, also where the Black designers is calling out is the 3% or 4%, depending on who you ask, of the people who are designers are Black. So the voices that are the most impacted by the things that are being created in the world are not at the table to voice how they feel things should be. They&#8217;re not able to provide their cultural intelligence to the institutions and the systems and the tools and the things that get created in the world.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So Critical Discourse in Design really was a response to that. It was really a response to how do we start to now bring in these voices and also to leave people not with just new words and new theories, but a theory that can turn into practice and really starting to understand what the connection between pedagogy, what people are learning, is with practice, how people create, how people experience and actually deliver things into the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, let&#8217;s talk about Design to Divest, which it sounds like came out of Critical Discourse in Design. Tell me about that. I know you&#8217;re one of the founding members of this collective. We&#8217;ve also had another member of the collective on the show before, Michael Collett. But yeah. Talk to me about Design to Divest.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. While I was actually creating Critical Discourse in Design, one of my really close friends who was working with part of Design to Divest messaged me and said, &#8220;Hey, do you have some capacity to join the steering committee here? This is what we&#8217;re doing.&#8221; So I joined Design to Divest. At the time, it was really meant to mobilize design skills and different designers, to mobilize those design skills around social impact projects. It was very like graphic design-based.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So I think part of what I was doing whenever I joined the team was really thinking about what Design to Divest actually meant as a concept, and what are the most impactful ways that we can create positive change or the change that we want to see in the world? That started over the past two years that we&#8217;ve been just having these discussions and doing projects and working on things to manifest into a version of what it is today, where we have a lot of things that we&#8217;re going to be releasing this year, hopefully, and that really talks about what it means to divest the inequitable systems that have been designed and created in the world. How do we start to celebrate and design for the communities on the margins?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean I think that came about at such a monumental time, during the summer that you mentioned where, of course, there were people out in the streets that were protesting against police brutality. You talked about the murder of George Floyd. Again, it seems like this was a time when a lot of people were really looking for this kind of thing. They were looking to hear from Black voices, but also just looking for ways that they can, I guess, channel whatever frustrations they had into something more positive.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. Not to say that that time still isn&#8217;t happening now, but [crosstalk 00:45:33]-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah. We&#8217;re still in it very much. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
We&#8217;re very much in it, but it was reaching fever pitches. It wasn&#8217;t just in the United States, it was globally. Me being Nigerian and seeing with SARS and the protests that were happening in Nigeria, the protests that were happening in South America, things happening in Brazil, it was everywhere, where you started to see people were really fed up with the institutions and the things that were meant to serve them. But people were just like, &#8220;Nothing is actually serving any of us, and nothing is serving us in a way that&#8217;s going to provide any level of comfort or any level of support. It&#8217;s actually doing the opposite.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So I think Design to Divest became, especially for designers, because I think so many designers get into design feeling that they can change something or that there&#8217;s some sense of positivity that they can use design to affect, but no one ever tells them how. And then it typically falls flat with very altruistic ideas that really don&#8217;t connect back to impact. It just connects back to some sense of moral I don&#8217;t want to say superiority, but just a sense of moral reflection that you did a project that did something, but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily connect back to impact.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I think with the idea of Design to Divest, we really want to give people a path to connect the things that they do to the impact that they want to see in the world, the impact that they want to see in institutions, and the impact that they want to see in the different products and tools and experiences that we experience in the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, speaking of that impact, given now that the collective has gone on now, what? I guess this will be your second year of going into things?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you want to see Design to Divest accomplish?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Quite a lot over time. But I think about education is a really core thing in terms of &#8230; One of the things that we&#8217;ve identified, too, is that there&#8217;s so many designers on the margins, designers of color, but particularly Black and indigenous designers who don&#8217;t have access to any type of content or education that teaches design in a way that validates their culture, in a way that validates their identity, in a way that celebrates the cultural intelligence of their heritage towards the creation of the things that exist in the world.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
When you look at design, the canon of literature and text that&#8217;s being taught to designers all are from European white men, and so there&#8217;s always a cultural disconnect. Essentially, what it does is informs people getting into design that you need to either erase your culture and assimilate into this culture if you want to find success in this profession because your culture is devalued or isn&#8217;t valued as a producer of good design, if you call something good design.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So part of what my hopes for Design to Divest is to really provide that platform, on one hand, for Black and indigenous designers to be able to have content and community to engage with around design that validates their identity, that validates their cultural heritage, and then that brings them to the table of creation. I feel like the world is a group project and, typically, only a select group of communities and culture have gotten to participate in creating the institutions, organizations, and business that shape the lived experiences for all of us.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s time that we create this space of ownership. I think this is what equity means, ownership and creation, and stop blocking these communities that are on the margins, Black, indigenous communities from participating in the creation and the stewardship of the world. I think that I want Design to Divest to be that platform that allows Black and indigenous communities to harness their ability to design through their own cultural intelligence, to create and populate the institutions and things in the world that are going to serve our communities.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the people that inspire you?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a tough question because I&#8217;m typically just inspired by people, in general. I&#8217;m inspired by culture, in general. Obviously, I&#8217;m inspired by my family, by my parents, aunts, and uncles, especially coming from Nigeria, making a way for themselves as expats into the United States and balancing multiple cultures. I&#8217;m also inspired by other designers, other creators, but also other people in other professions. I constantly draw inspiration from economists, from lawyers, from doctors in the way that they approach the work that they do.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I can say, as of late, too, I&#8217;ve been inspired by people like Andr√© Leon Talley and Virgil, who both passed, but seeing the impact that they&#8217;ve had. You can see that by the outpouring of support and the outpouring of responses that people have to their passing. To have that level of impact on community, I think, is also something that&#8217;s incredibly inspiring to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to somebody that is looking to enter into the design field? Because it sounds like, with your career, you&#8217;ve managed to really take that and apply it across a number of different facets of design and, even now, you&#8217;re still kind of paying that forward with the work you&#8217;re doing in Netflix, but also with this community work through Design to Divest. So if someone&#8217;s listening to this and this is inspiring them to want to get into design in some sort of way, what would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I mean one of the most important things, as a designer, is to be curious. I think that one thing that I would tell people is you just kind of have to do it. There&#8217;s so many people who are going to have something to say about whatever it is that you do. It&#8217;s also kind of that&#8217;s the idea of design is that whenever you design, there&#8217;s a difference between art and design in a sense, whereas design is really not meant for yourself. Design is outward. It&#8217;s meant to be critiqued by the people that you&#8217;ve created it for. So you can&#8217;t wait for perfection.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I think I would tell people that they have to just go out and do it. But another one of the most important things, too, is that design is a very community-driven profession. I think that it&#8217;s not done in isolation. I think that that&#8217;s in contrast to the way that we were taught about design. We were always taught about these individual people who are design heroes, whether it&#8217;s Dieter Rams or Frank Gehry or whatever. They&#8217;re not doing these things alone as individual people. They have a network of people. They&#8217;re talking to people.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
They are influenced by people, and they are finding different people who is inspiring to them to communicate with and also build with. So one of the most important things is to constantly seek out the people who are doing things that you find interesting and try to have a conversation with them and try to build your own communities, because that&#8217;s going to be the path forward for you finding the opportunities to design the things that you want to design, to create the things that you want to create and with the people that you want to create.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
And then lastly, too, I would also say is that you really want to start from a place of purpose. So if you don&#8217;t really have a purpose yet or you haven&#8217;t identified what that is, definitely just take some time to think about it. As everything, it could be an iteration. Your purpose whenever you were 16 could be different when you&#8217;re 24 or 50. But having a sense of purpose and principles to back that purpose then allow you to make decisions a lot easier. It gives you something to filter the opportunities that come your way with something that means something more to you than just existing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work would you like to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I&#8217;m doing a lot of the work that I want to be doing in combination with Design to Divest and some of the freelance projects that I&#8217;ve been working on as well. But I think more of that work, more of the work that I&#8217;m doing with Design to Divest, more of the creating the platforms, creating archives and things who are Black and indigenous designers to be able to participate in the creation of the world. Also, I mean I do quite a lot of mentorship.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So I&#8217;d love to be able to build careers and create more pathways for designers from other marginalized communities, including Black communities and other marginalized communities to have a pathway to create. So I see within the next five years, continuing to grow and scale the impact that I&#8217;m able to have on the design community from both a pedagogical, educational standpoint as well as a practice and people standpoint.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So when I think about the practice, it&#8217;s really illustrating to both the business and design world that you want to be able to take &#8230; What it really means to be diverse and to harness diversity for innovation is being able to take the different cultural knowledge systems that exist, where there&#8217;s the aboriginal system of knowledge, the African system of knowledge, and being able to apply that to the problems that you&#8217;re facing as a society or in your particular company, reframing the problem underneath those systems of knowledge, and then allowing those systems of knowledge to be able to deliver on solutions for you.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So doing work that allows me to bring more of those different systems of knowledge and those different diverse perspectives into the creation of things, and then on the people side of just continuing to bring more of those people who are holders of that knowledge, the descendants of African people from different African cultures who hold that knowledge or indigenous people, Native people, and providing a platform for them to use that knowledge that&#8217;s been passed down to them to design and create things that make the world a better place.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and your work and all your projects and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I try to not be so visible online all the time. They can find me on my Instagram, Azeez_Alli. In the near future, we&#8217;ll be releasing a new website for Design to Divest where they can check out some of that work that I&#8217;m doing. If anyone wants to chat with me or anything like that, they can always shoot me a message on LinkedIn. I definitely try to respond to people who reach out to me and might not be immediate, but definitely something that I&#8217;m open to chatting more and more with people who resonate with some of the things that I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Azeez Alli, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show, one, of course, for telling your story about how you got into design. But I think it&#8217;s really important, especially now, as a lot of people are really looking at the work they do and try to figure out how it can make an impact in the world, I think the way that you&#8217;re taking your design knowledge and, one, how you&#8217;ve been able to apply it to different parts of design, but then, two, also using it in a way to pay it forward to the community is something that is super important.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hope that we get to see a lot more of that in the future. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. Thank you so much for having me.</p>

<p>When I first chatted with Miles Anderson, he said that he&#8217;s &#8220;just a normal guy who works hard.&#8221; But then I heard his story and the growth in his career and well&#8230;Miles is no normal guy ‚Äî he&#8217;s extraordinary! </p>
<p>Miles talked about his recent move to Seattle in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, starting on the Xbox team at Microsoft, and how he&#8217;s getting along during this time. He also spoke about his time at IBM and how it helped him grow as a designer, the power of self-education in tech, and what he would do in his career if failure wasn&#8217;t an option. Miles is finally getting the recognition he deserves, and I&#8217;m glad to have him on the show to share what he&#8217;s doing with you all!</p>

<p>Adrian Franks is a one-of-a-kind renaissance man. His work as a UX creative director at IBM focuses on experience design (iX) for their global business services brand, but trust me &#8212; his skills don&#8217;t stop there.</p>
<p>Our conversation began with Adrian walking us through his typical days of meetings and projects, but things really came alive when we talked about his days growing up and learning design in Atlanta. Adrian also talked about how he connected with the venerable film maker Spike Lee for a series of art projects, and shared some great advice on the types of skills designers need to have in order to achieve their best work. I&#8217;m so glad we have designers like Adrian out there who can show us what the true possibilities of creativity can be!</p>
