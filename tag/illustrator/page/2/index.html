Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>Isiah Xavier Bradley was born to be an artist, and you can really feel his love for the craft just from spending a few minutes chatting with him. The Seattle-based illustrator loves all things comics related, and his body of work is filled with superheroes, aliens, mages, and all kinds of other fantasy figures. </p>
<p>We talked about some of his creative projects, and we spoke for a bit about diversity in the fantasy illustration space, as well as how he approaches storytelling through his art. Isiah also shared his story of growing up in Philly, getting inspired by his father (a painter!), and finding creative community both online and offline. Isiah is looking to achieve great things and grow as a professional illustrator, and with his enthusiasm and talent, he&#8217;s well on his way of making that happen!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Hi, I am Isiah Xavier Bradley and I&#8217;m a freelance illustrator and comic book artist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has the year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been going wonderful. It&#8217;s been wonderful. It&#8217;s been unsuspected, but just wonderful accomplishments have been happening. Recently, I was at the Western Hotel and was doing an event with two other artists and we were hired to do a 10-minute painting of Seattle&#8217;s like landscape of the space needle and the mountains, and of course, we had to include someone drinking coffee in there because there&#8217;s nothing but coffee around in Seattle everywhere, but yeah, that was one of the events that I recently did about maybe two months ago, and that was just amazing fun. I didn&#8217;t think that was going to happen. It was like I get caught off guard about like how many wonderful things just happen out of the blue. It&#8217;s like you don&#8217;t know when it&#8217;s going to happen or what&#8217;s going to happen, but with all the work, just paying off and networking and pursuing, it&#8217;s just this year has been a wonderful surprise of many things I got a chance to experience and to do and people to meet. It&#8217;s been awesome. It&#8217;s been an adventure-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
&#8230; seriously. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have any plans for the summer?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Oh, goodness. Well, right now, I&#8217;m going to be going to see my friend later in this month to Las Vegas. I mean, I know it&#8217;s not exactly summertime, but it&#8217;s close enough. So, I&#8217;m going to go see her. We&#8217;re going to work on some storyboards together. Besides that, I plan on spending as much time as I can outside painting and enjoying the fresh air because in Seattle, it was just way too cloudy and I needed some sunlight, but that&#8217;s it so far for now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at this time last year, how would you say you&#8217;ve changed or how have things changed for you over the year? What&#8217;s different? What&#8217;s new? Anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
I would say my mindset has definitely been changing. Last year it was like my art was still, like my career was still growing and I was getting more people and more companies to hire me, which felt really good, but also I had to work on my mindset about what success was and about how my career is growing. For being an artist, there&#8217;s no chart to show you. Like when you meet a goal, there&#8217;s like no reward or some outside source, especially when you&#8217;re a freelancer, to say, &#8220;Hey, yes, you made it. Yes, you did it,&#8221; and everything and that was something I had to get used to because it was like I&#8217;m my own boss. I have to be the one to do that for myself. So, that way, I can acknowledge the work. I was doing the hours, the hard projects, the tight deadlines, or I had to change my mindset to recognize the accomplishments I was doing and also to be completely self-aware and present.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s another thing. I was working out more and I&#8217;m working out more now this year. I was realizing that physically, like they always wanted to make characters like toned and skinny and muscled, and realizing how that had a negative effect on people and it&#8217;s including myself because I was like, &#8220;I need to show that beautiful is all different types of shapes and sizes.&#8221; Beauty is diversity. That&#8217;s like with my character, Sandra. Actually, I was inspired by Lizzo because I was watching Lizzo and Lizzo was just this beautiful, powerful, thick queen and I wanted to create a character that was like that. So, I created a character called Sandra. She has this huge ice ax and she&#8217;s just around this really cool character that just doesn&#8217;t take nothing from nobody and it&#8217;s her own person and as I&#8217;m talking to you now, I&#8217;m looking at the poster above my desk and it&#8217;s like all my diverse characters. I have Native American. I have Mexican. I have Black, Afro-Latina, and different types of body types, and I just feel like that definitely contributed to how I was thinking differently last year and this year and how it affects my artwork now.</p>
<p>With that experience, it definitely helped me become more of a better artist and more in touch with myself too, about finding that beauty about myself too. So, now I&#8217;m able to take that and put it into my art.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You touched on something now that I actually wanted to discuss a little later, but we can jump into it right now. Is representation, and I&#8217;m using air quotes over representation because that&#8217;s such a broad spectrum of what that could mean, but is that something that you feel like has to be a part of your work? When you think about your individual identities, do you feel like I need to put that into my work in some way?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Absolutely. I think it&#8217;s important. For example, Ariel, that was a huge debate just because of the color of her skin, but the people that I saw, like Black little girls and Black women seeing Ariel being a Black mermaid and having that such powerful, positive enforcement, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, we need to have more of that. People need to feel like they can do that too,&#8221; and sometimes people just need to see that like I did. Like for X-Men, Storm, that beautiful Black queen goddess. I love her so much of the X-Men. She&#8217;s great. She definitely was an icon for me and diversity and acknowledging that I was like, &#8220;I have to make sure that I represent more of that, bring that out more into the world so that way people of color can feel beautiful too and people with different body types can feel beautiful too.&#8221; It&#8217;s just like diversity is absolutely needed because it&#8217;s all around us and it needs to be accepted.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s so natural and for it to not to be celebrated as such, it hurts and especially towards our younger community, our younger community needs to know that, yes, you can do this. Yes, you can be that. I dream of a future where everyone is just represented equally and accepted and loved. So, we can all just create beautiful things because imagine what we could create if all of us were just getting along together and just sharing our beliefs and whatnot, but we don&#8217;t have to agree on it, but it&#8217;s just something that could be so beautiful. So, absolutely diversity needs to be in my work. Absolutely. The more weirder, the more unique, the better. I just want that. I yearn for it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s that adage that goes like, &#8220;You can&#8217;t be what you don&#8217;t see,&#8221; or something like that and I think certainly along the lines of illustration, animation even, there&#8217;s been such an explosion at least over the past decade or so where we&#8217;ve seen Black and brown artists, queer artists, et cetera, that are creating works in those images and putting it out there in a way that&#8230; I mean, some stuff has even been on streaming series and things of that nature. You started to see such a huge explosion of this diversity through the medium of illustration or animation over the past 10 years and it&#8217;s really been something to see because along with that, there&#8217;s also all these other stories that can be told because it&#8217;s coming from people with these different perspectives or because the characters are not the average white character, et cetera. There&#8217;s just more opportunities and possibilities for storytelling.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Absolutely, absolutely, and I feel like some companies or people would just be nervous about tapping into it too, because it&#8217;s change and people can be very scared of change, but it&#8217;s like we need that change. We need it. Even though it&#8217;s scary, it&#8217;s like we need it because it&#8217;s like we can&#8217;t keep repeating ourselves over the years over and over and over. No, we need to have that change right here, right now, so that way in the future we can have a better opportunity for everyone and then everyone can just feel that self-love more and capable. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about your work as a freelance illustrator. What does a typical day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Oh, actually, it&#8217;s weird. My mind likes to play tricks on me and what I mean by that is sometimes I&#8217;ll wake up in the morning and I will be ready to go. I&#8217;ll just jump right into it. I&#8217;ll just get up and brush my teeth, maybe splash some water on my face or take a shower, or I&#8217;ll just wake up and I&#8217;ll just go to my art desk and start painting out of nowhere. I feel like those are my go-get-it days. Today is definitely one of those days where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to go ahead and do my work and be focused,&#8221; which is like I made that conscious decision to go into that. So, I would wake up, make a list because for me, I can&#8217;t think of things in my head of what to do. If I do that, I easily get overwhelmed.</p>
<p>So, I have to make a list and that list keeps me organized and not only that, but checking it off actually makes me feel like, &#8220;Oh crap. I&#8217;m actually getting stuff done. I&#8217;m actually doing it,&#8221; and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to focus on how long it takes me. I&#8217;m going to focus on getting the goal done,&#8221; because once I get that done, it&#8217;s going to feel really good. Then I can go on to the next one and then I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m doing it.&#8221; On off days, I wake up and I have no energy in the morning and I have to wait till 12 o&#8217;clock for my whole body to feel that full awareness. It&#8217;s like, okay, I&#8217;m ready to make art and I think that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to be self-aware because if you can be completely self-aware and present about how you&#8217;re feeling physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually, that you will be able to conquer yourself.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be able to be like &#8220;I know what you&#8217;re thinking,&#8221; and be like, &#8220;I know what to do.&#8221; It&#8217;s like if I&#8217;m at home and I&#8217;m trying to work and I can&#8217;t focus, I know to remove myself from that space into an outside space or a completely public space where I can focus and get things done. So, it&#8217;s about doing that work and realizing what works best for you and for me, it can just flip. It can be vice versa, but I&#8217;m working with it. It&#8217;s been doing wonders for me. I&#8217;ve been able to get more work done, especially from working from home because you could get so easily distracted, distracted by video games, distracted by cooking food.</p>
<p>I mean, I love food, but also I got to do my work or movies and whatnot and I think as long as you&#8217;re completely self fully aware, you&#8217;re good and breaks. I always try to take a break after probably between hours or every other three hours perhaps. So, I&#8217;ll take a small break or I&#8217;ll just get up after 15 minutes, after I realize that, &#8220;Hey, my focus is slipping. I&#8217;ll just get up and walk around, stretch my body out, just get it physically active, walk away from the project and maybe go for a walk outside,&#8221; and then I&#8217;ll come back and my mind is refreshed and I might be able to point out some things I didn&#8217;t notice before. So, yeah, it&#8217;s all about just knowing how your body and your mind think and just utilizing that for your advantage. That&#8217;s how pretty much my take goes. Natural chaos. I like to call it natural chaos.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I think you touched on something that a lot of people probably like at the start of the pandemic had to come to grips with when working from home is that it&#8217;s tough to work from home. It takes a lot of discipline to not fall into just doing something else. Like you mentioned, I could play video games. I could eat. I could do whatever. I could watch TV, whatever, but knowing that you have to get the work done is it&#8217;s a challenge. It&#8217;s a challenge and I think for a lot of people when the pandemic started, that was something they had to come to terms with. One, I think it&#8217;s just outfitting their place to be a place to work because the office is the office. Home is home.</p>
<p>Now, you&#8217;re bringing the office to your home. How do you make that happen? It&#8217;s a process to get to that level where you can feel like you can really wake up in the morning and get into a flow state and get work done at home. It&#8217;s harder than I think a lot of people realize.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Especially when you&#8217;re own, you&#8217;re your own boss too. You have no one looking over your shoulder. You are completely free. You get to decide exactly what you do and how you do it and it&#8217;s a blessing and a curse because you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Dang it. I need to focus.&#8221; So, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s always good to know yourself, to be like, &#8220;How do I function? What can I do to make sure that I am actually getting work done?&#8221; It&#8217;s so easy to fall into that trap and being a freelancer is more than just one job. You have multiple jobs. You&#8217;re the manufacturer. You&#8217;re the producer. You&#8217;re the advertiser. You&#8217;re the financial budget person. You&#8217;re the stock person organizing your area, make sure you have enough materials and whatnot and all that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re playing multiple roles. I don&#8217;t think many people realize when you&#8217;re playing freelancing, you&#8217;re literally your own army unless you are hiring somebody else to help you, but it&#8217;s hard times. Not everyone can be affording that, but if you also have that capability to do that stuff by yourself, then go for it. Just make sure you&#8217;re giving yourself breaks and affirmations. Affirmations are really important for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you do a little bit of everything from comic books to trading cards. What does your process look like when it comes to approaching a new piece of work? What does that look like?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
I usually like to feel it out. Like what is this image going to convey? What is the vibe I&#8217;m trying to give it? Because doing illustrations, and any kind of illustration, sketch cards, book covers. It all leads down to storytelling and it&#8217;s so important that you recognize body language, colors to evoke mood, the perspective, the layout of the image. Everything adds to the story. So, I try to keep that in mind while I&#8217;m looking for references and I try not to spend too much time on references because I find that you could spend a lot of time looking up references and then you lose too much time that you could have used for the project.</p>
<p>So, I try to do at least an hour of references, or under, and then I just go in there and do really quick, bold sketches. I think that doing bold sketches allows you to develop your idea much quicker and gives you a bit more of a confidence booster. It&#8217;s like I know what I&#8217;m doing. I know what I want to go for and it just helps you move things along in a much more progressive kind of way and afterwards, after thumbnail is chosen or making a discussion, depending on the client, sometimes clients have notes about something they would like to have changed, or sometimes you&#8217;ll just get lucky, which thankfully I&#8217;ve been very lucky where I&#8217;ve had customers where they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s perfect. Keep going.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Great.&#8221; So, I&#8217;ll just go onto the next step and I&#8217;ll do a loose sketch.</p>
<p>Back then I used to do sketches where I would just go from very loose sketch to a very, very tight sketch, but nowadays, I go from a loose sketch to half tight sketch because I like to add more details with the color. So, after I&#8217;m done doing a tight, but not full-on sketch, I like to do a quick color filling, and that quick color filling allows me to play with the color and see what works, what&#8217;s more powerful that serves the image in the story and then after I get approval for that, I just go in there and start painting it like I would traditional art. I don&#8217;t know if many people would do it this way, but I like to stick to three, four layers max only because I was raised by my father to do traditional art and when I went to art school, I learned digital art and then it took me a while to feel comfortable with digital.</p>
<p>So, I took that mindset and the way I used traditional paintings, I took that method and applied it to digital and now that I have less layers and I&#8217;m working on it like I would traditional, it actually turns out much more the way I would want it to. Yeah, it is weird. I think it&#8217;s just because I was just so trained for so many years. I was doing traditional art way longer than digital. So, that&#8217;s programmed in my head, but it worked nicely for me. I really like how my digital artwork comes up now. I still do traditional, of course, because I can&#8217;t let that old-fashioned love go. That&#8217;s my first love, traditional watercolor, acrylic color, pencil, love all that. I would just apply that method and it would just work nicely for me and that&#8217;s pretty much my process right there. Just remembering what you&#8217;re trying to tell, what the story you&#8217;re trying to tell, and long as you keep that in mind along with the body language and the color and the way that they&#8217;re just presenting themselves, the character or the environment, that&#8217;s the best way to create that image you&#8217;re trying to make.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now. You mentioned storytelling. How do you approach storytelling through your art? Is that a separate process?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Oh, well, first thing I did was I did some research. I actually had a friend, Tony Atkins. He&#8217;s a DC comic artist, and I think he&#8217;s the one that recommended me to look at this. I&#8217;m not 100% sure, but I have this book here called Framed Ink, and it&#8217;s called Drawing and Composition for Visual Storytellers. It&#8217;s so such a good book. I recommend this book for any artist who&#8217;s trying to do illustration or comic book art. Technically, it&#8217;s for comic book artists, but after reading this book, it allowed me to take that method and apply it to illustrations and it talks about everything. It talks about what direction the trees are going in. If the trees are somewhat bending towards the focus point of the piece, it actually creates more of a focus point. If you&#8217;re looking downwards or upwards at a person, let&#8217;s say upwards, it gives more of a towering kind of vibe where you feel small and they&#8217;re big and threatening and whatnot.</p>
<p>Even the dramatic lighting, when I was doing comic books, I was working on some stories where sometimes I wouldn&#8217;t even go in full detail. In the area, I would just put a Black background and add dramatic lighting to their face because sometimes the character would be sad or upset and I really wanted to capture that and it gave it a traumatic effect. There are so many little things you can do, and even hands. Hands are a big thing too that give a big personality in storytelling. So, if someone&#8217;s more gentle and calm, maybe their fingers look more elegant and soft and not so stiff and someone&#8217;s mad or trying to cast an aggressive spell or something like that. Maybe their hands are a bit more provocative or a little bit more like gnarly or something like that. There&#8217;s so many aspects to storytelling.</p>
<p>And also another thing I loved to do. I haven&#8217;t done it in a hot minute because I&#8217;ve just been painting crazy, which is look at movies and notice how they have the camera set, what kind of colors they&#8217;re choosing. It&#8217;s just like watching movies can teach you a lot about how to do storytelling and I&#8217;m trying to think of what was like a good movie I think that was pretty good. I would say I liked Ultraviolet with Milla Jovovich. That was a good one for how the perspectives were. They did the crazy camera angles and the way they showed scenes through someone&#8217;s shade. They&#8217;re wearing shades and then you could just see a picture within their shades. It&#8217;s just so many interesting ways for you to do storytelling. Maybe the person&#8217;s drinking a cup of coffee and you see them talking, but you&#8217;re not focused on them, the reflections in the cup of coffee. It&#8217;s just so many fascinating ways to do storytelling.</p>
<p>So, I would say for sure, just also pay attention to people out in public, just like we&#8217;re not having a conversation. They&#8217;re not all standstill and stiff like some action figure. No. They&#8217;re either hunched over or they&#8217;re leaning one way or the other, or it&#8217;s all about just pay attention to those small details and if you gather all those, those things to come together. You can come up with some really cool images. So, I would just say people watching, movie watching, sometimes even video games, but it depends on the video game. Like God of War, that&#8217;s a good storytelling for sure. If you&#8217;ve seen God of War, the video game, you would definitely see what I mean because it&#8217;s so well done and put well together, but that&#8217;s why I would say that and this book called Framed Ink for sure. It&#8217;s so good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of video games, as I&#8217;m looking through your portfolio and seeing your work and everything, a lot of it is based on fantasy, science fiction. You&#8217;ve mentioned comic books being influenced by that. What really draws you to those as genres? What draws you to all that?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Oh, goodness. I fell in love with comics and fantasy, sci-fi stuff when I was a kid. I was so obsessed with it. I wanted to submerge my mind into that world. Something about it just seemed like so much fun and it seemed bright and exciting and just something that just reached out to me. It all started with the &#8217;90s, those beautiful colored costumes and Storm making her speeches and you didn&#8217;t see, but my hands just reached out to the sky like her. Just like what else was fantasy like Yu-Gi-Oh!, the monster designs. I was just fascinated by all this. I was watching cartoons absorbing it like a sponge and I was so into it and I had so many action figures. I still do, and honestly, it was like my dad introduced me into fantasy art as well, because he&#8217;s an artist and he would do a lot of these paintings at home where they were just fantasy-based, abstract kind of fantasy combination.</p>
<p>I just grew really fascinated with it and to be honest, I was like, when I was a kid, I was bullied and that world of fantasy and superheroes honestly helped me with my day-by-day life. It just brought so much happiness for me and honestly, I think that&#8217;s one of the main reasons why I became an artist in the first place. So, anyone else who was different like I was, they could look towards that and maybe get inspired by a character because it was like I was just so inspired by so many other characters too that made me just feel like I was capable. Like being different was great and awesome, and I just think that that&#8217;s definitely what drew me in. It&#8217;s just that entire world is something that made me happy, really, really happy and it still does.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there a lot of diversity in that space? I mean, of course, there&#8217;s the different stories that are being told, but in terms of other artists and things like that, is there a lot of diversity in that fantasy space?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
In terms of other artists?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
I feel like for sure, like back then, when it came to it, like at the time I wasn&#8217;t aware, but Larry&#8230; I forgot his last name. But Larry is the producer and artist for the &#8217;90s X-Men and it wasn&#8217;t until maybe five years ago I found out that it was a Black man and I was just astounded and so inspired. I was already inspired by the X-Men. The fact that it was created by a Black man, I was about to burst in tears happy because it just made me so ecstatic and I was like, &#8220;Holy crap. Someone who made something that inspired me and that just touched me in so many ways,&#8221; and oh, it was empowering. It was just amazing. I would say for sure that was just an important part of my art journey.</p>
<p>And now, since him, I didn&#8217;t notice too many. Even before I met him, I didn&#8217;t even notice too many Black artists, or at least they weren&#8217;t acknowledged at least because I feel like when it came to especially the comic book industry, that a lot more artists were not being acknowledged for their work. I mean, thankfully now it&#8217;s becoming more of a thing, but it should have been a thing already. It should have been like they should have been recognized for their hard work for sure. I didn&#8217;t know that many. I know a couple now. I follow a couple now on social media, which is great, but I just feel like we need more because especially for big projects like Dungeons and Dragons and Marvel, like thankfully Marvel&#8217;s now definitely for short, like not even artist-wise, but actor/artist-wise, we&#8217;re getting more people like Monica, Miss Marvel. It&#8217;s just having more people of color. It&#8217;s just awesome and I feel like now we&#8217;re getting more people of color who are artists arising more, especially during the pandemic because&#8230; Well, I think the pandemic&#8217;s over now-ish, but I think a lot of people realize that you can make your own business. You can be a freelancer. You can do this.</p>
<p>And them realizing that really did reveal more to social media. Like, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re here. I&#8217;m queer and I&#8217;m a person of color and I&#8217;m here,&#8221; and because of that I am happy that that happened, that people were able to put their stuff out there more. So, now I can actually see more and honestly, I&#8217;m just really happy about that. I think that would be the only good thing that came out of the pandemic. The only good thing was people realized, hey, I can start my own business. Hey, I can do this. I can make art and people can buy it, and with that, I would just have more rising, more rising and I just want that for everybody. More people to bring their voices forward because I didn&#8217;t have enough of that when I was a kid. I didn&#8217;t and that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t know many people by name, which is unfortunate, but now it&#8217;s happening. So, yeah. Now, I can full on support.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I just looked up who you were talking about. I think it&#8217;s Larry Houston.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Yeah, I was looking at his last name on the Storm piece he signed for me, but I couldn&#8217;t make out&#8230; I was like, &#8220;Darn it. That&#8217;s too many swirls. I can&#8217;t read it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, Larry Houston was the producer and director of X-Men, the second season. I&#8217;m looking at his Twitter bio, but he&#8217;s like Fantastic Four, second season, Captain Planet, Johnny Quest, GI Joe, GI Joe movie, The Karate Kid, Care Bear. I had no idea. I had no idea he had such a impressive resume.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
I only knew he did the X-Men. I didn&#8217;t know the other stuff. My goodness.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And actually speaking of X-Men, like I know there&#8217;s the new&#8230; I think it&#8217;s like the reboot of the &#8217;90s Cartoon is supposed to be coming out I think this year, maybe next year, but that has a Black director at the helm too, Beau DeMayo.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, I&#8217;ve been following it too. I was like, &#8220;Yes, I need to see this.&#8221; It&#8217;s like it&#8217;s supposed to be a continuation off the &#8217;90s, which I&#8217;m very curious about how that&#8217;s going to go because first off, that show was just&#8230; It was ahead of its time. It tackled racism. It tackled speciesism. I think that&#8217;s how you say. You know what I&#8217;m talking about? I forget the correct terminology, but anybody who was different, that was not normal. Anybody who was different, they were just looked upon as a freak of nature or something like that and just to have a show that was empowering people who were different, it was a huge gift. I don&#8217;t know honestly if I would&#8217;ve been an artist if X-Men didn&#8217;t exist at that time for me when I was a kid. I don&#8217;t know because that was just a huge motivator, huge inspiration for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit. I know we&#8217;ve talked a lot about your work and you&#8217;ve led us into your process, but you&#8217;ve also given us, I think, a bit of a window into where you came from and where this love comes from. So, let&#8217;s talk more about you. Let&#8217;s talk about you. Are you originally from Seattle?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
No, I am from Philadelphia.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Most of my life, I&#8217;ve been an Philadelphian.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. What was it like growing up in Philly?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Oh goodness. First off, concrete jungle. No trees around. Some trees around, but not that much. Going from Philly to Seattle was definitely an adjustment. Goodness gracious. In Philly, I&#8217;m just remembering, like I was living with my parents. I went to art school. I went to Northeast High and that was in the Northeast Philadelphia and that was definitely a school I enjoyed for sure because I had so many good friends there. I was a part of the choir, so that was another creative thing, another creative outlet for me and I was working on comics and this is before I was overthinking some of this stuff. So, I was able just to draw without overthinking it and actually made a little bit of profit there too.</p>
<p>So, it was super fun just to draw my own comic book, make copies, and my classmates were like, &#8220;Ooh, we want to buy one. We want to buy one,&#8221; and it was just super, super fun, but the area I was in definitely was more concrete jungle. I don&#8217;t think I got inspired by the area I was in, more by the people I was hanging around with and my dad when he was working on this art and my brother too, and it was just like I had a good community over there. I&#8217;m very grateful for having so many awesome people there that inspired me to continue making art and going hushing over there in Philadelphia was great. Was there for four years. I met some very good friends of mine and they&#8217;re still friends of mine, which is a blessing because it&#8217;s hard to find some true friends and it was just a wonderful experience, and honestly, it also helped me find more of myself too, just like people there who knew me through and through.</p>
<p>Before even I knew me, it was weird. It was like, &#8220;Where are you, in my head or something?&#8221; No, it was just an awesome experience. Plus the food was way cheaper than Seattle. It was also dangerous because I could get me a plain pizza at large for 11 bucks and I would go for it, but over here in Seattle, it&#8217;s like a large plain pizza is like 26. So, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, maybe that shouldn&#8217;t be ordering so much over here. Maybe I should learn how to cook.&#8221; So, when I came up here to Seattle, it was definitely more of a, okay, let&#8217;s step up this adulthood more. Let&#8217;s learn how to cook. So, I did that and goodness gracious, I had to build my entire art studio again because I had no scanner. I had no art desk. So, it was just starting all over and fresh, but being in Seattle, I love the nature. Nature is gorgeous.</p>
<p>If you ever wanted to get away, obviously, you could just take a bus to a park somewhere and just chill there. It&#8217;s like nature is right there and it was just so nice to have that accessibility. There is definitely a Seattle freeze for a couple, maybe a handful or two. Over here where it&#8217;s like some people are just like they&#8217;ll pretend you&#8217;re not there or if they need to reach for something, they&#8217;ll just reach right in front of you and I&#8217;m not used to that. I&#8217;m used to Philly kind of interaction which is like, okay, if you need something, I&#8217;m going to say excuse me and then get together, but thankfully, a lot of people weren&#8217;t born here and moved here and you can always tell because those are the people that are just like, &#8220;Oh, hello. How you doing?&#8221; They actually will have a conversation with you or have eye contact with you, but thankfully I&#8217;ve had the pleasure to make friends with a lot of people who weren&#8217;t having the Seattle freeze symptoms.</p>
<p>They wouldn&#8217;t have the Seattle freeze symptoms. They would just be completely themselves and open and nice and kind. Yeah. So, be over here in Seattle and Philly, I could tell you that the difference is that for sure is like, &#8220;Philly, you just need more green. You need a lot more green,&#8221; and then Seattle&#8217;s like, &#8220;Seattle, you just need to look more fun. You need to have a little bit more fun.&#8221; Yeah, it was definitely like a process and adjustment for me to go from East Coast to West Coast. Such a huge adjustment, but I&#8217;m still me. I&#8217;m still a Philadelphian. I even consider myself to be a little bit of Seattleite, but Philly come first because I was there most of my adult life. So, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What made you decide to move to Seattle from Philly?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
I wanted to be with my ex at the time. So, me and him both moved to Seattle and at that time, I was going through a lot of struggle, a lot of inner struggle, inner demons, what&#8217;s that? Imposter syndrome. My friends were trying to help me and my family were trying to help me and they were all so wonderfully attending and want to make sure I was okay, but I was not going to be okay until I was going to want to be okay or figure out some stuff. So, when I moved over to Seattle, it gave me that breathing space for me to figure out what&#8217;s going on with me and it took a hot minute too, but thanks to therapy, thanks to journaling, thanks to working out, thanks to being self-aware and giving myself those self-love affirmations, all that helped me become much more of a happier person to get in touch with that inner child that was suffering from all the seriousness of adulthood.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like I know we got responsibilities, but also we are supposed to live our life and have fun. I can&#8217;t lose that part of myself because that part of myself is a huge part of why I&#8217;m an artist. So, I have to make sure that I&#8217;m taking care of myself and giving myself that time and space I need to do what I need to do to make sure I am in a better place, and when I&#8217;m like that, I&#8217;m actually able to be there for other people more. I&#8217;m able to handle more. It&#8217;s just something that I think that everyone needs to take into consideration. It&#8217;s about like self-care, self-love, self-expression for sure. Self-expression because too many people hold things in and it builds up like a volcano and it explodes and it&#8217;s not fun. That was one of the things.</p>
<p>I was just like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t be living my life like that. I want to be happy. I want to make my work and be proud of the work I make and I want to be there for my friends and not feel exhausted or forced and doing all that work. That self-work allowed me to become much better.&#8221; That&#8217;s what I would say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you been able to tap into an artist community or a design community in Seattle?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Took me a hot minute, but I find it a little hilarious because I didn&#8217;t think it was going to work, but I went to a comic book store, Phoenix Comics &#038; Games, in Capitol Hill, and I went there, and I was looking at the local artists and they had local artists putting their comic books on the rack and I was like, &#8220;Oh, let me see if I could find somebody,&#8221; and thankfully I found my friend Tim, and his book, I think it&#8217;s called Enter the Wolves. He had his phone number and contact information in there, or was it just his email? Either way I contacted him and he responded and we met up. This is before I had any of our friends at all here on the West Coast. So, I went to go meet up with him. We hung out, had a cup of coffee, talked, and it was like later we decided to start making it a thing.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get together and draw and then we would do that and then we started to bring more people into the forward people. He knew people I would probably meet that were interested in meeting for the art meetup and it&#8217;s just now a regular thing and we&#8217;ve been doing it for years now, just doing our art meetup and drawing and just having a blast because one of the huge things I missed in Philly was my art community, was hang out with my friend Laurie and Kat and we would just hang out together and I loved that. I didn&#8217;t realize how much I would&#8217;ve miss that until I moved to Seattle and it was no longer accessible and I needed that back in my life or at least closest to as I could get. So, having that art community is a huge blessing and it&#8217;s awesome and it also helps me focus too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Ooh, if I&#8217;m going to be home I&#8217;m going to have to adjust myself, but if I go out and meet with my art friends, then I have no excuse. I can just go in there and start drawing because I&#8217;ll be fine and chill with my folks.&#8221; So, absolutely worth it of trying that, just emailing random artists like, &#8220;Hey, you want to meet up and such like that?&#8221; I&#8217;m just glad that I did that because usually I get social anxiety and I get nervous about talking to people, but it was like, no, I&#8217;m not going to let that stop me from making new friends. I&#8217;m going to go out there and I&#8217;m going to do it. Yeah, I&#8217;m just very grateful for that. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you spoke earlier about Larry Houston, but I&#8217;m curious, are there other artists or illustrators that have influenced your work the most?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Jim Lee.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Because he was drawing the X-Men back in, I think, the &#8217;80s, &#8217;90s-ish. Like I said, I&#8217;m a huge X-Men fan. You just don&#8217;t know. I have so much X-men on my wall about besides that. No, Jim Lee, it was definitely for sure because I loved the intensity he will put into his ink work. It was just so comic bookish style and it really made the X-Men look really cool and I was just like, &#8220;Oh my God, I could just read this all day.&#8221; Another artist I would say is Ross Straus. Him, I enjoy because of a lot of his potent color. Like my art teacher back in Hussain would talk about how juicy the colors are, you know? When we&#8217;re painting, she&#8217;s like, &#8220;Get the juice in there,&#8221; and I&#8217;m just like&#8230; ever since then when it comes to my art, I just have to put juice into my color.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like I need to make this a little bit more pow in your face. So, yes, that was definitely another one. Alex Ross is another one. He is much more of a traditional. He does works in, like I think traditional acrylics or oils. I&#8217;m not exactly sure, but he does work with traditional mediums and his work is taking the comic book world and making it more into a realistic kind of vibe and he does a lot of dramatic lighting too. So, I just loved it. I just love how he was able to take that world that was fiction and bring it so close to reality. So, sometimes I&#8217;m doing my work. If I&#8217;m working on a cover or something like that, I&#8217;ll step on comic book style. I&#8217;ll probably go for an illustration style just because it gives it a completely different vibe. It gives the character more of a breath of life kind of scenario.</p>
<p>I mean, I love the graphic feel, but something about just seeing a character that looks almost realistic. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh crap.&#8221; You&#8217;re just like, &#8220;That looks great,&#8221; and one more is Simon Bianchi. I hope I pronounced his last name right, but I believe he is a French artist who works for Marvel and he does a lot of acrylic watercolor kind of techniques where it&#8217;s a combination of realistic and comic book style and I just loved how he would illustrate such a dramatic use of colors and his hair detail. He would draw a lot of detail in the hair, but it would just look so beautifully well planned. I can&#8217;t even get into full detail about how his stuff works, but Simon Bianchi is definitely an artist I studied especially back in art school. When I was learning watercolor, I would just look at his pictures and I would just paint what I saw.</p>
<p>I would just paint up a panel I saw of his I really enjoyed and because of that, I actually got much better with watercolor the next year because watercolor was literally the first medium I was trying to get really good at and it took a hot minute for me to understand how to manipulate watercolor, but now it&#8217;s like after all those years of studying and investing time and studying that medium, watercolor, I just was excited to actually be able to utilize it to make an image the way I wanted to because watercolor is very, very tricky. So, thank you, Simon, for doing that for me because now I know how to paint.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you mentioned that your father was a traditional artist. Was he an illustrator also?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
He definitely did his own paintings. He didn&#8217;t do it professionally, but he wanted to, but unfortunately he didn&#8217;t have the support of his family, like not the way that I do and I&#8217;m just grateful for him to give me that support because he knows how hard it is out here in the creative field because so many people want to jump in and do it, but my dad still does make art till this day. Like I was talking to him and my mother for Mother&#8217;s Day and he showed me these pieces he was working on. It was so beautiful, abstract, gorgeous, surreal kind of fantasy and it just makes me so happy that he&#8217;s still making his art because this is a part of who he is. He might not be doing it professionally, but at least he&#8217;s still doing it and I&#8217;m just happy and proud of him for that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. What advice would you give to any aspiring artist? They&#8217;re hearing you talk about your work and your process and they want to follow in your footsteps. What advice would you give to them about just starting out in the industry?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Number one I think is patience. Patience with yourself, patience with the process of making art and patience with the process of getting work if you want to pursue it professionally. It took me a hot minute before I started to get more commissions coming in manually, and it took a while for me to get to that point where, hey, I don&#8217;t have to look for commissions. People just come to me and asked me, &#8220;Hey, can you do this for me?&#8221; All that took a while and like I said, without that actual chart to show you, hey, you&#8217;re on step two now. You&#8217;re on step three. Woo. Without that, it&#8217;s so easy for you to feel like you&#8217;re not moving. You&#8217;re standing still, like your career&#8217;s not going anywhere, and especially if you are starting off with illustrate, like you&#8217;re starting off by making art and you&#8217;re not at the level you want to be, it&#8217;s so hard to be patient with yourself, especially when you&#8217;re comparing yourself to other artists.</p>
<p>I think people need to have much more patience with themselves and understand that what&#8217;s going to get you there is consistency, to keep trying, to keep painting, to try new things, to share your work. Don&#8217;t be afraid to share your work. That&#8217;s something that I still struggle with sometime. I mean, I know I have a lot of content on my social media. Yes, I do, but there are moments where my partner will catch me. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t overthink it. Just write out your stuff and post it on there,&#8221; and I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;You&#8217;re right. I just wanted to be perfect,&#8221; but there&#8217;s no such thing as perfect. The best way to be perfect is to be yourself authentically and then there you go. Just be your genuine self. That is perfection.</p>
<p>I would definitely say that that&#8217;s something that that&#8217;s needed is patience. No one&#8217;s going to give you a timeline of when you&#8217;re going to get that job either and that&#8217;s frustrating. I could totally get that, but you also just got to&#8230; Like I said, you got to be patient with that process. You won&#8217;t know until it actually happens in that moment. Like this podcast, I didn&#8217;t think I was going to get interviewed for a podcast and next thing you know, it just pops out in a moment. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, wow. Okay.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Fine.&#8221; Even the Western Hotel thing, that was another random thing, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh my goodness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another thing I would say for sure is give yourself affirmations for sure. If you had to make yourself that list and cross something off that you got done to get that pat on the back kind of feel, then do it. I would say go for it. That&#8217;s absolutely necessary because it&#8217;s so easy for you to do things and then forget what you do because this happened to me before and still does sometimes. You forget what you do in the day and then you feel like you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, I could have done more.&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;No, no, you&#8217;re doing pretty darn good. Look at that list.&#8221; I think it&#8217;s definitely important to give yourself that affirmation and also to sometimes take a look back at your old art and look at your art the way it is now so that way you can give yourself that affirmation of, oh, I did grow. You know? Because it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s so&#8230; Being an artist is a marathon. It&#8217;s not a race. It&#8217;s a marathon. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying to be consistent and with that marathon you&#8217;re running, it&#8217;s so easy for you to feel like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not growing as an artist.&#8221; My skill level&#8217;s not improving or whatnot and it&#8217;s always good to look back at your old art pieces and don&#8217;t compare to other artists.</p>
<p>That other artist is on a completely different path than you. Not every artist is going to get a job the exact same way. Not every artist is going to get noticed the exact same way. It&#8217;s so different from each other, it&#8217;s frustrating because you wish that there was a book to go ahead and tell you like, &#8220;This is exactly how you do it.&#8221; Oh no, there&#8217;s no book. You just got to put your stuff out there and be consistent and don&#8217;t be a butt hole. That&#8217;s another thing. When you&#8217;re talking to people, always want to be a genuine person, but also treat that person with fellow respect. No one likes to work with somebody who&#8217;s mean or nasty or comes off as aggressive. No, like this is networking and building a relationship, a friendship. You want to make sure that you are presenting yourself the best way you can be that is genuine and true, and I think that&#8217;s just something to absolutely consider as well and another thing I think that&#8217;s beneficial is trying out new things.</p>
<p>Like I&#8217;ve done watercolor, acrylics, used acrylics as watercolor and on canvas, digital painting. Now, I&#8217;m starting to get into story boarding and sculpting. Sculpting too. It&#8217;s like you are an artist and yes, you have a preference, but it&#8217;s always refreshing just to get into something just a little bit new and it keeps your excitement up. It keeps you like, ooh, I&#8217;m so excited just to try that out. You&#8217;ll see what comes out and everything. I&#8217;m painting on canvas now, and usually I don&#8217;t paint on canvas. I usually leave that alone, but with that 10-minute piece painting I was doing at the Western Hotel, that was something that really brought that out on me that I was like, &#8220;I want to paint on canvas. I want to try that out.&#8221; I feel something that&#8217;s pulling me towards that and it was like that kid-like spark that was like, &#8220;Ooh, I need that.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, now doing that and looking at the canvas, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I am happy,&#8221; and I think that&#8217;s definitely something important to do is don&#8217;t be afraid to challenge yourself and don&#8217;t be afraid to show your art, self-affirmations and patience with yourself, and one more I think is self-awareness, and self-awareness, I mean by that is just acknowledging if you are upset about something because being an artist isn&#8217;t just drawing pictures. It&#8217;s you&#8217;re putting your energy into that piece. You&#8217;re giving parts or you&#8217;re putting parts of yourself into that piece, and if you&#8217;re upset or going through something, it&#8217;s going to show up, or you might not be able to draw as well. You might not be able to think as well. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to be self-aware about what state of mind you&#8217;re in, and it&#8217;s all about just giving yourself that attention, acknowledging that you&#8217;re not okay or you&#8217;re upset, or maybe you&#8217;re just tired and burnt out.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good for you to acknowledge this and to know this so that way you can just take care of yourself, give yourself a hug, or get a hug from a friend or talk to somebody you trust, and this is definitely something that will help you out for sure because being an artist, and especially in a world like this, it&#8217;s stressful. It can be very stressful, but it&#8217;s also very, very rewarding, especially when you are just giving it your all and you see it pay off. It&#8217;s something absolutely worth it, and long as you are just making sure that you&#8217;re your own best friend, you&#8217;re going to get there just like you got to make sure you give yourself some loving and you got to make sure that you just acknowledge when you need something, and I think that&#8217;s important too. That&#8217;s my advice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have a dream project you&#8217;d love to do one day?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Oh, okay. It&#8217;s on my list. It&#8217;s on top of my list. I want to be a cover artist for Marvel, because I just like doing illustrations. I just love doing the storytelling. I want to be a cover artist. I want to do full-on paintings and do stuff for them. I want to do stuff for Wizards of the Coast because I love the overall style of their world. They&#8217;re just this beautiful like&#8230; It&#8217;s like Renaissance paintings. I don&#8217;t know if you know what I&#8217;m talking about, but it&#8217;s like they have that soft glow. It&#8217;s like the way they paint them. I was going to the Seattle Art Museum, and I was noticing these pieces that were back in the day Renaissance Times where I have no clue how they did it, but the way they painted, it&#8217;s almost looked like they were computers themselves, but you could still tell it was by an artist, of course. The way they just captured a glow or the texture or the way the person was, like the way they were standing. It&#8217;s just like their bodies weren&#8217;t even stiff. Something like that. It&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Oh God. Yes. That is exactly what I need.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We had someone on the show a couple of months ago, Lauren Brown. I think she&#8217;s an art director at Wizards of the Coast. I&#8217;m looking now. Yeah, Emmy Award-winning illustrator and art director at Wizards of the Coast. She&#8217;s here in Atlanta too. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Oh, nice. I&#8217;m going to look them up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes. Yeah, so there&#8217;s a lot. I mean, there&#8217;s certainly, I think as you sort of mentioned that, I think that opportunity is definitely going to be out there for you because as I talked about earlier, it just seems like there&#8217;s more and more Black people, really people of color, but I&#8217;d say Black people specifically that are really being out there, especially with the major titles. I&#8217;m really surprised to see how many are doing things for Marvel. We&#8217;ve had a few motion graphics designers that have done work for some of the movies, like Black Panther or into the Spider-Verse. It&#8217;s amazing how we are starting to get out there more. I mean, granted, it&#8217;s still not super diverse like in the grand scheme of things, but I feel like that&#8217;s going to happen for you sooner rather than later. I really think that.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Oh, thank you. Yes, please. I want that as like I can feel my spirit trying to grab it with its hands. It&#8217;s like I want it. It&#8217;s like I need that because in the future, I want to have my own company, like Marvel or Wizards of the Coast where it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m able to give those same opportunities for other people of color and especially Black people. It&#8217;s like there&#8217;s so much talent there and it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s so untapped and now we&#8217;re just tapping into it. It&#8217;s so much more like Woman King. Oh my God. [The] Woman King, Viola Davis, like oh my God. Thank you for doing that movie because that was amazing. Michelle Yeoh about&#8230; What&#8217;s it? Everything In Our Place. That&#8217;s a long title.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Everything Everywhere All at Once.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Yes, that&#8217;s another one. It&#8217;s like see what happens when people of color and diversity is represented. You get awesomeness. You get wonderful stories. It&#8217;s just something that is needed and in the future, if I can provide that opportunity for more people, I will. If I can reach back and grab my fellow artists and be like, &#8220;Hey, I did not forget about you. Come here. I got something for you.&#8221; I want to do that and I feel like that&#8217;s something that a lot of people of the community should be doing. It&#8217;s the only way for us to excel and expose ourselves to more and get our names out there because there&#8217;s so much that haven&#8217;t been shown yet and we&#8217;re just tapping the tip of the iceberg for all this. I just think it&#8217;s going to be amazing and I just can&#8217;t wait to be a part of it.</p>
<p>I just want to be a part of it, and I just want to be there with my fellow nerds, my fellow awesome nerds and yes, just being in a convention surrounded by people who are raised in the same world that you were raised in. You know, just like anything, like fantasy, sci-fi, comics, movies, games, all that. It&#8217;s such a beautiful way to bond with people and to share that. It&#8217;s so much fun and I feel like one of the biggest things, adults forget to have fun and to be a kid again, and honestly being an adult, you&#8217;re just older and you forget to tend to that inner child and it&#8217;s like, no, no, no, no, no. So, it&#8217;s when adults go to conventions and it&#8217;s like someone who&#8217;s like 50 and they&#8217;re still buying action figures and whatnot, go for it. Do it.</p>
<p>You work so hard. You get that action figure. You get it and you flaunt it like seriously. It&#8217;s just like we need to make sure we&#8217;re balancing out that fun and I feel like that&#8217;s what my work and the industry of creativity gives to people, gives you that permission. Even though you don&#8217;t need permission, you should be having fun. It gives you that childhood like happiness, and I think that that&#8217;s why the reasons why it&#8217;s so important to be an artist is to bring that out of people so people can still feel that. I think it&#8217;s still so important for it. I think it&#8217;s very important.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? I mean, I feel like you&#8217;ve already spoken some of that into the universe now, but what do you want the next chapter of your story to look like?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Oh, goodness. I have visions of how I want things to look like. As I say this to you, I&#8217;m actually looking at my manifestation board. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve come to really enjoy doing because I&#8217;m looking at my manifestation board and some of it&#8217;s already come true, which is great, but in the future, I would like to go to more conventions for sure. That&#8217;s something I love doing, just to be in that world full of people who enjoy the same things I do and to interact with them and to show them my work. It&#8217;s one of the greatest gifts to create art and someone comes along and they&#8217;re just entranced by it or they are feeling things because of it, that the art has moved to some kind of way, and I think that is awesome. So, I definitely will want more of that.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t had my work in galleries before, so I am focusing on getting my work in galleries too, because now painting on Canvas, it&#8217;s like I want to develop so much art on canvas, bigger size, small size, all the size. So, I definitely want to have more of my work in the galleries and I want to have my comic book up and have it out there because it&#8217;s like my own stories I&#8217;ve had on my mind for a while. I started to give it some more work recently, so I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m grateful that I&#8217;m starting to get back into that,&#8221; and in the future, I would definitely love to have a comic book made officially, have a shiny cover, and maybe a 3D model made of a character.</p>
<p>Five years from now, I just want to be making art like crazy and I want to be a part of those teams that make fun projects like people at Marvel, like the people who get to be a part of the whole process of the movie and whatnot. I would love to be a part of that. I would love to be part of a company like Wizards of the Coast where it&#8217;s like I can give contributions to like, hey, let&#8217;s make this character, whatnot, and just design new stories and characters and whatnot. I would love to do that just to be fully submerged more into my craft, and I think that&#8217;s something that I have recently come to full-on terms, which is like acknowledging that this is not only my career, but being an artist is my life and I love being an artist. So, it&#8217;s like I just want more of all of that. I am greedy and I want all of that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Well, I do have my own personal website. It is my full name, www.isiahxavierbradley.com. You do have to include the Xavier in there because otherwise you&#8217;re going to get the Black Captain America, which-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah, that was his name from&#8230; I remember that from the show, from Falcon, Winter Soldier. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Yes. Yeah. I&#8217;ve always found that hilarious. I was like named Dr. Superheroes, even my middle name. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh my goodness.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I think I was born to do this.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s destiny. Yeah, it&#8217;s what it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Yeah, like universe, you have a heck of a personality, don&#8217;t you? Also, I do have Instagram and Twitter and TikTok, which all you can find under my handle, Isiah_XB, and then there&#8217;s my Facebook as well. You can always go under my full name, Isiah Xavier Bradley and my page would show up. Just include that Xavier part, and we&#8217;re all good, and most people get confused with how to spell my name, so I am going to say it&#8217;s spelled I-S-I-A-H, and then underscore XB. Most people spell Isiah with two As. For some reason, mine is just with one A. I don&#8217;t know why, but okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. There you go. Well, Isiah Xavier Bradley, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on this show. I think if there&#8217;s anything that people will get from this interview is that you have this joy. It&#8217;s not even passion. I mean, I will say passion is probably there too, but you have this joy about just the fact that you&#8217;re doing exactly what it is that you want to do that is infectious. You&#8217;re excited about the genre. You&#8217;re excited about your work. You&#8217;re excited about all these things, but you&#8217;ve also taken the time to make sure that your own self is prospering and well throughout all of this.</p>
<p>I mean, the world is changing at such a rapid rate. I mean, you talked about self-care and rituals and things of this nature, so I really get a feeling that people will listen to this and they&#8217;ll get a really good sense of you as an artist, as a creative, and hopefully we&#8217;ll follow your work and we&#8217;ll see that Marvel cover one day. I&#8217;m putting it out there. We&#8217;re going to see you one day, but yeah, thank you again so much for coming on the show, man. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Isiah Xavier Bradley:</b><br>
Well, thank you so much for your time, Maurice. I really do appreciate it. This has been awesome. You really made up my day. I can&#8217;t stop smiling right now. I&#8217;m just excited, just like I&#8217;m going to start painting all day today, like I was already drawing and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to get into it real good.&#8221; So, thank you so much for your time and this opportunity. I&#8217;m really grateful, Maurice. Thank you so much.</p>

<p>I had to connect with Morgan Bissant after seeing a few of her images of 90s sitcoms make the rounds on Twitter. Her work definitely captures to the richness of the Black experience, and she&#8217;s done everything from editorial work for Comcast to children&#8217;s illustrations and book covers. But that&#8217;s not all!</p>
<p>Morgan and I talked about some of her big freelance projects, and she spoke on how Black pop culture, especially animation, is a big source of inspiration and her creative process. We also discussed how she stays up on trends in the industry, how she handles burnout, and she gave us a look into her current art journey and creative process. Morgan&#8217;s experiences and raw talent are a unique combination, and I think we&#8217;ll definitely see more of her amazing work in the future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
My name is Morgan Bissant. I am a graphic designer and illustrator. I do a lot of branding work. I do a lot of layout design, I do web design, but something that I&#8217;ve always been more passionate about is illustration and I&#8217;ve been doing illustration work since I was old enough to hold a pencil. Currently, I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of illustration work for different companies and publishers. I&#8217;ve been working on children&#8217;s books, I&#8217;ve been doing promotional material. That&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve really enjoyed doing. I enjoy being able to actually use my craft, I guess, in bigger spaces.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. It sounds like it keeps you pretty busy.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yes, it&#8217;s a lot. It definitely takes up a lot of time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has this year been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
So far it&#8217;s been going pretty good. I&#8217;ve actually started a new full-time job probably a couple months back, I want to say. I started a new full-time job doing graphic design work and I work at a marketing agency called OrthoSynetics. It&#8217;s been nice being able to do a lot of different things. In my previous job, we designed a lot of baby products, and in this job we do a lot of different marketing products. So, we&#8217;ll do flyers, we&#8217;ll do social posts, we&#8217;ll do websites. I was able to work on a major branding project for a new doctor that we picked up for our agency, and that&#8217;s all been pretty exciting. It&#8217;s really different from what I&#8217;m used to doing. It&#8217;s a much faster pace than some of my earlier jobs and projects, but it&#8217;s been a lot of fun. I like being able to do a lot of different things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Keeps me interested.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Congratulations on the new job.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have any plans for the summer? Anything coming up?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Not necessarily. I&#8217;m just seeing what may be over the horizon maybe. So, I&#8217;ve currently been working on doing some freelance projects and I&#8217;m just always trying to keep myself open to seeing if I could get some other things, follow up with those. I&#8217;m always trying to see what other opportunities that I may have and other work that I can take on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I saw back in September last year that you had did some work for Comcast for their Black History Month series, which ran this year. Can you tell me a little bit about that?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah, sure. So, actually it ran last year. I ended up reposting it because I&#8217;m pretty proud of it, so I&#8217;m going to keep sharing it. So, this was something that we worked on last year. It was a partnership that they reached out to me for. I had initially gotten their attention because I had seen one of their ads on Twitter and it was something for the Olympic Games, and I saw there was this little black girl and she was looking at the screen in awe and seeing the black athletes doing all kind of stuff, and she was just so amazed and everything. And I just thought she was just so cute and I was like, &#8220;I just have to draw this little girl because she&#8217;s adorable.&#8221; And so I went ahead and illustrated how she looked in the ad and I figured out I would just post it and tag them, because why not?</p>
<p>And they ended up seeing it and they really liked what they saw. And so I want to say a couple months down the line, they reached out to me and they said, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re doing this campaign for Black History Month, and we really loved the artwork that you tagged us in on Twitter. So, we wanted you to do something actually in partnership with us this time in celebration of Black History Month.&#8221; And that was pretty exciting. So, they asked me to do a couple of different illustrations. The first two that they asked for, they wanted some illustrations of Erin Jackson and Elana Meyers Taylor for the Winter games.</p>
<p>They followed up and they said that they wanted to do something else, something I guess a little bit more Black History Month specific. They wanted to do the McDonogh Three. I know a lot of people aren&#8217;t exactly aware of who those are, and that is three little girls that desegregated McDonogh 19 in New Orleans in the 1960s. And that was something I was really excited about doing, because being from New Orleans, that was something a bit more personal for me. Them doing that, desegregating schools is what gave me the opportunities that I had growing up, and that was something that I really was excited to do.</p>
<p>So, I was over the moon about that part of it, and I went through everything to put the illustrations together and they wanted two separate illustrations, so they wanted to show, I guess, a parallel of the past and show them as little girls, and one in the present. So, just showing them how they are now and I guess illustrating how far they&#8217;ve come over the years and what their sacrifices meant to people, and also to show that these women are still alive today. And a lot of people always think that, &#8220;Well that happened so long ago, and everybody that was involved in that is probably gone and all of that is over,&#8221; but they&#8217;re still here. They&#8217;re still here to tell the stories, and they&#8217;re still here to push a lot of the, I guess I want to say, push a lot of what was hidden, a lot of the things that were lost historically because a lot of people know about Ruby Bridges, but a lot of people also don&#8217;t know about them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean there&#8217;s a lot of layers to that, that I think is really cool. One that Comcast saw an illustration that you did and they were like, &#8220;Oh, this is great. Can you do some work for us?&#8221; I feel like you hear those sorts of things sometimes is being discovered out of nowhere things, but I think that&#8217;s really cool that they just picked up on some work that you put online and they really wanted to keep working with it. I think that was great, but also the levels of being able to do something that&#8217;s tied to history, especially civil rights history in this country as people from this podcast.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m from Selma, Alabama, so I grew up in that cradle of the civil rights movement, and there are so many stories about things that have happened that we knew about, the bigger things we knew about the March to Montgomery, as you mentioned, we know about Ruby Bridges, but we don&#8217;t know about some of these lesser known stories and struggles and triumphs that have happened.</p>
<p>And so I think it&#8217;s great that you were able to create some work that shone a light on that and to let people know that while this is &#8220;history,&#8221; it&#8217;s also the present. Like you said, these women are still alive, so the fact that they are still here and that they fought for these rights is something that we should all be aware of.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yes, it&#8217;s always good to make sure you&#8217;re informed. And it&#8217;s always good to be able to put more things out there and shine light on things that we don&#8217;t know about, because there&#8217;s just so much stuff that we didn&#8217;t learn in school and just so many things in general that just get overlooked in favor of just those little three big figures like Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King. I mean nothing&#8217;s wrong with learning about them obviously.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s sad that that&#8217;s all most people really know about and they barely know about them either.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I think it&#8217;s also telling that, in the past, media was really the thing that brought the whole civil rights movement to the nation. I mean because a lot of these things were happening in small southern towns, et cetera, and it wasn&#8217;t, I think until the incidents of, I think it was Bloody Sunday that happened in Selma. It wasn&#8217;t until those incidents where there were actually cameras and then that footage got broadcast across the nation that people saw about it. So, in a way, you can see how there&#8217;s a lot of stories and things that happen that we just don&#8217;t know about. Parts of history that get covered up.</p>
<p>I think people are just starting to really know about, for example, Bayard Rustin or Claudette Colvin, and people have mentioned Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, but not these other people that were behind the scenes maybe, or that did the work that they did before they did. So, a lot of those stories, it&#8217;s interesting, are now also being uncovered through media. I think within the past, I&#8217;d say at least in the past 10 years, I&#8217;ve seen so many black creators unearth a lot of these stories through animation, through illustration, et cetera. I think it&#8217;s really great. It&#8217;s really great.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s always something exciting to see.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s talk more about your work as a freelance illustrator. You mentioned that you&#8217;re also working full-time at this agency OrthoSynetics. What does a regular day look like for you right now?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
With working full-time, that gets a lot of my time. Basically what we do is we have a certain amount of projects that we have to get done throughout the day, and it&#8217;s generally a nine to five situation, and so we&#8217;ll have certain things that we&#8217;ll work on. We might have banners that we might have to do, we might have billboards, but it basically varies from day-to-day what we might have to work on. The things that we do are mainly for orthodontists and dentist, and that&#8217;s just a lot of what we see.</p>
<p>We might have flyers advertising different prices for dental work or different offers or things along those lines. So, that&#8217;s basically what we have our eyes on throughout the day. Now, as far as doing any freelance work, I have to put that, I guess, on the tail end of my day or reserve that for the weekends because we&#8217;re generally just so busy with doing graphic design work at the agency that sometimes it can be a little tough to juggle. But generally speaking, when I do get freelance projects, I&#8217;m given a sufficient amount of time to complete them. So, it&#8217;s not like I have to do everything at work and then come rush home and then just rush and get a book cover done in five minutes.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ll have months and months to work on things and get things done, and I&#8217;ll do that in my free time that I have. Sometimes I&#8217;ll work on things while I&#8217;m listening to music or while I&#8217;m watching a TV show that I enjoy to motivate me or I guess help me to get into a groove. It just helps to do it when I have, I guess, some breathing room to do so, which again, with the deadlines, it does help to give me some breathing room to actually get a lot of these projects done, and I try not to take on too much at a time so that I won&#8217;t be overbooked.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean that&#8217;s a good thing. I know that you&#8217;re represented by an agency, which we&#8217;ll talk about a little bit later. I imagine your agent knows that too. So, when you&#8217;re getting booked for things, you can&#8217;t do something last minute, there has to be some buffer time around it for you to be able to get it done.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah. They have different industry standards on what is appropriate for different projects. Now sometimes people will come and be like, &#8220;Hey, we need you to get this done in two days,&#8221; which I mean, it&#8217;s really ultimately up to you on whether or not you want to take it with not enough time to get it done. But generally speaking, for larger projects especially, you definitely need a sufficient amount of time to finish things. And especially in a creative space, you don&#8217;t want to be pushed to the limit and be getting yourself burnt out when you&#8217;re trying to come up with ideas that look good and are executed well. I always try to do things that are within my means. Now, if it&#8217;s something like maybe smaller and it might be a little bit of rush, I just feel like I have time and I feel like I might be able to do it, I might grab it. But usually if it&#8217;s a little too tight, I might ask for more time or I might have just have to pass on that one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Now, I&#8217;m looking through your website now. I see of course you&#8217;ve done illustration work, but there&#8217;s logo design work here. You&#8217;ve done book illustrations, character designs, all of it is really great, and I mentioned this to you right before we started recording that I saw your work on Twitter because you had done this character lineup of the main cast from Living Single. And I mean the style of it was so good. I was like, &#8220;I have to reach out to her to see if she can come on the podcast.&#8221; Are you influenced a lot by TV and pop culture in your work?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I am. That actually is what pushed me to start drawing, and that&#8217;s really what made me want to do it more seriously. Pop culture is a huge part of it, especially things that are immersed in black culture. Obviously me being black, that&#8217;s my own culture and it&#8217;s something that I can pull inspiration from my personal experiences. Things like anime and cartoons, they&#8217;ve always fueled my desire for illustration. I&#8217;ve always been influenced by things like Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball Z and things like that. Growing up, I was very small and watching a lot of these programs, and that&#8217;s what made me want to draw. I started copying things that I saw while I was watching TV. I would be watching Sailor Moon in the mornings and I&#8217;d said, &#8220;Well, I want to draw Sailor Moon.&#8221; And so I would be working until I got her to what I felt was right and was an accurate depiction of what she looked like on the screen.</p>
<p>And as I got older and I started cultivating my talents and working on my skills, started trying to branch off and do other things. And I&#8217;ve always tried to start creating my own concepts and characters, and nowadays I am still heavily influenced by anime and animation in general, but a lot of other things that I was exposed to like different black sitcoms and cartoons, that also had an impact on my overall style. Bruce W. Smith has always been one of my huge inspirations for illustration work. I&#8217;ve always liked his style since The Proud Family and B√©b√©&#8217;s Kids, Happily Ever After, Fairy Tales for Every Child.</p>
<p>That always was a draw to me. And I&#8217;ve mimicked some of my style and my character designs around some of the things that he&#8217;s done, and I mean he isn&#8217;t one of the only influences that I have, but that&#8217;s always something that I&#8217;ve seen growing up, and I&#8217;ve always liked his style and I&#8217;ve always wanted to, I guess, put a little bit of that into my style. And so nowadays I have this, I guess, combination of all of these different influences that have created what I have today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, talk to me about how you approach a new project. What does your creative process look like when a new project comes across your table?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
So, for basically any new project that I have, whether it just be freelance or something personal, I always try to brainstorm first. I might write down ideas or just sketch things down, and I just try to just do things and just get my brain going. I don&#8217;t always have something in mind before I start sketching, so I have this approach where I&#8217;ll just start doing anything. Well, not anything, but I&#8217;ll start trying to draw different things and just see where it takes me and then try to give myself a couple of different options and variations in what I might want to do with it, and then just see where it goes from there. This is especially true for larger projects, because I definitely have to see where I&#8217;m going before I start tackling something so huge.</p>
<p>So, I always have to sketch things out first. I always have to get ideas down first, and if I have any troubles or bumps in the road, I might go online. I have my Pinterest, I have all these bookmarks and stuff on Instagram. I have all these bookmarks on Twitter of different photographs or screenshots or fashion or just whatever, and I might use that as a way to, I guess, give myself a little bit of inspiration so I can push myself in the right direction. Because sometimes I can&#8217;t always come up with things just immediately from the top of my head.</p>
<p>So, it helps for me to look at some things. It helps for me to continuously draw things until I can get some ideas to come out that I like. I always try to keep things in my back pocket that I can always pull up later in terms of references and images that I might have saved that I think that I could probably use going forward for my creative process.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Was there ever a really particularly hard design or illustration that you had to create for a project?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I think that probably one of the hardest things that I have worked on in recent years would be probably the illustration that I did for the Crescent City Sneaker Ball. It was both illustration and it was a graphic designed invitation, and I&#8217;m really happy with how it came out, but there was a lot of thought that had to go into it, and there was a lot that I had to consider like, &#8220;Okay, how is this going to work? How can I fit this in here?&#8221; Because it was a little bit different from what I usually do. Everything was a collage and I had to make sure all the pieces fit together and flowed together and had to make sure things didn&#8217;t look too cluttered or too structured. So, it took a lot of working around with that one and playing around with it to make it work.</p>
<p>But I think ultimately all things considered, it came out pretty cute. It was a lot to think about. It was a lot to figure out how everything should go and everything should work together. I&#8217;m also really not too fantastic with buildings, or at least I personally don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m all that great with them. And that had a lot of structures in it. I like drawing people more. That&#8217;s always been my thing. I&#8217;ve always liked drawing characters, so structures and boats and street cars and stuff, I&#8217;ve never really done a lot of that. And that added to the challenge. So, executing that, it was a lot for me, but ultimately I&#8217;m glad I took that on. I thought it came out pretty nice, all things considered.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have any upcoming projects that you can talk about? Anything you&#8217;re excited about?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if this would be considered upcoming, but the book that I have recently illustrated for Lamar Giles that is going to be coming out next month, and I&#8217;m actually pretty excited about that one. So, I mean, I don&#8217;t know if I would call that an upcoming project because I&#8217;ve already finished it, but we haven&#8217;t gotten the printed books yet. And so I&#8217;m honestly very excited to see how it will come out on paper, because I&#8217;ve seen what it looks like on my computer, but I want to see it in book form. It&#8217;s just an entirely new feeling you get when you actually see your work just tangible and you can hold it in your hand and on a professional level, because you can print out your own stuff at Office Depot or something, but it&#8217;s not the same as this is a book that&#8217;s going to be in Barnes &#038; Noble.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost so weird because I never thought that I would ever get to this point in my life where I would actually be seeing my name on the cover of children&#8217;s books or seeing the book actually in store somewhere. So, that&#8217;s pretty cool and I&#8217;m excited to actually get some copies of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I mean I think it&#8217;s always an accomplishment when something you do makes it on a book or a magazine or something like that, because it&#8217;s so finite. Things that are on the web can get redesigned or deleted or moved or stuff like that. But a book or a magazine or something like that, that&#8217;s permanent.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
It&#8217;s exciting. Like he said, it&#8217;s not the same. I mean you can post all your stuff on Instagram and I mean nothing&#8217;s wrong with that or anything. It&#8217;s great to have your stuff out there, but it&#8217;s totally different to go outside and see your work there at the store and other people actually see it. And people that might not even have Instagram or Twitter, they can see your work, and people that are working in these industries, they can actually see your work. And that&#8217;s almost like an out of body experience sometimes thinking about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s a really big deal. It&#8217;s a big deal. I think it&#8217;s a big deal. I want to get more into your work and your career, but before that, I want to learn more just about you. As you mentioned earlier, you&#8217;re a New Orleans native. Tell me about growing up in New Orleans. Did you do a lot of creative stuff as a kid?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I did. I don&#8217;t know if that necessarily had to do a lot with me living in New Orleans, I did have a lot of opportunities to be creative growing up. We did have a lot of stuff at our schools where we could paint murals and things on the walls. I had this one art teacher in elementary school, Mr. Baldwin, and he had all of the art students paint this, I guess, prehistoric scene of all the dinosaurs on the cafeteria wall, and I thought that was so much fun. I wish I could do more things like that. I just always liked collaborative types of projects and things that were always, I guess, larger than life, at least to me. Because like I was saying before with the book, it&#8217;s different when everybody can see it like that. And I think as a child, that really pushed the importance of artwork to me because it didn&#8217;t just trivialize it as this little hobby that kindergartners do when they draw with crayon on paper and things like that.</p>
<p>It actually took our craft seriously and it encouraged us to pursue what we were doing. It gave a credence to art, and I think that that&#8217;s always important for little kids that enjoy that stuff. I think that it&#8217;s always important to encourage what they&#8217;re doing because that&#8217;s something that needs to be fostered, that&#8217;s something that needs to be developed. And if it&#8217;s something that they really enjoy and that they want to go forward with it, I don&#8217;t see why you shouldn&#8217;t encourage it and give them opportunities to push them and put their work out there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Was your family really supportive of you going in that route?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah, they always have been. So, like I was saying before, I&#8217;ve been drawing since I was able to pick up a pencil. I don&#8217;t remember this, but this is what my mom told me, so this is what I have to go off of. So, I have just always been drawing things and I guess the things that I was drawing were a little bit more developed than what the average toddler would do, and I guess I was showing that I was able to pick up different forms more than somebody that would have that natural inclination. As I got older, my drawings started getting a little bit more developed, and as I was watching cartoons, I was drawing the cartoons that I saw on TV, and they weren&#8217;t exactly stick figures. I always tried to get them as close as I possibly can with the skills that I had at three years old.</p>
<p>And as I got older, my parents, they noticed what I had and they put me in different programs. They tried to get me in talented art classes at school, and they always wanted to give me a chance to grow as an artist, and they always encouraged what I did. They always saw what I had, they saw the talent that I had, and they always wanted to encourage me to continue doing it and to pursue it. And eventually I ended up pursuing that as a full-time thing. Now, graphic design is different from a illustration, but it&#8217;s still a form of art, and that&#8217;s something that they never stopped me from doing it. They were like, &#8220;No, don&#8217;t do this. Be a lawyer.&#8221; They wanted me to do what I enjoyed doing, and I&#8217;m really grateful for that, that I always had a supportive family that always pushed me to do what would make me happy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I mean, graphic design is a gateway into I think a lot of different just visual designs. I mean back in the day I think it was all just called communication design, and then it splintered off into advertising. And then I think especially with the advent of the personal computer and Photoshop and stuff like that, it became desktop publishing and then it was graphic design. So, it&#8217;s a gateway into a lot of different things. I mean, as you mentioned, you really wanted to do it enough to the point where you ended up studying it. You went to Louisiana State University, majored in graphic design there. How was your time there at the school?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I really liked the time that I had, because they gave us a lot of time to explore a lot of different things. So, with the curriculum that we had, which it was basically called fine arts, the entire degree itself, they gave us opportunities to do a lot of different mediums of art. Your primary major would be graphic design, and that was what was ultimately the focus. But we had classes where we could illustrate, where we could paint. If we wanted to, we could explore photography, we could explore welding and print making.</p>
<p>So, they gave us a lot of different mediums and avenues that we can dip our feet in and see how we liked it, or we could even use those things to apply them to graphic design in a way. So, myself, I&#8217;ve always been interested in illustration. I always wanted to put illustration in my graphic design work, and so when we took a lot of illustration classes there, it also helped me to develop my style and pay attention to a lot of things that maybe I might have been overlooking.</p>
<p>So, it helped me to improve my craft overall when I took illustration classes. And I could always bring that back into graphic design where I could maybe draw characters and now my characters look more refined, or I could draw different symbols, and now everything looks a little better, it looks sharper and it looks more professional. And that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve always liked. So, I don&#8217;t know exactly how every other school tackles this degree, but I really did like that about it, because it gave us a lot of different options to go in. You weren&#8217;t exactly forced to do all of them. So, I was never really huge on photography. So, I didn&#8217;t do photography, but I had another option.</p>
<p>If instead I wanted to do painting, or I wanted to do sculpture making, I could do one of those. And that&#8217;s something that I really appreciated. It gave us a lot of different things that we could go into, and I felt like that helped me in the long run because while it gave me a graphic design degree, which helped me getting a full-time job, it also helped me in terms of art in general, because all of those illustration classes, they helped me in terms of anatomy and in terms of composition and things like that, that you can use that in graphic design, but ultimately you could use that in illustration too, because that&#8217;s a lot of what I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean it sounds like the program was really expansive to allow you to just try out a lot of different things and see what you liked the best.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah, they gave us a lot to work with, and that was just a lot of, I don&#8217;t know if you would call them collectives, but they weren&#8217;t exactly our core classes. They were just things that you can pick to add on to what you were doing. And even within graphic design, we still had a lot of things that they gave us that we could explore, like typography and making different graphic symbols and things like that. So, we always had a huge variety, which that was great, honestly, for all of us. Because a lot of people, they branched off and did other things and they found that taking this drawing class, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, now I want to do books.&#8221; Or &#8220;I took this photography class and now I want to do photography and I want to do events.&#8221; And that was always something that I felt was influenced by the fact that we had all of these options.</p>
<p>And I always thought it was really great, and it made the curriculum a lot more fun. I always liked drawing. I always had fun drawing. So, being able to take all these drawing classes, it was nice. And then it gave me a little bit more of an outlet, because graphic design isn&#8217;t always about drawing. Sometimes it&#8217;s about laying out things, and sometimes it can get a little bit monotonous, especially if it&#8217;s all for school projects and things. But if you have time to go on the side and go draw a polar bear or a bowl of fruit, and that&#8217;s something that you enjoy doing, it can make your time in school more enjoyable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So, when you graduated, did you have an idea lined up about what you wanted to do next?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I honestly was not exactly sure, but at the same time, I actually already had an opportunity lined up for me before I even graduated.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
So, a couple of months before I graduated, me and a few other students had gotten recruited by a local business called Impression Works, where we did photo books and greeting cards and things like that, and we could basically do whatever we felt like worked. So, it didn&#8217;t always have to be layout stuff. If we wanted to put illustrations in them, we could, and it gave us a little bit of creative freedom. And that was nice to be able to have during school, because it was a bit of a safety net in terms of having a job when I graduated. But then on top of that, I had a little bit of income coming in while I was in school, and it was flexible because we could do most of our work from home.</p>
<p>So, I was able to just work on projects for work in my free time, and we were still interns/part-time, so we weren&#8217;t totally overloaded with things where we couldn&#8217;t balance homework and senior projects and work work. And that ended up working out for a little while. And then it was a contract job, so once the contract was up after that, I had to try to turn around and try to find something else as soon as I could. And I wasn&#8217;t exactly sure how that was going to work out, because with me being pretty illustration oriented, I wasn&#8217;t sure how I would&#8217;ve liked something that didn&#8217;t really allow me to do that. And I know that a lot of graphic design jobs don&#8217;t really have a heavy focus on that. And so I was always wondering, &#8220;Well, will I be able to fit into another job somewhere or at a real firm?&#8221;</p>
<p>Because I really didn&#8217;t do a whole lot of layout at the time, and I didn&#8217;t have a whole lot of that in my portfolio outside of a couple of school projects. So, I was wondering how that was going to work out. And I ended up landing another full-time job at a company called Sassy Baby. That was a place where we got to design a lot of baby products. So, we would draw the little characters that were on bibs and bath products, and there were a couple little toys and stuff, we designed teethers and things like that. And that actually worked out in terms of capturing the, I guess, the niche that I am in, because being a graphic designer and an illustrator isn&#8217;t always&#8230; it is I guess. A lot of people who are graphic designers, they&#8217;re not illustrators, and a lot of illustrators are not graphic designers.</p>
<p>So, I guess I felt like I was different in that sense. But that job that I found, it ended up working out pretty well because I got to draw cute little characters. And we also had to do a lot of graphic design, we had to do a lot of layout things, we had to do a lot of presentation materials. So, graphic design of course helped me in those aspects. But being an illustrator helped me in terms of being able to capture different likenesses of little bears and bunnies and things like that. That was a pretty nice job, because we got a lot of tangible products out of it. You&#8217;d go in Walmart and you&#8217;d see the bibs that you designed. You&#8217;d see the little patterns of characters and things that you did, and you could go to Target or Meijer or wherever, and you could see the work that you&#8217;ve done, and you&#8217;d see it on full display for people to buy. And that was always cool. And it was always rewarding in a sense, to see your work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m so glad that you said that about a graphic designer&#8217;s not an illustrator. Illustrator&#8217;s not a graphic designer, because I feel like sometimes, and this is really from the company standpoint, they just think it&#8217;s all the same. They think as long as you can do something in design, that you can do everything in design. So, I&#8217;m glad you qualified that by saying that.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve seen a lot of mix ups with that. I will see a lot of illustrators that I follow get all of these requests for, &#8220;Hey, can you do logos?&#8221; And I&#8217;m just like that&#8217;s not the same thing. Just because they can draw Goku does not mean they can give you a professional looking logo for your law firm. This is two totally different forms of art. It&#8217;s an important distinction.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, it&#8217;s an important distinction. And I think it&#8217;s good to stick by that, because I think early in your career you want to be able to do any work that comes your way because you want to be able to prove yourself as a creative. So, even if you are, say for example, really good at illustration and someone says, &#8220;Well, can you do a logo?&#8221; You&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;Well, I mean it&#8217;s a drawing. I can do that.&#8221; But I think it&#8217;s good that you&#8217;re sticking by saying, &#8220;No, I only do illustration. This is what I do. I can&#8217;t do this other thing that you&#8217;re asking for.&#8221;</p>
<p>I mean you probably could technically do it because the skills are transferrable, but I think it&#8217;s good to stick by that because what it does is it strengthens your particular craft in that area. So, people eventually don&#8217;t get it confused. But I feel like that&#8217;s pretty common early on though. You try to do a little bit of everything, one, to see what you can do, and two, because the work just comes your way.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah. And I get that, especially if you&#8217;re just starting out and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any projects and this guy is asking me for a logo, so I&#8217;m just going to take it because I need the money.&#8221; But if that&#8217;s not what you do, you don&#8217;t want to end up getting saddled with that your whole life, trying to struggle to do something that you know you don&#8217;t enjoy doing and you don&#8217;t exactly, I guess, have the equipment for. Because you can definitely do a logo that&#8217;s a drawing. But I mean if this super corporate firm is asking you for a super corporate logo and you draw just characters or buildings and things like that, it&#8217;s not always going to transfer well.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t exactly have, I guess, that same know-how or that same eye to capture what they might want. So, I like to make sure people know that there&#8217;s a difference, because every illustrator that you try to ask for a work from is not going to be equipped to give you what you need, because illustration and graphic design aren&#8217;t the same thing. And I feel like a lot of people just think, &#8220;Oh, art is art,&#8221; but that&#8217;s just not how it is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Now you&#8217;re represented by Inkyverse, which is a agency. They rep a lot of animators, artists, authors. How did you go about getting representation? Did they come to you? Did you seek them out? How did that work?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
They actually came to me. I believe they found me on Instagram, I want to say. So, it was, I think not too long after I had posted this graphic that I did. It was the Salt Girl, the Salt of the Earth thing that I did. And that went viral, and I think that&#8217;s what got me noticed by the agency. They reached out to me, they actually sent me a text because I had my number on my resume and they were like, &#8220;Hey, this is Inkyverse and we are looking to see if you would be interested in commercial art representation.&#8221; And then I followed up with, &#8220;This is not a scam, this is real?&#8221; Like okay.</p>
<p>I was like, &#8220;Well, thank God for clarifying.&#8221; I sure was about to just block the number. They said that they would keep in touch with me, and we ended up having a conversation over the phone. The agent that I was speaking to, Katrina, she was going over everything that having an agent entailed and how having an agent can help you find high profile clients and they can help you to establish rates for yourself and they can basically just manage you. And I was like, &#8220;That sounds pretty good to me. So, I mean I don&#8217;t see why I would say no personally.&#8221; I mean I never was really good with managing everything that I had. I was always really bad with trying to figure out rates that I wanted to charge for myself. So, I mean I was like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll go for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I mean the worst that could happen is that I might not like it and I can just say I don&#8217;t want to do it anymore. So far it&#8217;s really been a blessing to have an agent and work with Inkyverse, because having a lot of these major companies reach out to me, not having an agent would have been terrifying because I would not know what to say. I would not know what money to ask for. I wouldn&#8217;t know how to fight back against that, because especially if you&#8217;re pretty green, it&#8217;s like you don&#8217;t want to say the wrong thing and be like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, I just ruined this entire opportunity because I have asked them for the wrong amount or I said the wrong thing, or whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, it really helped to have somebody, I guess, go back and forth on my behalf that actually knows the industry and actually knows the standards and actually knows what to ask for, what is fair. That&#8217;s been a huge help in getting me fair rates for projects, for getting the amount of time that I would get for things. I mean it&#8217;s been good to have somebody to look over contracts and things and make sure nothing weird is in them before I sign them. And that&#8217;s something that I really like having and I would definitely recommend other artists do so if it is at all possible to have somebody to, I guess, be your help where you need it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean I&#8217;ve had other illustrators on the show before that are also represented by agents and they&#8217;ve talked about how it just helps them to focus on the work. They don&#8217;t have to handle all the administrative emails and contracts and all this stuff. They can just focus on doing the work when it comes in, and it&#8217;s just such a big benefit for them. And it&#8217;s really cool that they reached out to you, they saw your work and wanted you to be a part of what they&#8217;re building.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah, and I was honestly really blown away by that. I was, &#8220;Really? Me? How did you even get here?&#8221; It was really exciting. I was like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you would want me to do this.&#8221; And then even more so with the random text, I was like, &#8220;Are we sure this isn&#8217;t a scam and you&#8217;re not going to ask me for my credit card number next? I feel like this is too good to be true.&#8221; But it was really nice to be able to have somebody who works in that industry say, &#8220;Hey, we think your work is so good and that it can make a whole bunch of money, so we want you here.&#8221; Not to say that my representative is just like, &#8220;Hey, we just want you for the money,&#8221; because I didn&#8217;t want it to sound like that, but it&#8217;s nice to know that your artwork is appreciated in a professional sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. How do you stay up to date with the latest design and illustration trends? Like you mentioned pop culture being a big part of your work, pop culture and television. How do you stay up to date with trends in the industry?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I personally would say that I try to do somewhat of a research. I don&#8217;t know if I could 100% call it research. Well, I guess I could, yeah. I try to research some things when I have time to do so. At my previous job for graphic design, we always used different magazines and publications and even Pinterest to stay up to date with what was trending and what was up-to-date and designs that we can pull from that won&#8217;t look dated. And I do use that to a certain degree when it comes to illustration work, but I also do like to look into a lot of fashion.</p>
<p>I follow a lot of fashion bloggers and I&#8217;m always looking at things on TikTok and stuff like that, because that&#8217;s always been an influence on my style as well. I like drawing illustrations that incorporate a lot of fashion. I like looking at different, I guess, design when it comes to fashion on TV or in movies or things like that. I try to pay attention to those things and pay attention to, I guess, what is out now and what I could probably see in the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is one of the newer trends right now?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
You mean in terms of fashion?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I mean like, yeah, I guess in general, as you look at it as to how you might apply it to your work, do you see any trends that you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, I might want to try that out?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Honestly, I&#8217;ve been looking at a whole lot of fashion.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I mean fashion could be that inspiration, it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Sometimes I look at a lot of just things that I see just online, and it doesn&#8217;t have to be anything in particular, but if I feel like something is particularly striking, I might pull some inspiration from it, from what I see on there. I guess as of right now, I&#8217;ve been liking a lot of, I want to say suits and things in that general area. That&#8217;s always been something that&#8217;s been drawing my attention. I don&#8217;t know if that is exactly the trendiest thing overall now in terms of I guess business and things like that. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people doing those kinds of things on TikTok and whatever. That&#8217;s always something that I wanted to incorporate in some of my illustrations as well. Now, in terms of now, I wouldn&#8217;t say a pulling a whole lot of things from now in particular, or some things that are trendy now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you say that your style as an illustrator and a designer has evolved over the years?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I have definitely gained a better understanding of composition, and I want to say anatomy and layout. Basically everything that I worked on, I feel like it has elevated. I feel like I&#8217;ve really grown to have a better understanding of what works and how things should look, how I can utilize the different spaces of things and create, I guess, a better and more fluent composition. I also feel that I&#8217;ve grown in the sense where I&#8217;ve been able to refine how my characters look. I went really back and forth with a lot of different styles and trying to figure out what worked and trying to figure out how I should paint things and should I do things that are really stylistic? Should I do things that are realistic? It&#8217;s always been experimental and trying to figure out how I want things to look overall and what I felt worked for me.</p>
<p>And I think I&#8217;ve found, I guess, a good middle ground of how I want my illustrations and how I want my designs to look. But I think just having more of a knowledge of shapes and color and growing in those areas has really helped my design and illustration work to flourish. And I have also accepted the fact that everything is not always going to look the same. So, I know a lot of artists have a particular style. I know a lot of people, including myself, have always felt like you should just have one style and that should be it, and you shouldn&#8217;t really do anything else. As I&#8217;ve grown, I&#8217;ve learned that you could just do whatever you want. I mean if I want to do something realistic one day, I can do that. If I want to do something stylized another day, I can do that.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that I don&#8217;t have a style, and it doesn&#8217;t mean that I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing. It just happens. You might want to experiment, you might just want to do something different. I mean I think that that really just shows that you just have a lot to offer as an artist. I mean it just shows that you have the skill to be able to go back and forth and do a variety of things. And I don&#8217;t think anything&#8217;s wrong with that, which unfortunately a lot of people still feel that way. But I think that I would always encourage artists to just do what you enjoy doing. If you want to do a lot of different things, I say go for it, as long as you&#8217;re not burning yourself out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I guess speaking of that, how do you handle those periods when you might be burnt out or you might just have low motivation? How do you handle that?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
So, overall I try to just take breaks in between my work. I try not to rush things, and I always am pretty careful about not overbooking myself, especially keeping in mind that I do have a full-time job and I&#8217;m trying to juggle freelance and whatever else I have. I always want to make sure I&#8217;m trying to gauge my time properly and see what I actually have room to do, because I don&#8217;t want to get to that point where I&#8217;m just like I&#8217;m completely just worn out and I just can&#8217;t do anything. I think that it&#8217;s very important to take breaks when you can. I always try to set aside some time or a day or whatever to just do nothing or just have fun or maybe watch a movie or play a game or just something, something not work related. But there have been times where I just didn&#8217;t have a choice.</p>
<p>I just had to power through something. And I felt like what just motivated me to get it done is just to try to have as much fun with it as possible. There&#8217;s been projects that I&#8217;ve worked on and I just try to, I guess, put a little bit of myself into it and just use that as a way to express myself, which wasn&#8217;t exactly discouraged in the project. And that helped me to, I guess, think of the project that I had to work on or something that was just more fun, something that I could enjoy. Not thinking about it as, &#8220;I have to get this done right now because the deadline is tomorrow, and if I don&#8217;t, then the whole project is ruined.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought about it as this is something that I&#8217;m enjoying doing and I just want to do it. And in times where I am just getting a bit pushed, that&#8217;s what I try to think about. I try to think about it as something enjoyable. I try to just take my time with it as much as I can and have fun with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you hope people take away from your work when they look at it?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I would hope that they could see the beauty in a lot of these different characters. I like to do a lot of black girls and black women, and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen, because you have seen my portfolio, but little black kids. I like to draw a lot of that stuff. And growing up, I had issues where I want to say I had lower self-esteem than I should have had. I never really felt like I was cute. I didn&#8217;t think that I was pretty, because I would see a lot of the cartoons, like the heroes and the love interests on a lot of cartoons, and they wouldn&#8217;t look like me. And that is what made me want to put a lot of black features and characters into my artwork, because while we did see a lot of that growing up, I felt like we didn&#8217;t exactly see as much as we probably should have gotten.</p>
<p>Black characters were always like the sidekicks sometimes, and they didn&#8217;t always get time to shine. And that&#8217;s something that always impacted me growing up. And so I like to put that into my work. I like to show people, like anyone that we are beautiful and nothing is wrong with our features. Our features are beautiful. They make us unique, they make us who we are. And I think that that&#8217;s something that I wanted to put in my work, because I want everybody to be able to embrace that. So, I always hope that little kids and adults alike can take that away from what I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to someone, they&#8217;re out here listening to your story, they&#8217;re hearing about your work and everything. What advice would you give them if they want to follow in your footsteps?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
The advice that I would give to anybody that might want to pursue a career in art or graphic design, I would say that don&#8217;t be afraid to do what you know you want to do. Have fun doing it. I would say that if this is something that you really enjoy and you really see yourself doing this in the future, and you know you really want to go into these different arenas where you can use your art for animation or books. So, I mean I would encourage anybody that wants to pursue art to just go for it. I don&#8217;t think that you should let anything scare you from doing it. If it&#8217;s something that you enjoy doing I say, why not do it?</p>
<p>I mean it&#8217;s something that it&#8217;s always been fun to me. I could never really see myself doing anything else. And so I felt like this is what I had to pursue, this is what I was going to do. And I know that there&#8217;s other people that feel that way and I feel that they should go forward with it, because I mean why keep yourself from doing something that you enjoy doing and that you can make a living off of it. And I know a lot of people feel that it&#8217;s harder to actually make a living off your work than doing other things, but I believe that we have so many examples out that shows that that&#8217;s actually a possibility. You can work in animation, you can do books, you can even do things like ads and partnerships with brands.</p>
<p>You can do flyers, you can design things for brands, branding or whatever. There&#8217;s so many options that you can explore, things that you can put your talents toward. There&#8217;s so many options that you can look into that you can use your skills to make it tangible and make it real. So, I would say that you shouldn&#8217;t limit yourself and you shouldn&#8217;t hold yourself back if you&#8217;re afraid that you might not be able to get different opportunities, or you are afraid that you might not be able to get into this certain arena so there&#8217;s nothing you can do, because there&#8217;s a lot of things that we, as artists, we don&#8217;t really think about how many opportunities that they really have out there.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a lot. It&#8217;s just the possibilities are endless. And on top of that, I would encourage people to always have fun with what they&#8217;re doing. Never be afraid to experiment and do different things. Just have fun. Just enjoy it. Take time to perfect your craft. Take time to practice. You always want to take time to pour into it, because if this is something that you&#8217;ll enjoy doing and you want to put yourself out there and you want to continue to grow, I mean you always want to keep doing it. You always want to keep those, I guess, creative gears turning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I&#8217;m honestly not 100% sure. I honestly never thought I would even see myself where I&#8217;m at now five years ago. It&#8217;s different for me. If there is something in particular that I could be doing down the line, I&#8217;ve always been interested in animation of course, because it&#8217;s always been a huge inspiration for me. And I&#8217;ve always wanted to work maybe in an animated series, maybe like creating some characters or concept work or visual development or something along those lines. So, here&#8217;s hoping that maybe at some point in my career the door may open for that. I&#8217;m just here to see where life takes me as of right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
So, I am on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok at morg_city. Also on Facebook at Morgan Bissant, all one word. I have a website, morganbissant.com, and you can basically see most of my portfolio on there, and you can find links to my social pages at the bottom.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Morgan Bissant, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you really for talking about I mean, one, your journey as an artist, as an illustrator, as a designer, and how it&#8217;s brought you to where you are now. But I really think it&#8217;s good that you talked about your process, you shared your inspirations, you shared your experiences. My hope is that when people listen back through this interview, and especially once they get a chance to really look at your work, they&#8217;ll be able to get a good overall view of who you are as an artist and the work that you&#8217;re bringing into the world. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Well, thank you so much for having me. This is definitely a pleasure speaking with you.</p>

<p>It takes a lot of hard work, dedication, and sacrifice to make it on your own as an artist, and Akeem Roberts knows this well. This illustrator and animator juggles being an associate director at Holler Studios with freelancing for <em>The New Yorker</em>. Even though Akeem&#8217;s been in the game for nearly a decade, I have a feeling that we&#8217;ll be seeing his work for many years to come.</p>
<p>We talked about Akeem&#8217;s new gig at Holler, and from there he went into sharing his unique approach to storytelling. Akeem also spoke about attending the University of South Carolina, went into some of his influences for his artistic style, and gave some great advice for handling operational tasks as a freelancer. Akeem knows that success doesn&#8217;t happen overnight, and he&#8217;s put in the time and effort to come out on top!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
My name is Akeem S. Roberts. I&#8217;m a cartoonist for The New Yorker. illustrator for J.D. the Kid Barber series, and a book designer by day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2023 been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
2023 has been pretty crazy so far. I started off the year unemployed, just doing freelance stuff, and as of like three weeks ago, I just got a brand new job and sort of getting the reins on that and everything&#8217;s been going pretty good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. Congratulations on the new job.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have any plans for the summer? Anything you want to do?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
For the summer, right now I don&#8217;t have anything planned. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll just try to go to a beach or a lake or something and just relax for a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious, from last year to this year, aside from the employment change that you mentioned about, have there been any other kind of changes for you? Anything else going on?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I&#8217;d say from last year to this year, I&#8217;ve more committed to being in publishing versus animation, which was kind of the main thing that I did at the start of my career was mostly animation. After I started doing stuff at The New Yorker and stuff with Kokila, I slowly started making the transition into publishing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What brought that transition on aside from just more work? Was it a feeling or anything?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I felt like for animation mostly it was things move a little bit slower and it feels like the artists&#8230; I guess I was a cog in the machine animation-wise, while publishing, even though I am still just in the machine, I have a little more of a voice and a little more of a say, and I guess it just feels more freeing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds like there&#8217;s just more, I guess, agency, I guess, in publishing.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yes, exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Let&#8217;s talk about some of your work that you&#8217;re doing as a freelance illustrator. I&#8217;m curious, what does a regular day look like for you these days?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
If I&#8217;m doing dailies for The New Yorker, I&#8217;ll try to get up around like 7:00 and then hit Twitter or some kind of news source and just go through trending and try to see what&#8217;s going on, what happened in the past 24 hours. Then, I&#8217;m seeing if I can find a joke and connect that into a bit for The New Yorker for their daily cartoons.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;re creating new pieces every day, so you have to check the news, be like, &#8220;Oh, this is funny,&#8221; draw something, and-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; then it&#8217;s just done? That&#8217;s it?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
It depends on the process. Sometimes, for instance, I got one in for a daily after the trailer of the Barbie movie dropped. For that, I had an idea of doing something of scientists trying to get to the Barbie because there was all of those memes about people saying three, how many or whatever for Barbie movie tickets. I wanted to like have that idea of getting to the Barbie movie first and having it happen immediately, so I was first thinking like scientists creating a time machine to get there on the day that it&#8217;s released. Then, for The New Yorker, I thought of that idea, but I put a little bit of &#8217;80s nostalgia in it, so then I changed it to kind of like Back to the Future where they&#8217;re trying to go to the future to see the Barbie movie.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like Marty and Doc Brown and the DeLorean?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, so they&#8217;re all sitting in the JCPenney parking lot trying to get to the Barbie movie.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s funny. It&#8217;s interesting, though, that you have to, I guess, get them in by a certain time, but it&#8217;s every day, so that makes sense, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. For the dailies, it&#8217;s you have to get the sketches to them before 9:00, and then they&#8217;ll let you know if they like it or not by 10:00, and then you have that done by noon. The one that I did for the Barbie was like a bonus for the daily, so I didn&#8217;t have to get that done till 2:00.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. No, that&#8217;s just interesting that it&#8217;s so fast. I don&#8217;t know why I thought maybe you would have done it the day before or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I think some people do. I&#8217;m reckless.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I see you do a little bit of everything, book illustrations, you do comics, you do animation, you do editorial work. Is there a particular one of these that you prefer to do?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I think I prefer to do comics and publishing chapter book stuff. I feel like that gives me the most control, but also the most freedom. I feel like when you&#8217;re usually doing a comic book, you got to do like 30-something pages and the deadline&#8217;s pretty tight, but when it comes to chapter books or whatever, it&#8217;s a little bit&#8230; It&#8217;s still tight, but it&#8217;s not as, I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s not as hard just because you&#8217;re just doing one panel kind of basically, versus doing nine panels, trying to semi-tell a story, designing multiple backgrounds. It&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. I can see how doing it in that sort of controlled format also, it&#8217;s just easier on you probably just on your workload, you know?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me about how you approach a new project. What does your process look like?? Does it vary per type?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, it definitely varies per type, per project. For anything that&#8217;s like New Yorker, that&#8217;s just I&#8217;m just on the subway jotting down ideas. I send my notes app and I&#8217;ll just like think of jokes, try to connect them, and then from there I&#8217;ll draw a little small thumbnail and then sketch a bigger illustration for that and then send that to the New Yorker. Then, my process for when I&#8217;m doing my web comics also starts on my phone. I just write a joke, describe what&#8217;s happening in the panels. Then, from there I do a thumbnail and then I finalize it and then add all the texts and stuff.</p>
<p>Then, for animation, usually with this, there&#8217;s only a couple of those that I started from scratch where I had a original character and original plot. Those started off more&#8230; I was in Word and Google Docs instead because it was longer format and I had to share it with other people to read, look over, see if they had any notes on the script. For those, it&#8217;s like script first, and then you start the thumbnails and animating each thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What if you&#8217;re doing, say, editorial work or something for the book? Is that process kind of the same?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, editorial is like you&#8217;ll&#8230; Most of the stuff that I did editorial for was like for Men&#8217;s Health. They have this section called Cool Dads-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; so for that, I would like&#8230; They would give me the article that a celeb wrote, and then I would read it. Then, from there, I would like think about an illustration that kind of hit the vibe of what the celeb wrote. The latest one I did was for like LeVar Burton. His whole thing was talking about reading books to his daughter and giving her the freedom to read and how he wants to be there for her. Then, he also makes a reference basically to Harry Potter.</p>
<p>For that, I just drew him in like the garbs with a wand fighting off the Dementors because in the article he talks about how his daughter stopped reading because she didn&#8217;t like the Dementors. He was like, &#8220;Maybe I should have not introduced her to Harry Potter.&#8221; I just took that vibe and added it to the illustration. I would send like three sketches and then the art director over there would pick which one they think is the best. Then, from there I would finish and color it and everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You kin of have to read a little bit of what it is that you&#8217;re going, then, to make sure that the illustration kind of matches that in some way.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. With every editorial or even like the children&#8217;s book, you have to read the manuscript and everything first before you can fully get the gist of it to kind of sum it up in whatever illustration, whether it&#8217;s for a chapter or for an article.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Last year, I was Editor-in-Chief of a print magazine. This was part of the job that I was doing at the time, and our in-house creative director had decided for our first issue that he wanted to also do all the editorial illustrations. I was like, &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; &#8220;a lot, but if you want to do it.&#8221; He also did the cover and everything. I was like, &#8220;Look, more power to you.&#8221; It was so funny because the way he approached it was like, &#8220;Well, I have an idea of a theme for the whole magazine,&#8221; and so he just did illustrations based on whatever, and none of them matched the article in any sort of real way. I&#8217;m telling him like, &#8220;You should probably try to make sure that the images match what the article is about. You drew a polar bear. This article has nothing to do with polar bears. What&#8217;s the connection for the reader to look at this?&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, well, the connection is winter because we&#8217;re publishing the magazine in the winter.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Huh. No, no.&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t make any-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s sounds like a little bit of a stretch, but you know, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, that&#8217;s one of us that feels it. I mean, eventually we ended up sort of just going with the concept because we didn&#8217;t have enough time, but for the second issue, the pieces fit the article more and I told him like, &#8220;Look, read the article and then get started with designing.&#8221; He would just start designing and be like, &#8220;Oh, I have to read the article?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yes, it would help. It would be helpful so at least what you&#8217;re designing matches that in some capacity.&#8221; So&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah yeah. You got to read the article.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
You got to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, how do you approach storytelling through your art? I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s more than just like in, say, the book illustration example, it&#8217;s more than just reading. How do you really approach telling a story through your art?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I would read it and then I would like try to imagine it in my head and say, for instance, for the J.D.the Kid Barber series that I did, for that it was reading it, and then the art director would kind of tell me what they imagined in it. They were like, &#8220;Oh, this character is in their room,&#8221; but it&#8217;s up to me to add anything else that I wanted to add into it, so I would just try and look up Google images basically to find what I imagined this school look like because references, it&#8217;s always great to have. I know sometimes it&#8217;s like, especially when you&#8217;re starting out, you want to not use any references. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;I can do this from my head.&#8221; You can&#8217;t. I mean, you can, but you&#8217;ll miss the small details that you want to have caught if you weren&#8217;t looking at a reference. I would look at reference, kind of imagine the area, and then just try to imagine the characters just living and breathing.</p>
<p>For some of them I would add even like small jokes. One of the illustrations, the art director was, &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s losing this battle, but everyone has numbers up saying 10 for this guy who&#8217;s winning.&#8221; Then, for one of those, I drew his friend in there giving him a thumbs up with like a two, so everyone has a good rating except he has a bad rating for the guy, and he&#8217;s got a thumbs up giving it to the guy being like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I got your back.&#8221; I try to put in little jokes like that inside the book so kids will see it and notice it. I&#8217;m trying to always make an illustration for, I guess, like the younger me if I was reading it as a kid.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. Do you try to add a little something that&#8217;s just unique to you in each image that you do?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
If I do try to add anything, I try to add humor. I feel like that&#8217;s my go-to form of communicating is trying to add a joke if I can.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, we&#8217;ve had a few New Yorker illustrators on the show before, most recently, Liz Montague. I&#8217;m curious, how did you get started with doing illustrations for The New Yorker?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I feel like my story is very unique. I have yet to hear anyone else who&#8217;s had this experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Basically I was like tabling at this convention in New York called Mocha Fest, which is like an art festival, and I had a bunch of comics that I had done online and this little short story that I did that was in black and white. After that weekend, I got a message from Emma who&#8217;s like the Editor at New Yorker. She was, &#8220;Oh, do you want to do a daily shouts?&#8221; Basically like, &#8220;I like your work, and I was wondering if you want to try to submit some jokes or a daily shout or anything like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was like, &#8220;All right,&#8221; and then I sent my first batch, and then after that Friday after I sent it they were like, &#8220;Oh yeah, this one is in.&#8221; I sold one the very first time I tried, which was crazy good. I don&#8217;t know anyone else who&#8217;s done that. Maybe other people have, but I had sold it first immediately. Then, the next week, I also submitted some batches and I also sold another one, so I was feeling really good. I was like, &#8220;All right, I can do this,&#8221; and then after that, it was 40 weeks of like not selling anything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is that usually like the&#8230; You said that was sort of unique to you. I&#8217;m just curious, what would a cartoonist normally do if they&#8217;re trying to get into like The New Yorker? Is there a more-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; typical process?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s like submissions that you can do on the website, and you can send them batches that way. Then, they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;You&#8217;ve made it,&#8221; and then you&#8217;ll get Emma&#8217;s email, so you can start sending batches to her directly. Sort of like a filtering process before you get her email, but I just got it immediately and then got one in immediately, which felt good. Then after that, it slowed down a bit, obviously.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, you&#8217;re still doing it now, so, I mean, it obviously worked out in your favor.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there a particular style that you think, I guess&#8230; I guess it probably varies per publication, but for The New Yorker, and not to harp on them specifically, but is there a particular style that you think they&#8217;re looking for?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
For The New Yorker, I think they&#8217;re looking kind of for something that is sketchy and has detail, but not too much. Nothing that will distract from the joke.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Basically just like if you had to jot down a joke with stick figures in five minutes, that&#8217;s kind of the ideal I think like they want in terms of detail is just not enough stuff that will distract from it. Then, they definitely don&#8217;t want it too cartoony, which is like I always put my stuff, and maybe sometimes it&#8217;s too cartoony, but there&#8217;s a line where you&#8217;re trying to hit where it&#8217;s not cartoony in the sense that it feels like on a Saturday morning cartoon, but also not cartoony in the way that it feels like it&#8217;s Family Guy. You got to hit a perfect, unique just like sketch style that takes a lot of work, but looks simple.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm. I get what you&#8217;re saying. I get what you&#8217;re saying. Certainly, nothing that&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t know, Marvel style, like not a comic kind of thing, but you also-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; want it to have some level of expression and polish, as you would say, that doesn&#8217;t detract from the joke.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve worked with some other big clients as well, Boom! Studios. You mentioned Men&#8217;s Health earlier, Conde Nast, which is over a bunch of different magazines and such. Is it easier working with bigger clients like those than, say, smaller clients?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
For sure. I feel like bigger clients, they kind of have an idea and they kind of let you be free, especially if they know your work. They&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;All right, I saw your work. I kind of imagine what you can do. If you&#8217;ll do that, we&#8217;ll be great.&#8221; I feel like when it comes to mom and pop type of clients, it&#8217;s a little less freeing for the artists in a sense because I guess the dollar value that they&#8217;re spending is&#8230; it&#8217;s precious, their $500 or whatever.</p>
<p>This thing that you&#8217;re doing for them, especially if it&#8217;s like a logo or anything that they&#8217;re going to use over again for t-shirts, it&#8217;s very important. Because of that and because of how important it is to them, they&#8217;re sometimes a little overbearing. They&#8217;ll overwork in illustration because of having multiple revisions that kind of the artist loses&#8230; The more revisions that&#8217;s happening, the artist kind of loses the spirit sometimes. If it&#8217;s 20 revisions to get this logo done, the artist each time is less and less into it-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; and that doesn&#8217;t mean that there will be a point where they don&#8217;t care. The artist is always going to care because it&#8217;s for their portfolio and their job. They want it to be good. It&#8217;s kind of like a way of the artist helping&#8230; not helping themselves, but guarding themselves from being like&#8230; If you&#8217;re too personally attached, you&#8217;ll get upset about the notes-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; so you have to be removed. The more and more you get notes, the more and more you&#8217;re like, &#8220;All right, this is getting away from my vision and I&#8217;m trying to see if I can get exactly what they&#8217;re seeing in their head,&#8221; which is not normally something an artist can reproduce is what another person is envisioning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like if I had to do 20 revisions on a design, I would want to fire the client. To me, that feels like the client really doesn&#8217;t know what they want, and they feel like you&#8217;re just going to keep iterating on it until it magically appears to them. I mean, I know that&#8217;s how we&#8217;re sort of just pulling that number out of anywhere, but I get what you&#8217;re saying about the dollar value, which I think is something that&#8217;s really important. A lot of these bigger companies just have the budget to be able to do bigger type projects, more audacious ideas, et cetera, but then smaller clients, that money has to really go far. That&#8217;s not to say that larger clients aren&#8217;t as invested in the end project, but it just takes on&#8230; There&#8217;s an added gravity to it when it&#8217;s from a smaller client or for a smaller client, I should say.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Can you discuss any upcoming projects or collabs that you&#8217;re excited about?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Right now, I don&#8217;t really have anything coming up. I guess the only thing I have is I&#8217;m working on a graphic novel and I&#8217;m trying to pitch to HarperCollins or Kokila to just get the story that I have in my head off the ground.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I&#8217;ve always wanted to do a graphic novel. I cannot draw, but I have had ideas for characters in my head since I was a teenager to put into a graphic novel. I&#8217;ve talked about it here on the show before. People probably already know this, but one day I&#8217;m going to have the time and the funds to make it happen, so I hope it works out for you.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m hoping it works out, too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I want to get more into your work and your career, but let&#8217;s learn more about Akeem. Let&#8217;s learn more about you. Are you originally from New York?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
No, I am kind of like from everywhere is what I tell everyone. I was born in North Dakota and my Mom was in the military, so I moved around a lot from North Dakota to Alabama, to Germany, to South Carolina, to Texas, to Maryland, to New York. A lot of places, but most of my time was in the South, so I guess I could just say I&#8217;m from the South.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Did you do a lot of drawing growing up?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yes. I would just say that I started drawing&#8230; There&#8217;s two big reasons I started drawing, so first I was just doodling, and then in third grade, I won an award for the state in South Carolina, third place for this painting I did-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; and that was a good boost. I was like, &#8220;Oh, wow, this is cool. I can draw.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t really think of anything of it. I was just like, &#8220;All right, I can doodle.&#8221; Then, in fifth grade, there was this girl that could draw way better than me. I was crushing, so then I would try to get better to impress her, and I think that&#8217;s kind of my origin story is trying to get better to impress a girl. Then, I just kept drawing on my own.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did it work?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
It did not work, you know? So-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; ultimately it was for me, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I had someone on the show a couple episodes ago, Kendell Burton, and he was telling me how he first&#8230; He&#8217;s an art director now, but he was like, &#8220;Oh yeah, I first got into design in the web because I was making a blog on Zynga to try to meet girls.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Does that work?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Never does.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You were doing a lot of drawing and stuff growing up, and I see you went to the University of South Carolina and majored in Media Arts. Tell me about that time. What was that like?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Media Arts, basically, I ended up there because I was very late at applying for colleges, and my family had just moved back to South Carolina, so then I just applied there. This guy that I met with was like, &#8220;Oh, tell me what you want to do.: I was telling him that I probably would want to do some animation, like comics and stuff, and so he was&#8230; The Media Arts Program, which is basically teaching you how to use the Adobe Suite while learning about film, photography, script writing, and so it was like mostly on the film and photography side. Then, I minored in Illustration, so I did like one figure drawing class on my senior year and one illustration class on my senior year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you feel like they really kind of prepared you as an artist?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I feel like not in a sense of what I ideally wanted to do, which was basically do animation and stuff like that. I didn&#8217;t have a student film. I didn&#8217;t even take the animation course because I never signed up in time, but I guess overall, it kind of helped me be a jack-of-all-trade because certain things with film and photography and script writing can transfer into illustration. Having that does help me visualize ideas, but not necessarily in the sense of, &#8220;Okay, you do this something. You&#8217;ll have a job immediately after.&#8221; You know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think school is interesting in that way. I mean, I majored in Math, so I didn&#8217;t think-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Oh no.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; when I was graduating I was going to have&#8230; Actually, no. I mean, I did major in Math, that&#8217;s true, but I had like a scholarship thing lined up with the program that I was in that I was going to work for the government after I graduated. Then, that fell through like junior year because of 9/11. It fell through. I was like, &#8220;Oh, I have no plans for what I&#8217;m going to do when I graduate.&#8221; I was working part time at the Symphony here in Atlanta selling tickets, and I did that, I think&#8230; I did that up till I graduated, and I remember when I graduated they took the calculator away from my kiosk because they were like, &#8220;Well, you have a math degree now. You don&#8217;t need this.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Is that supposed to be funny?&#8221;</p>
<p>I mean, I didn&#8217;t need it, but I didn&#8217;t have any sort of career plans lined up after graduation because I thought I was set. I really didn&#8217;t even pursue other companies. I snuck my resume into other departments&#8217; resume books so I could get interviews at places. I was wholly unprepared going into senior year for any kind of actual career goals. I was in college just because I was a nerd that liked math.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah. That actually sounds very familiar to my story. That&#8217;s basically kind of like how I ended up in New York was my friend got me an internship in New York, and then I did that internship for the summer, but it kind of fell through near the end. Then, I was working at Starbucks in South Carolina. I was making $9 an hour, but the rent was just so much. Most of my money was going towards the rent-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; and then it was like&#8230; I think the rent was&#8230; I want to say almost like 600, almost 800, which is a lot. Then, they were like, &#8220;Oh, you could transfer to the Starbucks in New York,&#8221; which I transferred and I was making like 13. Then, the apartment I had up here was 584 with everything included, so I was way better off staying in New York, and that&#8217;s just like how I got here was not planning on staying. I came up for an internship and I was like, &#8220;All right, I&#8217;m just going to go back,&#8221; but then it just seemed to work out better for me to just live here than be in South Carolina barely making it-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; that makes sense, and I would say also probably as an artist, I mean, you kind of want to be in the cultural capital of the country when it comes to experiences and stuff. I would imagine you probably wouldn&#8217;t have access to the same level of experiences in South Carolina that you would in New York City, you know?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I mean, I feel like&#8230; Okay, so when I was going to college, there was this rumor that actually a bunch of comic artists actually lives in South Carolina, which might be true, but I just never met anyone.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If I recall, and this was years ago when I interviewed him, Sanford Greene, who&#8217;s like, I know he&#8217;s done stuff for Marvel, for DC, pretty prolific visual artist, lives in South Carolina. He lives in South Carolina.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Oh really?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, he went to Benedict&#8217;s.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yep.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, so like yeah, I guess&#8230; Look, I guess South Carolina is the home for the comic artist, but I just could not find that community at all, but comic artists tend to be homebodies, so you would never really see them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I&#8217;d imagine, yeah, it&#8217;s probably not&#8230; There&#8217;s no collective or something like that. I would say it&#8217;s probably just easier in New York because of availability and just the cultural atmosphere of the city. I came from a small town in Alabama, and if I would&#8217;ve stayed there after I graduated high school, I&#8217;d know I wouldn&#8217;t be doing what I&#8217;m doing now because there was no kind of technology or design or anything. You either got married, got into the church, or maybe worked a factory job. Not a lot of options.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s not endemic of the South, but just in particular, like-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah [inaudible 00:30:14].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; your environment can help out, you know?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
No, no, I hear you. I have a bunch of family from Alabama.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. One of your early career gigs, you were at this place called ideaMACHINE Studio where you worked as an animator. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
All right, so crazy with that was one of my friends came up and he was doing photography. I was still working at Starbucks at this time, and he was like, &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s an animation studio just like here. Do you want to apply?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;All right, cool.&#8221; We possibly could work in the same building, whatever, so I applied. Then, I got the job, and then that same day my friend got fired from whatever company he was working at in the building, so it&#8217;s like we didn&#8217;t get to work together, but he did help me get this job by seeing it. Then, at that same time, I was still working at Starbucks, which I worked that job while also doing Starbucks for like a year and a half just doing both of them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, and at Starbucks, I had just became a shift manager. I would only work two or three days a week, but it was weird because I&#8217;d be in charge then, so it&#8217;s like&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You were able to kind of juggle it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I was able to juggle it, but it was surreal once I think about it, just like how many hours I was working. It was a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How was ideaMACHINE Studio? Was that kind of your first studio experience?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, that was my first studio experience. That one, it was a little more&#8230; I guess in a sense it kind of trained me, kind of gave me the animation class kind of a sense because I went in there knowing some stuff, but not really knowing the 12 principles of animation or anything like that, just what I saw online. Most of the stuff that I did for them was kind of like whiteboard explainer videos.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
It was like for pharmaceutical companies that had this idea, but wanted it to be explained in a simply way. That&#8217;s what we did for them. There was tiny stuff that you can animate, and then I would push it every once in a while to try and get better at my animation chops and my graphic design skills. I guess in a sense that job kind of trained me, but it was very reluctantly because the guy who runs the company was&#8230; I was trying to get better at art, and he was like, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to get better at drawing.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yes, I do.&#8221; Then, I just kept pushing and doing my web comic on the side was also something I did. Just work on my skills and progress my abilities to draw and stuff like that. Was just doing that weekly in order to force myself to put something out consistently and have a foundation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, so you were doing this kind of freelance work or doing your own work at least as well as doing this nine-to-five. How did you balance that?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I did not sleep a lot is how I balanced that. Basically, I would work during the day. If I had a Starbucks shift, maybe it was two or three hours, so I&#8217;d work nine to five, and then I would walk over to the Starbucks. I just happened to be super close to this company and then work four hours there and then come back home, which the commute was good. It was like 30 minutes, not that bad, especially for New York, and then work on my freelance stuff. Then that started again in the morning. It was a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s amazing the stuff that we pull off when we&#8217;re younger just to try to get that&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, I guess you just have all that youthful energy. You can get it done. Nowadays, absolutely not. I&#8217;m in bed-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; at a certain hour. I not staying up pulling all-nighters anymore. No, I get what you&#8217;re saying. It takes a lot to try to make sure you&#8217;re doing all of these things because, of course, you&#8217;re doing what you have to do to pay your bills and whatever, but you&#8217;re also establishing yourself during this time doing your own thing, which I think is super important. It&#8217;s something I tell a lot of designers that come on the show, especially ones that just start off, like have something on the side that&#8217;s just your own thing, you know?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You can still do what you have to do to get involved with your career at your workplace, but have something that&#8217;s just yours.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, after you worked at ideaMACHINE, you ended up at another studio called Holler where you were their Associate Animation Director. Was that a big shift from your work at ideaMACHINE?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, that was a big shift. One of the main things that like&#8230; The reason I left ideaMACHINE was first I wanted to grow as an artist, and then the second thing was that they were in Brooklyn, and then they were moving the company to New Jersey. I was&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to step foot in New Jersey, no offense to New Jersey, but I was just like, &#8220;I live in Brooklyn. The commute is crazy. Getting on the path just to get there, I absolutely can&#8217;t do it.&#8221; This is around the same time that The New Yorker reached out to me, and then this company reached out to me and they were like, &#8220;Hey, do you want to do a test for us?&#8221; I did a test for them. I had my Cintiq and everything all set up, and then my Cintiq broke that weekend-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; and I had to use the Bamboo, which is kind of like is still a drawing tablet, but just doesn&#8217;t have a screen. I had to use my Bamboo tablet and finish that animation for them, which is a quick reaction GIF that was like three seconds long. I did that over the weekend and they liked it.</p>
<p>Then, I started working there and the culture was very different. ideaMACHINE&#8217;s culture was kind of like you were doing like a student project. You would have art director&#8230; They would like help you, but not with any direction. The art direction was purely up to the animator. The way that it looked was purely up to the animator. The client would give notes, but it wasn&#8217;t like I had to follow a guide. I was the guide. It was like everything I did at ideaMACHINE from like the music to audio, sound effects and all of that compositing, there we did&#8230; It was a one-shop stop for one artist on each video. It wasn&#8217;t like working as a team really. It was kind of one guy is doing this, and if they need help with the animation, they&#8217;ll ask you, but it wasn&#8217;t anything that was ever felt like a cohesive team effort where everyone is trying to draw in the same style or anything like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm, so it seems like it was definitely just a ramp-up in terms of responsibility, though, right?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, so for Holler, when I first started, I was just doing little three-second GIFs and there&#8217;ll be client stuff, and then we&#8217;ll work on those. Then, later on, I started directing some shorts that they did right before I left. There was one called Akemi-chan: Is It Magical?, which is an idea that I had which was like a play on Magical School Girls trying to do a bunch of anime inside jokes kind of stuff like that. I was writing the script for that and then guiding the people that was working with me of how I wanted it to look and fleshing out storyboards and having more of a commanding role, which felt good, which kind of led to my newest role is sort of still doing that. It was kind of a stepping stone of becoming in charge, taking a step back and letting people do their things, but also helping them grow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. I would imagine even with that, it&#8217;s sort of helping you out in your freelance because you were still freelancing also during this time with Holler?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. With Holler, I was still freelancing. Like the beginning of 2020, like in January 2020, I got a call from Kokila being like, &#8220;Hey, do you want to work on this book?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;This name looks familiar.&#8221; I was looking at the art director&#8217;s name, and then I looked it up and it was the same art director for Hair Love, which I loved Hair Love. It was great. They&#8217;d just had that short come out. It was beautiful with Matthew A. Cherry. I was, &#8220;Wow, I would love to work with them.&#8221; I reached out to them and I was getting started. I was like, &#8220;Man, I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m going to do this with the commute, but I&#8217;m going to try and make it happen.&#8221; Then, of course, the pandemic happened, so it made it a little easier for me to finish my day job and then jump straight to my freelance. From there, every day I was doing illustrations from like 9:30 at night to like 2:00 in the morning-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; just to get those things done, and it was a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, but I mean, I would imagine it changed the way you work freelance, right?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, definitely. Freelance before I felt was more if I felt like I had the energy to do it, I&#8217;d do it-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; but with the book, it was like, &#8220;All right, you got to get these pages done. You got to get these multiple books done. You kind of have to treat this now like a full-time job where you clock in.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;All right, my clock-in time is 9:30 at night to 2:00 in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, that&#8217;s good. You get into doing it, you kind of time box your schedule, it sort of helps out, especially if you&#8217;re doing it on a regular basis.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, something that I&#8217;ve seen at least over the past decade that I&#8217;ve done this show, but I&#8217;d say probably prior to that as well, you started to see a really big increase of Black artistic talent, visual artistic talent specifically. Cartoons, animations, fine art, like you mentioned Hair Love from Matthew A. Cherry. No relation, I think, I think. Any genealogists out there want to dive into that, I&#8217;m more than welcome.</p>
<p>When I see all of this, I also end up seeing this question about representation, like that always seems to come up, which I think is kind unfair that if you are a Black artist that you have to represent your community through your work. I think it&#8217;s up to the individual artist what they choose to do. Is that something that you feel like you have to do through your work? Have you gotten that kind of, I don&#8217;t know, sense of&#8230; I don&#8217;t even want to say responsibility, but have you gotten that, say, from other people, from clients, et cetera?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, I would say there&#8217;s a little bit of that, and there&#8217;s like, for instance, when I first started at Holler, I was one of the only two black people there that was the artist and black people in general. One of the things I did when I started there was like I didn&#8217;t want to get pigeonholed as the guy who you only come to for Black stuff, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
That I immediately just did not draw. I drew like animal characters that I knew were Black or like Mother Earth was a character that had an Afro, but I knew she was Black, but it was like I didn&#8217;t do anything that was explicitly Black because I didn&#8217;t want to get pigeonholed. With my comic stuff, it&#8217;s slice of life, but there are times that I do stuff that is political, but those are very few and far between. Then, my main stance on that is just I want my web comic to&#8230; There&#8217;s a bunch of web comics out there where it&#8217;s just nothing really happens. It&#8217;s just like couples chilling and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>I was like, &#8220;This web comic, I&#8217;m doing it to show that Black people are normal. This is my every day. This is slice of life. There&#8217;s like nothing big going on. No overarching villain. This is just a Black guy chilling. Here&#8217;s a look into this. It&#8217;s not what you normally expect.&#8221; I feel like there&#8217;s that, and then sometimes if there&#8217;s bigger issues, I&#8217;ll just bleed over. Then, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;I have to address this.&#8221; I will-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; but most of it I&#8217;m just the way that I&#8217;m thinking of representation is just like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m just a normal guy on the internet. This is what a normal Black dude is doing-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; you know? Chilling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I like that, and I&#8217;m glad you sort of framed it in that way. You know, it&#8217;s interesting, even after doing this show for as long as I&#8217;ve done it, people will only think Black designers come in one specific type. I mean, that can be whatever that type is what that type is, but I say that to say that there&#8217;s a lot of variety in what people might think might just be a monolithic set. One thing I&#8217;ve tried to do with the show is like, yeah, I have designers, but I&#8217;ve got cartoons and illustrators. I&#8217;ve had footwear designers on the show. I&#8217;ve had software developers on the show. I try to make it pretty diverse in general just to give a sense of what we&#8217;re doing out here in terms of creativity in this kind of digital age. I&#8217;m glad that you framed it in that way. I think that&#8217;s a really good way to look at it.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, that was also one of the things when I did the J.D. the Kid Barber books was the reason I worked so many hours on it was because I really wanted the illustrations to have like an angelic feel or like magical feeling, and to have there be depth in the Black character&#8217;s skin, so it wasn&#8217;t just a gray tone because it was on black and white, but it wasn&#8217;t just a gray tone for the skin and no light. I made sure that there was an airbrush. I showed the details of Black skin so when a Black kid opens it up, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, my skin is beautiful.&#8221; I made sure the skin popped, and that&#8217;s what I was like&#8230; That was another way of what I was thinking of representation, but not in the sense of, &#8220;Oh, this stands for something,&#8221; but just in a subtle way of like a kid opening a book and seeing that Black is beautiful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Who are some artists or illustrators that have influenced your work?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I got the classic Calvin and Hobbes. Loved the Garfield. Loved Boondocks. Maybe it wasn&#8217;t age-appropriate for me to be watching it when I was, but I did love The Boondocks. Strong anime influence. Just a bunch of stuff. Even speaking of The Boondocks, when I was in college, I think this guy is named Carl Jones. He worked on The Boondocks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah. He was in Columbia, South Carolina, for something. I don&#8217;t know what he was there for, and he saw my sketchbook. He was like, &#8220;Oh, let me look at this.&#8221; Then, he looked at it and he was like, &#8220;You got some good ideas here, but you really need to work on your fundamentals.&#8221; From there, I just started working on my fundamentals like crazy, which I reached out to him and I told him that and he was like, &#8220;Wow.&#8221; Then, that was it, That was the last we talked, but he was like, &#8220;Wow, thanks.&#8221; Then, he started following me on Instagram and I as like, &#8220;All right, cool.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, that&#8217;s so interesting. Early&#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t even say&#8230; This wasn&#8217;t even in my career, and I keep sort of making these parallels because you&#8217;re saying some things that line up directly with some experiences that I&#8217;ve had. This was the year, God, I sound so old. This was like 2000 I want to say, &#8217;99, 2000 maybe, but I was palling around on the internet. This was back when Yahoo used to be a big destination on the web for a lot of people.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It had chat, it had games. I mean, ask any elder Millennial about Yahoo Spades, and they will spin you a tale, okay. Yahoo had a lot of these user groups that you could just join or whatever. Very similar to like, I guess, a forum or something like that. They had one around Black comic books that was just called like Black Comics. When I tell you the cr√®me de la cr√®me of Black artists at the time were in there, I&#8217;m talking Denys Cowan, I&#8217;m talking Dwayne McDuffie. Dwayne McDuffie-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; actually gave me a critique on a comic book idea that I had. I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I want to make this comic book about these like&#8230; They&#8217;re ninjas, but they&#8217;re Black, and I&#8217;m going to call it Black Ninjas.&#8221; I mean, I can laugh about it now. This is terrible. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;This is just-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Oh no.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; &#8220;you&#8217;ve just taken Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,&#8221; which I love, &#8220;you&#8217;ve just taken Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and mapped their direct characteristics onto Black people.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;If you want to make something that&#8217;s your own, you really have to make it your own. You can&#8217;t just copy from what someone else has done.&#8221;</p>
<p>That has stuck with me. I mean, I&#8217;ve certainly taken that advice with other projects and things that I&#8217;ve done, but this was way back in the day. It&#8217;s amazing how even just like those kind of little comments that you get from someone that has been where you&#8217;re trying to go can help just set you in the right direction, that kind of indirect mentorship in a way.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to any aspiring artists out there that are just starting out in the industry? What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Work on your fundamentals, but also when you&#8217;re doing contracts, there&#8217;s a couple of things you need to make sure you have, which is a kill fee. If you finish an illustration, no matter how much percentage of it, they&#8217;ll still pay you what they said they&#8217;ll pay you. That way, even if they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, you finished this illustration,&#8221; and then they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Actually, we don&#8217;t want to do the project anymore,&#8221; if you have a kill fee, that would be like, &#8220;Hey, I finished a hundred percent of this project. Pay me a hundred percent of the project.&#8221; No matter what, they still have to pay, which is important.</p>
<p>Then, make sure you have a limited number of revisions. I like to do three revisions, and then if a client goes over that, they pay for that, so like you get these three revisions, then anything else they pay for it. That allows the client to think about it because I feel like if it&#8217;s unlimited revisions, the client is just going to keep being like, &#8220;Oh, what if this was pink? What if this was blue? What is this was orange?&#8221; If you&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Hey, you have three revisions,&#8221; that kind of nit-picky stuff with the client they&#8217;re not going to do because they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, these are important. Let me actually think about it.&#8221; Like, &#8220;Oh, can I just imagine that color in blue or whatever versus asking the illustrator or artist to do it for them.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Then, after that, I would say also save 30% of whatever you get for freelance for taxes because you do not want to get caught with your pants down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are you speaking from personal experience there?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
No, I was able to catch it. I didn&#8217;t let that happen to me, but I&#8217;m always worried. I&#8217;m always trying to save just in case. I don&#8217;t want to end up having to pay too much in taxes and don&#8217;t have any money in my account.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good idea. That&#8217;s a good idea. How do you stay inspired and motivated in what you do? I&#8217;m curious. How do you handle burnout or any sort of periods of low motivation? How do you get through that?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
That, I feel like whenever I&#8217;m in a funk, especially when I&#8217;m drawing stuff, I kind of just doodle a comfort character, which for me is like I love Sonic the Hedgehog. Sonic 1 was like one of the first games I ever played. I always draw Sonic, and it helps me get out of the funk because I feel like the funk you&#8217;re usually in is just because you&#8217;re progressing in your mind, but you haven&#8217;t kind of caught up to your hand yet. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, this is looking bad,&#8221; because I know my taste is a lot better in my head and I can visualize it, but I&#8217;m like my mind, my body hasn&#8217;t quite gotten there yet. I feel like if you have a comfort character that kind of helps you put things in perspective, I guess.</p>
<p>For me, it&#8217;s Sonic, which whenever I&#8217;m feeling out of it, I&#8217;ll just doodle a little Sonic and I&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Hey, this was better than what I did before. That keeps me motivated, and I always try to measure myself only to myself. Yeah, there&#8217;s going to be artists and stuff that you look up to, but make sure you just look at how you are progressing so that way you don&#8217;t lose motivation and drawing. If you&#8217;re drawing and then you see another person who just draws something straight out of the air and it&#8217;s perfect and beautiful and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Man, I can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; you just got to like slowly keep working. Just look at yourself and be like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m slightly better than what I was the other day,&#8221; and just keep going.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I&#8217;d love to have this graphic novel come out and then continue doing stuff in publishing, because right now my job is designing book covers-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; so I don&#8217;t do the illustration or anything in that. I just do the layout, the fonts and everything-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; and I feel like that has been a little freeing in order to look at the process, but also pick other artists that will be good for a work or a job or something like that. I guess I give them the opportunity to show themselves.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I think designing book cover certainly is a&#8230;that seems pretty cool. I&#8217;ve seen awards go to just book covers in terms of design and everything, so that&#8217;s a pretty cool gig to have.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m liking it so far. Only three weeks in, though, but it&#8217;s good right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
You can find out more about at akeemteam.com and everything pretty much at Akeem Team, which ironically, that is just like an AIM username I made back up in middle school and I just kept it,</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, it&#8217;s yours. It&#8217;s yours forever.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good, man. Akeem Roberts, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. Thank you for, I think, demystifying a little bit about what it&#8217;s like to be a working freelance artist. I think what&#8217;s probably the most important thing that I gathered just from this conversation and from your story is that this wasn&#8217;t an overnight success. You always sort of had this gift for drawing, and then you cultivated that through college and then through your additional work experiences. Then, you were also freelancing and now you&#8217;re doing cartoons in The New Yorker and you&#8217;re designing book covers and stuff like that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all a process, like you&#8217;ve managed to continue to build your skills up at every step of the way, and I think that&#8217;s something that for most people, particularly for most people I think that are listening, it&#8217;s just an important thing to know that success doesn&#8217;t come overnight. You&#8217;ve really kind of worked hard to make a name for yourself. I&#8217;m excited to see what else comes out from you in the future, so thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Hey, thank you so much for having me, man.</p>

<p>A common sentiment shared by a lot of the guests I&#8217;ve had on the podcast is that you can&#8217;t be what you don&#8217;t see. That starts at a young age, too &#8212; think about the book covers and other visuals you saw as a child and how that&#8217;s shaped you to where you are now. Luckily, there are dope illustrators like this week&#8217;s guest, Alleanna Harris, who are creating images that captivate and inspire kids so they can truly see themselves.</p>
<p>Alleanna and I went over some of her recent projects, including a portrait of Will Smith she drew in front of The Fresh Prince himself. She also shared her process on how she conveys a book&#8217;s story through pictures while also making them stunningly appealing. Later, Alleanna talked about growing up in South Jersey, attending UArts, spoke on the benefits of being represented by an agent, and told me what she appreciates the most about her life right now. Alleanna is a rising star, and according to her, a career in the world of illustration is possible! (So keep drawing!)</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
I&#8217;m Alleanna Harris. I&#8217;m a freelance illustrator from South Jersey. I mainly illustrate picture books, but I also do editorial, commercial, advertising, chapter books. I illustrate a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s the year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been going pretty well. It&#8217;s kind of different than last year. Last year, I took on a lot, and the year before that, so I&#8217;ve been trying to just chill a little bit and take on less just so I could align myself with projects that I really want to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I find that a lot of creative folks I&#8217;ve talked to just on the show and off the show, they really started the year off kind of slow. Like, they&#8217;re really kind of easing into 2023.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Definitely, definitely. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing my best, just picking things that I really, really like that I&#8217;m really, really into.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, based on all that hard work that you talked about before, I hear that congratulations are in order. There&#8217;s a book that you illustrated that won in the Black Kidlit Awards, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yep, yep. It won best biography in the first Black Kidlit Awards ever. It&#8217;s called Marvelous Mabel. It&#8217;s about the life of Mabel Fairbanks. And she was the first Black figure skater, just the first Black famous figure skater. She came up in 1930s, 1940s, New York City. So it&#8217;s basically about her early life and all the things that she went through while trying to learn how to figure-skate, and it actually won. And it was the biggest surprise ever. I just went on Instagram and people were like, &#8220;Hey, Alleanna, you won,&#8221; and I was like, &#8220;What?&#8221; And I looked and it said, &#8220;Best biography,&#8221; and I was like, &#8220;Oh my goodness, I can&#8217;t believe I actually won.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I also saw, just from peeking around through social media, you also recently did some work with Pentagram, which is a extremely well-known agency. How was that project?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
It was pretty awesome. They emailed me and they said that they wanted some work done in the picture-book style for an animation for the Gates Foundation, Bill &#038; Melinda Gates Foundation. And basically, they said that they wanted me to illustrate a character named Abeo, and she was about six or seven, and they wanted a good representation of a kid in early elementary school just so that they could show it to policymakers. And it was up to me to come up with the character and what she looked like and how she moved around. So I actually ended up illustrating a lot of the key frames for the animation and a lot of the assets, the things that she&#8217;s holding, like her books and pencils and different formulas. And it was a really amazing process. I got to work with the great folks at Pentagram and another animation studio named Kong in the UK, so that was really, really awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How long did that project take, just overall?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
You know what? Animation&#8230; Well, actually, that would be more advertising. Those kinds of projects are really, really fast-paced, so that took about, I would say, under a month, maybe about three weeks. So it was-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, it was fast.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yeah, it was really, really fast, but it went really well. It was pretty straightforward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, since we&#8217;re already getting into your work, I want to keep going down that road. We talked a little bit before we started recording, and you mentioned that you started professionally as an illustrator in 2017, but prior to that, you were, I guess, testing the waters, maybe, on Etsy. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yep, that&#8217;s right. I started right after college in 2015. And it was funny because my mom, she said, &#8220;Well, if you&#8217;re right out of college and you want to do this illustration thing, then you know what, I&#8217;m going to give you two years so you could figure it out. Do your best to figure it out in two years, and if not, then you could go right into probably, like, a master&#8217;s program.&#8221; So I was like, &#8220;Okay, I really have to figure this out.&#8221; And the best thing that I could think of was to just sketch and draw what&#8217;s around me or things that interested me. So I did a ton of sketches of places in Philly, and I also did a ton of illustrations of different Philly foods, and different pop-culture things, like living single in a different world. I ended up putting them on a Etsy shop, and it actually did well as soon as I started offering those prints. And that&#8217;s where I got my start.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How was Etsy like? Was it a good platform for you to, I guess, test out whether or not you had a market for your work?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yeah, it was really good. I was really surprised, actually, because when I put them on, I was pretty convinced it would take a long time. It&#8217;s crazy, but it was a week, only a week that someone first bought one of my prints. And I actually think it was a Ferris Bueller print that was my first sale. And then around that same time, I started sharing my illustrations on Instagram, too, so I started building an audience on there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is that the one where they&#8217;re at the Sears Tower and they&#8217;re leaning over and their foreheads hitting the glass?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yes. Yep, that was the one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love that one. That one is so good. It&#8217;s so good.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you. That&#8217;s the one I did. That one, and then I did different ones of Cameron&#8217;s&#8230; I think it&#8217;s Redhawks jersey, Sloane&#8217;s white leather jacket, and then Ferris&#8217;s shirt/vest combo, and that did well, too. So, that was kind of my start on Etsy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you mentioned earlier, when you were working with Pentagram, that they wanted, quote, unquote, &#8220;a picture-book style.&#8221; What does your process look like for illustrating a picture book? I would imagine it&#8217;s probably different from working with an author than it is working with a company or a nonprofit.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. Well, for picture books, it can actually take a long time. It could take a year or more. Because I don&#8217;t actually work directly with authors; I usually work directly with the publishers. So I usually get those projects through my agent. My agent, Alex, she usually emails me with a manuscript and she&#8217;s like, &#8220;What do you think about this? Do you like how it sounds? Are you interested?&#8221; And then I look over it and then I say yes or no. And then if it&#8217;s a yes, then I look over the manuscript again, and then they might send me these thing called art notes. Usually they&#8217;re within a template for the book, so usually they place the text within the book so that I have a place to sketch everything. And then they give me art notes, which basically tell me what to draw.</p>
<p>But lately, they haven&#8217;t been giving me art notes. They&#8217;ve just been saying, &#8220;Okay, here&#8217;s the manuscript, and go for it.&#8221; So, I just sketch things, whatever comes to mind, whatever I think fits the story best, and then I send it back to them. The editor and the art director go over it, and then they come up with feedback and notes, and then I revise. Usually it&#8217;s a bunch of revisions, just a cycle of revisions. And then I go to final art, I start to add color. Sometimes I do rough color, I just place colors around, and then they give me the &#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; and then I fix that up. And then it&#8217;s another cycle of revisions. And then after I finish the final color, I usually go over it again. And then that&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s a long process, but it&#8217;s totally worth it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you mostly work with the editors, that&#8217;s interesting. For some reason, I thought you&#8217;d be working more closely with the author since it&#8217;s their words and everything.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
I know, and usually&#8230; Well, when I started, I thought that would be the case, too, but no, I work directly with the art director and then the editor. Usually it&#8217;s both of them together. For my last couple of books, I talked to the authors after the process. It&#8217;s really funny. I usually don&#8217;t talk to them, not unless it&#8217;s through the editor.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I would imagine the authors are&#8230; I mean, do they like that process, I guess? I don&#8217;t know. I guess that&#8217;s not really for you to decide, huh?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Not really. Usually, I guess they rely on the editors for that. If they have things that they want me to include, if they have reference photos or other things like that, they send it through the editor, and then I work from there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting, interesting. Well, I guess if the author&#8217;s writing the book at that point, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Look, you got it from here.&#8221; No, I mean, I guess it sounds like the authors are happy with it. I would imagine that would be kind of awkward if you do all this illustration for the book and the author&#8217;s like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if this is really what I wanted for the book.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yeah. Oh, no, that would be so awkward. But I mean, I would work with it and then I&#8217;d get it to a place where we&#8217;re all happy. But yeah, they leave it up to the editor and the art director. I&#8217;d say for one of the books, it was actually a early reader, and it was about Geoffrey Holder, the actor and Broadway star. I actually had to go through a lot of revisions for that one just to get it to a place where the author was happy with it. It wasn&#8217;t that she wasn&#8217;t happy with the art, but it was just a certain kind of feeling that she wanted, because he&#8217;s from Trinidad and she just wanted it to have that homey, bright feeling, just, like, Caribbean feeling. It took me a few revision cycles to get there, but I got there, so she was happy with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, to that end, when you&#8217;re illustrating for a book, is it more about trying to accurately convey the story, or is it about making something, like you just mentioned, making it more visually appealing?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
It&#8217;s both because you want the reader&#8230; And usually the reader is a kid. You want kids to want to know what they&#8217;re looking at, and two, to feel something from the book. So it&#8217;s usually my job to get it there, to get it accurate enough where they know who they&#8217;re looking at just by their parents, but also, it&#8217;s up to me to make it look good enough in terms of color and mood so that it really affects the readers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, yeah. I mean, you said it&#8217;s a picture book, so the picture has to be sort of the primary focus almost, it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Right, right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Aside from that Geoffrey Holder book you mentioned, was there ever a particularly challenging illustration you had to create for a book, whether it was technical or just getting the look and feel right?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Oh my goodness, yes. It was actually my first picture book called The Journey of York. I&#8217;d say it was more like a oil painting-type style. It was way more realistic. And it had a lot of different landscapes, and all the people had to look really real. So it took a lot of work to get it to a point where it looked right. It had all these different locations in the Pacific Northwest and all this vegetation and all these people. And it was just a lot of going back and forth with my art director, Laurie. It took a lot of research, too. They actually sent me a book, and I do not remember the name of it, but it&#8217;s somewhere in my bookcase at back of me. But they had to send me a book, and it had a lot about the clothes that they wore during that time. It also had some examples of the places that Lewis and Clark went, because it was basically about the enslaved man that went along with them, and it was basically the brains of the operation alongside with Sacagawea. So, it was just a lot to that artistically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I want to get more into your work and your career. There&#8217;s some really dope things that you&#8217;ve done that I want to talk about. But before we get there, let&#8217;s learn more about you. Now, you&#8217;re originally from Philly, but you were raised in South Jersey, is that correct?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yes, yes. I&#8217;m Philly born. My parents are both from Philly. And I was raised in South Jersey, about 20-30 minutes away, Northeast. So, Philly is really important to me. Yeah, just raised in South Jersey and in a very, very close-knit family. It was a pretty cool upbringing. The town where I was raised in, it&#8217;s predominantly Black. I mostly went to Quaker schools growing up. And for those that aren&#8217;t familiar with Quaker schools, it&#8217;s basically Christian, but they believe that the light of God is in everyone, and they don&#8217;t have worship services. They just sit in silence for a little bit of time weekly. They&#8217;re known for just very rigorous academic programs. So, I went to Quaker schools for K through 12, kindergarten, all the way through 12th grade, and it was really a awesome experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you do a lot of drawing as a kid or as a teenager?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. I&#8217;ve been drawing forever. When I was little, when I was a toddler, I would just scribble in all of my mom&#8217;s legal pads. Every single page, I&#8217;d just scribble. Like, turn the page, scribble, turn the page scribble. And then she&#8217;d go to work and then take out her legal pad, and then all of them were just covered in scribble. When I got a little older, I would always doodle in the church programs. By the time I got to middle school, I would keep a sketchbook with me. And my mom and my grandma were super supportive because they&#8217;d always be like, &#8220;Did you remember to bring your sketchbook? Always remember to sketch.&#8221; And I would just sketch everything that was around me. In high school, I was more of an academic-type kid. I was very math and science-y. So I didn&#8217;t really take a lot of art classes, but I always kept that sketchbook next to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, that&#8217;s interesting. You mentioned that about being more math and science-y, but also into drawing and art. Is that kind of what initially pushed you into architecture at Temple?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yep, that was it. Because I was into math and science, but when I was trying to decide what to do, I was like, &#8220;I need something with a artistic bent,&#8221; and I thought that would be architecture. So, I got into Temple. I was in their honors program, actually, and I was also accepted into their architecture program at their Tyler School of Art. It was a really, really great program, but I did not enjoy it one bit. I thought that&#8217;s what I wanted to do, but I got there and I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t really enjoy this like I thought I did.&#8221; I mean, I did well, but I was like, &#8220;No, there&#8217;s got to be something other than this I could do.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I can imagine&#8230; I mean, when I went to school, for example, I went to study computer science, computer engineering at first because I wanted to be a web designer. Now, granted, this was late &#8217;90s, early 2000s, so web design was not&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say it wasn&#8217;t a profession, but it certainly wasn&#8217;t one that you could, I think, really study in a lot of schools. Most schools just didn&#8217;t even have a curriculum for it. And I remember taking it that first semester and talking to my advisor about it, and he was just like, &#8220;Oh, the internet&#8217;s a fad. You don&#8217;t want to get into that. Nobody&#8217;s going to be interested in that.&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;If that&#8217;s what you want to do, you should change your major.&#8221; So I did change my major. But you went even further. You completely transferred schools.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
I did, I did. I&#8217;m pretty sure everyone thought, I don&#8217;t know, maybe that I was a little bit crazy, because they&#8217;re like, &#8220;You&#8217;re at Temple, you&#8217;re at a great art school. What are you doing?&#8221; I had a really chunky scholarship that I was just not throwing away. But yeah, I need something more creative, so I actually ended up looking up other schools, and I found University of the Arts. And it happened to be on the other side of Broad Street. Temple University is on North Broad, and University of the Arts is on South Broad, on the other side of City Hall. So, I looked them up and I saw that they had an animation program, and I was like, &#8220;I think this would be really great.&#8221; I sat my mom down, I was like, &#8220;Listen, I have something to tell you.&#8221; And she&#8217;s staring at me, like, &#8220;What is wrong?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;I want to go into animation.&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh my God. Okay, that&#8217;s fine. Just figure out how to apply and we&#8217;ll just go from there.&#8221; So, I went to the Open House, I applied, and I actually ended up getting a bigger scholarship there than I had at Temple.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Whoa, look at you.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
I know. Thank you. But it&#8217;s like, who knew? So, I ended up at University of the Arts as an animation major, and that&#8217;s where I graduated from.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How was your time there?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Oh my goodness, I loved it. It was different from Temple because, number one, it&#8217;s smaller. It&#8217;s private compared to Temple, which is public and it&#8217;s bigger. But it&#8217;s smaller, but it&#8217;s right smack dab in the middle of Center City, so right on the Avenue of the Arts. It doesn&#8217;t have a campus, it&#8217;s just within everything. This is within Center City. So, when I got there and I got to the dorm and everything, which is basically like an apartment, it was kind of culture shock because you have to learn how to navigate. It is kind of like &#8220;living as an adult,&#8221; quote, unquote, even though you&#8217;re in college. So it was just interesting having to meet people again because&#8230; I transferred, so I didn&#8217;t get to go to orientation, so I had to meet people.</p>
<p>It was really great because I always liken it to Fame, the school in Fame, because UArts has so many different majors. It&#8217;s just such a comprehensive arts university. It has musical theater, and fine arts, and film, and photography. And then I tell people it&#8217;s like Fame because we would sit in the dining hall and then people would just start singing and dancing and everything and just be in the midst of that. But it was a really great time. Just so many creative people, so many things to do, so many great professors. It was really awesome. I enjoyed it. I made a lot of great friends, still friends with them today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, do you feel like it really sort of prepared you once you graduated and got out there working as a creative?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yes, definitely, because it allowed me, just going there, to take different types of classes. I had my animation&#8230; my core classes, but I was also able to take film classes, and I learned a lot in those. And just the things that I learned within my film classes, it directly applies to how I see illustration, just my point of view. I also took illustration classes. And actually, my illustration classes, that made me realize that I really wanted to go into illustration more than animation. So for sure, definitely. Definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I can imagine that kind of environment because, one, there&#8217;s so many different creative disciplines happening at once, but then also, like you mentioned with that lunchroom example, you&#8217;re getting to see people exhibit their craft. You have the possibility and the potential to go into anything else just by getting inspired from being in that environment, which I think can sometimes be a lot different when you&#8217;re at a traditional liberal-arts school because you&#8217;re so locked into your major.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. I agree.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And then as you said earlier, after you graduated, for your early career, you started out with just, I guess, freelancing, starting out on Etsy, seeing if you had a market for it, and then that&#8217;s sort of where things took off. But you said you started professionally in 2017. So what were those first two years like after you graduated from UArts?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
They were really interesting because I did things on Etsy. I was starting to build an audience on social media, but I was also doing commissions for friends and family members. So there&#8217;s some people who were like, &#8220;Hey, can you do this cover, because I have a book coming out,&#8221; so I do stuff like that. So, I did a lot of commissions. I even taught senior citizens how to paint. I would go to assisted-living places and we would have little paint-and-sip nights. And that was fun. That was interesting. I also do stuff like that. And actually, closer to 2017, I illustrated a book. Well, my cousin worked within the Philadelphia School Board. And she was working with someone who had a company that had to do with the school board, and she wrote books. So she was looking for an illustrator, and my cousin was like, &#8220;Hey, my cousin is an illustrator. You might want to check her portfolio out.&#8221; So she did, and she checked my portfolio out and she liked it, and she was like, &#8220;Hey, can you illustrate this book for me?&#8221; So, that was actually my first experience illustrating a book, and I absolutely fell in love with it. And actually, that was the main experience that made me want to illustrate books.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice, nice. Now, you&#8217;ve said that&#8230; We talked about this before we recorded, but you said there are a lot of different paths when it comes to illustration as a career and that you can make it lucrative. It sounds like for you initially, you tried out a bunch of different things, like you were teaching senior citizens, you were doing Etsy, you were doing commissions. What are some of those paths that people can take if they&#8217;re looking to pursue illustration as a career?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
There are a ton of different paths. I guess just thinking about my major, I was an animation major, so most of my classmates, they ended up going the animation route. They also illustrate, but they&#8217;re within story of the animation. So they come up with the storyboards, they come up with the plot points, they do stuff like that. And then I also have friends that are animators now. So, you can definitely go that way.</p>
<p>Within illustration, I know people who illustrate commercially, so they do different advertisements or they work with brands like Google or Apple or Adobe.</p>
<p>I know people who work within art licensing, so they do the patterns that go on clothes or that go on different products.</p>
<p>There are just so many different ways you can go. Or, like me, you could go into picture books, or you could do comic books, and there are just so many different ways you can go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it sounds like, I guess maybe once you get further along on one path, you can maybe bounce between others. Like, if you&#8217;re doing picture books, maybe you can also do editorial illustrations or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Exactly, yeah. Yeah. There&#8217;s a lot of leeway. There&#8217;s a lot of leeway because some people can look at your work and be like, &#8220;You know what? That will work over here. Do you want to try it out?&#8221; That happened with me. Someone from&#8230; I think it&#8217;s called the Phoenix International, they&#8217;re making a graphic novel about Ida B. Wells, and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Do you want to work on this? I know it&#8217;s a comic book, and I know that you do picture books, but do you want to work on it?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Sure.&#8221; And I ended up doing a graphic novel. But yeah, that&#8217;s definitely how it happened. You could just kind of jump from style to style.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I would imagine your process probably still mostly stays the same, even if you&#8217;re doing these sort of different types of illustration.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yep, yep. Yeah, it pretty much stays the same. You&#8217;re right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I&#8217;m curious to get your take about AI-generated art. That&#8217;s a discussion that has really popped up, I&#8217;d say, within the last, I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;d say, four to five months particularly, once people started using&#8230; what was the app called? Lensa?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And they started making those AI-generated avatars and putting them out there and everything. I don&#8217;t know, the discussion around it, I think, has been so interesting because I&#8217;ve heard from artists that are like, &#8220;I hate this. This is theft. I can&#8217;t believe this is happening,&#8221; that sort of thing. And then I hear it from the average layperson that is surprised for two things. One, that the art looks nothing like them, which, I mean, yeah, you had a computer do it, that makes sense. But then secondly, they&#8217;re more perturbed that they had to pay for it.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like, you paid money for that? You gave them how much money? And I would see people on Twitter and stuff searching around, trying to find a free alternative because they didn&#8217;t want to pay Lensa. I think it was $8 or $10 or something like that. So they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, I found this Chinese app called Meitu, and I can do it there for free,&#8221; and da, da, da, da, da, and all this stuff.</p>
<p>From your perspective as an artist, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, all these AI-generated art&#8217;s algorithms and apps and stuff like that, what are your thoughts on all that?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
I have so many thoughts. First of all, well, just, I guess, the bottom line, I&#8217;m not a fan. I&#8217;m not a fan because some people want to use it to replace working artists. I saw this big thread on Twitter with this guy who used&#8230; I think he used Stable Diffusion to make a picture book, and everybody was getting on him about the picture book because all of his characters, they weren&#8217;t consistent. It just didn&#8217;t look right-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah, I saw that, I think because he also used ChatGPT to write the book.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yes, that&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s it. Yeah, I&#8217;m not a fan because it is theft because it needs other people&#8217;s work, at least Stable Diffusion does. It needs other people&#8217;s work to create art. So why don&#8217;t you just actually pay an artist to actually do the art instead of stealing the work to make something out of it? Also, I feel like using AI, you&#8217;re not really being an artist, you&#8217;re more being a client because AI is doing the work. You&#8217;re telling it what you want it to do instead of you actually actively doing it. I know it&#8217;s less work to tell software to do what you want, but the process is the biggest part of making the art, and you&#8217;re taking all the process out of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a friend of mine, he&#8217;s an art director at an ad agency, and he&#8217;s been learning Midjourney and been posting the results on LinkedIn and stuff. And it looks nice. I find that the AI art has a particular style-</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a look.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s a particular look. Very stylized, heavy shadows, all the art kind of looks the same regardless of who the subject is. But he&#8217;s been taking a class. Apparently people have written classes about how to ask the right prompts to get it to do the right thing. It&#8217;s so interesting seeing how far people are willing to take it, I think, just to see what the possibilities are.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, there are so many ways that we could use AI that would help or make our lives easier, but I just don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s the best way to go about it. It&#8217;s like, why don&#8217;t we use AI to figure out our taxes or do the work that we don&#8217;t feel like doing, having to do bookkeeping or something like that. But the actual art part that really takes a human to do, you&#8217;re taking that away. I&#8217;m not really a fan, but hey.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s so interesting, at least from what I&#8217;m seeing people trying to do. I think it does unlock some people&#8217;s creativity that doesn&#8217;t necessarily have the skill-</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
It does.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; to maybe take the idea that they have in their head and really draw it, or even spend money to get someone to draw it. So they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Oh, well, let&#8217;s see what AI can do.&#8221; I saw&#8230; I think this was on TikTok. Someone had done a Racebent Addams Family, where the Addams Family is all Black, so then they had all of the&#8230; Gomez and Wednesday and Morticia, et cetera. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s interesting.&#8221; And then you look at all the comments that are like, &#8220;Somebody needs to take this to Netflix.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Netflix already has both the movies and the new series.&#8221; Not saying that they couldn&#8217;t do this, but what is&#8230; I think when people see that, one, I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re under the assumption that the person created it, but two, if they were to take it to that extra level, that&#8217;s when you got to get humans involved.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Exactly. And you were talking about the level of skill. That&#8217;s so true, because I think people want to avoid, I&#8217;m going to say this, but the ugly phase, when your work doesn&#8217;t look that good, when you&#8217;re still learning. But you can&#8217;t avoid it. To make good art, you have to make bad art first. That&#8217;s also why I&#8217;m not a fan, but yeah. You kind of skip over that phase where you&#8217;re just learning the materials, learning&#8230; If you work on a computer, you&#8217;re learning the software. You skip over that to try to make art that&#8217;s presentable. And you can&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I do have some writer friends that are using it just for character sketches. It helps them to take the character that they&#8217;re writing about to visualize it. So they&#8217;ll do it for that purpose, but they&#8217;re not going to take that and then go to a designer or an illustrator and say, &#8220;I made this on Midjourney. Can you touch this up,&#8221; or &#8220;Can you do XYZ?&#8221; I would imagine some people will go that route. Don&#8217;t do that. But I can see some useful applications of it, as long as it doesn&#8217;t get too&#8230; The person creating the picture book, I mean, come on.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. It&#8217;s like, if there is a way to do it without stealing other people&#8217;s work and styles, then that would be interesting to see. But I just don&#8217;t like that a lot of the different programs are stealing other people&#8217;s work, and not even paying them for it. They&#8217;re just taking it, &#8220;Oh, I like this person&#8217;s style, so I&#8217;m just going to plug it in.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, I know Getty is suing&#8230; I think they&#8217;re suing Stable Diffusion-</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
I heard.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; because one thing that Stable Diffusion does, and I guess all of these algorithms or AI things do it, is, they&#8217;ll take the watermarks, too. Getty Images always has that big rectangular watermark across their picture. And so there are AI-generated images that have malformed versions of that, and Getty&#8217;s like, &#8220;Ah, ah, I don&#8217;t think so. You got to pay us for that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly. And there&#8217;s this thing going around on Twitter. People were saying, &#8220;Oh, maybe you should plug in Disney and see what happens.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Because yeah, you can feed stuff to it to make it better. But to what end is this going to come from? Because I&#8217;m starting to see applications of folks using AI for music, for example. I think Google has this beta program out now where you can give it a couple of phrases and have it generate music in a particular style, which I know musicians will hate that. But it&#8217;s interesting how far we&#8217;re trying to take artificial intelligence in a way that subverts human creativity.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Exactly. Along with creativity, it makes you think of ethics, too. Like, where exactly do we stop? When is it okay, and when is this not okay? It&#8217;s a bigger conversation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, educators now are already having to deal with that with ChatGPT. I&#8217;ve been talking with a couple of educators now that are just like&#8230; Some are still trying to wrap their heads around it, others are already changing their syllabi to say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t do this.&#8221; And we&#8217;re starting to see school districts and stuff crack down on it because students&#8230; And this is to a point where, in an educational perspective, this is really dangerous. Students don&#8217;t know the difference. They don&#8217;t know the nuance or the particular human parts of this. They just see it, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, this can do my homework for me.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yes. Yes, you&#8217;re so right. It&#8217;s really something to see. It&#8217;s so many new developments in such a short amount of time. Technology.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I saw this while going through your Instagrams. I was doing research, but you even got to draw Will Smith in front of Will Smith.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
I did. I did. I did. It was crazy because the folks at Harriett&#8217;s Bookshop, they contacted me and they were like, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re having this book tour stopping in and we were just wondering if you&#8217;d work with us in setting it up.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Oh my God. Of course.&#8221; So as I was working with them and getting everything set up and working with possible drawings, I was like, &#8220;Okay, something&#8217;s up because, one, this project is really rush. It&#8217;s going really fast. So I feel like this is someone important, and I don&#8217;t know who this is.&#8221; And then I emailed them and they were like, &#8220;Yeah, we figured we&#8217;d let you know. It&#8217;s actually Will Smith. And this is a Will Smith&#8217;s book.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Oh my goodness.&#8221; So, they were like, &#8220;Okay, so people from Westbrook-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Westbrook, Westbrook, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yes. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Westbrook is going to call you and they&#8217;re going to ask you to do a portrait, and you&#8217;re going to say yes.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Okay. Okay, I&#8217;ll say yes.&#8221; And I actually had to meet with them and send them past sketches to see if they approved. And then they told me, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re going to show this to Will, see if he likes it.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Oh my God, you&#8217;re going to show it. He just [inaudible 00:39:17] to be Will Smith as just Will. Okay.&#8221; So, they showed it to Will Smith, they showed it to Will, and he liked it, and I ended up sketching him in front of him at the event.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny because I didn&#8217;t get to finish the sketch because the whole day was actually pretty hectic, but I was able to give him a drawing that I did. And I actually have the process video up on my Instagram, too. I was able to give that to him and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s definitely me.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;I know.&#8221; But it was great to just be able to say hello and shake his hand and say thank-you. And just to see how it went in person, it was just amazing. That was an amazing day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is he Philly royalty?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yes, without a doubt.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve always been curious about that because, I mean, so much of&#8230; Of course, his early story has been about in West Philadelphia, born&#8230; We all know that. But then I think so much of his professional career has been wrapped up in Hollywood and California. I was just curious about that.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Oh no, he&#8217;s definitely royalty. And actually, before he got there, it&#8217;s just tons of people. There was even a guy dressed up like him in his Fresh Prince days. Like, the striped shirt on, the sideways cap. These would people that are like, &#8220;Oh, we walked so far to be here.&#8221; And there are people from the Carolinas, I think, they were just waiting for hours. And he pulled in and people were just losing&#8230; 6abc was there. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Fresh Prince returns.&#8221; He&#8217;s definitely Philly royalty, no doubt.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, nice. Now, you&#8217;re represented by The Bright Agency, and The Bright Agency reps, a ton of animators, artists, and authors. How did you go about getting representation, and what are the benefits for you as an artist of being represented by an agency?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny, it was actually pretty serendipitous. My friend Loveis Wise, they&#8217;re a illustrator. They&#8217;re really amazing. We went to college together. We both went to UArts. They were a illustration major. And they told me, they said, &#8220;You should join Women Who Draw. It&#8217;s a really great website. It&#8217;s basically a database of women illustrators. You just put a piece of your work there and you say your name and different things about your identity, and then people go there and look for artists.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Okay, cool. I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221; So I uploaded my info. And not too long after that, I&#8217;d say months, my first agent, James Burns, he said, &#8220;Hey, I like your work. Is there anything that Bright can do for you?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;You got to be kidding me, because it&#8217;s&#8230;&#8221; Actually, Bright was the agency that I was looking at when I was starting to plan, sending out my artist postcards. And the fact that he found my work on Women Who Draw and then reached out to me was absolutely amazing. So, from there, I said yes, and I&#8217;ve been represented by Bright ever since.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are artist postcards? What&#8217;s that? Is it, like, a calling card of some sort?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Basically, yeah, you put a strong piece of art. It could have different themes. It could be seasonal or just whatever piece of art that you like most. And you put that on one side and then you put your information, your name, website on the other side, and you send it to art directors or agencies. Basically, if they like them, they keep them and they keep you in line for projects.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So you use that to sort of shop yourself around a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
No, I didn&#8217;t even start. I went on, I put my stuff on Women Who Draw, and he found me there-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And they came to you.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Okay. What are those benefits of being repped by an agency? I would imagine it sort of just takes a lot of the admin stuff off of your plate.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
It does. It really does. That&#8217;s what I like most because contract stuff that goes through them, they have people who specifically work on contracts. So I could go to my agent even about payments or deadlines, and they could talk to the publishers and the companies on my behalf. It&#8217;s just great having someone in your corner who knows the field better than you do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then all you can do is just draw and get paid.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
I love it. It&#8217;s so much help.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I mean, that&#8217;s the dream for all creatives to be able to have the freedom to do that. Like, just do your work, get paid, and not have to worry about all the in-between stuff. So that&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yes. Yes, yes. It&#8217;s definitely a blessing. I&#8217;m definitely grateful to work with them. It&#8217;s really awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve got a couple of books that are coming out a little bit later this year, right?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Yep, yep. I have two. The first is Good Things by Maryah Greene, and that&#8217;s a picture book about a boy named Malcolm. Lives with his dad, and I believe it&#8217;s in Harlem. [inaudible 00:44:33] grandma, and his dad actually passes away, so he has to learn how to take care of the plants that his dad left him. And it&#8217;s a really good book about grief, and about plants, too. I got to illustrate a lot of plants because Maryah is a amazing plant doctor in New York City. So, there&#8217;s that book. These books come out in August, I believe, the 1st of August. There&#8217;s also Recipe for Change, which is by Michael C. Platt. And he is pretty young. I believe he&#8217;s in his late teens or his teens, but he&#8217;s a chef. It&#8217;s a cookbook. And I illustrate different foods in different scenes, based on the civil rights movement. And each of the recipes align with the scene. So you have a recipe and a story and a portrait, and it&#8217;s really, really educational. So, I have those two coming out in August.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Are they both available right now for pre-order? Because I want to put links to them in the show notes so people can check them out.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
They&#8217;re about to be. Recipe for Change is actually about to be open for pre-order in the first week of February, and I am still waiting on word for Good Things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Well, hopefully by the time this comes out, which will be right around mid- to late-February, we&#8217;ll hopefully have links to both of those, but we&#8217;ll certainly mention them, as well.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Awesome. That sounds great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. How do you stay motivated and inspired with your work?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
You know what, I just think it&#8217;s a part of my personality. I&#8217;m really self-directed. I have a lot of family support, especially from my mom. And there are certain things that I just want to see on the world, and I want kids to be able to see themselves in books. And that drives me. That&#8217;s always the thing that pushes me. So I have no lack of passion or drive. That always pushes me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have a dream project of sorts that you&#8217;d love to do one day?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Oh my goodness. I feel like I have a lot of dream projects. I&#8217;m always into little-known stories of figures that we definitely should know about, but we don&#8217;t. So I love picture books that have to do with subjects like that. But I&#8217;m also interested in going back into animation. I&#8217;m not leaving picture books, but going maybe into the visual-development part of animation, maybe character design and maybe, one day, art directing, that would be amazing, for a animated series. That would definitely be a dream for me. That would be amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is this a series that you&#8217;d create yourself?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Ooh, I&#8217;m open to it. I didn&#8217;t even think of that, but now that you say it, yeah, that would be great. It could be existing, too, but any way that I could art-direct or do character design, that would be a dream.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you appreciate the most about your life right now?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
I just appreciate being able to use the skills that I&#8217;ve worked on. I guess I could say gifts, too, just to be able to use them to help people learn and just give them material to look at, just new books and being able to help kids read and learn new things. That&#8217;s just a blessing, and I never would&#8217;ve thought that this would be what I do as a career, but I absolutely love it. I love being able to sit down in my room and just draw and then actually have it turn into a book, into things people see on bookshelves. That&#8217;s just amazing to me and I&#8217;m just forever grateful for it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work would you like to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Definitely more picture books. I guess, along with the animation thing that I just mentioned, I could actually see myself working on a series. But other than that, I could see myself doing more commercial work, kind of like what I did with Pentagram. Actually, last year, I illustrated a gift card for Target. It was a Christmas gift card. I can see myself doing more of that, more brand work. But yeah, those are the things I could see in the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. We just had Domonique Brown. She has a company, a lifestyle company called Domo, Inc. And she has a collection&#8230; Yeah, part of her collection&#8217;s at Target now for Black History Month. She also did a few cards for American Greetings, I think it&#8217;s a card company. She did some cards for them, too. So, I could totally see your work in that vein. That would be great.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you. I would love it. That would be so great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and your work and your books and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Sure. Well, you could go to my website. It&#8217;s alleannaharris.com, A-L-L-E-A-N-N-A-H-A-R-R-I-S, .com. And I&#8217;m also Alleanna Harris everywhere on social media, so you can find me on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, even Tumblr, TikTok. You can find me all those places. Alleanna Harris.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Alleanna Harris, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I think that just the work that you&#8217;re doing is so inspired and really, I think, driven by your own particular creative passion. I mean, as a kid that grew up reading a lot, reading competitions and all that stuff, there is just such an importance on children&#8217;s books that I think sometimes gets lost in the shuffle. And so the fact now that we have so many Black artists, especially like yourself, that are creating the books with authors that children are going to read, that are going to help shape them into becoming the people of tomorrow, I think is just such an amazing and inspiring thing. And your work is just so beautiful, and-</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; I&#8217;m so excited to see what you do next. And like I said, we&#8217;ll put links to your books in the show notes. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Alleanna Harris:</b><br>
Thank you so much, and thank you so much for having me. This was great. I really enjoyed this.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been at your local Target lately, then there&#8217;s a chance you&#8217;re familiar with illustrator and entrepreneur Domonique Brown. She&#8217;s the founder of <a href="https://domoink.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">DomoInk</a>, a contemporary lifestyle brand including apparel and home d√©cor, all with art by Domonique. Pick up some of her products in <a href="https://www.target.com/c/celebrate-black-history-month/-/N-bw2fb" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Target&#8217;s Black History Month collection</a> and bless your space, y&#8217;all!</p>
<p>Our conversation began with Domonique giving me a behind-the-scenes peek at her business, and she outlined some of the unique challenges she&#8217;s faced as her work becomes more popular. We also talked about breaking out from your 9-to-5 job to do you own thing, her aspirations to go into fine art, and we discussed Black art and mainstream exposure through other Black creatives. Domonique is a woman on the rise, and I know we&#8217;ll only be seeing more and more of her work in the future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Hi, I&#8217;m Domonique Brown. I&#8217;m an illustrator and founder of DomoINK.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How have things been going for you so far this year?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been going really well. I started the year off with my new collaboration with Target for Black History Month, and also I have a collaboration within the same store of Target with American Greetings, where I am selling greeting cards.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, that&#8217;s big. That&#8217;s big. I&#8217;ll make sure that we have links to those in the show notes, so people can check those out. I saw on TikTok, which is actually how I first discovered you, I saw a TikTok from Tabitha Brown. She was picking up your stuff in Target. She was like, &#8220;Oh, I got to get these coasters and I got to get this.&#8221; And we&#8217;ll talk about how that all came about. But it really seems like last year was quite a year for you, and now you&#8217;re starting off this year with this big collaboration. Are there any other things you really want to try to accomplish this year?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I really want to get back into the fine arts. I think right now with all these collaborations, there has been a huge focus on my digital work. I&#8217;ve been lucky with Target, and I guess I could say also with American Greetings, that they kind of have been, I guess, touching more on my, I guess my artwork on paper. So I really want to build value towards my original artwork. Because before I started doing digital designs, I was just in class drawing with pens and markers. So I think I really just want to get back into, I guess, back to basics and try to get into some more art galleries. My huge dream is to get into art to cell and yeah, just really just get back into just being a fine artist. The digital design work is cool, but I want to have both. I&#8217;ll say, there you go. I&#8217;ll just say I want both, to be a digital artist and be a fine artist at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Let&#8217;s jump right in there and talk about DomoINK, which is your company. I&#8217;m looking at the website here, and you&#8217;ve got art, you have home decor, you have apparel, and it&#8217;s all your artwork, which is amazing. Tell me about how you got started creating DomoINK?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, I think DomoINK really just came from me just wanting to have art for my own space. When I first started DomoINK, I had just moved into my first home and we just had a lot of empty walls. So I was like, okay, let me just go to the store and see if I can find something that spoke to me. I would go to all these different stores and I would see nothing. And say, if I did find Black art, I felt like it was very generic, it may be just an African woman sitting there. But I was like, okay, I want something else. I want each space to say something different. This room could be filled with abstract art. This room could be line art. I just wanted more variety. So I just started drawing from my own space and posting it on social media, and people were like, &#8220;I want this.&#8221; And I was like, okay.</p>
<p>So I decided to create my own store and just build it up to offer a variety of just unique products that will connect to people who are also going through the same thing as me. I think as a Black woman, it&#8217;s so tough to find art and decor, or even apparel that represents you. So I wanted to have it to be like DomoINK is a one-stop shop where you can find Black art, Black cultured products 365 days a year, instead of having to wait for a retailer to offer a Black History Month collection in order to be able to get something that&#8217;s Black.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I mean, speaking of social media, I love how you&#8217;re using social media to kind of provide a glimpse, not just into your artistic practice, but also where your work is at. Like I mentioned, I saw you on TikTok, but you&#8217;re on Twitter, you&#8217;re on Instagram, you have your own TikTok. How does social media help out with what you do? Does it just help you get to a wider audience?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I feel like it allows you to build your own destiny, I feel. I feel like before, let&#8217;s say in the nineties where there&#8217;s no social media, you just have to get discovered from someone walking into an art gallery. But I think with social media has allowed me to make my own art gallery at basically no cost to where I can reach hundreds of thousands of people, and especially if a video goes viral. So with me being able to post on social media, it has allowed me to connect with you, like as you said, you saw me on social media. But then also even for brands, brands come across. Recently, for Bleacher Report, I had did an illustration for their social media platform. They found me because of a viral video I did of me drawing Martin Luther King with crayon. So I think it&#8217;s just social media is so powerful to where you can really build your dream out through it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I saw that video too. That&#8217;s a really good illustration.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you approach creating a new piece of art or a new design project?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I think when I first started, I honestly was drawing for the trend. Like if I saw, let&#8217;s say a celebrity&#8217;s birthday was coming up, I&#8217;ll illustrate really quick for that. But I think I was like, okay, I don&#8217;t want to just be drawing celebrities. I really want to draw something that&#8217;s meaningful to me and also could relate to someone in their own home. So I think with me having my own store now, I&#8217;m trying to think in a perspective of, I guess you could really say what&#8217;s marketable and also just connects with people. So that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been going more in the direction of drawing the everyday man or everyday woman, and they&#8217;re just living life. I think my artwork is all about positivity and just joy. You&#8217;ll never see me draw anything negative. I just really want it to be, when someone looks at my piece, they feel like that could be them. That could be their aunt, that could be their uncle, something that they want to bring into their home and feel good about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there a particular design that you&#8217;ve done that really took off that you weren&#8217;t expecting?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I think it was when I did my Black hair series. I really wanted something that was very abstract, but at the same time, you can look at it and be like, &#8220;That&#8217;s a Black woman. That&#8217;s a Black man.&#8221; So it&#8217;s basically people, their hair is black, their skin is black, and if they have any accessories, their accessories will be in gold, their sunglasses, their earrings, but their apparel is basically African textures and tones. And I just did it one day and I just made a whole series out of it, and I posted it on social media and people were just like, &#8220;I want this. I want this.&#8221; And I was like, okay. I&#8217;m like, I understand now. I think before me, I was just thinking very about myself of, okay, I really want art that looks like me, that looks like my family and my friends. And when I posted it, everybody else was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s me or That looks like my grandpa.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you didn&#8217;t have anyone particular in mind when you created that?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
No, it was really for myself in a sense of me just, I guess from me just dealing with never finding artwork that looks like me when I go shopping, and I just posted it and it just took off.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, are there any sort of unique challenges or opportunities that you faced doing your work or exhibiting your work as a Black designer?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Oh, I will say, I think that there is still a lack of, I guess, companies wanting to utilize Black art. Sometimes I&#8217;ll feel like maybe, let&#8217;s say if I didn&#8217;t just draw Black figures and I just drew, let&#8217;s say white figures, I might be able to get more publication. I might be able to get more views on videos. As you see, I think when you are watching, I guess the trend with TikTok, as you&#8217;ve seen with Black creators, they have such a harder time being able to get the same amount of money for brand deals or the same amount of views. So I do feel that same kind of maybe oppression in a sense as a Black artist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I hear that a lot on TikTok, and in a way it makes me wonder why people even, well, I wouldn&#8217;t say why people, why Black creators still mess with the platform, considering how unfriendly it seems to be. But I guess it just has a great reach?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
It does have a great reach. And then I feel like if this is with TikTok, why wouldn&#8217;t it be the same with Instagram or any other platform? So I think it&#8217;s just something, just an overall, I guess the thing that one day I hope whatever end, it&#8217;s going to be a really appeal battle to end discrimination. But I guess for me, I&#8217;m on TikTok because there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it, but what I can do at least try to reach the people who would be interested in having my art in their home.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That makes sense. And I&#8217;d imagine you&#8217;re also reaching people there that you might not reach on your other platforms. Maybe they&#8217;re not on Twitter that often or Instagram or something, but they&#8217;re on TikTok.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s why I try to post everywhere. I&#8217;d be posting my artwork on LinkedIn and people are on LinkedIn just trying to find a job, but I&#8217;m like, hey, you never know who could be watching.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Very true. Look, a lot of people get jobs off LinkedIn, so-</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
They do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; there is no problem with posting there at all. None.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Right? And then at the same time, you might be able to find a job on LinkedIn by posting art, so you never know. So I just try to post everywhere I can and just see what could come from it. It doesn&#8217;t hurt. I mean, it doesn&#8217;t cost anything to pose, so might as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I need to adopt that mentality. I need to think about it that way.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Your collection with Target, like I said, I saw that on TikTok. I saw that on Tabitha Brown&#8217;s TikTok. How did that come about? Did that partnership happen?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
What&#8217;s so funny is that I didn&#8217;t even talk to Tabitha. There was nothing. It was just all of a sudden I wake up in the morning and people are in my DMs sending me the video, like, &#8220;Do you see Tabitha Brown posted this?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, what? And I look and I&#8217;m like, oh my God, this is so cool. I was sitting there texting my friends, writing people, &#8220;That&#8217;s my cousin. I&#8217;m Domonique Brown. She&#8217;s Tabitha Brown. Don&#8217;t play.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
See, I didn&#8217;t even think of that. I didn&#8217;t even think of that until you said it, so.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Right? I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s my cousin, y&#8217;all. I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t tell y&#8217;all.&#8221; No, but it was something really, really cool and it just felt good to see. She could have just went in that store and just bought, or just basically just highlighted her collection. She has her vegan food collection this year. So it was really nice that she went over to the Black History Collection, she highlighted a few creators and then she walked to the back. Or she could have did it in reverse, she could have highlighted her collection first and then threw us at the end. But it was just so sweet that she started off by highlighting small businesses.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. How did you first get to working with Target?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Honestly, they found me through another brand collaboration. I had a brand collaboration with Jiggy Puzzles. And for that deal, I had created a piece where it&#8217;s literally two sneakers walking through California, and it was called Cali Views. I reached out to them, I showed them the art piece, and then Jiggy Puzzles put my artwork on their next puzzle collection. And someone, a Target buyer, saw it, bought the puzzle and fell in love with it and decided to reach out to me and see if I was interested in doing a collection with them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now I see the items that are on Target&#8217;s website now. You&#8217;ve got two pieces of wall art, you&#8217;ve got an art kit, there&#8217;s some coasters, there&#8217;s a wall calendar. We&#8217;ll make sure to link all of that in the show notes, so people can go ahead and grab those if they&#8217;re not able to get them from their local Target.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you maintain a sense of authenticity and individuality in your work while it appeals to such a mass audience? Target is mass market, it&#8217;s as big as you can get. How do you maintain yourself in your art through that?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I think what helps me a lot is that my artwork, I guess what makes it so authentic is that I am a Black woman and I&#8217;m literally just drawing from my own experiences and basically just illustrating what I would want to see. And I think with my background in marketing and also just studying PR and advertising design, I feel like I kind of have that idea of always trying to create something that is marketable to a wider audience instead of just creating just for me. I feel like if I was just drawing for myself, it probably wouldn&#8217;t be as clean, I will say. It would be more of me just doodling or sketching something out. But with me having that mentality of I&#8217;m designing something that will literally make someone happy and feel like they&#8217;re represented. I&#8217;m always trying to illustrate that. And at the same time, the work that I&#8217;m putting out, I guess, speaks to me as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, earlier as I was doing my research for this, I thought it was super interesting that you were running this mega business of DomoINK while also having a nine to five. But as we started recording, you told me that&#8217;s now changed, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yes. That has now changed. I think what really pushed me to create DomoINK was that I had the ability to work from home. By working from home, it takes away the whole commuting, you getting dressed from work, you taking that long drive home for. My job, it was based in Orange County, that&#8217;s like an hour drive or two hours in traffic. So I mean, just being at home, it gave me so much more free time than I ever had when I was just working in an office.</p>
<p>I mean, it&#8217;s bittersweet because it was, the opportunity for me to work from home came from the pandemic, but you&#8217;re stuck in the house all the time. So with me being stuck in the house all the time, and then also the workload had kind of decreased as well because of people just calling into&#8230; I guess from my job, it was just less work to do because there wasn&#8217;t much to do because of the pandemic. So it gave me it lot of time to really just figure out how can I run a business? And I just went forward. I&#8217;d never run a business before, except having an Etsy store where I&#8217;m selling pens and earrings a couple years back. But I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing, and I just was just going along. I&#8217;m like, okay, I&#8217;m going to start selling artwork. I&#8217;m going to start selling apparel. Now I&#8217;m going to start selling plates, I&#8217;m going to start selling puzzles. And it just blew up into what it is now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Was there a particular moment that it blew up for you?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I will say by 2021, it felt like it really took off was because I started getting published in different articles for BuzzFeed and just doing a lot of brand collaborations. I think with me collaborating with different companies, it brought a lot of awareness to DomoINK. And also just brought trustability towards it. Just basically, I think people started to believing in what I was pushing out. You can go on Instagram and see someone has a shop, but you&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;That&#8217;s really cute.&#8221; But I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Am I actually going to get the product?&#8221; All the time.</p>
<p>So I think with me just getting so much, I guess brand awareness, it really just took off from me where people were buying all the time from me, especially around Christmastime when I did CNBC Make It. I had so many sales every single day. My original artwork was selling and I sell my original artwork up to $5,000 and just to wake up and see that, and my account was just absolutely insane. So I guess if I had to pinpoint a certain moment of where I felt I really made it with DomoInk was CNBC.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. That is amazing. That is really amazing. Sounds like that big press really kind of helped out because it got your work out there nationwide, probably worldwide.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, it really did. Because I was getting orders from Australia and United Kingdom. I&#8217;m like, you guys want to pay that international shipping? It just felt really good because it was like, there&#8217;s so many artists in this world, and for someone to sit there and just want my artwork in that small space of their bedroom or large space behind their couch. It was just a really good feeling to know, okay, what I&#8217;m creating is meaningful out here. It&#8217;s not just something I&#8217;m just throwing against the wall. So it just felt good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s learn more about the artist behind the art. I mean, we spent this time talking about DomoINK. And we&#8217;ll get into more of the brand collapse and stuff you&#8217;ve done later, but tell me more about where you grew up? You&#8217;re originally from Pomona, California, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yes, I am from Pomona, California. It&#8217;s a cool city. There&#8217;s nothing to do in Pomona. I will say that Pomona is known for the LA County Fair. I would say that was the big highlight of it. But I think what shaped me as an artist to want to illustrate more, I guess be more of a Black like&#8230; oh, I guess I&#8217;ll say I&#8217;ll draw more Black art, was that when I was growing up, it wasn&#8217;t that many Black kids where I was growing up. Pomona is Hispanic. It&#8217;s basically the majority of Pomona is Hispanic. So for me, I was growing up, my best friends were all Hispanic. But I think I guess my first culture shock was me being around&#8230; basically being a majority of Black people was when I worked at the Post Office, surprisingly. That&#8217;s when I started working out in LA. So that&#8217;s when I did my shift.</p>
<p>I think it was very educational too, in a sense, because before I&#8217;m always around Hispanics. I guess I&#8217;ll say my culture was Hispanic in a way, when I&#8217;m out at school and everything, but obviously when I&#8217;m at home, that&#8217;s Black culture time, me spending time with my cousins in LA and stuff. So I&#8217;ve always kind of just been out in LA really most of my life. I grew up in Pomona, but I spent a lot of time in LA working or hanging out with family.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now were you doing a lot of drawing and stuff as a kid too?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I was doing a lot of illustrations. I think for me, drawing was my escape from school. Even though I have a masters, I never was a school kid. I will say I don&#8217;t know how I did it. I look back and be like, how did I do that? I never focused, I will say. I could look at my college notes or my elementary notes and there&#8217;s always a drawing on the side of it. That was literally my escape from having to be bored in class or just be bored, just anywhere was, it could be a long drive from my home to Vegas for vacation and I&#8217;m drawing in the car. So art was definitely an escape, and it was just fun for me. I never really thought about being an artist when I grew up. It was just like, oh, a little passion project, I guess, I&#8217;ll say a hobby.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, so it was a hobby, but you didn&#8217;t necessarily think, oh, this is something that I could do for a living?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
No, because I guess for me, it was like, okay, how do you even be an artist? How do you become, I guess now the huge artists are Kerry James Marshall or Bisa Butler, how do you get to that level? I just thought it was just like, you have to know somebody. And I&#8217;m like, I live in Pomona. There&#8217;s nothing going on out here. Am I supposed to get discovered at the fair? Where am I supposed to get discovered? So I felt like where I was, there was nothing for me. So I was like, what I&#8217;m going to do is I&#8217;m going to study into the Plan B options of, okay, I could be a graphic designer anywhere. I can do marketing for any company. But to be an artist, I don&#8217;t understand how to do that. So I&#8217;m going to focus on something that I can easily go on Indeed and apply for.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I gotcha. I gotcha. I mean, I grew up in a small town too, smaller than Pomona, but I grew up in a small town. And I know what you mean, when you have this kind of creative aptitude, it&#8217;s hard to tell, if you don&#8217;t see it around you, if you don&#8217;t see examples around you of how can I turn this into something? Is this just going to be a hobby that I do because I don&#8217;t know how I could do this for a living? So I get exactly where you&#8217;re coming from there.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;ve mentioned your MBA. You went to Cal Poly Pomona, majored in public relations, and you said you have an MBA, that&#8217;s in marketing from CSU Dominguez Hills. How has your education in marketing and PR helped you out as a design entrepreneur?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I think it helped out a lot. I think with me going to school, while I was in school for, I was in school from 2011 to 2019. So I think of me just always constantly working on, I guess, campaigns for my homework, my presentations, I&#8217;m always trying to create ways to, how do you&#8230; I think one of my class projects was like, how do you save Chipotle? When they had that whole E. coli PR crisis. We had to make a fake campaign, create fake ads, how to bring a customer base back. So I think with me just always loving how to build a brand has led to me doing it with DomoINK to where I have full control of it in a sense. I&#8217;m not working with some other company&#8217;s logo or anything. It&#8217;s me. Everything is me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look at your body of work, I mean of everything that you&#8217;ve done so far, is there a particular project or a piece of art that you&#8217;re the most proud of?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I would say my deal with Target is probably my biggest one, I will say. Because for me, I always grew up going to Target. I worked at Target, so it&#8217;s a full circle.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That is a full circle moment. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. I used to work at Target. And I think it was just funny because when I worked at Target, I didn&#8217;t care. I started working there, I was 18. Yeah, I was 18 years old when I worked there. It was like my second job I ever had. And I just came to work. I didn&#8217;t care. I was a cashier, I was just ringing up people. And I didn&#8217;t even show up my last week. I was a seasonal employee, and they were like, &#8220;Okay, you&#8217;re done with your seasonal time.&#8221; And I was like, okay. And I just never came back. They were like, &#8220;Oh, are you going to come back for the last week?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m just going to just go.&#8221; So I left on a bad note. It was just so bad. So it was just funny. So when Target reached out to me and I told them my story about me working at Target, I was like, they&#8217;re probably going to say no to me. They&#8217;re going to look at my record and be like, &#8220;She never came to work. She didn&#8217;t even show up her last week of work. She&#8217;s terrible.&#8221; But I&#8217;m a new person now. That&#8217;s how I looked at it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, we can&#8217;t be held responsible for those early jobs in our career. I mean, yeah, charge that one to the game. You&#8217;re good with that.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
We got to, yeah, I was like, that was 10 years ago. Now I&#8217;m older now. But I think that probably even helped me too with me getting to deal with Target was just me just talking about, I used to work there.</p>
<p>It was definitely a full circle moment for me. And then also I like Target so much because the product line is a representation of the variety of styles that I do. Like the coasters, the line art. The art prints is my artwork that I did on paper that has just been converted to art print. The mugs is my fine artwork. And the calendar that they sell has more of my digital artwork and different styles. So it was just really nice to just have the full representation of me and then just have DomoINK to be inside a Target. It wasn&#8217;t just like, oh, they just through my artwork on something and then it&#8217;s just my name on the corner. If you look at the packaging, it says DomoINK. It has my name. It has a picture of my face. It was just really cool to just see how far my business has grown since the pandemic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now a lot of artists I&#8217;m seeing now are wrapped up in a bunch of different kind of, I guess, tech intersections. I guess that&#8217;s kind of a good way to talk about it. I know last year there was a lot of talk about artists making NFTs. And then this year, well also last year, probably going into this year too, a lot of talk about AI generated art, stuff like that. Do you think about the future of the art and design industry and how it might be impacted by tech? Do you see your work in those capacities?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, I guess the first thing will be like NFTs. I wish I was ahead of the game with that. I have a friend who recently made $100,000 in one day selling NFTs. And I&#8217;m like, how the heck-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Woo!</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
&#8230; Yeah. I was like, dang, what was I doing during that time? But I feel with, I guess when the economy probably gets some stability, I think NFTs will probably definitely grow. I went to DesignerCon a few months ago, I think it was in November, and people were just standing in line just trying to get them a rare NFT. So I definitely think it&#8217;s probably something that will stick around once the economy gets back together, as you see with Bitcoin dropping or if you got your money in stocks, it&#8217;s on the negative right now, the economy.<br>
But I think with the AI generated thing, I think it sucks because in a sense that let&#8217;s say that person was going to buy a digital portrait from someone, but then with this AI generated art, they can just make their portrait for free or just download an app and pay $8. So I think it definitely hurts artists who their business is based off of commissions. And then also this whole AI generated thing is also stealing people&#8217;s art to make those art, I mean the little AI thing. So definitely, it&#8217;s cool, but it&#8217;s definitely hurtful to artists overall.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. One interesting thing that I saw from that, I think it was late last year, is not just people of course sharing this art widely over social media, but also just how many people, and I&#8217;ll be blunt, how many Black people were like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe y&#8217;all are paying for that. You paid money for that?&#8221; The gross devaluing of creative work is mind blowing to me, first of all.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Oh yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know. Did you see that? Did you see those kind of things going on?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I did. I did see that. I think it is definitely true, even for, let&#8217;s say, even for me as an artist, someone asks me to draw them a picture, and I&#8217;ll tell them, let&#8217;s say they want something super crazy, they&#8217;re like, we want a three-foot drawing or something. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You know that&#8217;s going to cost a couple thousand. That&#8217;s time.&#8221; And they&#8217;re just stunned by it. It&#8217;s like, you&#8217;re paying for my time, and also you&#8217;re just paying for me just having to use my supplies. I&#8217;m shipping it to you. You have to think about it. Just because I draw for fun doesn&#8217;t mean I want to draw you for free.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. And also just with materials and stuff like that, and time? All that costs money.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. And then I think people have taken the fact that it is your time. And also you&#8217;re paying for the person&#8217;s past too. The person spent 10 years to get to this level. So you&#8217;re paying for that experience as well. Because I mean, yeah, you can go to a college and maybe get a kid to draw something for $50, but will it look that great? And then even if it is really great, how do you feel good ripping them off? They still spent a good amount of time doing that. You wouldn&#8217;t want to work for $5 an hour. So why would you want an artist to do so?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. One thing that I&#8217;ve been telling some artists is that inevitably people are going to still, I mean, they&#8217;re still going to use this AI generated art. Because to me, this is just the next step from people doing Facetune or a little FaceApp or Photoshop, whatever here and there, this is kind of the next step from that. Because you&#8217;re already seeing people use them for avatar pictures and stuff like that. I&#8217;ve seen them on dating apps, so people are already-</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Oh my God.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; Yeah. People are already going the distance with this. But I told some artists, especially ones that do commissions, I&#8217;m like, look, if anybody brings you AI art, just don&#8217;t do it. Because somebody&#8217;s going to come to an artist and be like, &#8220;Yeah, I made this with Lensa or Midjourney or whatever, &#8220;Can you change this? Can you touch this up?&#8221; And I&#8217;m telling them, don&#8217;t do it. Just say no.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. And also I guess too, I guess a lot of this AI art is from stolen artwork. So you don&#8217;t want to attach your name to something and then someone comes out and says, &#8220;You just stole my artwork. All you did was change the color of the hair. You want to get involved in it.&#8221; And also you&#8217;re just basically supporting people getting their artwork stolen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I heard that Getty Images is suing Stable Diffusion and I think another AI art maker. I think it&#8217;s Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, suing both of them because their system scraped some Getty Images stuff. And now when people try to generate the images, they&#8217;ll come out with a mangled Getty Images watermark. Because they put that big watermark my on all their pictures. So I think it&#8217;s certainly something that, I don&#8217;t know what legislation&#8217;s going to do with relation to that, but I mean, I kind of feel like the cat&#8217;s out of the bag, people are still going to use it. Now, whether or not they value it? That&#8217;s a whole other story.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, I don&#8217;t know it will be valuable if you became an AR artist, but I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s so new. For me, I haven&#8217;t really dabbled with it too much because every time when I tried, I do not how the portrait looks. I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t know who this person&#8217;s supposed to be. But I definitely see where it&#8217;s going to be a lot of, I guess, issues with it. But I don&#8217;t know. I feel like people are using it for their profile pictures. It kind of reminds me of back in the day where people would use the cartoon filter for their pictures.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Or the Snapchat filters or stuff like that. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. I think it&#8217;s more of a little trend for right now. And then once eventually people just get over it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Which, it&#8217;s actually interesting, the week that we&#8217;re recording this, Snapchat is actually discontinuing one of their apps. It&#8217;s called Snap Camera. You can download it for your laptop, so you can use Snapchat filters on your webcam. They&#8217;re discontinuing that. They&#8217;re like, we&#8217;re not doing this anymore. I think part of it is because they fired thousands of people last year. But I&#8217;m wondering though if we&#8217;ll start to see some companies pull back on AI for art purposes. I mean, I think AI is already being used in a lot of stuff anyway. Photoshop has been used in AI for years now with Content-Aware Fill and stuff like that. But yeah, it&#8217;s going to be interesting to see what happens in the future, especially as more companies start to throw legislation, or throw lawsuits, I should say, behind this stuff.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yes, it is going to be interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now we&#8217;re starting to see a lot more Black fine artists in their work kind of being exhibited to the mainstream. I&#8217;d say this has really picked up over the past decade or so. We have Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald, they painted the Obamas. You&#8217;ve got television shows that feature Black art. We had a fine artist on last year, Dawn Okoro, her work was used in, I think it was The First Wives Club on BET, I think it was used for that show. You&#8217;ve collaborated with a show. You collaborated with FX Networks to do some work for their show Snowfall. What do you think about this kind of exposure?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s amazing, I think, especially for the artists, because shows will pay you to have your artwork in their show. I think for me personally, my artwork was in HBO&#8217;s Insecure. So in one of the episodes Issa Rae walks right past, it was an illustration I did of Nipsey Hussle, or even for-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
&#8230; Another show I had done was A Black Lady Sketch Show. So first season three, my artwork is featured throughout the show. So it was definitely cool because a lot of people reached out to me because they recognized my artwork. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh my God, your artwork&#8217;s in this scene right here.&#8221; And I was like, okay. Like I had said earlier in the interview, is that with your artwork being in so many different places, it starts to just build awareness towards you to where people can understand the value of your work. It&#8217;s just very helpful, I&#8217;ll say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can imagine, like you said, your artwork&#8217;s all over the place. Do you just find out about it when it&#8217;s shown or do they give you a heads-up?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
They do give you a heads-up because a lot of times&#8230; I knew that my art artwork was going to be in Insecure. I didn&#8217;t know which episode it would be. I never got that kind of information. I mean, I watched Insecure anyways, so I would just sitting there watching it the whole season and it was literally, I think the artwork appeared in the second or third to last episode. So all that whole season, I&#8217;m just looking everywhere. I&#8217;m like, where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Or for Black Lady Sketch Show, I was just looking around too, where is it? I want to see a piece. Because they had bought a lot of my artwork for it as well. So it&#8217;s really cool. I think it feels good that people can recognize your artwork. It&#8217;s just weird in a sense of, wow, you know my piece that well? You can just see it blurred in the corner and you know that&#8217;s me. It&#8217;s a feel-good moment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, that&#8217;s got to be a great moment. I mean, your work&#8217;s on TV, your work&#8217;s in Target. That&#8217;s major. That&#8217;s major, major, major.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the folks that have really motivated and inspired you over the years? I can imagine doing all this, you&#8217;ve probably got a great support system behind you.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I will say my dad definitely, I will say, as my day one motivator, I think. Especially when I was in high school, I had did a program called Ryman Arts. So every Saturday I would go to USC and do classes. So he would drive me from Pomona to LA, it was an hour drive. And also even my mom too as well. They would just drive me to LA and back. So they always pushed for me to be an artist. Because I was taking time out of their day. That&#8217;s their weekend from work. And they would just take me down there and then they would stay down in LA for three to four hours as I did my class at USC and then took me back home. Because that was when I was in high school. Also, they&#8217;ve always, for my mom, for Christmas every year, she would always buy me, I guess an artist kit they would sell and it would have crayons, markers, color, pencils, and this big old, I wouldn&#8217;t say a booklet, but it was a big old cassette kind of thing. And you picked it up and-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know those art kits, they&#8217;ve got all the waxy color pencils and stuff in them.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
&#8230; Mm-hmm. Yeah. So I used to always get every single year, when I was growing up, my mama bought me one of those. And so I think they always pushed me to always be an artist. But they definitely were always very pushing me to basically have a career somewhere. And then I&#8217;ll say now with me having a fianc√©, I think when I met him, I think I wasn&#8217;t thinking as big scale. But having him around, I was able to set up my own booth. I had to a booth at 626 Night Market. That was before I was DomoINK. I think I just threw a banner up, it was like Art by Domonique. Come through. I was selling art friends, earrings and pins and stuff. But if I didn&#8217;t have him, I wouldn&#8217;t of had nobody set up a big old booth for me. He had made the booth by hand. He had bought some pipes and connected them and boom, we had a tent.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. He set up all the whole everything inside of the booth. And I&#8217;m not crafty, no one in my family&#8217;s that crafty, so it would not have came out as well without him.</p>
<p>I will say my family has been a huge force behind me just being an artist. Even when I had my first solo art show in 2018, my dad and my fianc√©, but he was my boyfriend at the time, they were there all day just hanging my artwork on the wall, putting the hangers on the back of the pieces. So me just having, I guess a whole village behind me. Or even from my extended family, my aunts, they&#8217;ve always come out to my shows, buy pieces. And also my friends just posting my artwork on their Instagram or sharing it. Or even from my Target collection, it just felt really good that took the time out to drive to their local Target and just buy a mug, just buy something to just show support behind me.</p>
<p>And also just me just being on social media. A huge support system is just people, followers, they&#8217;ll send you a sweet message out of nowhere. I look at my DMs and see someone just write me and say, &#8220;Thank you for posting the things that you&#8217;re doing because it inspires me.&#8221; So that is a huge motivation just overall of people just telling me, keep going.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ll say this to anybody that&#8217;s listening that has a friend that is an entrepreneur. Buy their stuff. That is the best way that you can help support what they do. I mean, I think social media posts and things like that is great, but actually putting some money in your pocket, best way to help out.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Such a great way to support.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, no, it is. When I did my solo art show, it was my first art exhibition. It was in Pomona, which was cool. I had friends from high school just come down and just buy a print. I was selling little small prints for $5, just starting off. And they just came down there and bought an art print just to say, &#8220;Hey, keep doing it.&#8221; And it does, it means a lot to you. Even it&#8217;s go small purchase. It&#8217;s just really nice to feel like, dang, I made a connection in this person&#8217;s life that they came out here and bought something. They might not even like it, but they&#8217;re just doing it just to basically push your dreams forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What advice would you give for any designers out there that are listing, they&#8217;re hearing your story and they want to break into design entrepreneurship and work with brands like you have, what would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I will definitely say be okay with the answer of no or rejection. I think when I first started out, I was just posting my artwork and getting no likes on it, when I first started. It used to bother me at first. I&#8217;m like, why am I even posting it? It made me want to give up. Or let&#8217;s say a brand does reach out to me and they say, &#8220;Hey, we want to use your artwork for this billboard.&#8221; And two weeks later you don&#8217;t hear nothing from them no more. So you got to be okay with the rejection at first. It&#8217;s definitely not going to be like you post your artwork, that one piece, and it just blows up and you&#8217;re drawing for Target next. You may get lucky, I mean, that&#8217;s like a 1 billion chance, but you definitely have to be able to handle the slow growth. That&#8217;s the hardest part.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s what makes people give up is that first part of you&#8217;re selling&#8230; For me, I started off on Etsy and I was telling my art prints, I didn&#8217;t get no sales for months. And I could easily just shut it down, but I was like, I&#8217;m just going to keep my listings up and something has to hit eventually. I just kept drawing and drawing and stuff. But what really helped me too a lot was when I first started out, I had a nine to five. So that kind of kept me grounded to where I didn&#8217;t become desperate for my business because I had a steady income coming. So I think that helped me a lot with just being able to handle that slow movement.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you appreciate the most about your life right now?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I think I just appreciate me just sticking to my passion of just marketing and design and art has led me to having my own home in California. I think I&#8217;ve just been really just taking a moment to just appreciate how far I&#8217;ve come. When I first started drawing or maybe just looking back at me, when I was in college, I didn&#8217;t have no money. I would buy one burrito and eat off of it all day, when I was in my [inaudible 00:44:40]. It&#8217;s just weird right now with me trying to do a careers transition to where I want to go into more of an entertainment and tech field of doing marketing or being an art director, it&#8217;s a really good feeling to know I&#8217;m being sustained by my art. It&#8217;s super weird to just be at this point and still be in, like I said, I have a house in California. I always said to myself, California is really, really expensive and it just seems weird to get this far and be able to have these kind of accomplishments and accolades under myself. And this year I turned 30 and it&#8217;s a good feeling to know I got this far knowing where I came from.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s the journey. It&#8217;s the journey.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s the journey. And you to definitely have to appreciate every step of the way. I think it&#8217;s really easy to get caught up in what you want in front of you, but you&#8217;re not thinking about what you have right now is what your past you was dying to have.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Do you have a dream project that you&#8217;d love to do one day? I think you kind of alluded to one earlier.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Oh my gosh. I think my passion project right now is, well, I guess what I&#8217;m really trying to build up to is being in art museums. And a big one is Art Basel, I really want to get in that. I just really want to just get my artwork in front of some people in the gallery. That&#8217;s just a really good feeling when I go into gallery and have my artwork in there and I see people just standing there looking at it. It&#8217;s kind of cool. And so I really, really want to get back into the fine arts, that&#8217;s my thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you exhibited any art locally in Pomona?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
I have, when I had my first solo art exhibit. And then also I had my artwork in the Chaffey Museum of Art out in Ontario, California. That was recently, so I exhibited eight, nine pieces there. Well, my latest one was in Ontario, that made me really want to get back into drawing more on paper to be able to get into more museums. Because it was a really good feeling because&#8230; And also it led to a lot of people reaching out to me interested in buying my work. So I was like, oh, this is another place to keep building brand awareness towards me. And also even for DomoINK, because I always try to make sure to throw that in my bio, that I&#8217;m a founder of my own home decor business. So I definitely just want to just kind of, I guess get my hands into everything that I can that&#8217;s within my education and skills.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, gallery work aside, where do you see yourself in the next five years? Is there any particular kind of work you want to be doing or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Yes, I really want to, in the long run, eventually I&#8217;ll probably get out of the, I guess corporate space and really just focus on DomoINK. I really want to also just start my own marketing firm too, with a lot of people reaching out to me, trying to find out how they can do the same thing and how do they monetize their art. I really want to be able to become a mentor and offer courses and just educate people. Because there&#8217;s so many people who just don&#8217;t know where to start. Like for me, I didn&#8217;t know where to start, but somehow I was able to make it work. But I just try to think about the people who don&#8217;t have that aha moment just by sitting there. So I just wanted to be able to offer more resources and help people just like me be able to get some money and just be able to have financial freedom, because everyone deserves to be able to afford shelter, food, everything. So if I can help someone have their own place, I&#8217;m happy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, your work and everything? And of course we&#8217;ll put links, like I said, to the Target collection in the show notes, but where can they find out more about you online?</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
To find out more about me and my artwork and also shop for my artwork in home decor and apparel, you can go to DomoINK.com. It is D-O-M-O-I-N-K.com.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Domonique Brown, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Really thank you for sharing your story. I think it&#8217;s one thing to see the success on social media and people can kind of have one perception about it, but I hope that from people listening to your story and hearing just how upbeat and authentic are about the work, that they&#8217;ll see that this is something that maybe they can achieve too. I mean, the success that you&#8217;ve gotten over these past few years is really inspirational, I can&#8217;t wait to see what you do next. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Domonique Brown:</b><br>
Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me. Thank you.</p>
