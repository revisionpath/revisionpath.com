Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Well, number one, thank you for having me on, Maurice. My name is George McCalman. I am an artist and creative director based in San Francisco. I live part-time in the Caribbean, the country of Grenada. And I run a design studio, which affords me the privilege of doing a lot of creative things at the same time. And I&#8217;m also a fine and commercial artist, and I&#8217;m often the artist of projects that I am designing and am the creative director on. I do a lot of other things, but that&#8217;s it for right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, first off, happy New Year to you.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Happy New Year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;re recording this right near the start of 2023. How have things been going so far?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been great. I&#8217;m in a very different realm than I was even a few weeks ago. I just had a couple weeks of a break from a book tour that I have been on and a press tour in support of my book Illustrated Black History: Honoring the Iconic and the Unseen. And so I&#8217;ve had a little bit of a reprieve, and so for the first time in many months, I have had the opportunity to really synthesize and make sense of the whirlwind that has come from the second half of this year of this book being out and me going out on a book tour and a national book tour. So I&#8217;ve just been really reflective for the last couple of weeks, and so this conversation is really timed well because I&#8217;ve been just thinking a lot about my experience of being a published author and people interacting with this book and having their responses and what I have learned from their response to this book. It&#8217;s been really incredible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I know you&#8217;re currently recording in Grenada. I would imagine having a Caribbean paradise at the finish line of a book tour is a pretty good motivation.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s actually just a reprieve. I start back on the book tour in February. So this is actually not even the midpoint. I&#8217;m going to be on tour for this book most likely another year just because I feel really passionately that this subject matter should be revered every day of the year and not just localized to a month or a period of time. So I am taking the message of that to the streets.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. When you look back at last year, is there anything that you want to try to change for 2023?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yeah. Expansive. I don&#8217;t know that I would use the word change for myself. It&#8217;s expand. I learned a lot and I was involved in all aspects of the making of this book, which is a really unique place to be. Most authors are not involved with all of the backend, the making and the design and the marketing. And so it&#8217;s been a really comprehensive experience too. And if I would say any adjustment, it would just be more, basically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ll make sure that we have a link to the book in the show notes. Yeah, let&#8217;s dive more into it. Tell me about the book. I think the name is self-explanatory, but tell me more about the book, what was your idea behind it, all of that.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
The book came from the word &#8230; The first sentence of the introduction of this book is I had a curiosity, and that is the very simple truth. I was just curious to know more about black pioneers. And I was just coming to a point where I started realizing that there was an artist inside of me, and so I decided to merge these twin curiosities of, I want to test out the parameters of me as an artist after basically not making art since I graduated from college 20 years before. So I&#8217;m a classically trained artist. I&#8217;m a painter and a drafts person and a sculptor and a photographer. But when I went out into the professional landscape of being a magazine art and creative director, I didn&#8217;t think there was any room for me to be a fine artist. And at the time, there just weren&#8217;t people who looked like me in this realm.</p>
<p>And so I knew that would be a hard road, and I decided to go with the convention of working in the corporate world just to establish myself financially and it was an adult decision. But I came to a point a few years ago where I started realizing that there was more that I was interested in. It felt like there was an ocean that I had not touched. And I decided in a flash of inspiration to make this project my first assignment as an artist. And so I researched and wrote and painted a different black history pioneer every day for a month of February, and it just started ballooning. I think that&#8217;s the right word. It started expanding from there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How did you go about researching and selecting the people to feature in the book? Because as I&#8217;ve looked through the book, I have the book actually, you have a wide range of people that you feature.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I really know that the person that I am personally and professionally has really been framed by my time working at magazines because it&#8217;s basically, I got both military and library training at the same time, if that makes sense. There&#8217;s a rigor to when you are working under deadline, you have to really be sharp, you have to have your focus, you have to know what the context is of what you&#8217;re doing. You have to be really communicative with the people around you. And you have to make sure that what you&#8217;re writing is all the time. And so it really trained me to know some of the shortcuts of researching and trusting my instincts around that. And for me, I was interested in people I didn&#8217;t know that much about. Even if I knew their name, even if I knew some of their story, there&#8217;s always more to learn.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the thing that I&#8217;ve learned in my 15 years as a magazine person before I opened my studio, that even when you think you know everything about a public figure, there is always more. And so it was a trust in the information I was learning, but it was also a trust in myself. And so I was always just looking at the periphery, looking at the fringes, asking myself questions. Who is Edna Lewis? What was Gordon Parks thinking as he was moving through the world? I found myself asking intimate questions to myself of the people I was researching. And so I found myself drawn to aspects of their story, and I was always looking for not just their accomplishments, but their personality. So many of our pioneers were always looking through a contemporary lens, but life was just so much harder then.</p>
<p>And so I can&#8217;t imagine what Gordon Parks&#8217; everyday life was. He was always the representative, and there&#8217;s always a burden placed on black people in America that we have to represent our community. And I can&#8217;t imagine what that was like 50 years ago, what that was like 75 years ago, 150 years ago. How much harder it was to be seen as an individual when your community is always being judged against the majority white community. And so it&#8217;s always this push, it&#8217;s always this burden, it&#8217;s always this pressure. But then you look at these accomplishments and so many of these people, publicly anyway, were really graceful. And so you have to develop this superpower when you&#8217;re out in the world. And I found myself thinking, what did these people have to compromise? What did they have to give up? Who did they have to be to be the people that we know and sometimes take for granted?</p>
<p>I was always looking for the hidden messages of who these people actually were, and that just always sparked my interest. It just made me hungry and curious. And even as I was painting them, I found myself drawn to nuances of personality. Gordon Parks was really charming, and so the portrait that I did of him, there&#8217;s a twinkle in his eye. I was looking to bring out the anger and the jokingness and the sadness and the power and the force. I really wanted to capture human personality in these paintings and really individualize them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Aside from just how poetic that is, that is extremely profound of you as an artist to want to approach it in that way. Even as you mentioned that, I&#8217;m thinking of my personal experience, but I&#8217;d say maybe a couple of years ago, this was right around the summer of 2020, I was doing a lot of research looking at old issues of Ebony Magazine and Jet Magazine from the &#8217;50s and the &#8217;60s. And one thing that stuck out to me that I thought was really interesting, I saw an ad for &#8230; It was some kind of alcohol, maybe gin or something like that. But it was Langston Hughes.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Langston Hughes was selling alcohol. And I don&#8217;t know why that broke my brain for a second because in a way you think of, oh, Langston Hughes, Harlem Renaissance, profound poet. Why is he selling alcohol in Ebony Magazine?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes. We don&#8217;t often think of our pioneers as whole people. People who have made mistakes and people who have had different lives and weren&#8217;t always doing the things that we focus and categorize them in terms of their professional accomplishments. And you start seeing people are just flawed. Every human being is flawed. We have complicated relationships with our icons in that we have to place them on a pedestal to basically show ourselves and to show the larger community how great we are. And so we always have to work harder to show these things. And then when you see Langston Hughes out of context, it&#8217;s confusing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It caused me to pause for a minute. Not so much the why behind it, but it made me think &#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I wouldn&#8217;t think of him as a spokesperson for an alcohol company. I&#8217;m thinking of him as the poet. And not even thinking of like, oh, well, what are the circumstances that brought him to do this? Because I&#8217;m not looking at him being in Ebony in that way as a negative, but it just surprised me to go through the pages and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, Langston Hughes is selling gin.&#8221; It was gin or something. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Because Langston Hughes had to pay his bills too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly. Exactly.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Homie had to pay his bills, and so lots of people did lots of different things to survive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What would you say is the most interesting or surprising thing you learned while doing this research? Aside from what you just mentioned, which I said is extremely profound.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Oh gosh. I learned so many things it&#8217;s hard for me to pull out. If anything, it just broadened my fascination with basically how we think of our cultural figures. Back to your point of the kind of artist I was at the beginning of this process that I was looking to render a kind of wholeness of people. I was just always interested in the emotional language of portraiture and even how we as black people render each other is going through a current renaissance because we have not always &#8230; We haven&#8217;t been given the room and encouragement frankly, to render ourselves. And so I knew it was maverick of me to basically not flatten everyone and not render the same style. That would&#8217;ve been easy for me to do, but I knew that that was not the right thing for me to do for this project. I really wanted to make sure that I was showing the complexity of who these people were and I was also trying to show the humanity and make that as important as the historical details. That I was basically equating the emotional parts with the historical facts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you hope people take away from the book? I mean, aside from buying a copy, what do you want people to take away from it?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Well, I honestly think, Maurice, that we&#8217;re super casual about this subject. Not that we don&#8217;t know how important it is, but at the time that I started this project, I realized that there wasn&#8217;t a book like this and that I wanted people to have it because I thought that we all deserved to have something like this, that we deserve to have this resource. Even though we as black people, we carry our history in our bodies and we have a very particular way of an oral history of passing information down to each other that has survived the ravages of time and racism. This book in and of itself, I didn&#8217;t feel comfortable thinking about it until after the book came out and several people have told me that this book is in and of itself a pioneer. Because we just don&#8217;t have this information accessible in this way. That there wasn&#8217;t a book outside of historical, academic and children&#8217;s categorization, that there wasn&#8217;t an accessible book just to buy and share about American black history. And so that&#8217;s what I want people to know, that this is still a rarefied thing. This is not an everyday thing. This is a pretty amazing resource that we now have. And I made this book for myself as much as for anyone else. I wanted a book like this. And so that&#8217;s partially why I did it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I also love that the typography that&#8217;s in the book for the titles as well as on the cover is from a black typographer.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
There are two black typographers in this book. And because I&#8217;m the designer of the book, I was clear that that aspect had to be represented. That I didn&#8217;t just want to talk about it, I wanted to show it. It was more important that people knew that that sensibility &#8230; There&#8217;s this reductive conversation that came up during 2020 again that was like, where are all the black designers? And I was like, &#8220;Screw you all. There are plenty of us around. You just need to stop being lazy and do your research to find them because we&#8217;re all here.&#8221; And I know tons of black designers, and so that&#8217;s not a thing. There should be more of us, certainly. But this idea that somehow everyone just woke up and started looking for us, I was genuine. I was like, &#8220;Fuck you.&#8221; I wanted to know. The two black typographers, one has been in the game for over 30 years, Joshua Darden, and he has a very successful &#8230; Which he sold a number of years ago.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Darden Studio.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Darden Studio. And the other one is a more recent designer and typographer by the name of Trey Shields. A vocal type. And Trey&#8217;s hook, and it was a hook that he has just expanded beautifully, was to honor the civil rights protest signs and digitize them and make them accessible to everyday people. And so the book is filled with typefaces. There&#8217;re three or four typefaces in this book that both Trey and Josh designed.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Yeah, Trey&#8217;s the homie. I&#8217;ve had him on the show before.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
He&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
He&#8217;s amazing. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit and learn more about you. Learn more about your origin story. Are you originally from Grenada? Is that where you grew up?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes. I was born and raised here. The first decade of my life I lived here, and then my mother and I moved to Brooklyn. I grew up in East Flatbush in a West Indian neighborhood. And all my formal education was in New York. I went to Marine Park in Brooklyn and then Midwood High School, which was a medical science high school. Webster attended Midwood High School. That&#8217;s my one celebrity, useless factoid. And then I went to St. John&#8217;s University and graduated and then started working in the publishing field.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you always have an interest in illustration and design growing up?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Always. I was that kid who drew in the margins of every page of every notebook I&#8217;ve ever had in my entire life. And it was just raw. It just came out. I had no formal training until college, but I was just obsessively drawing. And I drew superheroes and I made up characters and it was all very detailed, and I would just create these worlds and I would be lost in them to the eternal frustration of my mother. And it just came from me. It came from me and it came for me. But I had no encouragement into this world, and I didn&#8217;t know enough of it to realize that I could make a career out of being an artist. I saw no road into it. And so it made sense to me to just walk away from it when I graduated from college.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s talk about college. You mentioned going to St. John&#8217;s University. We had another guest on recently, Sharon Burton, who also told me about her time there. Yeah. What was it like for you?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
My college education was a dysmorphic experience. I didn&#8217;t know what I had until it was in the rear view mirror, as is perfect parable of youth. We have no context to know what it is that we&#8217;re learning until life crashes into you when you have something to compare it to. And for me, I had an education that I was constantly frustrated with because it felt that it was out of step with the cool art schools that were in Manhattan. Number one, I was in Queens, which felt so far removed from the center of the art world, which was Manhattan at the time. And so I&#8217;d go into all these galleries in Manhattan, and I had friends who were at Parsons and SBA and Pratt, and it just felt like I was at this Catholic university that had a tiny fine art and graphic design department, and I just felt like my education sucked.</p>
<p>And it wasn&#8217;t until I graduated school and started working, I realized how amazing my education actually was and how unique it was in the landscape of how people are taught fine art and graphic design. And one of the main things that differentiated my education is that I learned philosophy and theology alongside art history, fine art and graphic design. It was one of the most comprehensive educations I could have received. And it took me a few years to realize that I was actually ahead of the curve and I&#8217;m actually really happy that I did not go to a more prototypical fine arts school. I got a fantastic education at St. John&#8217;s.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. How&#8217;s that saying go? Hindsight is 2020?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
It sure is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve heard that personally because I didn&#8217;t even study design. I went to a liberal arts private college. I went to Morehouse. And I initially went there because I wanted to &#8230; And this was late &#8217;90s, early 2000s. Because I wanted to be a web designer. I had started learning HTML in high school. I taught myself HTML in high school and learned Photoshop. I designed my high school&#8217;s yearbook and the paper, and I really wanted to go into it but the scholarships that I got weren&#8217;t for art school. I actually never even applied to an art school. And then I got to Morehouse, majored in computer science. And in my mind I&#8217;m thinking, oh, well, it&#8217;s all the same, right? It&#8217;s all computers and design. It&#8217;s all the same. And I quickly realized after the first semester, it was not. I switched my major to math, which is what I got my degree in. But I know what you mean about looking back at the education and seeing how it served you versus the time that you&#8217;re there and you have this comparison on what your peers are doing, on what others are doing or what you think they&#8217;re doing that you feel like you should be getting at that formative stage.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So after you graduated, you talk about going and becoming an art director. Did you go right into that right after you graduated?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I did. It&#8217;s pretty common now, but it was a little more unconventional back then. This was the mid &#8217;90s. St. John&#8217;s had a internship requirement that your final year of school was spent in the field the entire semester as if you worked. And so the entire semester, I ended up having three options. I remember being going to interview at these three distinctly different locations, and it was kind of a sliding doors. And even then I knew that I was basically deciding my path with these three. One was an ad agency, one was a magazine, and the other was a small boutique design firm. And I remember being confused about which direction I was going to go in. I really did not know. And I walked into the Office of Money magazine, which is where I ended up interning. There was just a vitality. The office was a newsroom and there were people walking around and talking and gossiping and stuff being put up, and I could see layouts, and it just felt alive. It felt like an organism. And in my early 20s, I was just kind of like, yes, I think this is the environment that I need to be in. And I didn&#8217;t know anything about magazine design at that point, but it just felt like I needed to be there. And so I said yes to it, and I think it was one of my first really adult decisions.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s really interesting that senior year you got to have that choice. That&#8217;s something that I know that a lot of students now don&#8217;t get. They don&#8217;t get to see the working world-</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
They really don&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Before they graduate like that.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
They don&#8217;t. Yeah. Because I teach also. I&#8217;m a professor of graphic design. And one of the big issues I have &#8230; And it&#8217;s not an easy problem to solve. I am critical of it while knowing that I don&#8217;t have the answers myself. One of the fallacies of school is that it doesn&#8217;t really prepare you for the real world. It&#8217;s like one of the last bastions of this purity of education. And it often is counter to how the process of the professional world runs. I quickly learned when I started Money Magazine that there was no graphic design class I had that prepared me for how the magazine world worked and how the design process actually worked. I realized how luxurious school is. It&#8217;s a place where you can sit and think and talk and show your work, and there&#8217;s no real disruption. There are no real crises. There&#8217;s nothing for you to solve outside of the assignment that has been given to you that you have months to ponder and to ruminate on.</p>
<p>And so the idea of instinct is just absent in the school diaspora. And so when I teach now, I teach differently than I learned, and I try to infuse as much of a real life sensibility. The other issue with schools is that a lot of people who teach don&#8217;t practice. And so you have a completely different and often very dissonant where the education is rigorous and it is really valid, but it is outside of basically the professional norms of how you would actually solve problems. But then the people who are in the field don&#8217;t have time to teach because they&#8217;re working. And even for me, teaching was a really difficult thing for me to do with the entrenched deadlines of my studio process. And so I understand that it is a very difficult thing to do. I recently took part in a review of students at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard a few weeks ago at the end of the semester in December.</p>
<p>And this was an active conversation that I was one of six jurors, and we were all in different strata of the professional world, and we were really debating and having this conversation about how what best serves the students. If you&#8217;re only learning from people who are not practicing, I&#8217;m sorry, the education is only so valuable. But then if you&#8217;re only learning from people in the field, you don&#8217;t learn what being spacious in your thinking and being intellectual and being academic, you don&#8217;t learn the value of that in the design process also. And so the answer seems to be a balance between the two, but that is not always the case depending on where the school is and at what stage the professors are and where the students are. So it&#8217;s a very complicated metric to figure out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting you say that because I&#8217;ve certainly encountered that even with some &#8230; Honestly, some schools that have interacted with Provision Path in different ways. You name a top design school in this country, they&#8217;ve reached out to me in some capacity about the show. Which is great. They like what the show is about. It&#8217;s filling a gap in their curriculum in some way that they&#8217;re not. But then if it comes down to me lecturing or teaching or something, it always seems to boil down to the fact that I don&#8217;t have a design degree. That they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, but &#8230;&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, stop wasting my time.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Stop wasting my time. And those kind of rules and terms don&#8217;t really serve anyone anymore. I mean, just the landscape has changed and design, because of technology, is just so accessible. And I know lots of brilliant designers who did not go to art school, and I don&#8217;t believe that you need to have a design degree to be brilliant at what you do. There are lots of people who have defied the convention of formal education and produced really entrancing, relevant, resonant work. And to me, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about. And so I don&#8217;t subscribe to this hierarchy of academia. I mean 30 years ago it was used to be exclusive and keep a lot of people out, and that was seen as a value, but I don&#8217;t think it serves anyone right now. Culture has changed and education has changed. And because of technology, everything is just more accessible. And so it&#8217;s really about what you are doing with the technology. It has nothing to do with did you go to school or not? That&#8217;s just such a reductive argument.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I agree. I agree. This actually is making me think of a question that I do want to explore more on the show this year. And since you&#8217;re one of the first guests on this year, I&#8217;ll ask you. I&#8217;m curious what you think about the future of the art and design industry and how it&#8217;s going to be impacted by technology. I think we&#8217;ve seen in at least the past year, maybe two years, talk about web three and NFTs and most recently AI generated art and things like that. How do you think these industries are going to be impacted by tech?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I think it already has been. What we call entrepreneurship is actually just hustlers. That&#8217;s what technology has given us. It&#8217;s given smart hustlers who are pulling and stretching and tweaking and bending the rigidity of so many of our institutions and our disciplines. The word I use a lot is it has expanded the notion of what design is, who it&#8217;s for, who it&#8217;s not for. And technology has brought so many things to people who would not otherwise have them. It just brings an aspect of the world to your doorstep. Technology for me, because I grew up outside of it and I was an adult &#8230; People who were born into technology, that&#8217;s what they know. That&#8217;s the real world. To me, it&#8217;s not the real world. It&#8217;s an aspect of the real world. And so I think of social media as tools.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think of it as real life. I think it&#8217;s a facsimile of real life. And so the language of how I talk about it has given me clarity in that I&#8217;m not confused about its place in my life. I started learning graphic design before we got our computer labs. And so I had two years of playing with typography, playing with a lot of the conventions of what is now basically archivable materials because nobody does it that way anymore. But because I learned design with my hands, that is how I continue to interface with it. I still draw out everything I do first. And that dexterity, frankly, has made me a better designer. I don&#8217;t rely on technology as a starting point for anything that I design. I bring it in to help move the process forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Good answer. I like that. You started talking about tech and that question just popped into my mind to ask you about that. But to go back to your career as an art director, you have a very storied history as an art director for several magazines. You mentioned Money Magazine, but you&#8217;ve also been an art director at Entertainment Weekly, at Mother Jones, at ReadyMade, just to name a few. When you look back at that time being a director for all these magazines, what stands out to you the most?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I can&#8217;t give just a simple answer. I can give a collective answer. Because I learned a lot. I learned a lot of things. And I don&#8217;t think in terms of best or worse because I think life is too complex for that. But what I did learn was agency. The word agency. Meaning that I am not stuck when I don&#8217;t know how to solve a problem. That there are ways and there are many paths to telling a story, and there&#8217;s no one way to do anything. And depending on the context of what you&#8217;re doing, I learned how to be a better communicator. Because when you&#8217;re working with a lot of people who are reliant on you, you learn that you are a cog in a wheel, but that your role, nobody else working with you has that. So everyone is really important to the process at different times.</p>
<p>And so you learn the economy of collaboration. That collaboration can be a really beautiful thing. And that there&#8217;s an excitement when you are working with people who are really good at what they do and that want to tell stories as well as possible. And that telling stories is one of the most unique aspects of being a human being. And that that is basically how we thrive and survive as people. We share information and we share stories with each other. And that&#8217;s where I learned that. I&#8217;m not sure I would answer this question in this way if I hadn&#8217;t worked at magazines. And I utilize magazines also to learn. And I did. I used them for two things within myself. To learn the process of what I was doing. And I moved around a lot.</p>
<p>I never worked at a magazine more than two years because I always wanted to learn what I was doing through a different landscape. There are lots of people that get a job and stay there for decades. I am someone who I learn what I need to learn and then I move on. I have always been that way. And so for me, it was what can I learn about the subject matter? I learned about the financial world, honestly, working in Money Magazine. I learned about the inner workings of celebrity culture, working at Entertainment Weekly. I learned about the wellness world at Health Magazine. I learned about technology working at Wired, working at ReadyMade, working at Afar. I really immerse myself in the subject matter to learn more about how these stories focused on this particular field. What was the combination, what was the metrics, what was the engineering of the subject matter? And so I was always kind of process nerd, if that makes sense. And that&#8217;s what I was always looking for. And with magazines, the process can become repetitive because you&#8217;re doing the same combination of things. And so the first year I was learning about the magazine and the second year I was learning about the subject matter. And then like clockwork, I&#8217;d come to the end of the two years and I&#8217;d move on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, was this sense of agency the inspiration behind you starting your studio?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Yes. I reached a point where I realized I wasn&#8217;t learning anything more. I wasn&#8217;t learning anything new. And I had all these skills that I wanted to apply in a different way. And it was working at ReadyMade that gave me the inspiration to open up my own studio, which was the second to last corporate magazine job that I had. And ReadyMade was a magazine about do-it-yourself design. It&#8217;s basically recycling. What we now call upcycling. It&#8217;s taking something that is at the end of its road as it&#8217;s being used and refashioning it for something else where it has an entirely new shelf life and you can use those things. And it was really just clever. It was just really clever design solutions. It&#8217;s taking cloths and making a kite out of it, or taking old jeans and turning it into place mats. Just stuff like that that is seen as quaint now, but was really at the vanguard of this recycling movement that is just more every day and more common.</p>
<p>It was recycling before recycling, even in California, was as ubiquitous as it is now. And I got to work with a lot of makers. People who just made things and who were just passionately, quietly &#8230; And not starting businesses, but just people who were making things for their own edification, for their homes. And I was honestly just really inspired. And I was just kind of like, oh, I know a lot of people who are working for themselves. And when I started thinking about it, I would talk to friends and contemporaries and professional acquaintances and everyone said, &#8220;Do it, do it. Do it. When you work for yourself, you will never go back to the corporate world.&#8221; And they were right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are the best types of clients for you to work with?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
It has both changed and remained the same. My interest is in culture. The identity of culture. And so I have coined a phrase just internally in my professional world that I am interested in culture clients. And in the early days it was &#8230; I live in San Francisco, so there are lots of artisans. There are people who are making small batches of things. There are restaurant owners. I was always working with clients who were working for themselves and needed help with the language and the messaging around branding. And so I worked with restaurants and I designed products and chocolates and tea, but I was really kind of more comprehensive. It was less me coming in to just design a package and it was basically working on the whole branding from the logo to the identity to the strategy to the messaging to the website, just the whole thing. And I realized that I was drawing on my editorial background to tell the whole story.</p>
<p>And so it expanded to &#8230; I started working with the tech world and then quickly stopped. Because I realized that they &#8230; I remember having a meeting with Uber. This was like 10 years ago. I was working with TripAdvisor and Uber. And these are big names, big clients at the time. I can tell you, TripAdvisor, I consulted with them for almost two years. They didn&#8217;t know how to assign photography. And so I worked with them comprehensively working with a photo editor to basically get them a library of photographers, come up with a system of rate assignments. Just basically the basics that one of the largest companies in the travel world had no awareness of. With Uber, it was they had been focused on the service for so long and they were starting to atrophy some of their customers because there was no story. There was nothing.</p>
<p>And the people who started Uber did not think that that was important until suddenly it was. And I remember having a meeting with them where I was like, &#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re just taking my ideas. I&#8217;m just here speaking to them.&#8221; And I was like, I don&#8217;t trust this field. I don&#8217;t want to have my intellectual property just ripped off and I&#8217;m not on the inside, so they&#8217;re not going to value what I&#8217;m doing. They&#8217;re going to treat me like a vendor, and I&#8217;m not anyone&#8217;s vendor. And I was really clear about my value to myself. And so I stopped working with the tech world for a few years and really just focused more on the one-on-one. And I worked with larger companies, but it was still where I had direct access to the founders and the CEOs so that I could thread continuity between what I was doing. I didn&#8217;t want to work with any intermediary people, so I had to be conscious of the scale that I was working in just to make sure that the projects didn&#8217;t get away from me. And I was also clear with myself that I wanted to keep my studio small, because I wanted to keep it manageable and basically control and frame the quality of the work that I was doing. I didn&#8217;t want to be embarrassed by anything that I was doing if it got too corporate.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I like that idea of culture clients because yeah, working with tech companies, they will just relegate you to vendor status and-</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
And they will just steal your shit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, they&#8217;ll steal it.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
No compunction about it. And it&#8217;s the people who don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing that want to steal your shit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I know in my instance, when I have worked with tech clients, it felt like &#8230; Or at least I entered into it thinking it would be more of a partnership. We would maybe bounce ideas off of each other or things like this. And in some instances, they just wanted to just cut the check, which I mean, look, I&#8217;ll take your money. I don&#8217;t have a problem with that. But I was really thinking that it would be more based on how the initial conversations went, why you sought me out, et cetera. And then it just ends up not being that. They just want to have it to be a bullet point on a DEI presentation.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
It is rarely that. And this is even before DEI so there was no representative of that. And that was the other reason. That I was often the only black person. And I was like, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want to do this.&#8221; I left publishing because I was tired of being the only black person. And for me, the tech industry has just become the new media publishing industry. I can see the corollaries and a lot of the people, a lot of my contemporaries have gone over and taken our playbook into the tech world. I mean, Apple very much has snapped up a lot of the most prominent magazine editorial art directors in the field in the United States. And so many of their campaigns, I&#8217;m looking and I can see the editorial strata of how these stories are shot and presented. It&#8217;s all going in that direction. And it should, because it&#8217;s the best form of storytelling. Advertising as a medium, as a typical form, I think is not very good at storytelling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, they are not. In addition to the work that you do through your studio, and you alluded to this earlier in the interview, you&#8217;re a columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle. How did that come about?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Well, it came about the year that I started the original 29 day project of Illustrated Black History. I tell you, Maurice, it was just a year where I just lost my mind and just began drawing and painting obsessively, just everything. I was just manic for it. And it was like it had been bottled up and it all just came out. And so that year I took a sabbatical, which means that I stopped taking on work. And when I tell you that I had no money, I mean I had no money. I was just living off of my savings. It was a really reckless thing to do, and I&#8217;m a pretty cautious person. And I knew that it was the right thing because it just came so easily to me. I fired all my clients and just started everything from scratch. And so I gave myself the time to do that, and I was also trying to figure out how to make a living with it.</p>
<p>And so I ended up doing a series. A series of series. And that is also a playbook from my magazine days. You tell a story in multiple images, threading a narrative and a continuity from beginning, middle to end. And so I did several series on my family, on Illustrated Black History, and then I started documenting the visual identity of San Francisco. And I was really fascinated by the human ecosystem of the Bay Area. And I&#8217;d been working on another series about how the tech industry started in the Bay Area and how it could not really have started anywhere else and just all of these threads were coming together. And I had this epiphany one day where I knew that I wanted to do a culture column on the makeup, on the genetic makeup of San Francisco and the Bay Area.</p>
<p>And I had been inspired by a morbid thing. It was when Bill Cunningham, who used to be a columnist for the New York Times, and he was a style photographer and he documented black style in Brooklyn and Harlem, and he equated black style with high fashion, which is something the fashion industry did not do and still does not do, even though they think they do. I was just like, &#8220;Oh, I think this is what I should do.&#8221; And I remember writing a pitch and deciding whether I was going to send it to the New York Times or the San Francisco Chronicle. And because of my magazine background, I outlined everything to myself and I wrote a pro and con list about the San Francisco Chronicle versus the New York Times and how much creative freedom I was going to have. And the whole idea for the column was that I would be writing, illustrating and designing this column, documenting various events that gave you a larger sense of what the Bay Area was all about and what made it unique and special and also frustrating and just all of the things that just brought all the complexities in.</p>
<p>And I sent that to the woman who became my editor, and she wrote back immediately and she said, &#8220;This is brilliant. We&#8217;re going to do this.&#8221; And I remember thinking at the time, &#8220;Holy shit. I didn&#8217;t think she&#8217;d respond this quickly, and now I have to do this on a monthly basis.&#8221; And it was one of the best experiences I&#8217;ve ever had. I would go out to cultural events several nights a week, and I just became this man about town for years. And I would show up as a reporter with my notebook and my pens, and sometimes I would live draw and sometimes I would draw later on and I just drew this column every month and designed it for the style section of the Chronicle, and I did that for years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. When it comes to work between what you do in your studio and what you do for the newspaper, is your approach different for each one?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I work in parallel lines, as I&#8217;m sure my answers are starting to illustrate. I&#8217;m always on the inside and outside of what I do, and I&#8217;m looking at both sides of it at the same time. And I think I developed that skill as a magazine person because there&#8217;s not just the story that you&#8217;re working on, it&#8217;s the process of how the story is being made that is as important as the story that you&#8217;re making. And as a designer, you are at the intersection of words and images, and so you&#8217;re never just looking at one aspect of anything. And it has just expanded my brain, I think, where now I can&#8217;t help but think of everything through this parallel thread of thinking. And so in terms of making this column for years, I knew that I was training myself to do basically all aspects of what I was doing.</p>
<p>I was always an art director, so I would have been the designer of the column, but I would&#8217;ve been working with a writer and working with an illustrator. But in combining all of those skills, I was sharpening my capabilities, but I was also training myself for this kind of repetitive monthly grind where it just became less of a grind. I remember the first year I was just stressed out all the time, and then suddenly it settled and it was not a stress anymore. And the column used to take me several days to do. And towards the end of that initial run, it would take me 24 hours to do the whole thing. And it just became a little more fine tuned. I really was able to pace myself. I knew what I needed to do. I knew what I needed to accomplish. And so you just anticipate what you need and then you do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you say your artistic style has evolved over the years?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
To answer your previous question, I do &#8230; And I&#8217;m answering both at the same time. I think I have developed a way of backing into the style. I often don&#8217;t know what style I&#8217;m going to do when I start something, and this book is evidence of that. I really just feel my way into what I was doing. The original column had a lot of different styles, but I basically invented a newspaper style because I wanted it to be stylized. I had to do things quickly, it had to be out of a economy of time. So I developed a shortcut of illustrating that for the longest time my contemporaries thought was my style. And then when I started working on the book, even close friends were like, &#8220;Oh, this is totally different from what you have been doing with the Chronicle.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I was like, &#8220;Yeah, this book is actually what my work is actually.&#8221; But I&#8217;ve been doing this shorter version of it for a while and it has just become what I&#8217;ve been known for. But the truth is I tend to start from scratch every single time, and I do it in my design world and whether I&#8217;m designing something, whether I am illustrating it, fine art, it is a brand new thing every time I&#8217;m sitting to do it, even if I&#8217;ve done it before. And so I&#8217;m considering all of the layers. I was like, what is best going to serve this story? Is it something that&#8217;s in pencil? Is it something that is in paint? Is it typography? I just think freshly about everything that I&#8217;m doing, and I throw out what has come before. I honor what has come before, but I don&#8217;t get stuck in the nostalgia of what I&#8217;m doing. I will throw everything out and start it up again if I think that that is the right thing to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the people that have really helped motivate and inspire you over the years?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
There are so many hidden figures in my life. The truth is, it&#8217;s not a lot of artists. The artists who inspire my work are not contemporary artists. They&#8217;re people that I grew up admiring. And where I find my inspiration is not really in other people, it&#8217;s in nature. The natural world really provides a lot of my motivation. But in terms of the people who have inspired they&#8217;re close family friends, they&#8217;re people I consider mentors in my life that have just always been many times the last few years where I&#8217;ve just admitted to my internal community, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing. I&#8217;m just literally making this up. And there have been many times, there were many times that first year of launching out as an artist where there wasn&#8217;t a month that went by that I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think this is going to work. I think I need to stop doing this. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to figure out how to make a living. I don&#8217;t think this is working.&#8221;</p>
<p>And no one person would let me do that. Everyone was just like, &#8220;Nope, nope, nope. Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.&#8221; And I&#8217;m grateful for that because that the first year I was absolutely flabbergasted how I was going to make this thing work. And I could see the talent and I could see that there was something there, but how all the pieces fit together in terms of continuity and financial stability, I didn&#8217;t see it. And then I got the column and the column I didn&#8217;t give the context for. I started six months after I started being an artist. And that was the first light bulb where I was like, oh, I think I know how to package this work.</p>
<p>And then I started getting more assignments and then it just picked up from there. And there were many stages of the process where something else would happen and I&#8217;d think, &#8220;Oh, okay, yes, that&#8217;s how this fits in.&#8221; And, &#8220;Oh, right. And then I can do that.&#8221; And then when I got my book deal, I realized that my column had been training me to do this book and that I had certainly designed lots of books, but this was the first time that I was all things and that I&#8217;d been doing a version of that for the last few years. And so I had been prepping myself for this larger project that I think it would&#8217;ve been much harder to do if I had not been doing it. So I just started seeing how all the pieces were fitting together.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you appreciate the most about your life right now?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
That I get to do what I love. I am happy. I am as happy as a pig in shit. I feel really fortunate that I am passionately in love with the creative world that I&#8217;ve given myself. I get to work with all of the things and the skills that I&#8217;ve been given. And there&#8217;s so much I&#8217;ve learned over the years that I get to relearn and apply in a different way. And I&#8217;ve learned that I get bored really easily and I&#8217;m not bored by anything that I do right now, which tells me that I&#8217;m doing the right thing. Learning is an absolute essential part of what I do, and I place myself on the ground floor of everything that I do because I see myself as a student also. And so I remain energized by what I do. I have a genuine love of what I get to do on a daily basis.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing? What kind of projects do you want to work on? Where do you see yourself in the near future?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
I have to say I&#8217;m already doing what I see myself doing in another five years. I&#8217;m going to be making a lot of books. I&#8217;m designing a lot of books. I am making a lot of books. My next book is actually on the publishing industry. And I&#8217;m also starting to expand into three-dimensional spaces. I&#8217;m finishing up my first stint as an exhibition designer. I&#8217;m designing a museum show that is premiering in another few weeks in California and it&#8217;s a major show for a major artist by the name of Mike Henderson, as a black artist who is having a renaissance right now and he requested a black designer specifically. And the cultural aspects of design is something I&#8217;m really keyed to and always representing the black perspective so the people know that design is not neutral. I went to school and grew up hearing this fallacy that design is objective and neutral, and I know that it is not.</p>
<p>And so I teach in that way, I design in that way, I educate in that way, I work in that way. And so I just see more three-dimensional spaces. I see designing interiors, I see designing fully comprehensive experiences where you can see the two dimensionality of the design process in terms of type and art on the walls, but also the three dimensional aspect. The mood and the tone and the feeling of what you should be feeling, of what the average person can walk into a space and experience. That is what I&#8217;m going to be doing a lot of in coming days and weeks and years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, your work, the book? Of course, we&#8217;ll put the book in the show notes, but where can people find out more information about you if they want to follow you?</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Well, the book itself, the book was published in late September of 2022, so it is everywhere. And the book, I&#8217;m really happy to share, has gone into its second printing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you so much. The response has just been &#8230; It has been a very emotional few months as people &#8230; Because you make a thing as you know as a designer, but then you don&#8217;t really know how people are going to respond to it. And so I have just been amazed and rendered mute many times by the messages that I&#8217;ve received and the responses of the people that I&#8217;ve met out on the tour. And so this book is everywhere. You can get it at any bookstore, anywhere, all over the country. Of course, I always tell people to support their independent bookstores, so if you are buying it, you don&#8217;t have to buy it from the devil, Amazon. There are lots of local bookstores that would love to have your support. And as far as just my social media feed, all of it is the same, whether on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. It is McCalman.co.

All right. Sounds good. Well, George McCalman, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show for-</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Thank you so much. Thank you, Maurice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. One, for just sharing your story of how you come into art and really studied it and then going on as an art director, but then also the process of the book. And I think to me, what is probably most important about this conversation is how you&#8217;ve taken that flame of creativity and found a way to really expand it out as far as you can into as many different places as possible. Like you&#8217;re teaching, you&#8217;re doing client work, you&#8217;ve got the book, you&#8217;re a columnist, and now I feel like this expansion into 3D space, even as you mentioned, definitely seems like the inevitable next step for where you&#8217;re going. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>George McCalman:</b><br>
Your questions were incredibly thoughtful. I&#8217;m really grateful for your interest in talking to me, and thank you. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m going to say. Thank you so much.</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Hi, my name is Lauren Brown, and I&#8217;m currently an illustrator and art director working at Wizards of the Coast.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has this year been going for you?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been a very interesting year, because it&#8217;s been a year of a lot of change. I think that I have probably had the most tumultuous year that I&#8217;ve had. No, I guess I can&#8217;t really say most tumultuous because the pandemic did just happen. But this year, it&#8217;s very tricky because I just moved back to Atlanta from Austin, Texas, and lost a job that I really believed in the day before I moved down. And then got another dream job. So it&#8217;s been a big year of ups, and downs, and a lot of a big journey, so to speak. But it&#8217;s also been a really good year because I&#8217;ve learned a ton and I&#8217;ve been able to do a lot. So it&#8217;s been a roller coaster a bit, but in a good way</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like it. I think this has been a kind of rebuilding year for a lot of folks, especially I don&#8217;t want to say coming out of the pandemic, but certainly as we are now more normalized to just the way the world is now. People are starting to get back into some sort of a familiar rhythm. So it sounds like that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve been trying to do also.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been trying to do. But I&#8217;ve been disrupted from really reestablishing myself. Because during the pandemic, I&#8217;ve really been in my head a lot doing a lot of internal work and doing a lot of self-centering and growing. I also got diagnosed with ADHD in 2021, so it was also a lot of coping and coming to terms with that. And working from home and having that pandemic environment exacerbated that. But from that, I learned a lot about how to master myself and learning how to be in better control of my own inclinations and my own tendencies.</p>
<p>And so I&#8217;ve been growing a lot over that course of the pandemic. Because weirdly, 2020 was a good year for me. Even though obviously stress wise and world wise it was awful. But because I&#8217;m an introvert and because I was able to be internal, I was able to do a lot of work towards my personal growth and my career that I think I may not have been able to do if not for that crazy, awful year. And a lot of it was the product of a lot of horrible things like the protests and all that. But that&#8217;s when people started to really take notice of Black creators and really wanted to elevate them. And so therefore, I had a good year because of that, even though it&#8217;s like a double-edged sword, obviously. Yeah, it&#8217;s weird to say always.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, I&#8217;ve heard that from people too with the events that happened during the summer with folks protesting and with companies trying to I guess come to some level of recognition of what people of color, particularly what Black people are going through in both professional and personal capacities. I know a lot of people got an influx of work, so I completely understand that.</p>
<p>Now you sort of alluded to this. You have a really long history as an art director and an illustrator. But I want to start with where you&#8217;re at now. You mentioned you&#8217;re at Wizards of the Coast. Can you tell me a little bit about the work you&#8217;re doing there?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Yes. I just started at Wizards of the Coast in October, late October. So I am the art director on Magic: The Gathering on the marketing side of things. So that means that I get to work on trailers and online content, and art direction with commissioning artists as well for key art. It&#8217;s a really exciting opportunity because it&#8217;s a chance to work with amazing artists all across the industry, and also impact the fantastic trailers that Magic does. And I&#8217;ve also been a huge Wizards fan for probably about over 12 years now. I started playing Match at the Gathering with my best friend, and then I started playing D&#038;D eight years ago while working at Floyd County Productions, which I&#8217;ll talk about later.</p>
<p>But both of those games have really changed my life in terms of just making more friends, being more social, and just giving a very enriching, inspiring experience. So it feels really good to be able to work at a company that has directly influenced my life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. How is the work going so far?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Right now I&#8217;m just onboarding. So I think you&#8217;ll probably hear a lot of people say this. When you first start at a studio, you have to learn how the systems work and you have to learn how the communication styles are. All of the acronyms, all the people that you&#8217;re going to be working with. So I haven&#8217;t really gotten to dive deep into things yet just because I&#8217;ve been doing onboarding for the past few weeks. But I&#8217;m really excited to see the work that I&#8217;m going to eventually start on and which project I&#8217;m really going to be able to impact. Obviously, whatever project I work on won&#8217;t come out for a little bit. But I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing that first trailer that comes out that I&#8217;ve gotten to have a hand in, and see people react to it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, of course people know of Magic: The Gathering as a card game. Of course it&#8217;s expanded to more than that. But is it different doing art direction for a card game versus say like a video game?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Absolutely. Because when you&#8217;re working on a game that already has mechanics and already has such a big following, and also for the fact that it&#8217;s a physical card game, there are a lot more considerations of various different teams that you have to collaborate with and communicate with when you&#8217;re doing video games. Because you&#8217;re handling technology, and you&#8217;re handling a player experience and how the player is going to engage with the art in a completely different context.</p>
<p>Obviously there&#8217;s similar considerations. It&#8217;s very parallel to a card game, because you have to still consider how the player is going to look at the card, how they&#8217;re going to interact with it. How they&#8217;re going to feel when they experience it and what the story they get out of it is. But in a video game, that story is much more immersive. So you really have to think about a video game on a moment to moment basis, and how the player is going to interact with these different objects throughout space, rather than just a physical card that you hold in your hand. But with a card game, you have to figure out how to think about the whole set as a cohesive unit, and as a whole story. So it&#8217;s a different way to think about stories and a different way to think about how the art is going to impact that experience.</p>
<p>But I think from my purview being on the marketing side of things, most of that figuring out is already done. And I have to figure out how the audiences are going to engage with it once it&#8217;s out into the world. It&#8217;s a completely different sphere I think, of art direction than video game art direction is. So the differences are pretty glaring, but I really enjoyed both so far. I enjoy seeing how players interact with the content that we create, and I get to see that one in both aspects. And that&#8217;s really rewarding for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it sounds like some of that art direction also includes I guess some play testing also, right?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Absolutely. On the wizard side, I won&#8217;t be play testing anything because again, I&#8217;m not working on the core game. However, in video games, there&#8217;s a lot of play testing that needs to be done to make sure that everything that we are creating is coming across as intended for the players. There&#8217;s a whole team dedicated to play testing. They&#8217;re the QA team, quality assurance. And they&#8217;re the ones who really make sure that they&#8217;re catching all the bugs and catching all the errors that we might have, or anything that shouldn&#8217;t be as intended. But the team is also required to play test the games to make sure that everything that we have created is coming across as intended.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my job to make sure that the art is reading as it should be, that nothing is going to be difficult to understand from first read. Is the main character blending into the background? Are these elements standing out? Will the player understand that they have to go through the store? Is that door bright enough or apparent enough?</p>
<p>Things like that are things that video game art directors have to think about, as well as just generally managing the team and making sure that everybody has a clear vision to aim towards. It&#8217;s a really collaborative experience with your full team, because you&#8217;re talking to everybody who&#8217;s making that game. Engineers, designers, producers, tech artists. You have to make sure that all the pieces are coming together. Because again, it&#8217;s a massive collaboration. And you want to make sure that everybody understands what everybody else is doing, so that everything is going to come together as a whole. Cause that&#8217;s very, very important. There&#8217;s a lot of things that can go wrong in video game development.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds a lot like, and maybe this is maybe an abstraction, but it kind of sounds a lot like production work in that you&#8217;re really kind of herding a lot of cats almost.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Absolutely. And usually, you want to be able to trust your team to make sure that they know what they&#8217;re doing. And hopefully you have hired them because they have skills in these areas. Obviously there&#8217;s going to be more junior artists or more junior people who need training and need to learn more. But everybody has something to bring to the table in game development. There shouldn&#8217;t be anybody who is sitting idle and not able to contribute to a certain part of the project. And so really, you have to trust that your team can do what they&#8217;re setting out to do.</p>
<p>But I really enjoy being more of a guide as an art director rather than a straightforward manager. I like to be a mentor, and really sit with my artists and work with them on growing their skills. And making sure that they&#8217;re excited about what we&#8217;re working on, and make sure that they have buy-in about what we&#8217;re working on. So a lot of the decisions that can be made are made without the input of everybody who&#8217;s working on the team, and you can feel like you lose your agency. And so as an art director, I like to make sure that everybody knows what&#8217;s going on. Even if they can say something and maybe it doesn&#8217;t work for the game, but at least they have the chance to speak and be able to contribute to that.</p>
<p>But I really enjoy that collaboration because it teaches me a lot. Especially working with different teams like engineers and design, because they all have different perspectives of what to bring to a game. And I&#8217;m a longtime gamer. And so being able to contribute actively to the process of making a game is really rewarding because you get to see why all these decisions are made. When I see players complaining about a certain aspect of other games that I am a fan of, I just have to shake my head because I generally know why those decisions were made, and why they had to be the way they were. A lot of the requests are things that are completely unreasonable. So being a part of that process is really illuminating, and was eyeopening for me when I first joined the game industry back in 2016.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you kind of have to think about the whole experience. You&#8217;re thinking about it from the player&#8217;s end, you&#8217;re thinking about it of course from your end as the art director. And you&#8217;re really taking all of these considerations into account at every step of the process.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Absolutely. Because again, there&#8217;s a lot of moving parts to a video game. So when you&#8217;re art directing, you can&#8217;t just say, &#8220;I just want it this way, and that&#8217;s it.&#8221; It&#8217;s like no, you have to really consider how that art is going to follow the game play, how it&#8217;s going to follow the story. How it&#8217;s going to work with whatever the engineers can actually code into the game. There&#8217;s a lot of art that you can create that&#8217;s not going to be feasible to fit into the game engine even, or be able to run on certain devices. Because I worked in mobile when I first started my career in gaming, and there&#8217;s a lot of considerations that you have to take for what a phone can handle versus what a console can handle. So you really have to be careful as an artist to not overload the engine so that people can actually play the game.</p>
<p>But you also have to make sure that if you&#8217;re working under a license product, does the art look like the license product? Because the licenser will tell you if it doesn&#8217;t. And you have to be very careful about that. You have to be very careful about trying to put your own point of view in where a specific style has already been established. Because a lot of artists can have the tendency to do that, especially when they&#8217;re more junior.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of considerations to take in art direction. But ultimately, it&#8217;s a lot more technical than working in a field, like say animation would be. And so you have to learn a lot more about what engine requirements there are if you&#8217;re working in Unity or Unreal, what implementation looks like. There is so much to consider. But it&#8217;s been a really fun experience and I&#8217;m already starting to miss it a little bit working on video games proper, even though I haven&#8217;t really gotten to dive deep into my side of things yet at Wizards. But I&#8217;m looking forward to that too. But I think I&#8217;ll always want to make video games.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now will you have an opportunity to also contribute artwork as well?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
I think I might be able to contribute artwork, actually. I don&#8217;t want to say too much, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that I will have an opportunity to be able to do that. Which I&#8217;m really excited about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you mentioned having to consider all of these different parts. And it actually is reminding me of the last job that I had. I was working for a tech startup, but one of the projects they had was that they wanted to make a print magazine.</p>
<p>And I had never made a print magazine before, but I was like, &#8220;I could do this. I&#8217;ve done enough kind of creative-ish projects to get a sense of what this is.&#8221; And I&#8217;m not saying that making a magazine is like making a video game, but I think very much the overall sort of creative direction of putting something together from start to finish, so it can be a singular experience is kind of the same.</p>
<p>With the magazine, I was considering not just the articles that we were publishing, but what&#8217;s the order? What&#8217;s the journey that I want the reader to take from cover to cover? What do we want to have for illustrations? Do we want to have these full page illustrations that mirror the article? Do we want to have maybe a center spread or something like that? So all these considerations, not to mention the size of the magazine, the paper, all of that coming into the experience.</p>
<p>I really think a lot of people do not understand just how much goes into art direction and creative direction in terms of crafting an experience. Cause because just get it at the end and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;This is it. They don&#8217;t consider everything that has to have been done to get to that point.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
And because that process again, is so involved and collaborative. Like I said, there&#8217;s so many things that can go wrong. And people don&#8217;t understand the sheer amount of content that they will never see, because there&#8217;s so much that I&#8217;ve worked on animation and in gaming that has never seen the light of day, because there&#8217;s so many things during the process that can just mess up the works. And the machinery will fail in terms of just the process of what it takes to make a game. And then that project will never get picked up again.</p>
<p>And so the fact that anything is out is a miracle to me, because I&#8217;m pretty sure that people see about probably 1% of all the content that actually has been made behind the scenes. There&#8217;s just really so much. But being able to see it start to finish becomes all that more rewarding, because it&#8217;s so hard to create.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s smaller snippets that you can make too. Anybody can make a game. And sometimes what we would do when I was working at EA and Zynga is that we would do game jams, which you would break up into smaller teams over a very limited course of days. I think the shortest game jams I&#8217;ve worked on was actually one day, but usually it&#8217;s about two or three.</p>
<p>And just five of us who would work together for a few years would come together and make a video game that was playable. It was a requirement that it was a playable game. And I think those experiences out of everything was the most rewarding to me because it was a really focused vision, and it had to be from the beginning because we had so little time to make it. And I was so proud of those little projects, because it was that full collaboration that happened in such a condensed amount of time. And so you really got to see the process from start to finish within that course. And you got to concept it together. You got to brainstorm. You got to come up with our style, and what that&#8217;s going to look like, and how the game is going to play and be coded, and what the experience is going to be like, what the core loop is. And you come up with all that in such a short space.</p>
<p>And then coming out of probably not sleeping for a little bit or staying at work late, and then you get to see people experience your game that quickly is so rewarding and so special. Because you get to see it and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Wow, we had a nugget of an idea and we really made it happen. It actually came to life.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s usually how I feel at the end of any big project, not just with gaming, but in animation, and illustration, and personal projects. I always feel that sense of accomplishment in a sense of, &#8220;Yeah, we made something. We had an idea and it happened.&#8221; Because again, people have no idea how often it just doesn&#8217;t happen or it just ends up as a work in progress. So it&#8217;s really special to be able to play any game. So I want people to appreciate that experience a little bit more because it&#8217;s so hard to make one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is that the most difficult part? The fact that you could do all this work and then it just not even be released or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
It&#8217;s not the most difficult because it&#8217;s not up to me whether or not a game is released. But it is the most heartbreaking experience when something that you&#8217;ve worked on really hard or worked really hard doesn&#8217;t see the light of day. This happened in animation as well. There&#8217;s been several projects where I&#8217;ve worked on that I never got to really show anybody. And that was really sad because a lot of us believed in those projects. Same with gaming too. I&#8217;ve worked on at least I think three different games that never got made. And so it was a really heartbreaking experience. But we could also see the writing on the wall very often where we&#8217;re like, &#8220;We don&#8217;t know if those things are going to get made because there&#8217;s too many miscommunications and things that are not really working that we thought was going to work.&#8221; And after a while, there&#8217;s money that&#8217;s spent on these things. And so you have to consider how much the company is willing to invest in this idea that may not pan out, that may not be profitable. And again, it&#8217;s not up to us. It&#8217;s up to the company ultimately.</p>
<p>So I think that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s special to be able to make a game jam because that one is up to the team who&#8217;s making it. And so the fact that the team can come together and agree that this is going to be good enough to create is something that&#8217;s very special.<br>
I think the hardest parts of game development is honestly the starting of it. The pre-production. Because it&#8217;s funny because it&#8217;s also the most fun. Most of the games that I&#8217;ve worked on have actually been live service mobile games. The Simpsons Tapped Out, Harry Potter: Puzzles &#038; Spells, and Words with Friends. And those games had already had a preset cadence with which they were releasing, which is very fun and comforting because you kind of generally know what the player&#8217;s going to expect and you can add new things to it. But the process has been already established.</p>
<p>But when a game is just starting, you have to establish the full process, how the production is going to run, what engine you&#8217;re going to use, what art style you&#8217;re going to use, which is really hard. What the game design is going to be, which is also very hard, and how the code base is going to be set up.</p>
<p>And so building the game initially is difficult because you need to make sure that you can maintain that game, or whatever you&#8217;ve committed to in the beginning can be scalable. Because if it&#8217;s not scalable and you&#8217;re trying to add more things to it, things are going to break really quickly. And it&#8217;s going to be really difficult to update, and edit your game, and add more things to it, and have it be playable on all these different engines. So there&#8217;s so much that has to go into when you&#8217;re first starting the game in pre-production or I guess in prototyping, because you&#8217;re throwing a bunch of stuff at a wall and you&#8217;re just hoping things stick. A game jam condenses this because you don&#8217;t have enough time to consider and mull over the details, and you don&#8217;t have the time to noodle over whatever could be. You just have to decide on something and make it happen.</p>
<p>But when you&#8217;re working on a full game, I mean it&#8217;s your playground, but it&#8217;s also difficult that it&#8217;s your playground. Again, that brainstorming collaboration comes into key. Because people can have buy-in, but they also can say, &#8220;Well that&#8217;s cool, but what if this?&#8221; [inaudible 00:22:24] last forever and ever. And you could end up not making anything because you&#8217;ve done what if this too many times.</p>
<p>So getting people to agree on a vision is really, really difficult. Especially when you have time to disagree. And so that&#8217;s really I think the hardest part for me. But it&#8217;s the most fun because you get to be the most creative. And if all the roles are correct and if people have their wheelhouses that they&#8217;re entrusted to, that can go really smoothly. I&#8217;ve had it go really not smoothly too. So it just really depends on what kind of team you&#8217;re working with and how much everybody trusts each other. It&#8217;s really an exercise in trust I think as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I 100% agree with that. Just to go back to the example I talked about earlier with the magazine, the company sort of had an idea like, &#8220;We want to start a magazine.&#8221; But they didn&#8217;t know what they wanted to call it, what they wanted it to look like. They&#8217;re just like, &#8220;We want to start a magazine and we want to publish it in four months.&#8221; It&#8217;s like okay, so I&#8217;m building it from the ground up, like Khadijah on living single. I&#8217;m trying to build flavor.</p>
<p>And even the initial ideas we had for, it kept changing in that pre-production process to the point where it took us longer to eventually get the first issue out because there were like, &#8220;Well, we want the cover to be this, and we want to do this.&#8221;</p>
<p>And all this sort of stuff. And even getting the internal buy-in from people to write for the magazine, because initially they&#8217;re like, &#8220;We want community members to write.&#8221; And then they switched it and said, &#8220;We want employees to write.&#8221; And employees were like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not in my job description to write articles.&#8221; And it during the holidays and someone would write an article and then say, &#8220;I&#8217;m taking the rest of the month off for Christmas.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What? I need my edits. Where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
But I think that&#8217;s the whole thing too with understanding what your roles are supposed to be on the project. It was something I had mentioned because when that happens, when people were like, &#8220;But you can do this, right?&#8221; That&#8217;s when things can really start to get a little bit&#8230; Again, depends on the team that you&#8217;re working with. But if people were like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not in my job description. Why am I doing this?&#8221; Then it&#8217;s going to be really hard to make something that&#8217;s cohesive because all the lines are blurred. If you are not expecting that to already be the process. If you are to come into a studio with the idea that you&#8217;re going to probably wear a lot of hats, that&#8217;s probably fine. You&#8217;re more of a generalist. But if you&#8217;re not inclined to doing various different things, that&#8217;s going to be really difficult to get adjusted to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yes. Oh yes. And even most of the team that we had for the first issue, we kind of changed it up for the second issue. And I felt like okay, we&#8217;re getting on a really good rhythm with this. I&#8217;m excited about the third issue. We were in production getting it ready. And then they laid off the entire team and it&#8217;s like&#8230;</p>
<p>So to that point about working really hard on something, I was working hard on the third issue of the magazine and they laid us off. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, is the third issue even going to happen?&#8221; And the company&#8217;s like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; So disheartening would that happens. They claim that they&#8217;re going to release it maybe by the time that this interview goes out. They said that they&#8217;ll release it in December. I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re going to do that.</p>
<p>But also this has happened, and I don&#8217;t know if you maybe feel like this too, but sometimes you just have to take the L. I&#8217;m just sort of like, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s above me. I can&#8217;t do anything about it. Oh well.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
No, I have a lot of experience in that. Because a lot of those decisions that were made, we don&#8217;t have any control over as a development team. So we had to take the L a lot and not by choice.</p>
<p>I think an essential part of the creative process though sometimes is learning how to take that L. Because you can hammer it away at something and sometimes it&#8217;s really not meant to work. And I think the difference between if it&#8217;s meant to work or if it&#8217;s not meant to work is the amount of effort that you&#8217;re willing to put into it and the amount of effort that you have the budget to put into it, if the project is dependent on budget. But I think anything can be made. It&#8217;s just if it actually gets finished or not. But any art is not finished. You just say, &#8220;I&#8217;m done.&#8221; There&#8217;s no such thing as finished. You can work on anything for an infinite amount of time. But when you say, &#8220;I&#8217;m done,&#8221; that&#8217;s when the project is finished.</p>
<p>And so it&#8217;s just like people have to learn when walk away from something, and sometimes the effort is futile, and you have to accept that, and move on to something that is better. Because what you do is you take that learning that you got from that last project and you apply to something that could work.</p>
<p>And so taking the L is not always a bad thing, but it is a heartbreaking place you consider all the time that you put into it, and you consider that somebody could have seen this and enjoyed it. But ultimately, you take that experience to go to the next thing and hopefully that next thing can get made. Sometimes it never gets made and that&#8217;s really frustrating too, but it&#8217;s all a part of the process.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true. Very true. Let&#8217;s kind of switch gears here a little bit and learn more about you. I know that you&#8217;re here in Atlanta, but did you grow up here?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
No, I actually grew up in New Jersey. I was from a little town in South Jersey called Willingboro, New Jersey, where there was not really much going for it in terms of culture, or art, or anything. Yeah, that&#8217;s where I grew up. It was essentially right outside of Philadelphia where most of my family is. But yeah, my hometown is in Willingboro, New Jersey.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Were you exposed to a lot of design and artwork as a kid?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Actually, yes. So my dad used to be a fashion designer. He&#8217;s always been an electrical engineer for 35 years, but on the side he did fashion design. And I would sit with him as he was picking out his ties, and I would help color coordinate his ties because he was colorblind, which is pretty funny. And I was always really good with color.</p>
<p>But he also designed a lot of dresses, and he did fashion shows for people around the neighborhood and in Philadelphia. And I think that&#8217;s essentially how my mom and dad had met was because he used to be in that fashion industry in Philly. And so I would help him design some of his outfits too. And really getting to see him doing that process of drawing something, and then creating it, and bringing it to life was really inspiring for me.</p>
<p>But I had the inclination to draw ever since I could hold a pencil really. I was unstoppable. I&#8217;d draw on everything. The walls, on homework, just anything I could get my hands on. Because I had a very, very creative imagination. And I always had stories in my head, and I just desperately wanted to get them out. And watching cartoons, anime, Sailor Moon, Pokemon, all these ways that stories could come out was super inspiring for me. And I just wanted to make my own things that made me feel the way that those things make me feel. But my creativity was highly encouraged at home because my dad was creative. And my mom understood what it was like to be creative, even though she wasn&#8217;t a creative. My parents kind of made an effort to make sure that my talent was cultivated, and they enrolled me in art classes, and made sure that I wasn&#8217;t really tamped down.</p>
<p>Because I was a weird child. I was real weird. I grew up in a predominantly Black neighborhood, and I was very, very different than everybody else. And no one really understood me. Which was fine by me because I found my little corners to draw on. And I found a best friend when I was seven years old, who was also really creative. And so me and her would just spend all our time together just making crazy stories and characters, and bringing a lot of our stuff to life. So it was a very inspiring kind of childhood even though it wasn&#8217;t a very inspiring town or culture to grow up around, just because no one really understood what we were doing. But we forged on forward regardless of that fact. So that was really cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now eventually, you ended up going to college and studying illustration and animation first at Montclair State University. And then from there, you went to Savannah College of Art and Design. What was your time like at those schools?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Oh man, it was unlike anything I had ever experienced before. Because when I went to high school, it was a vocational school where they had career majors. And I was in the advertising, art, and design career major. So I really got to work with other artists then and start to dive into what it was like to kind of work as a professional, do a graphic design and doing illustration.</p>
<p>But at Montclair, I feel like that&#8217;s where I really started to understand myself as a person. Because for the first time, really for the first time, people started to accept my weirdness for what it was. Just this creative, artistic child. I guess not child anymore, but this person who just wanted to express themselves. And I was surrounded by all these people who really wanted to express themselves, and was fully accepted for that. Not just accepted, but appreciated for that. And I made some really amazing lifelong friends at Montclair. And I actually went to Montclair with my best friend, that same friend who I met when I was seven.</p>
<p>I really got to explore a lot of different areas in art, sculpture, and ceramics, and painting. I didn&#8217;t do photography, but a little bit of photography and graphic design. And got to see what all these different areas in art had to offer and be very tactile with art. Because I was doing digital for a lot of the time in high school. And so that was a really great learning experience.</p>
<p>But the problem was, is that I was really interested in animation. The aforementioned shows that I used to love to watch. I thought I always thought I was going to be an animator in some regard, but Montclair didn&#8217;t really have an animation program flushed out yet because they just started their animation curriculum. And so when I went there, I was hoping that I could learn about animation and that was kind of opposite from the case. So I ended up rerouting my course and going full into illustration instead.</p>
<p>And so when I was a senior in college, SCAD, Savannah College of Art Design had come to North Jersey to do a kind of seminar about what the school entailed, and they gave me a brochure. And when I read that brochure, I saw that they had all these different majors like sequential art, which was comic books and illustration. And animation and game design. And they were like, &#8220;As a part of our sequential art program, you get to go to Japan for two weeks and you get to learn about the studios that are in Japan.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Well, this is everything I wanted to do in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I remember that there was a London trip that I could have gone to that I chose not to because I wanted to work on my portfolio to apply and get into SCAD. And so I spent those full two weeks just heads down and making art for that because I really, really wanted to get in. And so after I graduated that next year, I applied for SCAD and got into their grad program for illustration. And that was a really crazy experience as well. Yeah, I really wanted to go for that because I think that even though Montclair gave me so much in terms of personal growth, I really wanted that professional side of things too, because I was starting to get more focused in terms of what I wanted to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I would imagine it was probably just a different city environment too. Montclair State University of New Jersey is going to be a lot different than Savannah College of Art and Design. You went to the Atlanta campus, right?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
No, I actually went to Savannah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, you went to Savannah campus. Okay. So I would imagine even just the creative community around you was different because it inspired you in different ways.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
So Montclair was interesting, because everybody was really talented there. But I felt like I was very on par with the high ceiling of talent. I was like, &#8220;Okay, I can run with most of these people. This feels good.&#8221; There was some people who were above and beyond for sure. But I still felt like a fairly big fish in a medium pond. I know it sounds cocky to say, but that&#8217;s really how it was. And I think a lot of us felt that way. When I went to SCAD, I was a really little fish in a really big pond, and was surrounded by incredible talent. And all of my friends were just rock stars, and people who could make some amazing things like crazy illustrators. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think SCAD told you anything because you were naturally this gifted. There&#8217;s no way anybody could have given you this. You&#8217;re amazing.&#8221; And animators who I was like, &#8220;They&#8217;re destined to work at Disney and Pixar. They&#8217;re just crazy good.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so the fact that I was suddenly surrounded by a high ceiling of talent, a space high ceiling of talent. It was both really inspiring and really intimidating. I actually kind of went through a little bit of an artistic crisis when I went to SCAD because I started to try to make work that was everybody else that was in the illustration curriculum. And I didn&#8217;t really have a well-developed personal voice when I was at SCAD because I kind of rerouted myself to try to fit into the mold, fit into what I thought people had expected of me.</p>
<p>But when I went over to animation, my first year, I was solely really in the illustration department and really just learned from all my peers there and my friends there. But two of my really good friend, my best friends came to SCAD the year after I joined scad. And so they were animation majors and I hung out in a mission building a lot more. Which the ammunition building is a renovated coffin factory with no windows, which is really funny. It&#8217;s also open 24 hours, sorry SCAD Savannah.</p>
<p>But it was an environment where we all were really heads down and worked really hard on our projects. And it was the first time that I really got to experience collaboration at school as well, because illustration is a very independently focused type of field.<br>
Animation relies on a team. And not every student opted to do this, but some students built teams of up to 60 people that were full scale productions. They had actual producers. They had storyboard artists, and layout artists, and background artists, animators, compositors, 3D modelers. They had everything. And they ran it just like you would when you were in the industry, which I would find out later.</p>
<p>But when I would go into animation and work on my illustrated projects, people would come recruit me. They were like, &#8220;We like the work you&#8217;re doing? Come work on my film. You want to do character design for my film?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Yeah, sure. That sounds like fun.&#8221; And I got to meet a lot of people that way, but I also got to learn a lot about how the industry actually ran and how it functioned. And so I feel like that experience out of anything, because it wasn&#8217;t even a class I was taking. It was just extra stuff that I was doing outside of my classes. That taught me the most I think about what it looked like to actually work as a professional in the field.</p>
<p>And then I also did the Japan trip that was aforementioned in that brochure. I went to that Japan trip, and that was amazing too. So I got to meet a lot of friends, I got to go to Japan, I got to see animation studios up close. And that was just a really incredible experience. So SCAD gave me a lot. It&#8217;s also a very expensive school, so I can&#8217;t recommend it to everybody. But it really taught me a lot about what it looked like to work in the field. But also just that networking that I got from SCAD in particular was very, very valuable. Because a lot of those people cropped up in the future, and still are lifelong friends today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. And I&#8217;ve heard that SCAD has a really robust alumni program too, just in terms of not just the people who went there of course as alumni, but getting in touch for other opportunities and things like that. I&#8217;ve heard SCAD is really good about that.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Oh yeah, they&#8217;re really good about it. But I haven&#8217;t even tapped into the surface of those alumni programs yet. I have done their alumni Gaming Fest and Animation Fest, and I&#8217;ve done the alumni panels on that and talked about my experiences as a professional to the students.</p>
<p>And I actually had applied to teach SCAD. And this summer, I mentioned at the start of the episode that I had just went back to Atlanta. I had lost my job. And I knew that even before I had lost my job, I wanted to go teach eventually at SCAD Atlanta. It&#8217;s funny because they actually got back to me right after I got hired at Wizards so it was too late. I was like, &#8220;No, you got me just too late.&#8221; But yeah, that environment is like nothing else like that. Very creative, just very focused. And it reminds me why I love art so much, just being around students and being around all that creativity.</p>
<p>I felt the happiest at SCAD because really when you&#8217;re a student, you&#8217;re in a bubble. And you&#8217;re in a bubble of all this creativity and all this positivity. And so as an alumni, I do want to tap back into that, and find those resources, and meet my fellow alumni who are tapping into those programs too. But yeah, ultimately I also want to go back and teach, because you can take classes too, and I just want to learn more.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you mentioned that part of the SCAD experience in terms of how they set up working on projects and things like that was very similar to how it was in the industry. So once you graduated from SCAD and you got out there in the field, you were working for Floyd County Productions. That was sort of right after SCAD?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Yes. So after I graduated SCAD, I opt to stay in the city because I didn&#8217;t want to go back to New Jersey. I love my family a lot, and they&#8217;re awesome people. But the environment of Jersey is not a creative environment at all. And I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I want to go back to Jersey where I&#8217;m leaving all these people and all this creativity. I want to really build my portfolio and cultivate my professional appearance, and what I&#8217;m going to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I stayed in the city at Savannah, which is an awesome city by the way. Everybody should visit it. And really got to hang out with my friends and develop my portfolio. And I started to post on various different freelance websites and got a few small freelance projects as well. But because I had put my portfolio on all these websites, I was also noticed by a background director at Floyd County Productions, which is a studio that makes Archer in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p>The manager had reached out to me and she said that, &#8220;Hey, I saw your work on freelance.com. I really like what you do. We would like you to take an art test for us and I want to see if you would be good to work as a background artist here.&#8221; And I was just like, &#8220;What?&#8221; My mind was blown. Because I didn&#8217;t know what I was going to do after I graduated. It&#8217;s weird because I didn&#8217;t remember having a bunch of anxiety around it, but I also just did not know what I was going to end up doing. I thought I just needed to develop more skills. But I was really fortunate to be able to get that email.</p>
<p>So she sent me an art test. It was a 24 hours to work on this art test. I took that to mean you do this art test in 24 hours right now. I used all 24 hours at this time too. I made sure that that thing was bomb. And it&#8217;s funny because it was like you had to treat a background like a bomb went off in it. It was already painted and then you had to really mess it up. And so I had a lot of fun doing that. I got critiqued from my friends and made sure that it was looking good, and submitted it. And I was like, &#8220;Okay, I hope I did a good enough job. I hope I did it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And also, I was going to have a trip over to Atlanta for Dragon Con. So that still happened to fall around that same time. And so I messaged her all shyly and I was like, &#8220;Hey, I might be in town in two weeks. So is it okay if I visit the studio too?&#8221; I didn&#8217;t want to say it was Dragon Con because I didn&#8217;t know if that was acceptable or not. And she messaged me back and she was like, &#8220;You&#8217;re going for Dragon Con. Yeah sure, absolutely. You can come to the studio.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was such a little baby. It was really funny to think about me around that time because I just did not know. Because as soon as I walked into that studio environment when I got to visit, I was like, &#8220;This looks like just all of my classmates. This feels like college again.&#8221; Because everybody had toys on their desk, and everybody was really cool. And everybody was again, creative.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re a student, you think that professionals are this different breed of people. You think that they&#8217;re on this elevated, very buttoned up on this pedestal. And we&#8217;re really not. We&#8217;re so not. We&#8217;re not corporate, we&#8217;re artists. And it&#8217;s just like working with artists that you would work with as a student. We&#8217;re all creative and we&#8217;re all nerdy. We all have our own interests that we nerd out about and geek out about, and we get really obsessed about certain things. And so everybody really had that just laid back, chill kind of personality. And so it was very easy to get along with everybody because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m out of my element actually at all. This feels like SCAD.&#8221; And so I ended up getting hired after that trip two weeks later. And packed all my stuff, moved over to Atlanta, and found that the animation production cycle was exactly like how it was on films that I worked on at SCAD, where everybody had their different roles, there were different departments. It was a really collaborative environment there as well. And you had your team. That&#8217;s how I got over to Floyd County.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean it sounds fun. Even the environment that you mentioned, like working with all those artists and creatives is fun. I&#8217;ve mostly been a creative at tech startups. Not fun. They&#8217;re not fun. I mean if you want to nerd out about code or whatever, which I don&#8217;t really care about. But I remember I worked at one startup, and we would have our weekly all hands. And I mean these nerds would just go in on code for two hours straight. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I have work to do.&#8221; And they&#8217;re excited about it talking about containers and frameworks and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I have work to do.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m still looking to for that working with creatives experience like that, because it sounds like it would be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>When you look back at your experiences with studios though, I would imagine it probably wasn&#8217;t all fun. I mean after Floyd County Productions, you worked for four years at EA Mobile. You worked for two years at Zynga. What were those experiences like?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, I can get into those. But first I just want to address something too. It was definitely fun to be able to work in that creative environment with a bunch of creative peers, but it&#8217;s still work and you still have to show up and do the work. So after a while you&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Oh man, I&#8217;ve been working on the same background for two weeks now. I just really want to move on.&#8221;</p>
<p>And also the hours can be a lot because you&#8217;re in animation. You&#8217;re in a strict production cycle, especially for TV. And so sometimes, I think I&#8217;d worked once up to 80 hours one week. So it can be crazy. Yeah, I know. So that part&#8217;s not fun. It was my first experience becoming a lead, and a manager, and a director. Because I was promoted to background director shortly before I had left Floyd. I really wanted to protect my team from a lot of the brunt of that work, of the editing and of the long hours. And so I took on a lot of that myself with my lead. And that was a lot.</p>
<p>Then also after a season ends, you go on hiatus, which is basically laid off for about two or three months, which can happen in a lot of animation studios. And so you had to understand how to fend for yourself too during that time. And so it was really fun to work in an environment like that, but it can also be very stressful. And so that&#8217;s something to consider as well. I don&#8217;t want to sugarcoat what it&#8217;s like to work in animation, because there&#8217;s definitely drawbacks to certain studios and certain environments. Other studios that have union, you don&#8217;t have to deal with that as much. But I&#8217;ve never worked under a union studio before, so I can&#8217;t speak to that as well. But it&#8217;s just something to look out for and something that people have to determine whether or not they want to go into.</p>
<p>I felt like I could handle it because I was young. I can&#8217;t handle that now. I&#8217;m too old for that. I really can&#8217;t. But back then I had the stamina to deal with it, but there was also burnout. And so I was kind of thankful for hiatus because it was an opportunity to really recharge my batteries and do personal work as well. Because when I was working full-time, I couldn&#8217;t really dedicate that much time to personal work. So there&#8217;s definitely a lot of give and take.</p>
<p>I will say I do miss the people and I miss the kind of work that I did. Because when I went over to EA, it was my first time going into game development. I decided to leave animation just because I was ready to explore something new. My friend told me, he went over to EA a year prior and he told me how the environment was, and what they were working on, and that I would be a good fit.<br>
And so when I interviewed there, I realized that the experience was very parallel to what I was already doing in animation. And so I was like, &#8220;Okay, I think maybe I don&#8217;t fill all the qualifications for this, but I fit most of them. And I might as well go for it anyway.&#8221; And ended up getting hired at EA.</p>
<p>So I left Atlanta, which I was really sad about. I was not ready to leave Atlanta. I loved the city, and that&#8217;s why I came back. I realized that I&#8217;d fallen in love with it right before I left. So I was like, &#8220;Oh no.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I went over to Austin and Austin is also really cool, but it was a lot of change as well. I went over to EA, which was so much more of a corporate environment. Because EA is a huge studio and it has a lot of systems in place, and process in place, and a lot of very clear defined roles, and clear defined things that you&#8217;re supposed to do. And you can&#8217;t say everything that you used to say in a very informal environment like an animation, and you have to make sure that you&#8217;re careful about following all the rules. And so it was an interesting adjustment. It was a bit of a culture shock at first, but I found that I could roll with that as well.</p>
<p>Also, the people that I worked with too. Again, really awesome people. Gaming nerds, which I am also a gaming nerd. But like you were saying about your tech startup, it&#8217;s a lot more technical. And so there were a lot of things at first that really went over my head. I didn&#8217;t know what Scrum was. I was like, &#8220;What is agile? What is code base? What is all this stuff?&#8221; Working in an engine for the first time, and understanding that you had to make art a certain way to fit into the engine, and you had to optimize stuff. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What is all this integration?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What does all this mean? I don&#8217;t know what any of this means.&#8221; But I learned all of that probably within the course of three months. And just letting you know, even what I learned is different from game to game. So a lot of that experience can translate and a lot of it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I was really determined to do a good job at EA and to really work hard because I was a senior and lead environment artist. And so I had people to manage as well. And so I was learning a lot, and they were teaching me a lot about the process as well. But I really loved working with my fellow artists and my team.</p>
<p>And the games that we were working on, I can&#8217;t talk about the first game that we worked on, but we started working on The Simpsons Tapped Out shortly after, which was a live service mobile game that had been out for a while. And so being able to meet the people who had made the game and then understanding what it took to make a live service and talking to a licensor for the first time. That was just a lot of new learning experiences.</p>
<p>But it was also the first time where I really started to see the disparity of the industry, and the fact that it wasn&#8217;t very diverse. I started to really feel that in the city of Austin in general, and my environment reflected that. And I was working in Atlanta. So before, it was a very diverse place. And now I was like, &#8220;I feel at times, very isolated.&#8221; And I wanted to work to change that.</p>
<p>So I think at EA is really where I started to develop my professional voice as well as my sense for advocacy, and really started to want to actively work to make change in the game industry. Because I wanted to see more people who look like me, doing what I was doing.</p>
<p>Because I felt very fortunate, but I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m that special. I feel like everybody can do what I&#8217;m doing if they really work towards it, and they really go for it. I feel like again, I&#8217;ve been fortunate to be able to get these opportunities and to be able to make these friends. But I wanted to start teaching people how to get to where I was.</p>
<p>So what EA has are things called employee resource groups where there&#8217;re groups to advocate for a certain underrepresented group of people. So there was a pride one, there was a Latin one, there was a Black one. And there was a disabilities one as well. There wasn&#8217;t an Austin chapter of the Black ERG. And so I started it with a few coworkers. And we made a Black EA Team Austin, BEAT Austin, and started to do advocacy work around the city, around the industry. And that&#8217;s when I really started to do mentorships and started to do work like this where I actively did panels at Dragon Con and other conventions, and started to really talk about my experiences and be visible as one of the people who was a leader in the industry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How did that experience go?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
It was really interesting. Because at first, I felt very shy. I said this story on a SCAD panel, but I feel like I started my end career very quiet because I was a Black woman, and now I&#8217;m leading it loud because I&#8217;m a Black woman. Because I really had the sense that people didn&#8217;t quite know how to handle me. One of my managers had told me that he felt intimidated by me. And I feel like I&#8217;m the opposite of an intimidating person. I&#8217;m a very huggy, affectionate, just dorky person. And the fact that he felt intimidated by me, I was like, &#8220;It&#8217;s probably because I&#8217;m Black.&#8221;</p>
<p>But also, if I am going to have somebody feel intimidated by me and he expects me to be intimidating, then I&#8217;m just going to be intimidating and ask all the questions that I really want to ask, and start saying the things that maybe I wouldn&#8217;t have said if I was feeling a little shyer. Because with that intimidation, I was like, &#8220;He must respect me a little bit too. So maybe I can just say some things.&#8221; And in a professional way always, of course. But maybe I can start to speak my mind a little bit more and start to talk about the things that I&#8217;m observing. And I started to do that. And it was actually well received.</p>
<p>And so that experience was really enlightening for me because I was like, &#8220;I actually have a voice now.&#8221; At Floyd, I was a young creative. I just started, so I didn&#8217;t really want to express myself. I didn&#8217;t really want to be a contrarian, because I was just afraid of what people would say. I just didn&#8217;t have the confidence yet. I started to build the confidence at EA and started to really start to call people out and, &#8220;Hey, why are we not thinking about these things? Why are we not thinking about what this Black character is doing or saying, or the fact that we&#8217;re even having Black characters in this game?&#8221;</p>
<p>The designer that I started doing the ERG with, we used to do a Valentine&#8217;s event for Tapped Out every February. And he was like, &#8220;This time we should do a Black history event.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;We should do a Black history event. Let&#8217;s do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so things like that are things that I would&#8217;ve never thought to advocate for when I was working in animation. And I really started to advocate for it and started to really gain my identity too as a Black creative, when I started in the game industry. And it felt very empowering. And I really felt like I could really use my voice, because there were so few people who looked like me. There were no other Black female game developers at the time I was working at EA. And also when I moved on to Zynga four years later, there was still no other Black female game devs except for, I think there was the VP art director, which was really cool to see a woman like that in management and leadership. But that was the first time I had really seen someone like that. And it shouldn&#8217;t have taken that long. It shouldn&#8217;t have taken five years for me to see that. So I really wanted to work to change it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, good on you for really stepping into that. Stepping into that sort of, I guess vacancy that you saw. And being an advocate not just for yourself, but for other Black people, Black women particularly in the industry.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
It wasn&#8217;t easy because I also had to deal with people not understanding why things were important, not understanding why I prioritized the stuff. I didn&#8217;t let it get in the way of my workload. But we actually started to advocate at EA for all of our advocacy work and all of the things that we were doing to actually count towards our year end reviews and performance, and to be an actual positive mark. And so it actually became a company mandate. Through all of our being vocal, it became a company mandate for ERG work to be considered as a part of our performance review. And so it encouraged more people to join ERGs, and more people to advocate. And I think that it ultimately funneled up to become something really positive.</p>
<p>And so it worked in spite of any pushback that I got and any misunderstanding that it received, because then the company started to really back it. And that was really, really rewarding. So I feel really grateful to have a voice that was respected and had been a part of that change. But I still want to continue to do that in my work at Wizards as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What gives you purpose to keep doing the work that you do? What is it that keeps you empowered and motivated?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
I think when I was talking to a student at an event that I was doing, this was when I was still at EA. I was talking to him and he was like, &#8220;These are the things that I&#8217;m interested in, but I don&#8217;t know if I even fit in the game industry or where I could go.&#8221; And he was like, &#8220;I really like engineering, but I also like doing art.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I told him, I was like, &#8220;Hey you know, there&#8217;s a whole field just for you called tech art, where you get to be an engineer for artists.&#8221; And to see his eyes light up in that moment was the takeaway for me, because I got to help somebody realize that there&#8217;s space for them in the industry, and that there&#8217;s somewhere that they can fit. And so something that I love to do is to see, and mentor people, and give them reviews and give them advice. And then see them sometime later, actually break into the industry and do the job that they always wanted to do.</p>
<p>So being an influence for people to go for something that they would not have previously thought they could go for is such a rewarding experience for me to be able to give somebody that, because I feel like I&#8217;ve been really fortunate in the people who have supported me, and my parents being a support for me, but also my friends standing by me and advocating for me, recommending me to these things. I wanted to be able to provide that helping hand for other people. I wanted to be able to give back. And so that&#8217;s what really keeps me motivated is to be able to give back and see it really come to fruition.</p>
<p>But I also really want to make a more diverse game industry. I grew up playing games where very few people in those games look like me. And the more people we have behind the scenes making these games, the more diverse it&#8217;s going to get, and the more inclusive it&#8217;s going to become. And then the more accessible games will be for people who look like me. And so maybe we won&#8217;t think of it as an impossibility once we start to see faces to these games, and see people on the stage talking about what their experiences were making these games. And I think eventually, we will start to see that more and more. We&#8217;re already seeing it more and more.<br>
So if I can get at least one Black person in the industry, or one Black woman in the industry, or somebody who didn&#8217;t believe in themselves to believe in themselves to do it, then I&#8217;ll have succeeded at my job. And I think it&#8217;s already happened a few times, so I feel like I&#8217;ve succeeded at my job. But I want to keep that going. Because I really believe that paying it forward is really our step to a better future in gaming, but just in the world in general. So I want to be a part of that change.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And speaking of paying it forward, I have to bring this up that you&#8217;re also a podcaster as well. You have a show called Painted in Color. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. So we started Painted in Color in 2020. And previously, I kind of always wanted to start some kind of YouTube show or podcast, but I was always too afraid to do it or I was like, &#8220;What could I say that anybody would even listen to?&#8221; But after doing all that advocacy work in the game industry, I realized that I do have a point of view that people don&#8217;t get to hear that much. And so I really wanted to take the opportunity to share that.</p>
<p>Around the time we started Painted in Color, this is in 2020 right after the protests were happening. And people started to really take notice for the first time, some for the first time that Black game devs, or Black animators, or Black creatives in the industry were really not getting their dues. Started to really reach out with different opportunities. But I found myself both feeling pleased at this, but also frustrated that it took this long. And there was also a show that I was on, like a podcast. I&#8217;m not going to mention them by name, but they had run for six years, and I was only the third Black person on the show. Yeah, I know right?</p>
<p>And they interview people all the time. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Why did it take this long?&#8221; I actually called them out on the show about this too. It was live, so they couldn&#8217;t do anything about it. It was something that really needed to be called out. But I really thought about that and took it to heart. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Why was it that I was only the third Black person on the show?&#8221; There are so many Black creatives out there, and so many people who have great stories, and people who are highly talented, who haven&#8217;t really gotten a platform to share it.</p>
<p>And so when all these things were happening, we had a female fantastic art group about fantasy art. Somebody was talking about, &#8220;We want shows that are really uplifting, like women, and minorities, and creatives.&#8221; And I commented in that post saying that I really wanted to start something like that. And one of my friends who I had met at a convention had also commented on that post saying that she wanted to start something like that. Until she reached out to me on Facebook and said, &#8220;Hey, I saw that you commented that you wanted to start a show. Do you want to start a show together?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Heck yes I want to start a show together. That sounds awesome.&#8221;</p>
<p>So we started it with Esther Wu, Mia Araujo, and ended up pulling Eric Wilkerson, who&#8217;s also a fantasy artist, amazing painter, into our show. But we wanted to make a show that was dedicated to uplifting underrepresented artists in the industry. And we wanted to tell their stories, and interview them, and really get them to talk about the true experiences of what it was like to be an artist. We didn&#8217;t want to run it like a typical art podcast where people tell you, &#8220;You have to do this to succeed. You have to be like this.&#8221; Because it often comes from a white male perspective, and that&#8217;s not everybody&#8217;s perspective. And people can also feel very down on themselves when they can&#8217;t do all the things that people are prescribing them.</p>
<p>So we wanted to talk about all of our nuanced perspectives, and we ended up talking about a lot of mental health aspects as well. Because we were all going through it. Obviously it was the pandemic. It was a really hard time mental health wise for each of us and everybody. And it kind of ended up becoming that too organically, even though that wasn&#8217;t a part of the goal. But I&#8217;m happy that it became a part of the show, because it really showed a perspective from professionals that were still struggling in some kind of way. So we wanted to talk about our struggles and talk about how we were working to gain better mindsets around those struggles, and better perspectives around it. And a lot of the artists that came on our show also talked about those perspectives as well. And we got to hear about so many different journeys, and it was so inspiring to be able to get their sensibility and how they learn and grow. And so we started in 2020 at LightBox Expo Virtual. We had a panel discussion about what it was like to be a creative in the industry as an underrepresented group.</p>
<p>And we kept going from there. So we air biweekly on Mondays. We&#8217;ve been doing it for two years now. We&#8217;re about to air an interview soon with somebody amazing named Michael Uwandi, who started something similar, 9B Collective, which is a creative group over in LA that employs underrepresented artists and Black artists who work in the film industry, which is really awesome. We got a chance to really start to exercise that voice and grow our presence over time. And it&#8217;s been really, really fun and rewarding, and super inspiring. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m currently continuing to do now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I&#8217;ve definitely checked out the podcast, and I&#8217;ll make sure that we put a link to it also in the show notes. I know 100% that feeling of being on a show that has not had a lot of Black guests, and you ask them. And then there&#8217;s all this hemming and hawing and, &#8220;Well, we tried.&#8221; Yeah. Okay, sure.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
A lot of the excuses too from recruiters as well and from shows is, &#8220;We don&#8217;t know where to find them. It doesn&#8217;t seem like there&#8217;s that many of them.&#8221; There are a myriad of us. We are everywhere. It&#8217;s really sad what&#8217;s going on with Twitter right now, because Twitter was actually how a lot of places had found me to interview me. I didn&#8217;t an article with Apple on the App Store. And so when people opened the app store, they saw my face. And that was because of Twitter, because there&#8217;s hashtags called drawing while Black, Black and gaming, I am POC and play. All these hashtags that really elevate the presence of underrepresented artists and minorities in the industry. And I hope that we don&#8217;t lose that platform because that was a really big presence for us. And so it&#8217;s a shame that has happened, because it was proof that we were out there. And we were present in droves, and a lot of really amazing talent too.</p>
<p>And so that excuse was really invalid. It was just because companies and people didn&#8217;t want to put the effort forward to look in different spaces than they were used to looking. If your spaces are only netting a certain kind of artist, then you probably need to change up the spaces that you&#8217;re looking in.</p>
<p>So I really want to emphasize that a lot in the show and as well as all the panels that I do, because I really do think it&#8217;s a matter of effort. There&#8217;s a lot of excuses that go around about it, and people, they&#8217;re not used to making that effort.<br>
And we&#8217;ve had to make that effort for years. We&#8217;ve had to code switch, we&#8217;ve had to be twice as good, four times as good in order to get into the industry. So if people don&#8217;t want to make that effort, it&#8217;s time to start now. Because we&#8217;ve been doing that for a long time, and we know what it&#8217;s like to go above and beyond constantly. So we would like to be met halfway a little bit please.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Listen, I did a whole presentation called Where Are the Black Designers in 2015. Because so many companies were asking me that. They had found out about the show, and they would be like, &#8220;Where are you finding all these people?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;On LinkedIn, on Twitter. I&#8217;m just reaching out and talking to them. Are you not doing the same things? My melanin doesn&#8217;t grant me any special search powers. I don&#8217;t have Black spidey sense or whatever. I&#8217;m just talking to people. Are you not talking to people?&#8221; And they&#8217;re not. They&#8217;re not putting forth even the baseline amount of effort.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
The minimum amount of effort. Yeah, and my LinkedIn started to also get very diverse because I just started to follow more people who were talking about these things. And that&#8217;s really what you have to do. When you follow people who discuss these issues, people who are in the industry will respond and comment. It&#8217;s very easy, in fact, to find these people. Just follow a few DEI experts on LinkedIn to start with if people are listening to this and wondering how. Follow people like Crystle Johnson who talks about DEI issues in the industry all the time. And people will comment and say like, &#8220;Hey, this is what my experiences are.&#8221; People share their stories in these LinkedIn posts. And so that&#8217;s a great way to start finding more Black talent and Black creatives. Or maybe make a post yourself and be like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m doing a search for Black creatives. I just want people to comment and see who I find.&#8221; I&#8217;ve just done that on Twitter as well.</p>
<p>I do several times a year when these hashtags start to go around. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hey, drop your portfolio in the comments. I would love to be able to follow these artists, and be able to follow you, and see what you&#8217;re creating.&#8221; So there&#8217;s so many different ways, like the hashtags I dropped earlier, so many different ways to find Black creatives or just creatives of color, diverse talent, underrepresented artists, people with disabilities. Any group that you&#8217;re looking for, you will find them. We are around, and we talk about these things all the time. So it really, really isn&#8217;t that hard. You just have to know where to look. You just have to do some research, find places to look. And then you&#8217;ll start to open up your dashboards and broaden them. And you&#8217;ll learn something along the way too. So please do that. Cannot tell you how many times I&#8217;ve had to tell people this, too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What have you learned along the way from the podcast? What has it taught you?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
I can&#8217;t even go into all the things that it&#8217;s taught me. But I think one of the most important things that it&#8217;s taught me to be curious. Always be curious about learning something new, and growing, and being self-aware of who you are, and what it is like to work in your own mind, and how to work with yourself to be the best you.</p>
<p>Because again, a lot of shows will talk about, &#8220;Here&#8217;s what you have to do to be successful.&#8221; But if being successful means that you have to get up in the morning every day at 8:00 AM and you know you&#8217;re not a morning person, you&#8217;re not going to do that. You&#8217;re forcing yourself to do something that you hate doing. So what do you do instead? If you&#8217;re a night owl, then maybe do the bulk of your work at night where you know that your brain is awake during, and that you work with your own body. You know you get bored about working out? Then maybe switch up your routine every now and again. The fact that you&#8217;ve fallen off of a routine is not a failure. You just need something new to mix it up.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same way with any kind of aspect. Know yourself and work with yourself to be your definition of success, because success means something different for every single person. You can&#8217;t follow one set prescription of success. And so work with yourself the way you need to in order to get to your brand of success. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve learned about the show the most, because every single person who&#8217;s started to do the things that really make them happy has followed not the rules of society, but their own rules of how they best function and what makes them happy. And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve taken away the most from the show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How have you worked to stay your authentic self throughout your career? I get this very strong sense of one, I think determination. But also, it&#8217;s coming from a very earnest place. It&#8217;s not grand-standing or anything like that. It&#8217;s coming from a real, genuine place. How have you worked to keep that authenticity?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
I learned not to compromise myself anymore. Not just in my art, but just personally as well. If there is something that I feel very strongly about, I know automatically that it is not for me, or it is for me. And I pursue it, or I reject it however I need to. But I&#8217;ve learned that the person who I am will attract the people who I want in my life. And compromising myself and being inauthentic is going to bring around the wrong people that I don&#8217;t want to be involved with.</p>
<p>And even though I&#8217;m an introvert, I thrive around people who understand me. And in order to be understood, I have to share myself. And I have to really share who I am as a person, not just a veneer of myself. And so I think that&#8217;s what keeps me authentic, because being authentic just makes me happier. And sharing my point of view makes me really understand who I am. even more.<br>
So I have a little anecdote. There was a convention called Gen Con that it was a prestigious convention. And they had amazing fantasy artists that had been in the industry for 20, 30 years. And I got in somehow. Somehow.</p>
<p>And I was so intimidated by this convention. I was just like, &#8220;Oh my God, I don&#8217;t have art that looks like anybody else&#8217;s. What am I going to do? I don&#8217;t know what to create.&#8221; And I psyched myself out so hard that I didn&#8217;t make any new work for this con, and I was meant to sell my artwork there.</p>
<p>And the last few weeks before this convention had started, I was like, &#8220;Oh my God, I haven&#8217;t made anything. What do I do?&#8221; And I was like okay. I had a moment with myself. I was like, &#8220;I got in not because of what other artists looked like, but because what my art looked like. They accepted me for me. So why would I not make anything that looks like me? Why would I want to make anything that looks like anybody else&#8217;s, if they asked me to be in the show for what my portfolio looked like?&#8221;<br>
And so what I ended up doing was making the most self-indulgent piece ever, which was the Mushroom Queen piece that&#8217;s on my website if anybody wants to look at it. But it was just fully 100% my authentic viewpoint. And I was like okay. I went to the show. I set it up. I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen, but it&#8217;s going to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that was by far my best show that I had ever done. I&#8217;d been doing conventions for about 10 years at this point, and it was the most successful, the most positive experience ever. And that piece that I made was the most sold print. I sold out of that print. And it went to show me that being authentic is really what is going to get me that far. Because people are there for my voice, and so my voice I will give them. And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m authentic. That&#8217;s why I try to be authentic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have a dream project or something that you&#8217;d love to do one day?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s so many things that I want to do. I am ADHD, and so I want to bounce around between many different things. But what I&#8217;ve always wanted to do is make a video game, and an animated pitch, and a comic, and a graphic novel, and an art book, and a tarot card deck. So I have so many different dream projects.</p>
<p>Because I think the thing about dream projects is that once you&#8217;re done, you have to find a new dream. And so I have several dreams, and I want to pursue each of them one by one. And so the tarot deck is coming first. I&#8217;m going to be making a deck called the Avant Garden, which it&#8217;s a part of the Mushroom Queen series and the Rose Queen that I&#8217;ve made. They&#8217;re all different plant queens that have their own gardens. And I want to make a full deck based off of those, that project.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I want to do first. I would really love to make a small game with a small team. But something that is meaningful, and special, and beautiful. And many different stories I have in my head. So I want to just work towards each of these different goals as I go forward in my journey as an artist. But I have several dream projects that that I want to work on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? I feel like there&#8217;s this sort of wellspring of creativity that you could really just dive into.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s so much that wants to get out of my head, and I really just think it&#8217;s in the doing. But with the podcast Painted in Color, I really want to create it as a community in the future, and start to do live events, and start to have art retreats, and create classes around the podcast so that it&#8217;s an actual active learning experience for students. Where a lot of the people who are on the show can mentor and we can mentor as well. And really create something that is a positive environment that starts to cultivate talent of color and underrepresented talent for the industry.</p>
<p>I also would love to eventually start my own studio. I would like to say at Wizards for a good while, but eventually my old hermit plan is to start my own studio and to draw together a bunch of wonderful people who I&#8217;ve worked with in the past who I know are amazing and are good people. And start to create products that really inspire and uplift the next generation of gamers or animators in the industry. So that&#8217;s where I start to see myself. But in the next five years, I really want to make my podcast a really good, strong network, and a strong presence in the industry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work, your artwork and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve tried to make it as easy as possible. So I have a Linktree. Everywhere online is LAB illustration. Labillustration, that&#8217;s my initials, Lauren Brown. And so labillustration on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Patreon, Etsy. I have an Etsy store. Everywhere you can find me, it&#8217;s labillustration. I have a Linktree to make that easier. So it&#8217;s linktr.ee/labillustration. That&#8217;s where you can find all of my links.</p>
<p>Painted in Color is on YouTube currently. We&#8217;re looking to expand it soon, but right now it&#8217;s only on YouTube. And that is youtube.com/c/paintedincolor. And so that&#8217;s where our channel is. And so that&#8217;s mainly where you can find me. So I hope that you do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hope people do too. Sounds good. Lauren Brown, thank you so, so much for coming on the show. Thank you for just really sharing your story of being a Black woman in illustration, in art direction, and sort of giving I think a really good behind the scenes look at what it looks like to not just be in this industry, but also to be an advocate for underrepresented voices in the industry. I mean, you&#8217;re doing that not just in the media you&#8217;re making, but also with your podcast. I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing what you do in the next five years. I&#8217;m definitely going to keep an eye out. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate this, Maurice.</p>

<p>We all know there are several ways to achieve success as a creative, but sometimes it takes inspiration from others to set you on the right path. That&#8217;s definitely the case with the multitalented TTK. His work as an art director, painter, designer and illustrator have taken him far, and now he can add another title to his roster &#8212; filmmaker!</p>
<p>Our conversation began with a quick year-end check-in, and then TTK talked about <a href="https://www.justlikeme-havas.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">&#8220;Just Like Me&#8221;</a>, a short documentary he created with Havas to educate and inspire the next generation of Black creatives. TTK also shared more details of his life story, including growing up in Florida, serving in the Navy for 10 years after going to art school, and more. Hopefully TTK&#8217;s story and documentary can help inspire you to rise to greater heights!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
My name is TTK. What I do, I&#8217;m an artist, I&#8217;m a designer. Currently, I work in advertising. I&#8217;m a director, I&#8217;m a painter. I wear a few hats.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has the year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
The year&#8217;s been good for me so far, man, the year&#8217;s been very, very good. How I measure if the year is doing good, I measure if I&#8217;m doing something this year that I didn&#8217;t do the previous year or if I accomplished something this year that I didn&#8217;t in the previous year, that determines for me whether it&#8217;s good or not. We&#8217;re going into the fourth quarter right now, so the accomplishments and what I&#8217;ve accomplished so far in this year, I&#8217;m really proud of myself. I took a few punches, but that&#8217;s life right there. I hop back up and take it on the chin and take it as a lesson learned. But all in all, this year&#8217;s good for me. It&#8217;s been going great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything in particular that you still want to try to do before the year ends?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Paint more. A friend of mine jokes and it says once I learned how to do digital work, it made me lazy with painting. And I don&#8217;t want to admit it, but he is right because painting is a process. Well, everything is a process, but whenever you&#8217;re painting, you got to wait for the paint to dry, come back to it and work into it some more, then work into it some more. It takes much longer.</p>
<p>And you would think with me being traditionally trained before I even learn how to do anything in Photoshop or any software, I was doing this first years before I knew how to use any software. You would think I would be conditioned for it. But learning how to work in digital just made me just work faster and have less patience maybe because working in the industry, working the agency, working the companies, I&#8217;m on a timeline where I got to turn this stuff around fast. It can be very competitive, whereas with painting, this can take&#8230; Because I&#8217;m so meticulous with the details and everything when I&#8217;m painting, it can take anywhere from weeks to a month. Depends on how much time. Well, I try not to take breaks in between, but I wind up doing that. Anyway.</p>
<p>All that to say I just want to paint more, knock out more pieces. Because I got a solo show coming out in 2023, a solo art show. It&#8217;s the first solo show that I&#8217;ve done in, oh my god, probably 12 or 13 years with all original pieces, so I&#8217;m on the clock right now. It&#8217;s next year in the spring, but time catches up real quick so I got to start really cranking out pieces. Teah, all that to say I want to paint more.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I find when visual creators, particularly when they get further along in their career, they often want to go back to some sort of physical, tangible way of creating. Like you said, doing it digitally does make you faster, but there&#8217;s a craft in the visual art that gets lost I think sometimes when you&#8217;re relying too much on digital tools.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. People will ask me, &#8220;Can I get this? Can I commission you for this piece?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Truthfully, it&#8217;ll be probably easier for you on your budget to commission me to do something digitally.&#8221; Because paintings, it takes a while. Well, for me it takes a while because there&#8217;s a certain level of quality that I want to put out. And there&#8217;s no command Z to go back when I make a mistake or it doesn&#8217;t come out the way I want it to look. I got to wait for it to dry and then I got to go back and rework it, or I&#8217;m mixing these colors, and the tubes of paint ain&#8217;t cheap. You know what I&#8217;m saying? You can buy the cheap stuff, but you going to get cheap results. It really adds up. But all in all, this is always my first love right here. And I always go back to that.</p>
<p>I was just working on this piece that I&#8217;m currently working on. I&#8217;ve been working on it about two months now. I just think working in it, I forget about how I used to feel painting before I was doing anything digitally. How I would just put a album on, put a CD on, put a record on, just rock out for hours on. And I miss that feeling of seclusion and just painting.</p>
<p>I was watching something, one of those shows that come on Sunday, one of the Sunday weekly news shows or whatever, but they were talking about&#8230; This is a few months back. They were talking about George Bush, how he put out a book, maybe it was last year. It was a book about people across the nation or people in this community or something like that. But it was his paintings and these people. And it was like, we don&#8217;t really rock with George Bush. You know what I&#8217;m saying? We don&#8217;t rock with George Bush, but his paintings weren&#8217;t bad. You know what I&#8217;m saying? Man, this dude actually isn&#8217;t that bad. He was on his ranch just painting or whatever and everything. I was like, I never would&#8217;ve guessed that from this guy. But I&#8217;m like, man, I would love that life just to be in a loft somewhere just, I don&#8217;t know, in the middle of nowhere, just painting. I don&#8217;t know, man. One day, one day. I&#8217;m going to speak into existence.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think you&#8217;ll get there. You&#8217;ll get there, absolutely. Let&#8217;s talk about your day job, what you do. You&#8217;re a senior art director at Havas, which is ad and PR company. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah, so I&#8217;ve been at Havas for about three years now. It&#8217;s been good, you know what I&#8217;m saying? A lot of opportunities have come from me being there. What I do, I work on clients. The main client that I&#8217;ve worked on since I&#8217;ve been there is Michelin and doing stuff for Michelin social. And I got a chance to kind of be&#8230; Not kind of be, I got a chance to be very creative with their brand. I worked on stuff for Mike&#8217;s Hard Lemonade, worked on a few other projects, but&#8230; My mind is blank right now, but Michelin is probably the main one that comes to mind because I&#8217;ve been on the brand pretty much 80% of the time I&#8217;ve been there.</p>
<p>One thing I can say about working on stuff for Michelin is that I&#8217;m blessed it. Everything I touch, I&#8217;ve been able to add my own personal touch or flare to it that they probably wouldn&#8217;t have done, whereas I push the limits where I can bring my personality and my style of creativity to a brand like that that has so much rich history and it&#8217;s been doing something a certain way for so long. But I&#8217;ve been able to bring my look and feel to it and explain to them why this works. And they&#8217;ve been open and they&#8217;ve been receptive to it. Sometimes we get pushback, of course, that&#8217;s just how it goes. But for the most part, I think with me working on the brand for so long, I know the do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts and know where I can push it and where I can&#8217;t. But the areas where I can push it, I really try to flex and really do something where if someone&#8217;s scrolling, if they&#8217;re scrolling on their phone or whatever and they see this graphic like, &#8220;Oh, this is pretty dope right here,&#8221; it would make me as a consumer want to check out more about this product right here. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now, you started there in October of 2019, which it feels like&#8230; With this pandemic, that feels like a lifetime ago. But how did the pandemic change up how you work?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny you say that because I was doing&#8230; Right now I worked out of the Chicago office. And prior to me working out of the Chicago office, I was in New York, I was in Brooklyn. I was doing freelance work for them, and then they gave me a full-time&#8230; offered me a full-time role. And I was like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m already doing freelance for you guys out here and I&#8217;m delivering what you&#8217;re asking me for. Can I just stay out here in New York?&#8221; It was like, &#8220;Yeah, we want to have you in the office.&#8221;</p>
<p>I move cross country, and then a couple months later everybody&#8217;s working from home. You know what I&#8217;m saying? My partner, Chevon, she was working remote as well at the time for a nonprofit, and she had been telling me, yo, everybody in her nonprofit is all over the country. You know what I&#8217;m saying? Working. You&#8217;re doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Working from home thing, it definitely&#8230; I always say as messed up as the pandemic has been and COVID and all of that, it was a big reset to show some of these jobs that we do the way we do them is outdated. And this is just my opinion. And going into office every day, five days a week, sometimes six, and sitting there for eight, 10 hours just to say that you&#8217;re here, we can do the work everywhere. You look at people on&#8230; What&#8217;s the site? Fiverr. You know what I&#8217;m saying? You don&#8217;t know where these people are at, but they&#8217;re still delivering stuff for you or whatever. And that&#8217;s what this pandemic showed. In my opinion, what it showed is thankfully the type of work that we do, the digital creative stuff, we can do it from anywhere. It definitely opened up my eyes and everything because I feel like I was&#8230; Like a lot of us, we were programmed to just come and to go into the office, just sit there and just look watching the clock waiting for 5:30, 6:30 to come, paying $15 for lunch every day, all of that right there.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind working remotely at all, man. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I don&#8217;t mind it, truthfully. I know me personally, I can be extrovert, I can be reclusive as well. When I&#8217;m creating, sometimes I just like to be alone. We can collaborate, but I like to be alone. I&#8217;m able to execute the way I really want to execute and execute my best way sometimes when I&#8217;m alone. I don&#8217;t mind working remote. I actually love it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s a typical day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I juggle a few things, man. It depends on the workload sometimes, man. A lot of times, like when I was working heavy on Michelin, when we had a lot of deliverables for the brand, it would be coming up with all these different creative pillars of ways to how the brand incorporates into travel or how they incorporate with food, how they incorporate it in their heritage, coming up with creative ways to display this stuff right here, like getting things ready for a client meeting.</p>
<p>Basically, the day starts, we get briefed on what&#8217;s due, what everyone&#8217;s working on. And that&#8217;s pretty much it, thankfully for me. I&#8217;m in a space where I can just do what I need to do and no one really bothers me, I guess because maybe they know that&#8217;s how I operate best. That&#8217;s pretty much my work day.</p>
<p>As far as doing side projects or painting&#8230; Well, the paintings more so of recent things. I take breaks in between that. But sometimes I might work on little side project here, do little brush strokes on the painting for maybe about, I don&#8217;t know, 15 minutes, come back to it a couple hours later. My day is basically just me being creative. I&#8217;m thankful to say that. I enjoy what I do, and I have fun doing what I do. And it&#8217;s how I envision my life. No stress. I&#8217;m not working in the cold. I&#8217;ve been there before. I&#8217;ve done a lot of things, man.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thankful that right now every day when I wake up, no two days are the same, but every day when I wake up, man, I can honestly say I&#8217;m not stressed about what I&#8217;m doing. And I&#8217;m doing what I love to do. It may not be the exact project that I want to work on, but at least I can say that my day consists of me being creative. And I&#8217;m getting paid to be creative. You know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. No, that&#8217;s a good thing. I think especially agencies tend to get the reputation&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if they get the best reputation, I&#8217;ll put it that way, sometimes because you&#8217;re often working from client to client so you don&#8217;t have a lot of time to spend with maybe a particular brand to do something before you&#8217;re put on another project or put on another campaign or something like that. But it sounds like with what you&#8217;re doing, especially because you mentioned earlier you&#8217;ve been on the Michelin brand for so long, you&#8217;ve had time to grow into it in a way.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
It&#8217;s cool because I&#8217;ve had access to all of their assets and their personal login site where it&#8217;s so many assets, so much history. And that&#8217;s a cool thing about working on a brand like this right here that&#8217;s been around for over 100 years; there&#8217;s so much that you can pull from. A.And not to sound cliche, but a lot of times with working on this brand, you don&#8217;t have to reinvent the wheel. Everything is there already, you just got to figure out how to repurpose it. I&#8217;ve worked on&#8230; What&#8217;s the faucet brand MOEN. I worked on MOEN briefly. I worked on Yellowstone National Park.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I said it before, but Mike&#8217;s Hard Lemonade. That was cool working on that. This was pre-pandemic. We had a cool, very, very dope idea and campaign for Mike&#8217;s Hard Lemonade, but didn&#8217;t see the light of day because the pandemic happened at the time. The pandemic happened and everything shut down so we had to redirect the direction of where we wanted to go. And it was a much, much, much more scaled down version of&#8230; It wasn&#8217;t even scaled down, it was a whole new direction. Everything that we created, the hours that we spent, no one really will ever see this out into the world. But that&#8217;s the nature of the game, you take it how it comes, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, you&#8217;ve worked before as a graphic designer, and we&#8217;ll talk about that a little later, and now you&#8217;re an art director at an agency. How would you describe the difference in those two?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t think there is any difference, man. Personally, I don&#8217;t. Maybe on paper where it says what the roles are, what the responsibilities are. On paper, it probably says certain things, but from my personal experience, I was doing the same thing coming up with ideas, coming up with ideas, coming up with ways to execute this thing, thinking of ways where we can&#8230; places where we can place these ideas so people can see it and engage with it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s similar to what I&#8217;m doing now. I worked in music, working at Mass Appeal. I worked on the record label side of the house. And sometimes I would work on the agency side as well. But it is the same thing, just one&#8217;s more culturally hip hop based, the other one&#8217;s more very American and reaches a broader audience and selling products.</p>
<p>But selling music is like selling products as well, man, so it&#8217;s the same thing. The way I see it, I think the only thing probably change is the company that you&#8217;re getting to check from. I always joke and I say this to people, and not to sound like a Debbie Downer or nothing like that, but you pick your poison. What are you able to accept and what are you able to deal with and whatever role or company or agency that you&#8217;re with? But I don&#8217;t find it any different at all.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is that the most challenging part about what you do? What you just mentioned?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I think the most challenging part about this right here, that working in design and advertising, from my experience, it&#8217;s a revolving door. I don&#8217;t know too many people that&#8217;s been in one spot for over five years. I just don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Early on, it was shocking. Not necessarily shocking to me, but it affected me emotionally. Damn, am I good enough? Or what could I have done differently? But then I understand it&#8217;s never personal, it&#8217;s business. And sometime business is up, sometime business is down. And when business is down, you might get cut. And that&#8217;s just the nature of the game.</p>
<p>And I think that&#8217;s where it just comes in. In trying to figure out too what do you love? You know, could work on one thing where the money is great, but you don&#8217;t really care about the work that you&#8217;re putting out. You&#8217;re not really in love with the brand or product or whatever that you&#8217;re working on. And then it could be something where you&#8217;re all about the mission that this one company or agency has, or you love what you&#8217;re working on but the pay isn&#8217;t the greatest. It&#8217;s all about trying, well, for me, trying to find that middle, that medium where, okay, I can get the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>But in all, back to what I was saying it&#8217;s a revolving door from, just from my experience, and a lot of my peers, not too many people I know stick around for a long time. And I don&#8217;t know whether it is because us being creative, you want to do your own thing eventually, or&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t want to make it a race thing or whatever, but it goes back to how do we see ourself? Well, for me personally, how do I see myself in a place where there aren&#8217;t many of people that look like me, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
And cannot coexist and naturally be myself in these spaces, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Do you think it might just be burnout or something?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s a few things. I feel like with junior people, when they don&#8217;t have the support or support from senior leadership, you got somebody might be fresh out of college and they got all these dreams of, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to do this. I&#8217;m going to do this award-winning stuff.&#8221; Of course everybody&#8217;s got those thoughts in their heads or whatever. But I feel like you take someone junior and you put them in a position and you don&#8217;t give them the support that they need to grow, it can be discouraging. And people will, &#8220;Yo, this ain&#8217;t for me right here.&#8221; You know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Or resourcing or whoever, they may not know a person&#8217;s&#8230; What&#8217;s their skillset? What&#8217;s that person&#8217;s strength? And the only thing they see is the person&#8217;s name and a title. And then, &#8220;Okay, well let&#8217;s put this person on this right here.&#8221; They might not even be the person that&#8217;s equipped for that. It&#8217;s like playing basketball; you can&#8217;t have the center playing the point guard position. You know what I&#8217;m saying? It don&#8217;t work out like that. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Well, you could, but you&#8217;re not going to get the optimum results.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit and talk more about you, talk about your personal life. Tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I&#8217;m originally from Jacksonville, Florida. That&#8217;s where I&#8217;m originally from. That&#8217;s where my early years were based out of. I moved away years ago, years ago. But I went to high school down there. And I was thankful to be in an art program going to an art school, Douglas Henderson School of the Arts, which at the time when I was going there, it was prestigious art school and everything.</p>
<p>But my father, when he went there, my father went there back in the &#8217;50s or the &#8217;60s or something like that. And at the time when he was going to that school, I think it was a school for Black students. You know what I&#8217;m saying? This is when segregation and all that stuff was going on. He went to that school decades before me. I just think it&#8217;s ironic that I ended up going there, but it&#8217;s a whole little different school at the time when I went.</p>
<p>But yeah, I got introduced to the arts there. Well, what&#8217;s the old TV show from back in the day? Fame?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Fame. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
It was like that, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Yeah, so it was a school like that and everything, man. Shortly after I graduated high school, a couple years went by, I tried to dabble in fashion for a little bit, but I couldn&#8217;t so I realized there wasn&#8217;t for me. I could design the stuff, but I couldn&#8217;t sew. And then going to college for&#8230; I went to Artist Studio Ft. Lauderdale only for one semester. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, I can&#8217;t sew then.&#8221; But it was cool though, it was cool though. I&#8217;m like, it&#8217;s more than just drawing, illustrations and everything.</p>
<p>Some years went by in between me having a child. After graduating high school, I just joined a Navy. I joined a navy cold turkey one day. I went to a recruiter and I was like, &#8220;Yo, I need a job.&#8221; You know what I&#8217;m saying? I need a job I can&#8217;t get fired from, maybe because the jobs I had at the time, life put me on a path where I wasn&#8217;t doing what I really wanted to do creatively, creatively, I was just working jobs. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Damn, this ain&#8217;t it right here, this really ain&#8217;t it.&#8221; I&#8217;m 21, 22 trying to figure life out. I went to a recruiter one day and I was like, &#8220;Yo, let me just hear what you got to say.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t even think I was going to sign up, but they hustled me like a car salesman, like a used car salesman.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Of course.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And at the time, they told me, &#8220;Yeah, you can get a sign on bonus for $7,000.&#8221; At the time when they told me that, $7,000, I had never seen $7,000 before. When they said $7,000, I&#8217;m seeing a million dollars in my head. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I was like, &#8220;Yo, yeah, let&#8217;s do it.&#8221; I joined the Navy in September 2001.</p>
<p>Yo, it&#8217;s crazy. I went to a recruiter station on a Friday. September 11th happened that Tuesday. Two weeks later, I was in bootcamp. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I was in bootcamp. Yeah. And I was in the Navy for 10 years. I&#8217;m a ex sub mariner. I was on submarines. There&#8217;s not many brothers on subs. At the time when I was on in the early 2000 and everything. And with me being in the Navy and being mostly in the north or whatever, the bulk of the time I was in the Navy, I started planting my roots in New York and in Brooklyn. A lot of people think I&#8217;m originally from Brooklyn, you know what I&#8217;m saying? That&#8217;s my second home. But I&#8217;m originally from Florida, from Jacksonville, man. I got roots down there as well. We&#8217;re all over the place right now. What else you want to know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m just curious about this 10 years in the Navy. First of all, my dad&#8217;s a Navy man, so I understand what that&#8217;s about. But the whole time that you&#8217;re doing this, were you also still pursuing creative things during this time?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yes. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Or how did that happen?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
No. Mind you, at the time in my early 20s, man. I look back on it now, I was a kid doing adult shit, you know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I was trying to figure it out, man. And I was a parent as well, you know what I&#8217;m saying? I was a parent trying to take care of a kid. I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t really know myself just yet. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
But I just know I need to provide some kind of way. And so the first couple of years of just me being in, it was just me just trying to figure out this thing, figure out this system, figure out what I got to do to not get in trouble and still keep some funds in my bank account and still perform and learn all the things that I need to learn, man.</p>
<p>Like I said, I was on submarines, and that&#8217;s&#8230; Aw man, that&#8217;s a whole nother world within itself and so much stuff that we have to know, from physics to&#8230; It&#8217;s so many things that I had to remember, being around top secret stuff, having a security clearance, working around nuclear weapons and things like that, man. It was a lot.</p>
<p>I was always doing drawing or whatever the whole time during those early years, drawing little tattoos for people and stuff like that. But it wasn&#8217;t until probably around 2004, the end of 2004, the sub that I was on, we left Norfolk, Virginia and we went up to Kittery, Maine. Kittery, Maine is on the border of New Hampshire, so Maine/New Hampshire. It wasn&#8217;t until I got up there that I wasn&#8217;t going out to sea, I&#8217;m just going to work for a couple of hours every day then going back to my barracks room. That gave me time to really do my art the way I really wanted to do it because I hadn&#8217;t done any art for so many years outside of high school. And by this time, I&#8217;m out of school for maybe seven years now, so I wasn&#8217;t really doing anything besides maybe sketching in my sketchbook. Seven years of not producing any work, it was really eating away at me. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I&#8217;m like, I know it&#8217;s more to life than this right here, there&#8217;s more to life right here. People tell you like, &#8220;Oh man, you do your 20 years, you&#8217;re going to get your retirement or whatever, and you still get out. You be young, you still be able to pursue other things.&#8221; But I knew deep down inside that that wasn&#8217;t me, that wasn&#8217;t for me.</p>
<p>But going back to, like I was saying, in 2004, a good friend of mine, he was from the Bronx. And around this time in early 2000, he was like, &#8220;Yo.&#8221; He knew that I like sneakers a lot. This is the early days before everybody&#8230; The sneaker app and all this other stuff like that. I was always one of those guys that had mad sneakers, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Before everybody knew me for my clothes and my sneakers and stuff, and he knew I could draw as well. A good friend of mine at the time, he was like&#8230; I guess he had went home for the weekend. He was from the Bronx. He went home for the weekend one time or something. He comes back, he was like, &#8220;I see these dudes customizing sneakers and everything. Why don&#8217;t you start doing that?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; I&#8217;ve always thought about it, but I never really tried to pursue it.</p>
<p>And I started searching on lunch, trying to figure out what paints and stuff I need to get. And once I figured out the right paints and everything, I think that&#8217;s when it really, really took off, where it really began for me as being an artist and putting my work out into the world through sneakers. This is the early days too. This is around &#8217;05, &#8217;06, going a little forward, the MySpace days, me just putting my stuff upon MySpace at the time and people checking for it. And it was like I was running a business out of my barracks room up in Maine. Nobody knew who I was, you know what I&#8217;m saying? No one knew who I was, they just knew the name TTK. That was my tag that I went by. My real name is Michael Harris. It&#8217;s a very generic name. There&#8217;s always another Michael Harris everywhere I go, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I was like, I got to do something that makes me stand down or whatever, so TTK. I was always into graffiti and stuff, man, so TTK was the initials that I like to tag. And I just like just it looks, the two T&#8217;s together and the K from a design point, I just like the way it looks.</p>
<p>Yeah, so everybody just knew, &#8220;Yo, this guy named TTK is customizing sneakers.&#8221; And this is the early days so there wasn&#8217;t a lot of people doing it how it is now almost 20 years later. That really opened my eyes. While I&#8217;m doing what I love to do and I&#8217;m getting paid to do what I want to do, this is what I want to do right here. I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s going to be customizing sneakers or working for Nike or whoever one day, but I&#8217;m being creative and I&#8217;m getting paid to be creative. This Navy thing, this right here is going to be my way out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was just asking were you still doing design and stuff or interested in design this whole time while you were in the Navy? And it sounds like you turned it into a profitable side business almost.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah. That led to me doing a bunch of other things. I went to high school for visual arts, traditional means in the &#8217;90s, man, like painting and things like that. I knew I wanted to paint, but I knew I couldn&#8217;t carry a big canvas with me everywhere. And I know not everybody has an appreciation for, I don&#8217;t know, fine art or the graphic design. Even though graphic design is isn&#8217;t everything that we see and interact with, most people don&#8217;t even realize that. But I was like, &#8220;Wow, how can I get my skillset, show what I want to bring out to the world and how people buy it?&#8221; Put them on sneakers. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p>The first year of me customizing sneakers, I wind up being featured in a book, I can&#8217;t even think of the name of it right now, but it was a book about custom sneakers or sneaker art from the early 2000s. But I was featured in this book. I wind up winning some contest with Finish Line at the time. I wind up having my two solo art shows at the time, and I wind up doing some freelance work for Timberland, the brand. And this is within the first year of me doing this. And I was like, &#8220;Wow, you know what? I got something right here. I&#8217;m onto something.&#8221; You know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
And what I was doing then, it&#8217;s very&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, I call it maybe it&#8217;s&#8230; It wasn&#8217;t on the skill level that I&#8217;m at right now, but I saw, you know what? I got something right here. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I got something right here.</p>
<p>And then shortly after that, I wind up meeting a good friend of mine who&#8217;s like a brother to me, Justice Hall. He was a designer at Timberland at the time. Because Timberland&#8217;s headquarters is in New Hampshire. I forget the town that it&#8217;s in in New Hampshire. But Justice saw my work on display at this skateboard shop. He saw my custom sneakers. And when Justice saw my work, he reached out to me. And he didn&#8217;t know who I was, he just saw the name TTK and he saw the work that I was doing. And it was like, &#8220;Yo, this person&#8217;s dope. I need to find them.&#8221; And he found me and we connected.</p>
<p>And he calls me up. It&#8217;s funny, I tell this story all the time. But when Justice, he got my information from the guys at the skateboard shop in New Hampshire. And they didn&#8217;t tell him who I was or anything like that. He was like, &#8220;Yo, this is this guy, this is TTK. Call him up, man. He&#8217;s dope.&#8221; When Justice calls me up and I answer the phone, I said, &#8220;Hello,&#8221; the first thing he says is, &#8220;Oh shit, you&#8217;re Black.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;What you thought I was?&#8217; I was thinking the same thing too because when they said designer, I didn&#8217;t think it was going to be another brother, someone the same age as me. You know what I&#8217;m saying? That&#8217;s into the same things that I&#8217;m into. It was like we were shocked to meet each other. And it was crazy because up there in New Hampshire/Maine, there aren&#8217;t many brothers up there. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
At the time, whenever it was like you see another Black person up there, you were like, &#8220;Oh man, you&#8217;re from up here? Oh man, where you from?&#8221; Or whatever. &#8220;Man, we should hang out or whatever.&#8221; You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Because I really didn&#8217;t see many of us up there or whatever, man. But anyway, so whenever me and Justice connected, it was like he put me onto so much. And I talk about it all the time. He showed me that everything that I wanted to be, I could be it. This guy&#8217;s the same age as me, similar interest and everything, come from similar backgrounds, and this guy is doing all the things that I wanted to do in life at that point. He just encouraged me.And at the time, I didn&#8217;t own computer, I didn&#8217;t own anything. The only thing I knew how to do was to paint and just hustle and just do art. And he told me, he was like, &#8220;Bro, you&#8217;re a brand and you don&#8217;t even realize it. You created a brand in a barracks room and people are buying your work from all over the world.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;You&#8217;re special, man.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;Yo, you really need to get out the Navy, man.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yo, I can get you a job right now.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m under contract.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;You can&#8217;t break it?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Nah, I can&#8217;t break this contract. I get out in&#8230;: At the time, I think I had five more years left because I had just reenlisted.</p>
<p>Yeah man, I owe a lot to Justice, man. He credits me for giving him a breath of fresh air and inspiring him as well, but I thank him all the time, man, because if I never met him, I think I would&#8217;ve got to where I needed to go eventually, but it would&#8217;ve probably taken a little bit longer. Like I said, at the time when I met Just, this is 2006. He&#8217;s showing me his portfolio. I didn&#8217;t even have a portfolio at the time, I just had some photos of my work that I took. And I took him to the pharmacy at the time to get the photos developed [inaudible 00:37:03] or whatever, man. Like I said, I didn&#8217;t know, I was very, very green. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I didn&#8217;t know. I knew I got a good product and I just know how to hustle. That&#8217;s the only thing I knew.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s showing me all his credentials and everything, he&#8217;s telling me about, &#8220;Yo, I work with Kanye.&#8221; This is during the Touch the Sky era and all of that, man. He&#8217;s showing me this. He&#8217;s showing the brands he&#8217;s worked on. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I did this cool sneaker for my man right here.&#8221; You know what I&#8217;m saying? He was like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t even worry about the credentials. It&#8217;s going to come, man. You trust me. You got it.&#8221; Once I met him and I saw what I wanted to be, it was no turning back after that. I was like, &#8220;Yo, I&#8217;m getting out. I&#8217;m getting out. I&#8217;m going to figure it out one way or another.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fast forward, I don&#8217;t know, I can&#8217;t do the math right now, 15 so years later I&#8217;m here talking to you, bro. There&#8217;s a lot of stuff in between that I&#8217;m jumping over, but, yeah, I&#8217;m here, I&#8217;m here. And I think I&#8217;ve done a lot of great stuff. My name is in places where I only dreamed about, or I&#8217;ve worked on things where when I was a teenager only dreamed about working on or thought it would be cool if I got to work on this or connect with this person and work on this project. And I did it. I&#8217;m still doing it. Sorry for the long rant, yo.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, it&#8217;s all good. Let&#8217;s hop forward to 2011. That&#8217;s when you got out of the Navy. You had been in the Navy for roughly about a decade. And then right afterwards, you enrolled in City Tech, which is a university in New York city. Talk to me about that time.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
It was interesting, man, because I was so hyped to get out and just be a civilian again because&#8230; In fact, most people didn&#8217;t even know that I was in the Navy because I was doing so much my artwork, putting my work out there. By this time, I&#8217;m not really even doing sneakers anymore, I&#8217;m painting, and people know me for my paintings. It was an interesting time. But I knew just from my first time going to college in the late &#8217;90s, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;All right, things are getting&#8230; It&#8217;s digital now.&#8221; I just can&#8217;t see myself going to school to pay to be a fine artist. Nothing against people who do. You know what I&#8217;m saying? But for me, like I said, I had bills. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I still had some kids to support. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;All right, how can I be creative and get paid to be creative?&#8221;I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to do. I knew the process of applying for art colleges just from the past, but I&#8217;m like, damn, I don&#8217;t really have any work that represents what people are looking for in this current state of the world, 2011. And I was like, &#8220;Man, I know I got the skills, but I don&#8217;t necessarily have the work to show it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A good friend of mine, he told me, he was like, &#8220;Yo, why don&#8217;t you go to City Tech?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What&#8217;s City Tech?&#8221; He was like, &#8220;You can get the same education there at a fraction of a price.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;A lot of the teachers that teach there, they teach you the big name schools as well.&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yo, dude, you don&#8217;t even got to do a portfolio, you just go and you show up. Just apply.&#8221;</p>
<p>I went to City Tech, I applied, I got in. And within maybe, I don&#8217;t know, two weeks of me getting out the Navy, it&#8217;s my first day of class. And the first year or so I&#8217;m trying to figure out, all right, what do I want to do? I didn&#8217;t feel like I was being challenged. And then maybe almost around the first year of me being there, I was in a class with this professor named Douglas Davis. Whether he knows it or not, he&#8217;s the person that really inspired me to stay at City Tech because I met him in the first day of his class. I saw he was speaking in a language that I understood. And I just liked the way he just came across in the room. You know what I&#8217;m saying?I&#8217;ll never forget this. This is over 10 years ago, but the first day of class, he comes in, he looks&#8230; He&#8217;s not much older than me so he looks young, he looks like he could possibly be a student at the time. He comes in and he says, &#8220;My name is Douglas Davis.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;What I do, I get money.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You listen to me, you&#8217;ll get money too.&#8221; And he says something, I think he says, &#8220;I&#8217;m surprised. I remember it was yesterday.&#8221; He said, &#8220;My wife, she don&#8217;t got to work. I bring home enough money to support my family doing what I love.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;You listen to me, I&#8217;m going to give you everything that I got. But when I ask for it back, you better give me 100%. I&#8217;m going to run this class like it&#8217;s an agency. If this ain&#8217;t going to be for you, I&#8217;m not going to judge you. I&#8217;ll help you get to where you need to be. But if you here for the ride, let&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, man. I never heard no professor in the classroom talk like that. And I was like, wow. His whole presence. He&#8217;s saying what I want to hear. Yeah, man, and that really put me on the path of going the route of learning about advertising and the stuff that I&#8217;ve been seeing for my whole entire life and just wondering why, wow, I like the way this ad looks, but I can&#8217;t explain why I like it. Being around him and other professors as well, but that really&#8230; I guess I feel like it cemented me in at City Tech where it&#8217;s like, all right, I&#8217;m not going anywhere because I like studying under this guy right here, I like studying under this other professor right here. They&#8217;re talking in the language that I want to, you know what I&#8217;m saying? That I want to hear. And they&#8217;re telling me the things that I need to know to apply to what I do already. Yeah man, that&#8217;s how I ended up at City Tech.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, shout out to Douglas Davidson who we&#8217;ve had on the show twice now. That&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve heard his classroom style, though. But as you described it, I was like, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s 100% him.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yo man, I tell you, he&#8217;s a great guy. No joke, man, when I was in his class, I felt like I was on&#8230; What&#8217;s the one show? Making the Band or something like that, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Because I didn&#8217;t want to mess up, you know what I&#8217;m saying? I didn&#8217;t want to mess up.</p>
<p>The nights leading up to the days when we had to present, he was like, &#8220;Yo, when the door is shut, the door is shut. If you not in, you not in.&#8221; I would make sure I&#8217;m on the train early, that way I&#8217;m not late to class that day and everything. I have everything set up, staying up all night just trying to get it right and just going up there. Because he didn&#8217;t hold any punches or whatever like that, he really ran it, his classroom&#8230; He didn&#8217;t run it like a classroom, he ran it like it was an agency, like it was a business. He&#8217;s a great guy, man. You can tell he really cared about what the people that&#8230; The students that he was working with. And he was there. He&#8217;s a real special person, man, he&#8217;s a real special person. And he&#8217;s someone that I&#8217;m very happy that I was blessed to meet in my journey along the way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Speaking of that journey, you documented a lot of this in a recent project that you released called Just Like Me. You directed it, you put the whole thing together. Douglas was in it as well. Talk to me about the documentary. First of all, why did you decide to do a documentary?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
With the documentary, that came about&#8230; Well, actually it&#8217;s a idea I&#8217;ve had in my head for many, many years but I just never really talked about it. I didn&#8217;t really talk about it to anyone; maybe one person. But it&#8217;s just something that I had in the back of my head. I was like, if the opportunity presents itself, it&#8217;d be cool to make this thing. It&#8217;s just something like a passion project.</p>
<p>And the opportunity came sooner than what I thought it was going to come in life. But around the time&#8230; In 2020, summer 2020, everybody&#8217;s in the house, the pandemic, COVID, all that stuff, and then the incident with George Floyd, all these agencies and companies having, I don&#8217;t know, a coming of age moment. We didn&#8217;t know. You know what I&#8217;m saying? What can we do to support Black people? Or whatever like that, man.</p>
<p>That was a moment in time where someone said to me&#8230; A real good friend of mine, a mentor as well, he said to me, &#8220;This is a moment in time where you need to use this opportunity to make what you want to make and do what you want to do, because I know you can do it.&#8221; And when he said it to me, I&#8217;m just thinking from a point of having anxiety and just fear of what&#8217;s the worst thing that could happen? This could happen, this could happen. And I just brushed it off.</p>
<p>And he came to me, he was like, &#8220;Yo, look man, make what you want to make.&#8221; I&#8217;m paraphrasing right now, but he said to me, &#8220;Your story is a very, very special story. How does someone go from working on nuclear submarines to knowing all the people that you know and working on the stuff that you worked on? You really have an interesting story.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not telling you what you should make or whatever, but you got something.&#8221; And I was like, all right. He was like, &#8220;I&#8217;ll help you get to a certain point with putting the pieces together, but after that, you running the show.&#8221; Because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never directed a documentary. I&#8217;ve been around when documentaries are being made from my time working at Mass Appeal and I saw how much work goes into making a documentary. I know it&#8217;s a lot of work. He was like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, you have what it takes.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I was like, &#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll put some days aside.&#8221; I wrote up three paragraphs, three, four paragraphs. I talk about basically the moment, this particular moment in time about how people were talking about the state of Black people in America with all the whole George Floyd&#8217;s things and the police incidents. It&#8217;s nothing new, it always happens, but the spotlight was on it in that moment in time.</p>
<p>Like I said, plus these companies are talking about, &#8220;Yo, we need to bring in more diversity,&#8221; and all this other things like that. I thought about why is it that there aren&#8217;t many Black people and there aren&#8217;t many brown people in these spaces of creativity?| And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Why is that?&#8221; And I start thinking about my own personal experiences, about how we don&#8217;t really hear about them. And it&#8217;s like, I know a lot of Black creators, but the average person don&#8217;t know who these people are. But they&#8217;ve done a lot of great things and they&#8217;ve contributed to a lot of things that are historic now. And I&#8217;m sure you know, with you doing your podcast, you know we create a lot of great things that everyone knows and a lot of people benefit from, but a lot of times people don&#8217;t know who the wizard was behind the curtain that created this thing.</p>
<p>And I thought about too about why there aren&#8217;t many of us in these spaces. And I thought about a lot of us don&#8217;t know that this path exists until maybe much later in life when people got bills, they got families to support and they give up on being a creative. They give up on it because there&#8217;s always this narrative of being a starving artist. And that&#8217;s not true.</p>
<p>Going back to something Douglas David said to me once, and I always quote it, he says, &#8220;This thing called design is like the Matrix.&#8221; You know what I&#8217;m saying? &#8220;It affects all of us. We all work, operate in the Matrix and everything, but you&#8217;ll never know the Matrix exists until someone points it out to you.&#8221; And that&#8217;s like how design is. Everything is designed, everything, but most people don&#8217;t think about the whole process of that and how it interacts with us. And I thought about, wow, more of us, more Black people knew about this at an early age and were aware that you can make a living off of this, you&#8217;re not going to be a starving artist, I felt like you could see more of us in these spaces. And in order for me to try to educate more people on it, I wanted to show people who were influential to me. There are many people who are influential to me, but I wanted to show a few Black men and women who I&#8217;m blessed to cross paths with them in my journey and what they meant to me.</p>
<p>And not only just show who these people are, show their work because a lot of times I feel like when it comes to designers and things like that, or just anything&#8230; I&#8217;m losing my train of thought. But I feel like we will show a person and we&#8217;ll have the title, but a lot of times you don&#8217;t know the work that they&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p>I think about if I was 16 or 17 years old, I might not know what a creative director is. I might not even understand what a ad agency is, but I know this Nike shoe right here, I know this commercial right here, and now I can connect the dots like, oh man, this is the person to help put this thing together right here. You know what I&#8217;m saying? Show the work. That&#8217;s what I wanted to do with the project. I wanted to show some people who that were like me and the work that they&#8217;ve done and the work that have had impact on so many other people. And I pretty much wanted to make something that I would&#8217;ve loved to have seen when I was younger.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long spiel, but I wrote up a short paragraph explaining that, about how representation is very important, representation is very important. You need to see examples of a roadmap of people that have done things before you that can hopefully inspire you to want to go down that path.</p>
<p>And I also told a story in the pitch about when me and Justice met each other, when mt man Justice hall, when me and him met each other in the early 2000s, why were we surprised that we were both Black? We were surprised because we don&#8217;t see many of us so it&#8217;s a shock whenever we do find it, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
At that time. And I pitched it and I got the green light, you know what I&#8217;m saying? I got the green light. And I reached out to everyone from St. Adams to Douglas Davis to Julian Alexander, Aleesha Smalls Worthington, Dana Gibbons, John Petty III, and Justice, Justice Hall. I reached out to them, and they were all on board.</p>
<p>I connected with my man&#8230; He&#8217;s a creative director, he&#8217;s a director as well, my man, Ben Hype. And me and him came up with the whole creative look and vision, and we put it together. I just knew working on this right here, I knew that I wanted to make something visually appealing, visually, visually dope. The message is dope, but I want the visuals to be engaging as well where when someone&#8217;s watching it, they&#8217;re not going to want to look away because it&#8217;s just a beautiful piece. And I thought about what&#8217;s the series on Netflix? Abstract.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Abstract. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
You know what I&#8217;m saying? Out of what two seasons, they may feature one Black woman or person of color.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They had Ralph Gilles in the first season, and then in the second season they had&#8230; Oh God, they had Ian Spalter, who&#8217;s head of Instagram in Japan, and they had Ruth E. Carter, the costumer. They had her.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Right, right. This is just my opinion. I feel like that just an afterthought, like, &#8220;Oh, we got to check a box,&#8221; or whatever. You know what I&#8217;m saying? And Abstract is a great series, but if you go off of that, you would think Black designers don&#8217;t exist. You know what I&#8217;m saying? Don&#8217;t get me wrong, we&#8217;re rare, but it&#8217;s not as rare as how that series made it seem. You know what I&#8217;m saying? There&#8217;s a lot of us. But that&#8217;s what I wanted to show. Yo, we&#8217;re walking in plain sight every day, and we put a lot of things out into the world that you seen but you probably didn&#8217;t know that, hey, I&#8217;m the person behind this right here because&#8230;</p>
<p>And not even to sound the cliche or stereotypical, but whenever you&#8230; A lot of times when they think of basketball courts or sports, you think of a Black man. You know what I&#8217;m saying? When you think of entertainment or whatever, you think of Black people. But what about all these other roles and titles out there that we&#8217;ve contributed a part of, been a part? And I wanted to show this right here. But not show it in a preachy way or like I&#8217;m giving a lecture, I wanted to do it in a way that&#8217;s conversational.</p>
<p>And I credit my man, Brandon Coleman. He&#8217;s a designer. He&#8217;s another one of the first Black designers I ever met when I met Justice at the time. But he gave me the inspiration to go that route because like I said, I never done this before, I never directed anything before. I know what I wanted to see and I know that I want it to look good, I want it to be visually appealing. But he asked me a question early on. He said, &#8220;How do you want tell your message? Do you want to have a lecture or do you want it to be conversational?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, a lecture?&#8221; He was like, &#8220;No, you want to have a conversation. Put yourself back into the 16, 17 year old version of you, TTK. Did you like when people were preaching to you? Or did you like when when people were having a conversation back and forth?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;re going to do it, but think about that whenever you&#8217;re trying to put this story together.</p>
<p>And that helped me with the whole creative direction. Whenever Ben Hype was filming it, I told him, I was like, &#8220;Yo, I want you to show the people, show their hands, show them moving around, show closeups of them.&#8221; I want you to feel like you&#8217;re in the room with these people. I want you to feel like you know them. And even though if you may not know them or whatever, but you konw their work. But I want the people, when they view this, I want them to feel like it&#8217;s an intimate moment, like you&#8217;re close with these people, like you&#8217;re talking to a cousin or someone who&#8217;s a part of your family or a friend that you&#8217;ve known for years. And I think I was able to accomplish that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, the documentary is really great. And we&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes so people can check it out. We&#8217;ve had Julian on the show too. Julian is episode 250, I believe.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. But no, it&#8217;s a great documentary. I hope everybody will get a chance to check it out. When you had the idea and you put it all together, like what we talked about I think before we started recording about you never know how it&#8217;s going to be received. What has the reception been like since the documentary&#8217;s aired?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been good, it&#8217;s been very, very good. It&#8217;s slow, you know what I&#8217;m saying? It&#8217;s slow or whatever. But so far I haven&#8217;t had anyone say anything, &#8220;I wish you could have done it this way or whatever, this and that.&#8221; The response is always the same, &#8220;This is amazing. I never seen anything quite like this before. And it&#8217;s very real, and I feel inspired.&#8221; I did it. That&#8217;s what I wanted to do.<br>
Like I said, when I initially pitched the idea, I said I wanted to make something that&#8217;s meant to educate and inspire. Whatever comes after that is just a extra benefit. I wanted to make something that lives beyond this particular moment in time where if you watch it a year from now, two years, five years, whatever, it&#8217;s the educational piece. And I want people to be inspired by&#8230; I want to hopefully inspire the next generation of Black creatives out there to show, hey, these are people that are alive right now and they&#8217;re doing it versus I&#8217;m hearing about somebody who did some great things back in 1970. I&#8217;m like, wow, I&#8217;m hearing about it from someone else&#8217;s perspective versus hearing it from the person when they&#8217;re alive right now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going off on a rant right now or whatever, but I think about how Cey adams that&#8217;s featured in a documentary, why isn&#8217;t he taught about in schools? You pay this money to go to school for design and everything, you learn about all these other designers, and they&#8217;re great people and they&#8217;ve done great things, man, I love the work, but Cey is on that level of, in my opinion, the Paula Schers and all those other people out there because he&#8217;s done so much stuff that people know. They know his work but unless you&#8217;re into this thing called design, you probably wouldn&#8217;t even know who Cey is. And I feel like he&#8217;s someone who should&#8217;ve probably been on the Abstract series. This man was around in the &#8217;70s, New York, going from graffiti on trains to his work in the &#8217;80s to the &#8217;90s, to being in, what, the National African American Smithsonian Museum. Come on. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m skipping over 40 years worth of work right here because it is too much to talk about that he&#8217;s accomplished in his lifetime. Why isn&#8217;t he taught about in school? And it goes back to what I was saying, when you think of design, they don&#8217;t think of us. And I was like, &#8220;Yo, I&#8217;m not making this to ask for a seat at the table, I want to make this to just educate us and show us, tell these stories from a real perspective versus someone years later to tell the narrative a certain way.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I want you to hear from the people while they&#8217;re alive, people who are heroes to me, people who, whether they know it or not&#8230;&#8221; I took a little bit from all of them to get to this point right here. I want other people to be inspired as well to accomplish things that I didn&#8217;t accomplish or we didn&#8217;t accomplish, but a lot sooner.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel you 100%. I can liken it to what I do with Revision Path, with having folks on here. I&#8217;ve been able to have people on here at different parts of their career journey. There&#8217;s folks who I&#8217;ve had on maybe in 2014 that now I can bring back seven or eight years later and be like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s talk about how things have changed,&#8221; or something. You know?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I totally get that. Actually, I have a funny story. Well, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s funny, but I have a story about Abstract. This was in 2019 I think was when the second season was about to come out. And I had watched the first season. Well, I&#8217;m not going to lie, I watched Ralph Gilles&#8217; episode on Abstract for the first season and that&#8217;s it because I was like, I don&#8217;t want to hear about everybody else. I was like, I&#8217;m going to watch his.</p>
<p>And the place I was working at the startup at the time, and we were looking for design firms for a project that we were going to do, this lifestyle vertical. And so one of the agencies we reached out to was Godfrey Dadich, which is in San Francisco. The Abstract series came from Godfrey being Scott Dadich, who was the former co-founder of Wired. And I didn&#8217;t talk to him directly, but I talked to someone at the agency because I was like,&#8221; Yeah, my name is Maurice Cherry,&#8221; blah blah, blah, yada, yada, yada. And they were like, &#8220;Oh, we know who you are.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Oh, okay.&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t coming to them in a personal capacity, it was a professional capacity. And not even for the show, it was for my employer at the time.</p>
<p>They were talking to me about the second season of Abstract. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh yeah, the second season of Abstract is coming out.&#8221; And they were like, &#8220;I bet you&#8217;re really going to be excited about this because we got two Black designers for this season.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Why would I be excited about that?&#8221; Yay, you found two, but I&#8217;ve found hundreds. I mean, I don&#8217;t know if they were saying it to be solidarity or something. I don&#8217;t know, I just thought that was weird that they brought it up in that way. We ended up not going with them, not for that reason. But I was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll check it out when it airs on Netflix.&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, we managed to find two great Black designers. I&#8217;m like-</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
We managed to find.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, we managed to find, which is funny that they said that, because I was like, one, I&#8217;ve known Ian. Actually, I did an event here in 2017 back when he was&#8230; Well, he still works for Meta and everything with Instagram. But I met him at a live event here in Atlanta for Revision Path. And then Ruth, I don&#8217;t know Ruth, but I&#8217;ve had Ruth&#8217;s goddaughter on the show, Courtney Pinter. She lives in Switzerland. I think at the time she was doing flavor design for this company called Givaudan. Now she works for Fifa. But I&#8217;ve also had Hannah Beachler to give the Black Panther connection. I had her on the show for episode 300.</p>
<p>Your overarching point around the importance of being able to have people give their own history in their own words is super important because when I started Revision Path, and this was almost 10 years ago, that&#8217;s not to say that these stories weren&#8217;t out there, but they were really hard to find. And one of the few places that I found them was at AIGA when I started volunteering there with the diversity and inclusion task force. Because they would do these design journeys things and they would talk about folks. But even the way that they&#8230; The imagery and everything almost memorialized them. And keep in mind, these people are not dead, but they memorialize them in this way like they&#8217;ve gone on to greater things. And I&#8217;m like, these folks are still alive. What are you talking about?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
And they&#8217;re active, too. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, and active. Michelle Washington&#8217;s one of the first people that I had met through that. Her and I are working on the book together. Maurice Woods, who&#8217;s been on the show before, Maurice Woods of the Interact Project. I think he&#8217;s episode 12 or 13. Emery Douglas from the famous former Minister of Culture from the Black Panther Party, AIGA medalist, he&#8217;s been on the show. That was episode 15. But I didn&#8217;t find out about those folks until I volunteered and did that. And the way that even they just put it out there made it seem like these are not living people still doing work, it was almost like in memoriam. Nah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s like when we was putting the pieces together for Lust Like Me, Douglas Davis, he connected me with Cheryl D. Miller. I don&#8217;t know if you know her.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Yeah, oh man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
She&#8217;s episode 248.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I felt like I was sitting with royalty talking to her. You know what I&#8217;m saying? Me and Davis had some questions to ask her. Man, once she started talking, man, the questions just went out the window. She was just dropping so many jewels and so much history and stuff, man. And it&#8217;s like, wow, how come I didn&#8217;t know this woman&#8217;s story? I&#8217;m happy that I spoke to her while she&#8217;s alive saying, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Hear it straight from&#8230; It&#8217;s from the source.</p>
<p>And she said something. Well, I don&#8217;t know if you remember, but at the very end of the documentary, Just Like Me, there&#8217;s a quote from her at the very, very end before the credits. When we were talking, she said something, &#8220;It&#8217;s sad that your generation has to experience the same thing I experienced 50 something years ago around the time when Dr. King died.&#8221; She was like, &#8220;Yo, all these companies had an awakening moment for about a year or two, maybe less than that.&#8221; And she was like, &#8220;And this is what&#8217;s happening right now because of George Floyd. These companies are having an awakening moment, but it&#8217;s going to fizzle out,&#8221; unfortunately, man.</p>
<p>When you say we can have all the different programs, DEI, all this, whatever, if you want to change it, change it. And she said something too. She was like, &#8220;Yo, if they try to tell you that we didn&#8217;t exist, that&#8217;s a lie.&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;I&#8217;m fortunate that I got all of this stuff because I was alive and I archived it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like a magician, she pulls out a issue of Communication Arts from 1970. And I ordered it because of her. She was like, &#8220;This is one of the first&#8230;&#8221; This is what from 50 years ago, she just pulls this magazine out. She was like, &#8220;This right here on page whatever, 90 something or whatever, you see the Black designers right here? This is 1970 right here, so if they try to tell you that the only person that was out doing things is Milton Glazer and all those guys like that,&#8221; she was like, &#8220;nah, he was just the only person that was getting the work. That&#8217;s why you knew about him. But these other people were out here as well. And here, this is their work right here on.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;I got it in the archives right here, so nobody can ever try to pull the wool over my eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>And when I got that issue, I was able to back order it online, and I saw Ms. Dorothy Hayes, she was a Black designer as well. And I used to see she was a professor at City Tech. And I never knew that this woman was one of the first Black designers ever published. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I had no clue. I never had any of her classes, but I would just see her in passing. And I&#8217;m like, wow, there&#8217;s so much history that we have. And that&#8217;s why I feel like we got to tell our stories before&#8230; Tell them in real time and tell them authentic and speak to the people who needs to hear it because you already know how it goes, man, years later, the narrative, it gets switched up and it gets watered down. That&#8217;s not how it really was. Yeah, man, salute to you for what you do, man. I&#8217;m honored to be a part of this right here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Thank you. And yeah, Cheryl is 100% right about that. When I ran across Cheryl, this was in 20&#8230; Now you got me here telling stories. This was 2014, and I had just started doing volunteer stuff with Revision&#8230; Not Revision Path, with AIGA, started doing volunteer stuff. And that&#8217;s when I learned about her thesis that she did in 1985 when she was at Pratt about Black designers and their viability in the industry and how that became this 1987 print article, and then there was this AIGA symposium.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m doing all this research trying to find&#8230; Well, one, doing the research on what happened from that thesis, but then secondly, I wanted to put it into this presentation that I was putting together that I was going to present called Where Are the Black Designers? And I was like, is Cheryl still alive? And I remember asking folks at AIG, and they were like, &#8220;Well, we don&#8217;t know what happened to her.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Let me find her.&#8221;And I found her. How did I find Cheryl? Oh, I know, I found her on Amazon. Wow. She had written a book about her mother. It wasn&#8217;t even about design, it was about her mother and the relationship she had with her mother and everything growing up. I just found her book, eventually did some more searching, found a website, reached out on a whim and was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m Maurice Cherry. I&#8217;m doing this research. I&#8217;m putting this stuff together. I&#8217;d love to talk to you about this kind of stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I first encountered Cheryl, like I said back in 2014, she had put design behind her. She had had her design work and stuff. She had, I wouldn&#8217;t say retired, but she raised a family, became a theologian. She was living a totally different life. And then since then, of course, doing the presentation and then more people finding out about her work, now she&#8217;s Dr. Cheryl Miller and has given lectures across the country and doing all amazing stuff and is still here doing this stuff.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
That&#8217;s beautiful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s beautiful, it&#8217;s beautiful. And so with Provision Path, I&#8217;m certainly fortunate to be able to share that story and to bring more awareness to people in general about what Black folks are doing in design everywhere. I just had this year my first Black designer in South America, which is something I wanted to have for a long time. I was like, I&#8217;m going to hit every continent. Couldn&#8217;t hit Antarctica, but I done talked to a Black designer on every continent so far start with 2022 this year with someone in South America. Yeah, I just want to keep going and keep telling more stories and getting more folks on here to tell their stories so folks know that we did exist.</p>
<p>To that end about the whole black squares thing, in 2020, that summer, I was looking up a bunch of old Ebony and Jet magazines and stuff. I think Google has the full archive, the full digital archive of Ebony Magazine, and so I was looking at issues from when Dr. King was assassinated. And when I tell you it was the exact same thing about companies posting black squares, exact same thing people were doing back then when King died, sometimes even the same verbiage. I&#8217;m like, this is wild, this is wild.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s one thing Ms. Miller was saying, she was like, &#8220;Just change it. You want to make change? Do it.&#8221; These people that have positions to do it, they don&#8217;t want to do it. This right here is a moment in time. Like she said, I&#8217;ve seen it before. I&#8217;m not even thrilled by it. You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not thrilled by it at all. Just from her telling me&#8230; Hearing stories that I&#8217;ve never heard before. One day, thankfully, you&#8217;re doing what you&#8217;re doing so people will have,&#8230; We&#8217;re able to control our own narrative more so now. It was great, but at the same time, it&#8217;s bittersweet as well, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right, right.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Because wow, man, I&#8217;m experiencing the same thing my elders experienced. How come I don&#8217;t know about Cheryl Miller, the woman who created the original BET logo? You know what I&#8217;m saying? Something that&#8217;s a part of my childhood. Why more people don&#8217;t know about who this woman is right here?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m honored that I was able to speak with her and basically just sit and listen to her talk, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Just sit and listen to her talk. And to have a quote from her in the documentary, I was like, man, that was a great book end on it. It was a real book end to the project. Like I said, when you watch it, in the very beginning it says how it started, and at the end it says how it&#8217;s going. And you see her quote at the end, someone who&#8217;s been around that predates all of us. She predates even Cey, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
Who has 40 something years of work. She predates him. To have someone like a OG basically, a vet, to have her to be a part of the project, man, I&#8217;m thankful. I&#8217;m thankful for everybody that was a part of helping me put this project together, Just Like Me. Man, I&#8217;m thankful for everybody, man. But yeah, Cheryl Miller&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want the next chapter of your legacy to be?</p>
<p><b>TTK:</b><br>
I want to be known as a painter more. I want to be known as that. I want to do gallery shows, more of them. Because in the past where I was just doing art shows myself, and I was just happy if I was able to fill the room with friends and stuff like that and create a memory. I want to sell my work on a high level. I want to work with more brands, but I want to be working with brands because they want to work with me, not because I need a job. I want to bring my personal creativity and my expertise to the table. &#8220;Yo, we want to collab with you. We love your story.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I want another opportunity to make a project, another project like Just Like Me but bigger. I know when you watch the documentary, it looks like it was&#8230; Yeah, it&#8217;s put together very, very well, but oh man, we were building the car while we were driving it, making this thing right here. We were really making something out of nothing, but it looks like it&#8217;s on a high level so I would really like to have a chance to make something maybe&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the same type of topic or something completely different. I wouldn&#8217;t mind directing another project.</p>
<p>All in all, I just want to continue to be creative, continue to make a living, and live comfortable using my imagination, man. I don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s going to go in the next five years, but I&#8217;m speaking into existence right now what I want. And truthfully, I feel like I can&#8217;t even fathom what&#8217;s going to be for me because it&#8217;s going to be something that I&#8217;m not even expecting. You know what I&#8217;m saying? Just this documentary, just like&#8230;</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t mention it, but working on a project for Nas, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Well, I worked on a few project for Nas but having my name and the credits next to Nas and Kanye, you know what I&#8217;m saying? Wow, you can&#8217;t erase my name from this project. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I&#8217;ve worked on this right here. You know what I&#8217;m saying? If you would&#8217;ve told me at the time 15 years ago that, &#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re going to work on this project. You&#8217;re going to be the person who designs and put this thing together,&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;How is that going to happen?&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t&#8230; I&#8217;d imagine it, but I was like, wow, it seemed like a fairytale. But the have, I did it, and it&#8217;s a thing of the past now, I&#8217;m onto something new, wow, that&#8217;s great.</p>
<p>And if you would&#8217;ve told me three years ago that I would direct a documentary, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;How would I do that?&#8221; And that&#8217;s going back to what I was initially saying, five years from now, I just want to be doing something great and making a living and just putting the best stuff out into the world, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work online?</p>

I always say that project is my magnum opus project at the moment. Yeah, that&#8217;s where you can find me at.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
TTK, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show, one, for sharing your story, which again, I hope people will check out the documentary so they can get a chance to see it for themselves, but also just your whole story about perseverance and pursuing your creative passion.

If this documentary is any indication, I&#8217;m pretty sure what&#8217;s coming up next is going to be great. Thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>

<p>I really enjoyed my conversation with this week&#8217;s guest &#8212; the one and only Keith Henry Brown. This prolific artist has a catalog that few can touch, with work appearing in <em>The New York Times</em>, Carnegie Hall, Blue Note Records, and the Brooklyn Academy of Music, just to name a few. But Keith is so much more than just an artist, as you&#8217;ll come to find out!</p>
<p>We started off talking about his current and upcoming book projects, and he shared how he balances his day job with his other career passions while giving a peek into his creative process. From there, he spoke about growing up in Staten Island, getting a shot to draw for Marvel Comics, and getting handpicked by Wynton Marsalis to be creative director at Jazz at Lincoln Center. We even spent some time geeking out about jazz, and he shared one of his dream projects that he&#8217;d love to accomplish one day. Keith&#8217;s journey as a creative is all about not being afraid to do what <em>you</em> want to do &#8212; very inspiring!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Hi, I&#8217;m Keith Henry Brown. And I am an illustrator, graphic designer and a writer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2022 been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
It&#8217;s hot. I could tell you that. Other than that, I stay busy. In a lot of ways, I&#8217;m juggling two different careers, a career where I am a, I guess, full-time illustrator, but then I&#8217;m also a full-time art director, graphic designer for an advertising firm. I try to find some way to do both of those. I&#8217;m also a dad. Both my kids though are men now, but you got to deal with the craziness. Just juggling. But I like being busy. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about. The minute I slow down, then I start feeling complacent.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. You mentioned being an author. I wanted to congratulate you on your book that just came out a couple of months ago, Because of You, John Lewis. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, I didn&#8217;t write that one. It&#8217;s Andrea Davis Pinkney wrote this beautiful script about a story about this young man named Tybre Faw, who was I think 11 or 12 at the time, who was obsessed with civil rights leaders, which I think is pretty extraordinary in itself, from Tennessee. And he asked his two grandmothers to drive him to meet John Lewis. He met John Lewis, came in the back door, All these reporters came up to him and said, &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;<br>
&#8220;I want to say hello to my hero.&#8221; They opened the back door. Mr. Lewis came out. Never saw the kid before in his life. The kid started crying. He held up a sign telling him about what he thought about him, which was basically saying, &#8220;You&#8217;re a hero of mine.&#8221; Lewis gave him a big hug. He later invited him to march with him on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, and then they became friends. When Mr. Lewis died, he did his eulogy at his funeral. They became friends for a short time while John Lewis was alive.<br>
So the book is about their relationship, but the book is really about how leaders inspire each other, like Martin Luther King was John Lewis&#8217; mentor; not at first, but his person that he fancied and that he was interested in and wanted to be like. And then he finally got to meet him and work with King, Mr. King, which you probably know. And then the same thing happened again with Tybre and John Lewis. So it&#8217;s sort of a succession of future and past civil rights leaders.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Sounds like a great book. I&#8217;ll definitely put a link to it in the show notes so people can check it out.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
I give most of the credit to Andrea. They found me. Scholastic Books is the publisher. And I hadn&#8217;t done anything like it yet in my career. And it was just a huge honor that they thought that I could do it. And I was intimidated because of all these amazing people that were involved. And it was a learning experience. But the book is out, and people seem to like it. We&#8217;ve gotten starred reviews from Kirkus and Library Journal. And people seem to like it. I&#8217;m excited that people know the story now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything you want to try and accomplish before the end of the year?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I have a lot of projects coming up. So I&#8217;m a job-oriented person. So in my mind, my whole life is a series of tasks that I have to achieve. And I break it down from year, and I break it down to week, and I break it down to month. And I know what I got to do the rest of this year. And there&#8217;s a lot of stuff I got to do.<br>
So it just was just announced that I&#8217;m doing a book about &#8230; there&#8217;s a story of Raymond Santana, who is one of the Central Park five, the exonerated Central Park Five, if I may add. You may know the story about these five African American young men who were wrongly accused of raping a white woman in Central Park in the &#8217;80s. They all went to jail for this crime that they did not do. They were all eventually exonerated, but they all suffered horribly. In the early 2000s, they were awarded an apology and some money from it, but the story itself is scarring. Ava DuVernay did a really beautiful film about it that I think is still on TV, on-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
On Netflix, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, on Netflix. And also, there&#8217;s a beautiful documentary by Ken Burns and his daughter about it. It&#8217;s an extraordinary and heartbreaking story about not just these specific young men&#8217;s lives, but also how Black men are treated. Matter of fact, I love the title of DuVernay&#8217;s film, which is When They See Us. If you&#8217;re a Black man living in America, you know exactly what that means. Anyway, I&#8217;m doing a graphic novel based on his memoirs. That is something I have to start working on this year.<br>
I have a book that I&#8217;ve already written and finished, and it&#8217;s coming out next May, that I wrote. This is the first book that I&#8217;ve written, so that&#8217;s why &#8230; I&#8217;ve written a lot of articles about music and things like that, but this is my first book that I&#8217;ve ever written. And that one is about &#8230; it&#8217;s called My Dad&#8217;s a DJ. It&#8217;s about my relationship with my kids. And after I divorced my ex-wife &#8230; Well, she divorced me [inaudible 00:08:55] put it, we went on and had this relationship through music. And you know how the music that I like, old school, &#8217;70s, Prince and Stevie Wonder and all that, and they liked the hip-hop cats &#8230; And then we used to have these sorts of agreements and disagreements about music. And then we finally connected. So the book is really about staying together with your kids after a divorce. And that book is coming out in May next year.<br>
So all these things are going on. I also have another book that I&#8217;m working on. I could keep going on about it. So I guess to answer your question more succinctly, I have a lot of assignments. I&#8217;m going to try to get as much of them done as I can. And I&#8217;m going to try to get some rest too, because I don&#8217;t want to lose my mind.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. I mean, it sounds like you&#8217;re working on a lot of stuff. And I want to dig more into your illustration work, but let&#8217;s talk a little bit about your day job. We don&#8217;t have to spend a whole lot of time on it, but you mentioned working at an ad agency. Can you tell me a little bit about that?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m pharmaceutical advertising designer. That means that I&#8217;m designing ads and product packaging for different brands. One of the last ones that I did that had a pretty big campaign that went on to get well known was called Taltz, which is a type of drug that helps with people who have eczema. And I first came to the agency to work on testosterone trucks, which was interesting, but then it was changed to work on this. So it&#8217;s been something I&#8217;ve been doing now for a number of years because, as I said, I have children. I was married at the time. And I was trying to make a living doing that, even though my main goal all my life was to be an illustrator and to be an artist and to draw. But then you have to do what you have to do to take care of your family.<br>
So I had a friend who was into advertising and said, &#8220;You should try this. This would be something you should do.&#8221; And I had dabbled in advertising because I had worked on some small magazines, so I taught myself things like Quark and Photoshop and a lot of Adobe Creative Suite. So I knew how to do those things. And I just figured it just takes a little creativity to lay out an advertising. And then I started out small, working for a small African American agency, when I was living in Louisville, Kentucky for a few years. And when I was there, I got a job working at Churchill Downs. And then after Churchill Downs, I decided that I was an art director and I was a graphic designer. And I decided to put aside illustration for a while, although I was still doing it on the side for myself and for small publications.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you balance your illustration projects with your day job projects? I mean, doing work for big pharma, I mean, given the current climate that we&#8217;re in, pretty stable. I mean people are always going to get sick. But how do you balance that with your outside illustration work?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
I think I&#8217;m in a fairly unique situation in that I&#8217;ve been doing it so long that I&#8217;ve reached sort of a senior position where I don&#8217;t do as much of the nuts and bolts designing as much as I do in leading teams. And so that means that I don&#8217;t have to necessarily be there in the office, be part of the day-to-day, because I&#8217;ve just been doing it, when you have a certain amount of knowledge of the business and understanding what is expected of you. I work with younger designers, so I don&#8217;t put as many man hours as maybe somebody who&#8217;s just getting into the business. And so then I just schedule and balance my hours with book projects, magazine projects, album cover projects.<br>
And also, I&#8217;m pretty fast with my illustration. I work very quickly. So if I get an assignment, I can turn it around relatively quickly so that I have time to stay with my day job, which I&#8217;ll probably stick with for a little while longer. But eventually I want to, and I&#8217;ve told my employer this, so I&#8217;m not saying anything I don&#8217;t want anyone to know, phase it out so that I can focus entirely on the illustration work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like you&#8217;ve, I guess, found a pretty happy medium, then?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, because you want to have that security. You&#8217;ve got to be able to take care of your mortgage, and all that stuff. But at the same time you have to have that happiness. One of the things I&#8217;ve learned from being around a lot of jazz musicians is they&#8217;re the happiest people I know, and they never die. They live forever. And I think it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re doing exactly what they want to do. I know jazz musicians that are pretty well-known and really talented, who struggle financially, especially when the pandemic was going on. They didn&#8217;t have anywhere to play. And there are some that are so well established, they&#8217;re okay. I don&#8217;t know, Ron Carter, the great bass player, I don&#8217;t think he worries about that. But there was a lot of young musicians who are quite brilliant, who weren&#8217;t working.<br>
I see it the same way. It&#8217;s like I have to eventually take that chance that working in the corporate world and stepping away from it so that I can do the thing that I really love, because I want to be happy. And not saying that doing design just makes me unhappy. And I&#8217;m happy this skill gave me and it got my kids through school and it bought me a house and all that stuff. But it just doesn&#8217;t fulfill me in a way that illustration does.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I think that&#8217;s fair. As a creative, I mean, the things that sort give you that inspiration may not necessarily be the job I think that you work at. But I would also say, and this is for anyone, I think, that just does other projects on the side, sometimes you have to do the thing you don&#8217;t want to do in order to do the thing that you want to do. I feel like that&#8217;s sometimes career advice that people don&#8217;t really get told a whole lot. But no, I mean it sounds like you found that balance, though.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
I totally agree with what you just said. I sometimes teach classes at schools, about art design, or I come in or do workshops or stuff like that occasionally. And a lot of kids, they go to where I went, like Parsons, or SVA, School Visual Design, or FIT. And they come out and they think, &#8220;Okay, now I&#8217;m going to be this amazing designer, and I&#8217;m going to do fashion magazines, and I&#8217;m going to do all this super slick stuff. And I&#8217;m going to design for Beyonce and I&#8217;m going to design for&#8221; &#8230; whatever it is they think they&#8217;re going to do. And they think it&#8217;s all going to be glamorous.<br>
But sometimes you got to do stuff that&#8217;s not so exciting, because there&#8217;s all kinds of design out there. There&#8217;s everything from &#8230; I started off, at one point, I was doing catalogs, which I wouldn&#8217;t wish on my worst enemy. And not to criticize anyone who&#8217;s doing it, but I found it very difficult. And certain types of design is not as glamorous, or even you find out it&#8217;s not as glamorous as you thought, which is what my experience was with doing comic books.<br>
All my young life, I always thought, &#8220;Oh my God, I want to draw Marvel comics.&#8221; I mean, that&#8217;s all I wanted to do. And I drew comics by myself in my room when I was eight years old or seven years old. And I drew comics with my friends. And I went to the school I went to, thinking I&#8217;d get to do it, and I got to do it. And when I was actually there doing it, I realized, &#8220;Wow, this is a job. This is work. I have to be adult, because I have to meet deadlines, and they have to put out a certain amount of pages, and they have to be a certain level of quality. And I have people looking over my shoulder telling me what&#8217;s good and what&#8217;s not good.&#8221; So a lot of things are like that, right? It&#8217;s like you got to put the work in, you got to put the time in. And you have to figure out, &#8220;Do I want to break through to do this thing?&#8221; I think I heard an interview you did with Ray Billingsley?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
The great cartoonist. And he was saying something similar where he was saying that he&#8217;s one of those guys who really learned his craft. I mean, we know him from his cartoon strip, his comic strip, but actually, he could draw all kinds of things. And he tried everything, and he worked on it, and then he honed it down to this project that he has now been doing for a lot of years. But it was a lot of work and thought behind it. It wasn&#8217;t something he decided one day, &#8220;I could draw pretty good. I think I&#8217;ll draw a comic strip.&#8221;<br>
I do think we all have to pay our dues, in a certain form. And my paying my dues for a long time was doing graphic design. Now having said that, I know a lot of people, that&#8217;s all they do, and they do it way better than me, and they&#8217;re beautiful. And they&#8217;re excited about it every day and they love doing design. And I still love graphic design, to a certain amount, but it doesn&#8217;t give me the same high that drawing does, because I think I started off wanting to draw, more than anything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. For folks who haven&#8217;t heard that Ray Billingsley interview, it&#8217;s episode 370. Go check it out. It&#8217;s a really good interview. When you have a new illustration project that comes in, whether that&#8217;s a book or whatever else you might be working on, what does your creative process look like? Take me into that process.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
I could talk about a book or I could talk about an album cover or I could talk about a magazine, because some of them are different lengths of time that you immerse yourself in it. But I&#8217;ll just mention the one I just did for a magazine called Rethinking Schools, which is a wonderful magazine that is for teaching teachers how to teach children. Teachers write articles in the magazine, and they explain the techniques they used that were effective, so other teachers could use it. It&#8217;s a great magazine. And they used a lot of illustration. I did a full-page illustration a couple of months ago for them. And the process was the art director came to me and said, &#8220;This is an article. I&#8217;m sending it to you. See if you want to do this, see if this is something you think you would be interested in. This is how much we pay.&#8221; And basically, the article was about how this one teacher wanted to teach children about Black Lives Matter through dance. She was a dancing teacher, and she wanted to teach choreography to these kids in a private school.<br>
And so, I came up with these drawings of the kids dancing to this sort of music that they sort of describe in the BLM article. And I just came up with sketches first. They approve them, and then you start to paint them in. And then they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Well, this figure, we like better than that figure.&#8221; And you take them out and you put them in. So my thing is I do a mixture between digital and traditional, with the accent on the traditional. I draw everything out by hand, on paper usually. And then I scan it in and either I paint on it or I use digital colors, like out of Photoshop, or something like that, or sometimes it&#8217;s a combination of both things.<br>
As we go to the final art, I do watercolor because I like the spontaneity of it and I like the fact that I can&#8217;t really control it 100%, and that it can just some suddenly do something that I didn&#8217;t expect it to do. And that could be scary because it might not be something I wanted to do, but it also means that something exciting can happen. And whenever I do something and it feels static to me or it doesn&#8217;t look interesting or it&#8217;s not moving, I always miss the watercolor element, which is the thing that makes it to me feel spontaneous and alive, which is also connected to why I like jazz so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
See, I was just about to ask, because I noticed that theme of a lot of your work being done in watercolors. But it sounds like you like to have a little bit of that unknown element in the work?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I appreciate a lot of illustrators&#8217; work where they spend a lot of time planning every single illustration out to an nth degree, and the colors, and they have palettes, and they do hundreds of preliminary drawings and sketches, and things like that. And I do do some of that. But I like the idea of, I don&#8217;t know, just kind of going with the feeling. I mean, I&#8217;ve even had times where I&#8217;ve done a book, where I didn&#8217;t even finish reading the book, the whole script or the manuscript of the book, and was doing the illustrations without even having read it all. I probably shouldn&#8217;t say that out loud, so if anyone who wants to hire me. But if I like the basic idea, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay&#8221; &#8230; Like the first book I got published was in 2019. It was called Birth of the Cool: How Miles Davis Found His Sound, which could not have been a more perfect first book for me, because I love Miles.<br>
And I just thought the idea of doing a children&#8217;s book about Miles was kind of brilliant, even though I couldn&#8217;t figure exactly how they were going to do it, because Miles was not always kid-friendly. But I read two or three pages of the script and I said, &#8220;Ah, I see what she&#8217;s doing.&#8221; So I just started doing it. And I actually read the book as I was doing the illustrations, which anyone would tell you is insane, because you should plan the whole thing out. I just read the descriptions of what the action was, and not the actual dialogue, or even all the text. But I wanted it to feel like jazz and I wanted it to feel as spontaneous as he is, and how he takes a moment. I mean, that&#8217;s why jazz is so important to see live, or live recordings are the best, in my opinion, because everybody is not actually sure of what they&#8217;re going to be doing that day in that performance. And it could be brilliant and it could be not the best thing they ever did.<br>
I&#8217;m lucky enough to be in a position where it&#8217;s just the way I do things. I don&#8217;t really know any other way of doing it. And I think that if I drew the whole thing out and knew exactly what I was going to do, it would feel too much like work. So this way, it feels like I&#8217;m just doing art. It just happens to be following a specific storyline, because I also like storytelling, which is why I wanted to get into comics in the first place. But in comics, it&#8217;s way more structured.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the most challenging part about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
I think just finishing, for me. It always seems incredibly like, &#8220;How can I ever finish this? This is huge. There&#8217;s so much to do.&#8221; And there&#8217;s that famous quote someone said, where, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like writing, but I like having written.&#8221; I do feel that way. It&#8217;s like I could see the book in my head completed, but I don&#8217;t particularly like the process, in the sense that I can&#8217;t wait for it to be done. I want to see the book in my hands. I want to see it all drawn, but I know that that means many hours of work.<br>
I just got a project recently that I&#8217;m very excited about. It hasn&#8217;t been announced officially yet, but we&#8217;ve already kind of signed everything. So it&#8217;s a book about this relationship between Malcolm X and this Japanese woman who was also an activist, and their friendship. And it&#8217;s very unusual, it&#8217;s a true story, in the fact that most people don&#8217;t know about this. Also, the fact that the famous picture of when he was shot in the ballroom, there&#8217;s a woman holding, cradling his head. It was this Japanese woman. And so the writer saw this picture and decided to find out who this woman was. And she ended up writing this kid&#8217;s book about their relationship. Some of her activism comes out of the horrible story of the internment camps during World War II, they put Japanese in after Pearl Harbor. And she started off with that kind of activism, and then she folded into other kinds of activism. And they became friends, mostly correspondence, with Malcolm X.<br>
Anyway, I&#8217;m working on this book now. We were having a story conference with the publishers the other day, with my agent. And we were talking about what the book was going to look like and what it was going to sound like, and what kind of tone. And I could see the whole book in my head in five minutes. And I was like, &#8220;I just wish I could just snap my fingers and it was done,&#8221; because I want to see the book more than I want to make it, because it really comes down to work.<br>
I think Alfred Hitchcock said once that when he came with a story like, I don&#8217;t know, Psycho, or something, or The Birds, once he had the storyboards and he had the script done, to him, that thing was done. He said all the work of having to get the actors and go on set and shoot everything was the least interesting part to him. And I really relate to that because that&#8217;s the mechanics of it. It&#8217;s the conception of it that I think is the most exciting. But I do have a lot of fun in the midst of painting, when I&#8217;m actually doing it, too. So I always say that I don&#8217;t want to do the work, but when I&#8217;m really in it, I kind of forget I&#8217;m working. So it works both ways. But I do want to see the thing done, but usually before I can finish it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m interested to see that too. Yuri Kochiyama is the activist that you&#8217;re talking about?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d be excited to see that book when it&#8217;s done.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Oh yeah, I&#8217;m going to put 1,000% in that one. I think it&#8217;s a beautiful, beautiful story. And I think it&#8217;s a story that should be told. I love the idea of people of different cultures, races coming together in a cause. I mean, I don&#8217;t want to exaggerate their relationship, it was a short one, but it was significant to Malcolm. It was significant to her, and their families. And then I think we don&#8217;t do enough of that. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever read anything like that, or any story about an Asian person and a Black person together on a common cause, in a huge sort of undertaking like human rights or activism. So I want people to see this book so bad. I want it out there. I want it in stores now. I just got to get it there. I felt the same way about Miles. I felt the same way about John Lewis. I felt the same way, My Dad&#8217;s a DJ. I want people to see it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit and learn more about you, about your origin story. You live in Brooklyn right now, but you&#8217;re originally from Staten Island, is that correct?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, it was an interesting place to grow up in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you remember growing up there?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Actually, I lived in a pretty diverse neighborhood. My best friend who lived next door to me was Jewish, and we had Filipinos living a couple of doors away, and we had Irish and Polish, and we had Latinos, Puerto Rican and Dominicans, all in the neighborhood. So the attitude, I think a lot of people think of Staten Island now, especially from recent events, that it&#8217;s like this totally red part of New York, full of Joe Plumbers, and stuff like that. But it wasn&#8217;t like that when I grew up, although there was also a really strong Sicilian community of Italians that we didn&#8217;t really connect with as much. But we had this one little thing, it was called Stapleton, Staten Island. Also, this is the same area where Wutang started their thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, that&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Their projects was probably about a quarter mile from the little neighborhood I grew up in. I grew up in a house, and my dad was a physician, my mom was a bank teller. So I guess you&#8217;d call it near middle class, because I had my own room, and I had a house, and I had everything I needed. But we weren&#8217;t rich or anything, because my dad was still a student when I was growing up, and my mom worked full time at a bank.<br>
But it was a pretty nice upbringing in terms of how I saw the world. It until I get older that I realized that there was things like severe racism and things like that. So I was able to fantasize and not worry about my place in the world as much, and dealing with things like that. So I plunged into the world of Marvel comics and fantasy books and science fiction, like Isaac Asimov, and people like that. So that was the thing that I was into when I was a kid, and also music, The Beatles. And I liked The Beatles the same way that I liked Stevie Wonder. I didn&#8217;t have any boundaries in how I saw music and art.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it sounds like you grew up around a lot of music, but you also kind of grew up around a lot of art, too?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
No, that&#8217;s the interesting thing. My mom was a singer, but she sang in the choir, and she had a beautiful voice. She even got accepted to Juilliard at one point and couldn&#8217;t go, because my grandfather couldn&#8217;t afford to send her there. So we always had a lot of records in the house, so I was always listening to music. I would read every word in the liner notes and read everything on the back 15,000 times. And I was a fanatic about LPs and music.<br>
Art really wasn&#8217;t there. I think I came by art almost completely through comic books and wanting to draw comic books of my own. And I didn&#8217;t really know anything about art history or anything like that until I got to high school. I went to a high school of art design, which was in Manhattan. And it still exists, obviously. It was a great school. I started to learn about painting and drawing. Then I got interested in things beyond comics at that point. But before that, I don&#8217;t know if anybody else in my family even drew.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think comics was probably a good gateway for a lot of people. I mean, especially if I&#8217;m thinking about the time that you grew up, and especially with starting to see more Black people in comics too, I would imagine that probably was really inspiring to see back then.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. It was huge, huge, huge. Trevor Von Eeden, who created Black Lightning, who&#8217;s a little bit about the same age as me, there&#8217;s a legendary story about how he sent his drawings to DC Comics on loose leaf paper, because he didn&#8217;t have any other kind of paper.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
And they sat down with him, and started giving him gigs. But the big one for me was a guy named Billy Graham. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re familiar with him. He did a lot of the early Black Panther comics. He basically was the writer that created Killmonger, the characters in the movies. He did these magnificent stories, one particular one called Panther&#8217;s Rage. The same story that&#8217;s basically in the movie is in that story, which is that Killmonger, the character [inaudible 00:29:45] played by Michael Jordan in the film, kind of takes him down as being prince, and challenges his leadership of Wakanda.<br>
That was a Billy Graham thing. He was one of the very few Blacks that were in the business. Brilliant guy. He was also a playwright, a painter. He was just this amazing guy. I only met him once for a few minutes, but I was in awe of him. But most of the people that I liked, if I&#8217;m being completely honest, were like Jack Kirby and Neil Adams and Stan Lee, and those guys. I mean, they were all like gods me. I mean, if I had a choice between meeting Paul Newman or Tom Cruise or Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, I probably would&#8217;ve done the latter. I mean, those were the guys who were the big heroes to me when I was a kid, that were the comic book artists.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you were inspired by comic books. You went to this art high school. And then after you graduated, you attended Parsons. What was your time like there?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
It was good, but it was less about comics. By then, I had done a little time working in comics, and decided it wasn&#8217;t for me. So I wanted to learn to paint in a different way or draw in a different way, and not be just in comics. I mean, the comic influence is there. It will be there till the day I die. And I still draw comics sometimes, or cartoons, but I don&#8217;t draw superheroes or things anymore; not that I have anything against them. But my thing when I was at Marvel and also in general about superhero stuff is that a lot of times these things are &#8230; even then, before the movies came out and became this massive thing, a billion dollar company, is that they&#8217;re all copyrighted characters owned by somebody else. So there&#8217;s not much you can do with them. You have to stay with the continuity that you&#8217;re given. You have to be explained what you can do, what you can&#8217;t do. Even you and a writer have to follow a larger storyline that maybe is being planned throughout the company.<br>
And I always had this itching feeling to want to have my own characters and have my own thing. So I wanted to learn illustration because I wanted to express myself more as an individual and less as just a sort of a cog in this massive machine. I mean, every month, on the dot, you had to have a new Marvel comic. And I think only the very, very best guys got recognition for what they did. But I don&#8217;t think I was the best at that. I was okay.<br>
So I really wanted to express myself in a different way. I still love comics, especially independent comics. I&#8217;m more interested now in people like the Hernandez Brothers, Love and Rockets. I love it. It&#8217;s probably my favorite cartoon, is Jaime Hernandez &#8230; than now, than superhero stuff, because these guys are independent. And they own their own characters and they create their own worlds that are basically coming from them. And they&#8217;re not in it for the money. They&#8217;re in it because they just had to do it. And I admire that more than being just another person drawing Spider-Man, out of the thousands that have done it over the years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So Parsons, it sounds like, opened your eyes a little bit to the reality of what the industry was like?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Precisely. Exactly. I started getting interested in modern artists. I started getting interested in abstract artists. I love Rothko. The Expressionists is my favorite type of painting, so de Gaulle&#8217;s my favorite painter. I began to appreciate art for what it is and the endless limitations that art can provide, and not these sort of commercial concerns of just trying to sell something or sell a character.<br>
Now, I don&#8217;t have anything against people who do that. There are some brilliant kids and artists doing this stuff now. I love them. I love looking at the drawings. I love looking at Greg Capullo or Jim Lee or Frank Miller, when he was doing it, and David Mazzucchelli. These were all comic book artists. These guys are freaking awesome. I just don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m built to do this stuff, myself. But I love to look at their work.<br>
There&#8217;s a guy named Bill Sienkiewicz who does comics, but he also is a great, great illustrator. And guy like him, he&#8217;s like a god to me. So all these guys are great. I just know that I can&#8217;t do comics, because it&#8217;s just not, unless I do a personal comic, like doing this graphic novel about the Central Park Five. I&#8217;m working on now one about a jazz musician. So if I can find my way in, then it&#8217;s absolutely the greatest, but if I have to just &#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I couldn&#8217;t be one of those people who&#8217;s doing, I don&#8217;t know, SpongeBob comics, or something. I got to do something that I got some kind of skin in the game.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, yeah, I mean, it sounds like you&#8217;re in it for the storytelling medium. It&#8217;s not just so much like a way of telling a story in terms of, &#8220;Oh, here&#8217;s SpongeBob. And we&#8217;re going to do it via animation.&#8221; It&#8217;s more like, &#8220;What&#8217;s the story we can tell that animation can provide sort of,&#8221; I don&#8217;t know, &#8220;that bit of oomph to it,&#8221; I guess. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly. Somebody was telling me the other day that they had a gig at some Pixar. And they said, &#8220;Dude, they&#8217;re looking for artists, illustrators to maybe come in and work with Pixar movies.&#8221;<br>
And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I mean, that sounds great in terms of financially and also prestige and stuff, but I don&#8217;t really want to get bogged down working on some massive project where a hundred other artists are working on it.&#8221; Even if it&#8217;s good, like I thought &#8230; What was that one about the jazz position that came out?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Soul.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
I thought it was real good, but I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d want to have worked on it, because it requires years of work, hundreds of people. And I&#8217;d rather work on my little book, where it&#8217;s just me alone in a room and a writer writing a script, and then five, six months later, it&#8217;s in a bookstore, and it&#8217;s got our names on it.<br>
To me, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;d rather do that, even if it means I&#8217;m making less money or not part of a huge, famous organization, that I could tell everybody, &#8220;I work at Pixar, or I work at so-and-so.&#8221; Even when I worked at Marvel, I mean, people would be impressed when I said I worked at Marvel. But I didn&#8217;t care about that part because I knew that I was doing stuff I wasn&#8217;t even really that inspired by. So it doesn&#8217;t matter that people were enamored by it. It was more about the fact that I had to still sit down by myself at some point and try to meet a deadline for something that I didn&#8217;t love. But having said that, there are people I know who do love it. And God bless them, because they do some beautiful work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you did eventually, I don&#8217;t know, I guess maybe fulfill that childhood dream. You did do some work for Marvel.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. And then I saw what it was. Everybody finds out what the reality of things is and what things really are; like a lot of people think they want to be movie stars. A lot of people think they want to be pop stars. And then they find out what it&#8217;s really like. And sometimes the stress is so much they can&#8217;t handle it at all.<br>
My son is an independent musician. He has a band, and he has albums out, and he goes on tour. And one of the things we often talk about is if it ever happens that he blows up, get ready, because it might not be what you want. And even in the little bit of brushes of stuff that he&#8217;s seen, by just opening for bigger acts and things like that and seeing how these guys live, they say a lot of it is really difficult, because once you&#8217;re famous and people know who you are, or even if you&#8217;re just known by people to be successful, it gets to be more about that than about the music, which is what you came in there to do in the first place.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I relate to that so hard, I mean, for two reasons. I mean, I think, one, from the musician standpoint. So I might have said this on the show before, but before I got into anything, design, whatever, I was a musician. I grew up playing trombone. I played it all through middle school, through high school. I played it in college. I played it a few years after college as a session musician. But I loved it. I still love music. I was a jazz trombonist. But it&#8217;s not making any money. You&#8217;re not making any real money. And the hours are wild and crazy. You have to do it because you love it. You&#8217;re certainly not doing it to get rich or to get any sort of financial stability, unless you really get a deal with a label, and then you record an EP or an LP or something, and you blow up that way.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. And I&#8217;m going to be honest, I mean in jazz, I don&#8217;t see anybody getting rich. I actually [inaudible 00:37:46]-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Not in this country. Absolutely not.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
I work for one of the most successful jazz musicians there is. And he does well. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s hurting, but he ain&#8217;t rich.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He ain&#8217;t rich, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
He ain&#8217;t no multimillionaire. I do all of his covers, and he and I are friends. But I know he&#8217;s very well known in the jazz world, but outside of the jazz world, the guy&#8217;s won like six Grammys. I mean, he&#8217;s a genius. But it doesn&#8217;t matter, because there&#8217;s a limited audience for that type of music, unless you&#8217;re somebody like Herbie Hancock who&#8217;s become a legendary figure. And not only is he legendary figure, but he&#8217;s also even done pop hits, like Rocket, and everything. So he&#8217;s a guy who&#8217;s transcended jazz in order to have the success that he has. But also, he&#8217;s a legendary iconic figure, so he&#8217;s almost beyond human. I mean, he&#8217;s like this person who&#8217;s been doing it so long and has become so famous that people just give him money just for existing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;re talking about Wynton Marsalis, right?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Well, I was actually just talking about Herbie Hancock.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, okay. But I mean, when you mentioned this artist that you&#8217;ve done covers for, though.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Oh no, that&#8217;s Christian McBride. Christian McBride. Do you know Christian McBride, Maurice?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I do. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve done his last eight covers. He&#8217;s a friend of mine. One of my best friends was his manager. Some years ago, he started a new band called Inside Straight. And instead of getting a photo shoot done, my friend, knowing that I was an illustrator, asked me to do the cover. And then he and I began a creative sort of partnership [inaudible 00:39:19] the visualization of his music.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
So a lot of his album that I&#8217;ve done covers for, also LPs, vinyl LPs, he has won Grammys for. And I never know if I&#8217;m going to get to do it next year, because that&#8217;s one of those things that I wait for him and I hear Christian&#8217;s voice say, &#8220;Hey, Brother Brown, I got another cover for you.&#8221; But I never know if he&#8217;s going to call me. But I&#8217;ve done eight so far.<br>
So people who don&#8217;t know Christian is he, he&#8217;s a bass player, composer, band leader. When Sting started his first band, Sting the pop singer from The Police, he was his bass player. Sting&#8217;s a bass player, so that tells you something about the greatness of him. But he&#8217;s also played with everybody who means anything. He&#8217;s played with every single musician there is. He&#8217;s a genius player. So I consider that to be one of the proudest things that I&#8217;ve ever done as an illustrator, is do his artwork. He also heads the Newport Jazz Festival. He has a radio show on NPR, called Jazz Tonight. He&#8217;s just an incredible human being, and one most talented people I&#8217;ve ever met.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I think it sort of speaks to sort what you said earlier about jazz not being super popular. You kind of end up having to do a lot of different things just within your musicianship in order to make that happen; like with Christian, you said he&#8217;s heading up this jazz festival and he does a radio show. You almost have to have your hand in a bunch of different pots, instead of just focusing on maybe performing or touring or something.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, if you want to make money.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Look. Yeah. Hey, that is the truth.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:40:48] And as you know, the only way to make money nowadays is no longer in recording. It&#8217;s in &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Merch.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
&#8230; merch and touring. And so, going back to what I was saying earlier, when the pandemic went down, I mean, a lot of these guys weren&#8217;t making any money. If you&#8217;re in jazz, it&#8217;s particularly painful because that&#8217;s the only way you make money, going on jazz tours to other countries, because jazz obviously is appreciated in Asia and Europe. So, that&#8217;s where they make their money. If you can&#8217;t go anywhere, then you can&#8217;t depend on the recordings. Even in the best days of jazz, they never sell anything like the way pop music does. So I mean, a flop record by Ed Sheeran still sells 100 times more than [inaudible 00:41:32]-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Than a jazz record. No, that&#8217;s the truth.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
&#8230; and that&#8217;s just the way it is. But I like being connected with someone with so much integrity. And he also gives me an incredible amount of freedom in what I get to do on his covers. That&#8217;s why it works for me, because even though I&#8217;m illustrating, in the true sense of the word, which is that I&#8217;m doing a drawing based on a previous idea and telling a story, he&#8217;s not looking over my shoulder and saying, &#8220;Do it like this.&#8221; I mean, sometimes he&#8217;ll have notes or something, but he trusts me to know what I&#8217;m doing.<br>
That&#8217;s a lot different than doing other kinds of commercial illustration, where you have to do everything precisely the way you&#8217;re being told, and if you don&#8217;t do it that way &#8230; And also, for me, in children&#8217;s books, I&#8217;ve had the same experience. I mean, I interpret the words that are in the script of the books that I do. And I may get feedback and editors talking to me about it, but we can usually discuss it. It&#8217;s not something where somebody says, &#8220;You have to do it this way, or you&#8217;re fired.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t work that way. And that&#8217;s a little different than the real world is, including in advertising.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, you just touched on so many points that just hit me just personally in terms of-</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Go for it, brother.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; musicians and design, and all that sort of stuff. I mean, yeah, yeah, wow. Wow. I want to talk about your work with Churchill Downs, your work with Jazz at Lincoln Center. I know I mentioned Marsalis earlier, but you got to work at some pretty prestigious institutions, early in your career.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, I consider myself incredibly fortunate. The reason I was in Louisville, Kentucky was because my former wife was a professor at the University of Louisville. So I showed up there with no real skills, and didn&#8217;t know what I was going to do. And I had to get a job. I got a job at a small African American-owned advertising agency. And I was still learning my craft at that point. And an African American woman named Cindy Cook, who was a supervisor at Churchill Downs, asked me if I&#8217;d be interested, because she said, &#8220;We want to start a graphics department in Churchill Downs. And there&#8217;s no Black people working there at all, doing anything, except me. I wanted to bring somebody else Black in there. And we don&#8217;t even know how to use computers or know how to do anything. So you&#8217;re going to have to order the computers and find the programs.&#8221;<br>
Basically, it was to do the marketing for the park, and the programs and the posters, and everything like that. It was challenging because I was just new to it myself. And this goes so far back, I don&#8217;t even think there was InDesign yet. I think it was Quark or something, if anybody&#8217;s old enough to remember that, listening to this. I did it. And then while I was doing it, I made friends with a gentleman named Andre Guess, who was a really good friend of mine when I was living in Louisville. And he got a job at Jazz at Lincoln Center, because Wynton would come to Louisville and do concerts. And we were such big jazz fans, after the show, Wynton Marsalis is the type of a guy, he would sit around after every concert &#8230; I don&#8217;t care if it was a four-hour concert, he would stand around and meet everybody and sign every autograph.<br>
So we&#8217;d go talk to him. And after a few years of doing that, he got to know who we were. And he would have dinner at Andre&#8217;s house, at one point. We became friends with him. He said, &#8220;Well, listen. I&#8217;m building this thing. It&#8217;s never been done before. It&#8217;s a whole venue just for jazz. It&#8217;s going to be called Jazz at Lincoln Center, and I&#8217;m going to run it.&#8221; And so he hired my friend to be an administrator. I think it was a financial officer, or something like that. And then my friend told me, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to go up there. And I&#8217;m not going to leave you behind, though. In a year, I&#8217;m going to bring you there.&#8221; Almost a year to the day, he calls me and says, &#8220;Come to New York. You&#8217;ve got to come back to New York now.&#8221; And he [inaudible 00:45:12] he wasn&#8217;t from New York. My friend was from Kentucky.<br>
So I came to New York, they interviewed me. It was a very intimidating interview because it was at a table full of the board of directors. A lot of famous people were on the board of directors, including the boxer, George Foreman, and Judith Jamison, the great dancer, Al Roker, the newsman. They&#8217;re people who contributed money and were part of the board of directors. And they interviewed me. And I was leaving out of the office, the place. And the receptionist, Mel, who&#8217;s still a friend of mine, she said, &#8220;Wynton&#8217;s on the phone.&#8221;<br>
And I was like, &#8220;Oh, shit. He&#8217;s going to tell me not to come back, because I didn&#8217;t get the job.&#8221;<br>
And handed me the phone. And he came on and he goes, &#8220;You&#8217;re a bad motherfucker.&#8221;<br>
It was like, &#8220;Really?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Wynton?&#8221;<br>
He goes, &#8220;Yeah, get your ass back here in two weeks.&#8221; So I got the job. And I worked for them for about five years. And from there is when I started doing advertising, because after a while, I felt like I did as much as I could do there. But through there, I got to meet so many incredible musicians, jazz and otherwise, because they used to have amazing musicians come there to do benefits. So people like Stevie Wonder came and Ray Charles came and Paul Simon came, and it was just an incredible, incredible experience.<br>
And they&#8217;re nonprofit. So the whole point of view of Jazz at Lincoln Center is to teach people about jazz and [inaudible 00:46:34] jazz still lives, and that it&#8217;s in existence, and you should go see it. You should appreciate it. It&#8217;s not what you think it is, and all that. So it was great. And I got to design for them, and I got to meet a lot of incredible other designers, and be part of the community of graphic designers in New York, the whole time thinking in my mind, &#8220;I really want to be an illustrator. But this is great.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, to me, that sounds like a dream job. You&#8217;re doing design, you&#8217;re surrounded by jazz. That sounds like, for me, that would be perfect.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Oh, it was, for a while. All good things come to an end; like any organization, there&#8217;s changes, and things happen, and it&#8217;s not what it was when you first started. And new people come in and they have their own ideas. I have nothing bad to say about it. It was a decision I made, as well as something that I loved. But you can&#8217;t stay any one place forever.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
And ironically, after working in advertising for a few years, I ended up going back into the music and being the art director for Blue Note Jazz Clubs.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. I was there for about four years. So Blue Note Jazz, people think of the one club in New York, but they actually have clubs all over the world, in Madrid, Milan, Japan, Hawaii. I was their art director for several years. So again, I was in this club. I was back in my jazz world. I was in heaven, because I love jazz musicians. Jazz musicians are some of the most even-keeled people, artists there are, because they don&#8217;t make any money. They don&#8217;t get rich. They&#8217;re just doing it because they love it, and they&#8217;re happy to be doing it.<br>
If you can make a living doing something you like doing it, then you&#8217;re a happy person. So they tend to be not arrogant, tend to be happy, tend to be hardworking, tend to be very committed and focused, because to be a good musician, as you know, it takes an incredible amount of concentration, rehearsal, practice and focus. And they&#8217;re always thinking of what they&#8217;re going to do next. So being around those people makes you better at what you do. So it makes you better at your art, because you see the commitment they have. I said, &#8220;Damn, I need to get serious about what I&#8217;m doing, because these motherfuckers are kicking ass, what they&#8217;re doing.&#8221; You see somebody play, you see Herbie or Chick Corea come up there, sweat their ass off and play, and they get off and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;What you going to do now?&#8221;<br>
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to go get some chicken wings.&#8221;<br>
I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Damn, man. This guy just killed himself. But now he&#8217;s done, and now he&#8217;s going to go do something else.&#8221; And I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Oh my God, these guys, I want to be like them. I want to be like them.&#8221; So that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re the constant inspiration to me. It&#8217;s like total commitment and highest level of achievement, mixed with this sort of chill, like, &#8220;Yeah. Well, we&#8217;re here doing it,&#8221; type attitude. It&#8217;s beautiful, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to people out there? They&#8217;re hearing your story, they&#8217;re hearing all this about you. What advice would you give to people that want to follow in your footsteps?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
I just think you have to be honest with what you really want to do. I mean, listen, I understand practicality. I totally know that that is. I mean, I spent a lot of my life doing jobs. I&#8217;ve had all kinds of jobs. And I&#8217;ve done whatever it took to take care of myself or my family. But there also has to be this part of you that doesn&#8217;t lose the eyes on the prize. What is it you really want to do? What is it that makes you the happiest? And it doesn&#8217;t matter what it is. If it&#8217;s riding a unicycle backwards or being the world&#8217;s best juggler, whatever, you have to focus on that eventually, because you don&#8217;t want to spend the rest of your life just doing something that you just feel like you need to do in order to make a living. And I know that&#8217;s not always everybody&#8217;s path, but you have to work towards it, I think.<br>
I would say I spent a good half of my life doing things that I had to do. And now I&#8217;m having a half of my life where I&#8217;m doing things I want to do. And I think it&#8217;s worth doing that, whatever it is, whether it&#8217;s being a doctor or being a hedge fund manager or being a fireman. It&#8217;s the passion behind it that I think is important. And you shouldn&#8217;t deny yourself of that.<br>
Both my sons and musicians. Now, any parent will tell you, you don&#8217;t want your son to be a musician, for all the reasons I&#8217;ve already stated earlier. It&#8217;s hard to make a living, and you&#8217;re never probably going to be rich. But I can&#8217;t imagine them doing anything else, because they&#8217;re so deeply committed to it. And that&#8217;s all they want to talk about. I did a book about it because it&#8217;s such a focused commitment. Even more so than me, they knew what they wanted do before I did, in terms of their lives. So I guess my advice is always do what you have to do. No one&#8217;s going to fault you for that, but don&#8217;t forget what you want to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have a dream project that you&#8217;d love to do one day? It sounds like you&#8217;ve already touched on so many of your passions with your work.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
There&#8217;s specific things. Right now, I&#8217;m trying to get out a coffee book on jazz portraits I&#8217;ve done over the years, which is tougher than you would think to get printed and published. And the other thing is, some years ago I wanted to put out a book about Eric Dolphy. And I did a lot of preliminary work. I even did a Kickstarter. I could not get the book published, I could not get it finished. And I wrote a script, and I illustrated over half of it.<br>
And Eric Dolphy is a saxophone player, composer, who I actually am totally enamored with, in terms of his life trajectory. He was just a really nice guy who was committed to his art. And he died very young, in a very sad way, actually on a gurney in Germany from a diabetic shock. And the people that were there did not realize that he had that problem. And they thought he was just a Black musician who was on drugs, and didn&#8217;t take care of them the way they should have. But his life before that, he brushed against all the great musicians, Charles Mingus and John Coltrane, he played with for a lot of years, who loved him. And I wanted to do a graphic novel about him. And I did a lot of work on it, and I did a lot of things. But it&#8217;s one of those projects that keeps getting away. It fell through a couple of times. And I am just starting to resurrect it now. And if I can get that book done, I&#8217;ll die happy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at your career, is there a particular moment or an experience that really stands out to you the most, in your mind?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Can I break it down into two?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sure.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Okay. The first one is the one I just told you about, which is Wynton Marsalis telling me I was a bad motherfucker. The second one is, and it&#8217;s almost the opposite of that, but it gave me a motivation. I went to a comic book company early on, soon out of high school. I was starting to get small jobs to do things, but I didn&#8217;t really get anything major yet. And I won&#8217;t tell you which comic book company it is, but it&#8217;s a major one. It&#8217;s one of the big two. I showed them my portfolio, and the editor, the white editor looked at it and he said, &#8220;Yeah, this is pretty good, but we already got a colored artist. We already got one, so thanks for coming in.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Damn.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
And I just said &#8230; Can I? I won&#8217;t say the word &#8230; &#8220;F this guy.&#8221; And he ain&#8217;t stopping me. And I can say, even in this world, and I&#8217;m 60 years old, and I&#8217;ve seen racism of all kinds, but I&#8217;ve never really been held back when I really wanted to do something. I&#8217;ve had all kinds of opportunities, despite my race. I just don&#8217;t accept that as a reason for not achieving anything. My father was a doctor. My mother was the first Black woman to work in this bank that she worked in. I feel like if you really want something, you cannot use that. So I guess to answer your question, it was important to me that that that guy told me what he said, because I said, &#8220;F this guy. He&#8217;s not stopping me because I&#8217;m Black.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Before we wrap this up, and I meant to get to this earlier in the interview, you love jazz, I love jazz. Who are some contemporary jazz artists that you like?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Oh, that&#8217;s an interesting question. I like a lot of cats, man. One of them just passed away, but I still consider him contemporary. That&#8217;s Roy Hargrove. He&#8217;s an awesome cat. I think Christian&#8217;s pretty contemporary. There&#8217;s a young cat that&#8217;s out now called, named Joel Ross. He&#8217;s fantastic. Kamasi Washington is pretty awesome. I mean, I&#8217;m trying to think when. You&#8217;re 60 years old, you&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;Well, who&#8217;s contemporary,&#8221; because [inaudible 00:54:50] say Brad Mehldau, but Brad Mehldau been around for a minute, so maybe he&#8217;s not so contemporary. But you know what I&#8217;m saying. It&#8217;s like I hear cats all the time, man. I want to hear it. I want to hear the young guys. Joey Alexander is kind of a phenomenal young guy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, young kid.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Really young. I mean, he could play his ass off, though. There&#8217;s a lot of them, man. I mean, there&#8217;s so many. I occasionally write for a website called allaboutjazz.com, and I do do reviews. And I just did an interview with a cat named Croker, Theo Croker.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Theo. Theo Croker, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. And we did a nice interview. I painted him many times, too. He&#8217;s real good. Oh, my favorite young singer is C√©cile McLorin. She&#8217;s a brilliant jazz singer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, she&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
She&#8217;s modern. At the same time, she got the old school thing going on too. There&#8217;s a drummer I really like named Makaya McCraven. He&#8217;s pretty hot. Man, there&#8217;s so many cats out there, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, there is. There is.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Vijay Iyer. He&#8217;s a little bit on the older side, but Vijay could play, could play, could play. Tyshawn Sorey. Yeah, I feel like I&#8217;m having a conversation with my son. We&#8217;re always talking about music. He&#8217;s a little more on the edge than me. He always knows what&#8217;s going on more than I do. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Dad, you never heard of this guy? Man, you old.&#8221;<br>
And I was like, I said, &#8220;Buddy.&#8221;<br>
He said, &#8220;He been out about two, three years.&#8221;<br>
I said, &#8220;Son, I don&#8217;t [inaudible 00:56:13] two, three years. Two, three years is still new to me.&#8221; But yeah, there&#8217;s a ton of them. Anybody you like, Maurice?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You mentioned C√©cile. I like her. There&#8217;s actually a jazz singer I first found on TikTok, who&#8217;s really great, Samara Joy. She&#8217;s a jazz vocalist.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah [inaudible 00:56:35].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh my God, her voice is so good.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
She&#8217;s incredible, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then I like-</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve seen her live.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, oh. I want to see her live. I hope she comes to Atlanta one day. I know she&#8217;s playing at Blue Note next month in New York. I&#8217;m trying to think who else. I like a lot of bands, like Incognito. There was a time in, I would say, I don&#8217;t know, maybe mid to late &#8217;90s to early 2000s where you started to see this mix of jazz with other genres. So you would have jazz and hip hop, or jazz and R&#038;B, &#8220;neo soul.&#8221;<br>
So that&#8217;s how I started to find out about &#8230; well, that&#8217;s not necessarily how I started to find out about jazz artists, because I&#8217;ve been playing jazz through &#8230; I was in a jazz band in high school, and everything. So I had always kind of known about it, but it&#8217;s just interesting diving more into learning about other artists and just sort of the &#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I feel like for a while in the &#8217;70s there was just sort of a fine line between jazz and I guess what could be considered R&#038;B, where someone like a Roy Hargrove or a Roy Ayers or someone would tow that line a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, totally. I mean, my son&#8217;s favorite musician is D&#8217;Angelo. And if you have D&#8217;Angelo, you can take your finger and bring that to Erykah Badu, and you bring that [inaudible 00:57:47] and then to Robert Glasper [inaudible 00:57:49]-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, he&#8217;s so good. Robert Glasper is so good.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
And Robert Glasper, by the way, we were talking earlier about popular success, he&#8217;s probably the most successful jazz musician, if you call him a jazz musician. I don&#8217;t even know if I&#8217;d call him that anymore, because he works with so much pop. But he&#8217;s the epitome of the kid that grew up listening to hip-hop, but loved jazz, but also has jazz chops. So there&#8217;s always that element of hip-hop with jazz. So you got Robert. He played at Blue Note a lot recently. And he&#8217;s up there on a stage with Mos Def, Yasiin Bey, rather, and cats like that. So he&#8217;s doing that. He&#8217;s bridging the gap. So I do think you&#8217;re absolutely right that there&#8217;s a bridging the gap between old school jazz, Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis, and more contemporary music, hip-hop, funk, R&#038;B, mixed in with what could be called jazz, like Kendrick Scott, Nubi Garcia, who&#8217;s an English saxophone player.<br>
There&#8217;s just so many people who, for whatever reason, they got exposed to jazz, and they appreciate the musicianship of it. But then they also connect to where they&#8217;re coming from, which is their music. My music is R&#038;B from the 1970s. Their music is that. But they like the elements of both things, and they kind of put them together into this other thing. There&#8217;s a label called Jazz Is Dead, which is run by a guy named Adrian Younge, and a guy named &#8230; I forget his name, but he was one of the original members of A Tribe Called Quest. I can&#8217;t remember [inaudible 00:59:22].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, Ali Shahid Muhammad.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Exactly. And Jazz Is Dead is a project that basically takes &#8230; they&#8217;re constantly playing with either old established jazz musicians, jazz musicians that exist now, or up-and-coming people, mixed in with their R&#038;B funk, hip-hop sensibilities. It&#8217;s a perfect mixture of all this. And to me, they represent what jazz is right now, because they look back and forward at the same time.<br>
I think the most common thing that they probably want to see is just great musicianship, being able to play. So you&#8217;re not going to hear just somebody playing off a computer or synthesizers and loops, although that might be an element. But there&#8217;s people playing live bass, there&#8217;s people playing live drums, there&#8217;s people playing a horn, a saxophone, or a trump, so that you have all these things in it. You got raw singing and you have other things. And to me, that&#8217;s where the music is right now. And I&#8217;m really excited about it, because I love all that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I had a designer on the show, I don&#8217;t know, this had to have been a couple of years ago, Aricka Lewis. She was a designer in Arkansas, and now she&#8217;s in New York. And I had her on the show and we were just talking about her work as a designer. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m a UX designer,&#8221; et cetera, et cetera. And then I ran across this group, I think it was on YouTube, and she was the lead singers. It&#8217;s this group called Calle Soul, C-A-L-L-E. And they&#8217;re, I don&#8217;t know, I guess sort of a jazz samba sort of &#8230; not samba, because samba&#8217;s fast, I would say.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Like bossa nova?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, like a jazz bossa nova sort of band. And she was the lead singer. And I was like, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me?&#8221;<br>
She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Ain&#8217;t nobody want to hear about that.&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;It&#8217;s just a thing that I do with some friends.&#8221;<br>
I was like, &#8220;That is amazing. That is amazing.&#8221; I would say &#8230; Oh God, I&#8217;m trying to &#8230; I mean, we&#8217;re going off on a tangent. We&#8217;ll wrap the interview up. But I&#8217;d say probably my favorite jazz artist now is one that I sort of found by accident. I had just come to Atlanta in &#8217;99, and I had went to &#8230; There&#8217;s a neighborhood here called Little Five Points. There&#8217;s a music shop there called Moods Music, which is still open to this day. And I remember hearing this single called Ghosts from this band out of &#8230; I think they were out of Norway, called Beady Belle, B-E-A-D-Y B-E-L-L-E. And I was like, &#8220;Oh wow, this is really good.&#8221;<br>
And Darryl, who runs the shop, was like, &#8220;Yeah, I got their CD right here if you want it.&#8221; And that started, to me, a 20-plus year love affair with this band. I have all their albums. They&#8217;ve only performed in the States once. They performed in Rochester, New York, in 2007, I think.<br>
And when I heard about it, I was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going, I&#8217;m going.&#8221;<br>
My friends were like, &#8220;What&#8217;s in Rochester, New York?&#8221;<br>
I was like, &#8220;Beady Belle is coming to the United States for the first time, and they&#8217;re playing at the Rochester Jazz Festival.&#8221;<br>
And they&#8217;re looking at me like, &#8220;Okay, go for it.&#8221; And I went and I heard them perform. I was sitting in the front row. There weren&#8217;t a lot of people there, because I guess people didn&#8217;t know the band. But I was just giddy. I got to talk to them afterwards. They signed all my albums that they had up to that date. The band has since broken up, but still the lead singer, still goes by the name Beady Belle. And she still performs and puts out work, and stuff. But that&#8217;s probably my favorite artist, my favorite jazz artist.<br>
And then that opened me up to &#8230; I&#8217;d say contemporary jazz artist, probably my favorite contemporary jazz artist. But her and that band opened me up to Norwegian jazz and Finnish jazz. And I mean, they&#8217;re all pulling from Black American roots. But it&#8217;s just so interesting how jazz in other countries is just received, as opposed to here.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
[inaudible 01:03:05] a lot of DJ elements and hip-hop elements too, and electronics, in a lot of the Norwegian jazz world. So they do a lot of interesting things there. Do you have any other bands that you really like from Norway? I just want to know if I know any.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know that she had a background singer on her fourth album named Jarle Bernhoft, who went on to become a solo artist. And sort of to that thing you&#8217;re talking about with the sort of mixing with electronic, he would do this live mixing on stage where he&#8217;d do some beat boxing or some other vocal sounds, and then mix it all together on stage while also performing, singing and playing guitar. I like a lot of his work.<br>
There&#8217;s a lot of UK jazz, like Quantic Soul Orchestra, Alice Russell. Oh God, there&#8217;s one in particular who I&#8217;ve mentioned on the show before. Zara McFarlane. Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot. There&#8217;s a lot. Now I&#8217;m getting overwhelmed, trying to think of all of them. But yeah, wow. Wow. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
As I said earlier, I think I&#8217;m going to try to make a situation for myself where I am focused mostly on illustration. I want to do more writing, I want to write more books. I like getting assignments because you get brought great stories, like the one I was talking about with Malcolm X, or John Lewis. But I also want to create more stuff on my own. I do like doing magazine stuff. I like doing newspaper stuff. I just think if I just get assignments to create art based on subjects that I&#8217;m interested in, I&#8217;d be really happy, and if I&#8217;m able to do that.<br>
And I always fantasize about not staying in one place, like traveling around the world, because when you do what I do, you can be anywhere. So you can be in Berlin, you can be in Paris, you can be in London, you can be in Mexico. And I want to start doing that. I want to do these assignments, but be in different countries, set up a studio, and just illustrate books from different parts of the world. Live somewhere for six months, live somewhere for a year, and get to see the world, which is something I&#8217;ve never really been able to do much of for most of my life. So, that&#8217;s my goal I hope to do someday.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Well, my website is keithhbrown.com. My Instagram handle is @iamtheleopard, which I&#8217;m actually on hiatus with it right now, but I&#8217;ll be getting back on in a couple of weeks. I decided to take a break from social media, just because I was doing it every single day. And I just think I got addicted, so I wanted to see if I could unaddict myself, if there&#8217;s such a word. Yeah, those two places. Instagram. And I&#8217;m also on Facebook, at Keith Henry Brown. But the easiest way is probably just go through my website.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Keith Henry Brown, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. I was so excited, putting together what I was going to talk to you about, because I was like you&#8217;ve done illustration, and it&#8217;s jazz. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;This is going to be a great conversation.&#8221; And you did not disappoint with that. I think if there&#8217;s anything people can certainly take from this conversation, it&#8217;s that you can do what you want to do, if you set your mind to it. Don&#8217;t be afraid to go out and do it. And you found a way to meld your passions together in a way that lets you live the life that you want to live, which I think is what all creatives strive for, at the end of the day. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, and if I may, I just wanted to say one more thing really quickly. Can I, Maurice?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sure. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
It ain&#8217;t about awards, it&#8217;s about doing what satisfies you. A lot of times in design and even in illustration, people are always saying, &#8220;You should put yourself up for this and get that. And you should tell everybody you won that award and this award.&#8221; It ain&#8217;t about that. It&#8217;s about what makes you happy. And you can win 10 awards and Golden whatever, but you got to satisfy you, or it&#8217;s not really going to mean anything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wise words. Again, Keith Henry Brown, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Cheers, brother.</p>

<p>The thrilling part about entrepreneurship is following your dreams while pursuing your passions. That&#8217;s definitely the case for illustrator and creative director Alexandria Batchelor. As the head of her own company, <a href="https://www.foxeedesign.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Foxee Design</a>, Alexandria uses her skills in graphic design, branding and illustration to not only provide killer work for her clients, but to also redefine standards in the industry within art and design that represents minorities (primarily Black women). Now that&#8217;s change worth supporting!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Hi, everyone. My name is Alexandria Batchelor, AKA Foxee Design. I am currently the CEO and creative director of Foxee Design. Completely self employed right now, and I am a designer, but I specialize in branding illustration and comic production specifically. That&#8217;s me in a nutshell.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How is the year going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
It&#8217;s going really well actually. Lots of good projects are coming in. I&#8217;ve actually started subcontracting. That&#8217;s where I&#8217;ve started leveling up where I have acknowledged that I can&#8217;t do it all by myself. One of my mentors taught me that he kind of taught or ingrained this mentality of looking out for your community and your network and taking on all the talented people that you know and spreading the wealth, because I am tired. This year I am focusing on self care and that&#8217;s why I bring it in like, oh, you have some time? All right, I&#8217;ve got two projects for you here, and I&#8217;ve got this much money and I&#8217;ve got this for you and this for you. That&#8217;s kind of how I started managing my business this year. It&#8217;s already working quite well, so good start so far.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a great start so far. I&#8217;m telling you, and for people that are out there listening that might be running one person shops, the minute that you get into subcontracting, you will feel like you have unlocked the cheat code. Wait a minute. I can do this self employment thing. Once you build that network or that collective, you&#8217;re like, oh, I got this.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I know. That&#8217;s not sustainable. Not if you want to be happy and be a real person, because I like reality. Let&#8217;s stay rooted in it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, and also with subcontracting, it can also help you to even just expand your services. If there&#8217;s something that a client may want that you know someone in your network has the capacity to handle, it just kind of makes you appear more well rounded, so good for you. That&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Right. Thank you. I can&#8217;t wait to continue to build. I just actually recruited one of my old design confidants from college as well as one of my old interns who are both my friends still to be my right and my left hand for my company, so that was a big move where I&#8217;m like, I told one of them, I&#8217;m like, you&#8217;re my successor. The other one is just stepping up to the plate, so it&#8217;s just really nice to have people I really trust my business with and I could only be thrilled to imagine how they would run my company one day when I have to go expand to new horizons. Still come back to Foxee because that&#8217;s where my heart is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s amazing. I guess with that, do you have any plans for the summer?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yes. I&#8217;m going on vacation. I don&#8217;t vacation often, so yes. Actually summer, well starting off with my birthday, my birthday&#8217;s next month. May babies, Tauruses. Any Tauruses in the house? I&#8217;m going to Alabama because you were talking about the south, but my family&#8217;s from Alabama and I&#8217;m visiting my grandma for my birthday. We&#8217;re going to hang out in Atlanta for a bit, so that&#8217;s going to be really fun. Then in June, I&#8217;m spending the month in California because I&#8217;m also going to be speaking at VidCon, which is exciting, but most of it I&#8217;m going to be relaxing, but yes. I&#8217;ll have my first major speaking engagement in person. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve nervous yet, but as we get closer, I&#8217;m going to be a ball of nerves.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;ll be fine. VidCon is one of those conferences that everyone&#8217;s going to have a camera, of course. It&#8217;s a video conference, VidCon, but you&#8217;ll be fine. I think there&#8217;s enough energy at that kind of event where everyone wants to see you do well.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true. It&#8217;ll be good vibes. As long as there are good vibes, I&#8217;ll thrive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I&#8217;m curious, where in Alabama will you be visiting?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Nobody knows where this is, so I&#8217;ll be surprised if you know. It&#8217;s called Elba. Elba, Alabama in Coffee County.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I too am from Alabama.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Really?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Oh my goodness. I.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m from Selma in Dallas County. I&#8217;ve heard of Elba though.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Oh, really?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Oh my gosh. You&#8217;re the first person who&#8217;s ever heard of where my family&#8217;s from. That&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
People will come to me and name random cities in Alabama, like Utah or Boaz or something. I was like, yeah. I&#8217;ve heard of that. Really? I&#8217;m like, yeah. I grew up in Selma, from Alabama, south central Alabama. Yeah. Nice. Alabama in the summer is hot.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
It&#8217;s going to be brutal, yeah. Well, May, so that&#8217;s not too bad.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s not too bad. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yeah. My grandma wants us back later in the summer in August, so I think I might die. I don&#8217;t know if I could do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. August is Alabama is brutal, but the thing about visiting small towns in Alabama like that is it just strips everything away, like technology, wifi, cable. Selma is not a big city. Even when I go back home to visit my mom, she&#8217;s got cable and she has internet, but like it&#8217;s not the cable and internet I have at home. In terms of the entire environment, it just kind of strips everything away and forces you to be still for a while.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Nice. Yeah. That&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m looking for to unplug, kind of reconvene with nature. My grandma&#8217;s got this cute little vegetable garden that I want to see and just kind of learn about the land, because we own land too. It&#8217;s low key our inheritance eventually, so I just want to get back to my roots and what better time to do it than for my birthday? I&#8217;m really excited.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Let&#8217;s talk about Foxee Design. I know you&#8217;ve been freelancing for a long time now, but tell the people more about Foxee Design.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Foxee Design, I wanted to figure out a nice alias that really represented me, and we started branding ourselves in college, but everybody was kind of doing&#8230; no shade to people who just use their name. That&#8217;s a very legitimate brand because your name actually holds a lot of meaning. I&#8217;m big into name etymology, so I love learning the meaning behind everything, but I just wanted something more than just like A and B.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I just realized my hair became a really big signifier and symbol in my life because I used to have chemically straightened hair up until I was like 18. Right when I was in college, I did a big chop and I went natural and that was the first time I had had natural hair in my life. That&#8217;s why the hair kind of became a big thing. I have a beauty mark, like the Marilyn Monroe beauty mark and the lips and I&#8217;m like, you know what? Maybe this is the visual I want to represent my brand.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Then Foxee, the name, kind of came about because&#8230; actually, it&#8217;s from Foxy Brown, the Pam Grier movie from the 70s, but I learned about that from Quentin Tarantino&#8217;s iteration of it, Jackie Brown and Pam Grier again. I was like, oh, I&#8217;m in love with this movie. It was my favorite Quentin Tarantino movie. It just really resonated with me, so I was like, well, this character is so cool because she&#8217;s re-contextualizing black female sexuality and she&#8217;s kind of making the black woman a very powerful force to be reckoned with in Hollywood. I&#8217;m like, I want to do that in the design industry. This was before where are the black designers, which we were just talking about too, where I&#8217;m just like, I just want to be myself and be this very strong black woman without any consequence and have it resonate with my work. It doesn&#8217;t always need to be about my work, but it&#8217;s always rooted in it because it&#8217;s a part of me.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
That&#8217;s why it kind of was a little sexy. At times I would ask my friends like, should I have done something a little more palatable, but I just kind of leaned into it and I really want to embody this persona where&#8230; if you see me, I&#8217;m very naturalista, like Tom boy, but I can have those moments where I step out. It feels like an alter ego to an extent as well, but I like stepping into this alter ego because I&#8217;m this authority in the brand space and the design space and the illustration space and I get to know what I&#8217;m talking about and feel really empowered behind the knowledge that I&#8217;ve accrued over time. That&#8217;s kind of how Foxee came about and the meaning behind my whole business.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love that. I love that there&#8217;s so much intention behind it.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yes. Always have intention behind the work I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you specialize in, you mentioned, graphic design, you mentioned illustration or comics and branding. What specifically drew you to branding? I&#8217;ve been finding, I&#8217;d say probably on the show within the past year or so, a lot more designers getting into branding, but what draws you to it?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I look at branding as storytelling. I realize illustration, comics and branding are all storytelling mediums for me that are my favorite mediums. I also write a little bit and my mom is a writer, so I have that in my blood. There&#8217;s something about branding that I feel like can be missed where you just think it&#8217;s a logo, but it&#8217;s much more than that. You&#8217;re telling someone&#8217;s story. I think it&#8217;s more of the owner. You go back to the owner, you find out even more about the business, and that actually influences a lot of decisions, like what colors. Is this based on your favorite colors? Is this just tied to how that color represents the specialty that we&#8217;re trying to brand? What is this interest, this hobby? Did you like skiing? Is that why you wanted to make something related to skiing?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I think brands always go back to the first person who came with that idea, and I love learning about people and understanding the attention behind all of the things that we are drawn to. That&#8217;s why I really like branding, because it&#8217;s kind of like decoding and getting to know someone. It&#8217;s kind of personal, because I know recent years people are trying to separate the personal brand and the business brand. I actually think it can be both. It&#8217;s one logo. One brand can, I believe, represent both personal and business. That&#8217;s how I do it. I don&#8217;t have a separate page. It&#8217;s all at one.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I am a person, I am my business, but I can also be just the person that can just be the business. I can be like, okay, I&#8217;m taking a mental health day and I go to the spa. I feel like when you try to split, it&#8217;s hard to navigate, so I love creating this space where you can feel like your work isn&#8217;t necessarily your life, but it is an important part of your life and it can still be a representation of you, your will, your passion. That&#8217;s why I love branding.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love that. That&#8217;s a great way to put it. I see now branding and storytelling and it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve definitely seen with a lot of small companies are trying to get into it, or I think they&#8217;re trying to get into branding because they&#8217;re starting to see it now as more than just a logo. They&#8217;ll come to a designer, I need a logo, but the logo should hopefully tell the story of your business or why you&#8217;re doing your business or something. It&#8217;s not just something generic that you just slap together and say, this is what my business is. It&#8217;s this logo.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Right. It&#8217;s Papyrus type. No, I&#8217;m just kidding. I&#8217;m literally always walking around like, I don&#8217;t like that, I love that. My dad&#8217;s like, stop working. I&#8217;m like, I can&#8217;t help it, dad. The whole world is design. Oh, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me about how you approach a new project that comes into Foxee Design.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I&#8217;m a big process person, like process junkie over here. I love how you got from point A to point B. I learned that a lot of clients and even designers are only about the final product. When I was getting introduced to this culture of design, I would notice that designers would hoard their designs until they were ready to share it and it would be more finalized and clients would just be like, I don&#8217;t get what this concept is. Just give me the final product. This was in college I reached this theory. I was like, I think there&#8217;s a gap in understanding, because actually my college major, it&#8217;s not graphic design. It&#8217;s communication design, so I quite literally can design communication, and I realized there was a gap in communication between the designer and the client.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I made my process very transparent. I start with a sketch. I&#8217;ll give a couple rounds of sketches and I&#8217;ll share it with the client. I&#8217;m like, what do you think? This isn&#8217;t obviously what it&#8217;s going to look like in the final stage, but these are just some ideas to get from point A to point B. Do you like this? What do you like about that? What do you like about this? We can combine those ideas and see if they work. I can tell you why they might not work. Let&#8217;s try this instead. When you bring the client in and involve them, you just get a much more successful design.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve definitely had projects that have fallen through, obviously. No one&#8217;s perfect, but when the projects really go to the finish line, I&#8217;ve always had very high success rates. People are like, I didn&#8217;t even know this is what I wanted. I&#8217;m like, exactly, because the client always wants to be like, hey, I trust you. Just do whatever you want. I&#8217;m like, no. This is your business. You have to do work too, so I give them homework. I&#8217;m like, fill out this brand brief, answer all these questions. Some people are like, I never thought to answer all these questions about my business. I&#8217;m like, well, you&#8217;ve got to think about some extra stuff before maybe we even start your logo, because I always start with the logo if we&#8217;re doing a big brand project, because it&#8217;s an easy starting point but there&#8217;s way more to that. Especially if you want to be a musician or if you want to be on YouTube.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a lot of other deliverables that go around the logo. I&#8217;ll give you colors and type bases to work with, even if that&#8217;s what you lead me with, but there&#8217;s always more than just a logo. Yes. I make my clients work just as hard as me, and that&#8217;s why I think I work really well with people and now they appreciate the process. They&#8217;ll always walk away like, I learned something about design today, and I&#8217;m like, that&#8217;s amazing. I&#8217;ve got teaching in my blood.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s a good way to approach it. Back when I started my studio, which was&#8230; what year is this? 2022. Back when I started in my studio in the olden days of the inter&#8230; no, I&#8217;m kidding, but back in the late 2000s or so, there was this really big push and maybe it&#8217;s still this way now, I don&#8217;t know, but there was almost this dichotomy that was set up between designer/entrepreneurs and clients where the designer is always right and the client is always wrong and there was this whole thing about clients from hell. Clients from hell.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I remember that blog.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Not to say that they don&#8217;t exist. They do exist. But also I think it&#8217;s up to the designer to vet the people that are coming in.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think if you&#8217;re doing a good job of that and they know that you&#8217;re educating them along with doing the work that you don&#8217;t run into many clients from hell after a while. They know to kind of stay away, but that education portion is super important. I think clients want to know sort of what they&#8217;re paying for, of course. They&#8217;re not just paying for hopefully a set of hands. They want someone that can illustrate, especially if it&#8217;s for their business and its brand. I would hope that they would want to be involved in it.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Me too. Yeah. Someone, I can&#8217;t remember who, but there was four types of clients. You have the smart involved client, you have the smart, lazy client, you have the&#8230; sorry to say dumb, but the dumb involved client and the dumb and lazy client. I think the worst one they said was the dumb involved one because they want to be all up in your business but aren&#8217;t listening or anything. It&#8217;s interesting that there are types of clients out there, but you have to know how to deal with them. If someone is more the uneducated one who wants to be involved, that&#8217;s great. You shouldn&#8217;t see that as a loss. You should be like, no, this is a learning moment. You want to be involved, but you&#8217;re not listening to me and I&#8217;m the authority. You paid for this.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Also, sometimes that&#8217;s where I take an L. If you don&#8217;t want to listen to me, then we&#8217;ll go with what you want. It might not be the right decision, but because you don&#8217;t want to listen to the specialists that you hired, then we&#8217;ll just go and do what you want to do. I think as I got older I started to be less precious with my work because yes, I&#8217;m here to guide you. I&#8217;m here to be like a salesperson. I&#8217;m here to persuade you, but sometimes if they just don&#8217;t want to listen, then that&#8217;s fine. I paid you to do what you want me to do and that&#8217;s that. I think a lot of younger designers get really hellbent on like, well, they&#8217;re not doing this. They&#8217;re not do it. I&#8217;m like yeah, I know that stinks, but put all that energy in your own work then.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Design, at the end of the day, for what it&#8217;s worth, especially as an entrepreneur, it&#8217;s a service industry, so you are serving the client in that way. Honestly, just because you did the work doesn&#8217;t mean you have to put it on your portfolio. There is a lot of work that I&#8217;ve done for horrible clients that will never see the light of day for me.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Right. I get you there, or I&#8217;ll put the one that they should have picked in my portfolio. I&#8217;m like, this is the nice version that we just left from ground zero, and it&#8217;s a dream, but this is the reality it should have been, so I get that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You mentioned earlier about subcontracting and having people as you&#8217;re left and right hand. What does a typical day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Oh my goodness. I&#8217;m in a decompression mode right now, so it&#8217;s a little different. Sometimes I&#8217;ll be gaming all day while also working, so I balance it out, which is kind of hilarious, but other days&#8230; I&#8217;m a Switch girl, so I&#8217;m playing the new Kirby game. Nobody&#8217;s paying me to promote this, but it&#8217;s really good. It&#8217;s beautiful. That&#8217;s been nice to feel restorative, especially if I have a stacked day, but I go through my emails. Also, email anxiety is so real. Some days I just put them off, but I try to have admin days where I can focus and respond as I go so they don&#8217;t build up, because if I&#8217;m away from my email for at least a week, I will have at least 200 emails and that is not fun to go through. Yes. That&#8217;s real. Email, admin stuff, I&#8217;ll go through any contracts that I have and get them signed and sent over, because I always collect deposits or I have regular income where I&#8217;ll have to give bills and stuff. So I&#8217;ll send in my invoices then. That&#8217;s the business side of things.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Then some days I like to blog in the mornings, especially if I worked too much the past day. I&#8217;ll just be writing my memoir, which is a little passion project I have going on, so I&#8217;ll spend time either doing that. This morning I spent embroidering, so I&#8217;ve been trying to get back to traditional art because I want to spend less time on my computer. Yes. I&#8217;ve been wanting to paint more, so in the coming days I&#8217;ll get back to painting. I like to play as much as I work with even my art because it&#8217;s my passion and my job, but traditional is where I&#8217;m steering, so I like being able to balance that throughout the day. Then I&#8217;ll work on a project here or there. I&#8217;ve usually got several going on.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Some days I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m not working on this project or I&#8217;ll have to prioritize which one, like they need this one urgently or this deadline or this sub-task deadline is due this day, so that&#8217;s how I organize my tasks. Then I try to not work into the evening. Then I unwind with some anime and food. That&#8217;s what a day looks like for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love that you said I like to play as much as I work and that you kind of weave that into your work day. That&#8217;s pretty cool. I like that. I think it&#8217;s a good way, one, to just get through the day, but then as an entrepreneur, I think it can be so easy to fall into that trap of just work, work, work, work, work, because everything has to depend on you. Incorporating those moments of play like that into the work is a good strategy.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yes. This is very new too, because I was work, work, work, work, work, and then I crash, crash, crash, crash, crash. Now I&#8217;m like, okay. I have to make sure I am relaxing. I want to bring back yoga and meditation into my routine, because I also was doing that because self-care is just so important. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to stress as much as I&#8217;m trying to make money. I&#8217;m good. I think that&#8217;s also important to have financial literacy when you&#8217;re in these spaces and to be able to save and not worry about going check to check. That&#8217;s where I&#8217;m like, you know what? I&#8217;ve worked hard enough to be like, I can relax. It&#8217;s going to be okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good place to be.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yeah. It takes time. I think everyone can get there, but even if you are living check to check, still put a few bucks aside to get a facial from Walgreens. One of those things to just do the mini. I love doing like those really home care days. I&#8217;ll put my feet in like some Epsom salt or whatever and soak, so you can do it in a very affordable way too. I suggest that as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I like that. I first heard about you about a year or so ago from YouTube. I think I told you this before we started recording. I was randomly watching videos. I was letting the YouTube algorithm guide what I watch next and I ended up on this&#8230; I guess the best way to describe it would be maybe an anime discussion channel. Not necessarily review, but more like discussion. This anime discussion channel called Beyond The Bot. Can you talk about how you became a part of that?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Sure. Actually it goes back to my history at Frederator. We actually got laid off during the pandemic too. It happened to a bunch of different companies. I have no disclaimer. There&#8217;s no shade. I wouldn&#8217;t be the designer I am today without that company. I have much respect for Frederator, but we just couldn&#8217;t afford to keep all of us on after the pandemic hit. If it didn&#8217;t hit, we probably would still be there, to be honest with you. That crew wanted to keep a channel that we started at Frederator called, Get in the Robot. That had to pause production because we had lost our jobs, so we evolved it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I watched Get in the Robot. I didn&#8217;t know that was the succession. Look at that.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Right. Here we go. Full circle.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Full circle.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I knew we&#8217;d get there. Yes. We just evolved it to the next stage with Beyond the Bot. We did it completely independent. We were crowd funded. We had a lot of really great opportunities to us. Then they were like, all right. Come on board, because we literally took the whole old team from Frederator and just started this because we just needed extra work and the fans were helping us pay and keep it alive. We got a couple hundred bucks a month working on it and we just kept the joy alive because that channel meant a lot to us, like Get in the Robot, and then Beyond the Bot was a new baby that helped us be able to do even more than we wanted to do without corporate constraints.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
For people that want to check it out, you should really go to YouTube, search for it. If you&#8217;re into anime, I wouldn&#8217;t even say just modern anime, like My Hero Academia or whatever because you all have talked about stuff with Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball Z and stuff. If you&#8217;re an anime fan of any stripe, definitely check it out.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yes. We do deep cuts. I think we did a Neon Evangelion Genesis video. We&#8217;ve done a Cardcaptor Sakura video, so even the ones you&#8217;ve never heard of, we were talking about that stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. What are the best types of clients for you to work with? I know you&#8217;ve worked with, you mentioned Frederator is a place that you&#8217;ve worked at before, and we&#8217;ll go through the rest of your work history, but you&#8217;ve worked for some publications and other publishing studios. What are the best types of clients for Foxee Design though?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I love working with YouTubers. YouTubers are where it&#8217;s at because everybody is getting on that. I&#8217;m even trying to get on YouTube. I would love to be able to be like, come follow me at Foxee. Content will come this year, I promise, but yes. I love the YouTube space. That&#8217;s kind of what Frederator did too. We were kind of cornering the mark. They were kind of the first people really doing what they&#8217;re doing on YouTube. A lot of these clients that have reached out to me are like, I&#8217;m inspired by Get in the Robot. I&#8217;m inspired by this. We&#8217;ve kind of set a domino effect of these new big YouTubers who focus on anime or cartoon industries or video games. Well, there were other people like [inaudible 00:30:17].</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
All those different names, but YouTube is the place to be. There&#8217;s kind of a lot of not so great branding on there, so I would like to save YouTubers. That&#8217;s also why VidCon is a great space for me to speak at. I can&#8217;t wait to connect with a lot of people who might need a new brand. Either a brand refresh, a whole rebrand, or just a brand in general, but I think YouTube is a great spot because there&#8217;s a lot of authentic personalities that&#8230; the algorithm serves up authenticities. They love when you are just yourself and you have a good niche and you have a good hook. If people have those good ideas and just need a good brand, then they&#8217;re a great fit for me because I can help visualize that and help build their brand on YouTube.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Those are my ideal clients, but I&#8217;ve worked with musicians. Back when I was living in Buffalo, my first set of clients were local rappers who would charge $50 album covers. I&#8217;m like, the come up is real. I&#8217;ve worked with musicians, but I don&#8217;t charge $50 for album covers anymore. I&#8217;m all about indie. I listen to indie music. I love like indie films, so anything independent and not discovered by the world, it just feels more special. You were one of the first few fans to get access. When you see someone blow up, you&#8217;re like, I was following them when Spotify didn&#8217;t even exist. It just feels like an achievement to be able to be in those spaces. I think it&#8217;s high honor, especially if you&#8217;re a designer in those spaces to work with those kind of artists who are doing their thing, because it&#8217;s solely based on passion. Of course they want to be famous and they want money, but they are 100% driven by passion, and passionate clients. Ideal clients are just anybody with a dream and a lot of passion, and money too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. There&#8217;s a guy I design&#8230; not design. Sorry. I had him on the show&#8230; was it last year? I&#8217;ve been doing this for so long I really have to think, like when did I interview this person? It was last year. This guy, Chris Burnett, he started out doing some designs for Odd Future. He loved the music and lucked into becoming their creative director for a while, did work with Tyler and with Frank and them. I&#8217;m like, wow. To be able to come in at that level, whether it&#8217;s a musician or even with what you&#8217;re talking about with a YouTube channel or something like that, to get in on the ground floor of working with another passionate creative is amazing. That&#8217;s the best. It&#8217;s the best. It&#8217;s so good, because that energy is there. They&#8217;re doing their thing. You&#8217;re doing your thing. It&#8217;s so good. It&#8217;s so good.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
So good. Glad you agree.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit. I know we&#8217;ve talked a lot about your work, but let&#8217;s talk more about you. Where did you grow up?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Me, I grew up in the Hudson Valley in New York. A little town. I don&#8217;t know if you all know Fishkill. More like the Poughkeepsie area. I&#8217;m just throwing out general terms because this is so specific. It&#8217;s like the greater New York City area. I know some people are going to be like, what? Then other people are like, what the heck is that? It&#8217;s near Beacon. Beacon&#8217;s also really nice. I don&#8217;t know. Good. It&#8217;s the upstate New York area kind of, but not really. It&#8217;s very white, which is fine. That experience made me very comfortable being in predominantly white spaces, which actually helped me out in corporate and college, although my college program, our class, there was a lot of diversity there, which was surprising because it was Buffalo, but anyway. Yeah. I grew up in a predominantly white area in the suburbs and I lived there my&#8230; that&#8217;s not true. I was a baby in Mount Kisco, so I barely re remember that, but remembering the growing up experience, I grew up in that other area that I ranted about that half of the people listening will probably not know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When did you know that creating art was something you wanted to do for a living?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Probably when I was five. I was always drawing, especially when we hung out with the family. I was always curled up on the couch just doodling. I still have my doodles. I have a great archive. I&#8217;m excited to go through it, like through recent revelations and deeper understanding of my work, but I have stuff from when I was really young still in my possession, but I always knew. Yeah. I&#8217;m an archivist, which is a fancy term for hoarder, but it&#8217;s still worth it. I think having your old work is really important because it says a lot about the interest that shaped you as an artist. I always knew, and I actually wanted to get into architecture briefly because I do love architecture, but I&#8217;m not good at math, or maybe I am but I just didn&#8217;t have good teachers. The pressure it is to be an architect, uh-uh (negative). I was like, I&#8217;m not going to build a house that could fall down and me get sued. I don&#8217;t think so. Then I found graphic design and that was a wrap.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you mentioned studying communication design. You started out at Dutchess Community College and then you attended University of Buffalo. What were those experiences like? Did they really prepare you once you got out there in the world as a working designer?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I would say yes and no. Dutchess, the community college, it was a great school for saving money. I just wanted to save. Maybe I was a little not like ready to run, like jump the nest. That&#8217;s my mom&#8217;s theory, even though I&#8217;m like, no mom. It&#8217;s probably not that, but she&#8217;s usually right with her suspicions, so maybe. I went for free because I graduated in like the top 3% of my high school, but it felt like the 13th grade and me and one of my friends were really bored and we were just like, we have to get out of here. We got to do really fun programs. I got to learn fencing while I was there and did a dance program. I want to get back into fencing. Fencing was super fun and you look really cool. I love swords, and video games, I am always the person with a sword. That&#8217;s my ideal weapon choice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Just in case you guys were wondering, but I didn&#8217;t get to take really graphic design classes there. I took a 2D and 3D design class and a photography class, which is indirectly graphic design, but I had to wait the next year to take a graphic design course, but I was already onto the University at Buffalo. Those courses, they were okay. I thought the teacher I had was kind of pretentious. He was kind of a jerk and told me I couldn&#8217;t get into other schools, even though out of high school, I got into like RIT and I&#8217;m like, okay, well I&#8217;m here just to save money for my family so you&#8217;re wrong, but thanks.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
That was a crappy experience with that guy where I&#8217;m like, maybe you&#8217;re just mad you&#8217;re teaching and you want to be out in the field. I don&#8217;t know. It was not really about me, but it was a crappy experience to still have. University of Buffalo was way better. I actually met two of my mentors that I&#8217;m still friends with today, John Jennings and Stacy Robinson. They together work as Black Kirby and they are leading the Afro-futurist&#8230; they&#8217;re just big names in the Afro-futurist space, especially in the comic book industry. They just kind of took me under their wing immediately when I met them, and that was the best thing I got out of UB especially. Then also all my friends. I still keep in contact with a lot of my classmates. We just kind of all stuck together. I had a friend reach out to me recently like, hey, we&#8217;ve always been fans of your work and we always thought your stuff was next level. I&#8217;m like, me? Fans from school? Oh my gosh. Thanks guys. That was so sweet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. I had John on the show a couple years ago. I want to say 2017, 2018. Yeah. John is great. John, you mentioned his name.nd I think any Afro-futurist circle people are going to be like, oh yeah, Kindred. We know John. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yep. I&#8217;ve worked on most of those projects he&#8217;s worked on, so I actually helped color Kindred too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Work. Nice.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I just think those things [inaudible 00:39:39]&#8230; because I&#8217;m a very humble person. I don&#8217;t go out reciting my resume, but I&#8217;m like yeah, I worked on that too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yeah. He&#8217;s dope. He&#8217;s very cool to work with. He was the one I mentioned earlier who taught me, don&#8217;t leave your network behind and bring them up with you. He is trying to master the subcontract and that&#8217;s who I got that from.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I like that a lot. I like that. What was your early career like once you graduated? Is that when you started freelancing right alongside working?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yes, because my first job out of college was at The Cheesecake Factory. I was a server. I couldn&#8217;t get a job for the life of me because I was in Buffalo and the industry there is very small. It&#8217;s a very blue collar town. No shade to Buffalo, but design was not flourishing there. I&#8217;m not really sure how it is. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s flourishing now. You&#8217;d have to work at like a doctor&#8217;s office or some kind of establishment to really be a designer there. I wanted to work at an agency or some kind of innovative company, but I just couldn&#8217;t get in. I was behind on internships because I didn&#8217;t take internships in school because I was kind of a lazy student. I&#8217;m going to be honest with you. I slept during class all the time, since high school. I was a sleeper. I don&#8217;t know. That was my bad.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Instead, I decided to go into the restaurant industry and I made really great tips. Then that also encouraged me to freelance. If I never served, then I would&#8217;ve never really focused on freelance work and Foxee Design may not be what it is today, because I didn&#8217;t want a gap in my resume. I was like, well, I&#8217;m going to have to really operate as a freelancer so I have this experience for when I&#8217;m ready to get into design. I did end up getting in two offers at internships. One at like a car dealership place, which I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m not a big car person, so I&#8217;m like, it&#8217;s not a great fit. Then the other was at a newspaper, which is really cool. It was called the Buffalo News. It&#8217;s one of the biggest newspapers in the Western New York area. They had a medley of different clients that they would work with, so I thought that was a better fit than a car dealership. No shade.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
It was a great offer that she&#8230; it was the first time someone took me out and wined and dined me to be like, are you going to choose our internship? I&#8217;m like, for an internship for real? No, but thank you. I mean, not wine. She took me out to coffee and got me a snack or whatever, but either way it was [inaudible 00:42:21] that she really wanted me to work there, but I chose the newspaper instead. I worked in their digital ad department because they were still focusing on penny savers, but my department was the smallest and newest and youngest. We worked on Facebook ads, like back in the day when you were only in the backend, working on Facebook. This was back when it was so new that you could actually discriminate through it because you could choose to serve your ads to specific races. It was very interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. I remember when Facebook had that. I think it was some sort of housing. I forget what it was, how someone found out. I think it was because they were making ads that would discriminate against people for housing or something like that, but I remember when could do that with the ad manager.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yes, and I witnessed that happen. The sales rep didn&#8217;t allow it, but the woman was on speaker phone asking and I was just like, oh my goodness. I can&#8217;t believe she just asked if she could only serve this housing ad to white people. It was just the most baffling experience. I was like, wow, people really be doing that nowadays. Still to this day. That was a very interesting experience because it was very old school. I had to dress up for work. I had a retirement fund. I was like, what in the world? I had a retirement fund. That&#8217;s how old school this place was. That was my early career. It was very interesting. Very interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, what was it like at Frederator? What did you learn from there? I know you said it kind of helped you now in terms of, I guess, process and such, but what was that experience like, because Frederator, and we talked about this a bit before recording, but it feels like it serves a very specific type of demographic that I don&#8217;t know if it encompasses black women, black people in general, but probably specifically not black women. What was your experience there like? What did you learn from there?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s funny enough. I was one of the first three black people employed there. It was two black guys and me and one of them, he&#8217;s still there and just got promoted to president, so now he running the place, which is amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Look at that.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
The first day he started, he said, I&#8217;m going to run this place. I said, okay. That was me meeting him. I was like, sure. Then he did. I&#8217;m like, of course he did. Of course he did. It&#8217;s being run by a black person now, but it was a wild ride because it was definitely predominantly white for decades, which, it makes sense. The higher ups were all white. That&#8217;s usually what happens, but that&#8217;s why I was really grateful to my boss who gave me a chance because I needed to get out of Buffalo. Through friend or something, I was able to connect and she&#8217;s like, I love your work. Then I got the job and I got to New York City lickity-split because I was ready to go. It was just amazing to have an opportunity to be in that space, because it&#8217;s so hard for us to get into design spaces for whatever reason. Well, the reason is because it&#8217;s systematically designed like that, but that&#8217;s a whole other conversation. We&#8217;re partially going to talk about it.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yes, it was kind of hard being there, as any predominantly white space, but for whatever reason, there was more and more minorities that kept flooding in. At one point, there was half minorities and half white people and then there were less white people. I&#8217;m like, oh, they&#8217;re getting scared. They&#8217;re getting scared. I&#8217;m just kidding. It was so funny though. We would joke about it, but I think I was able to navigate the space where I let people feel comfortable talking about feeling uncomfortable. I would be able to talk to the one half Hispanic, half indigenous guy and the one Asian guy about in high school when they used to give us really racist names.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
This was water cooler talk, and I don&#8217;t think anybody would ever have been able to have a safe water cooler space talk like that if it was only white people around. I didn&#8217;t really have an influence on company culture because I was the only designer there too, so I was so tired and busy, but the moments I had were really nice where I could just bond with people and we could talk straight with each other. I even talked to some of the white people about it because I&#8217;ve always had white friends who just let me talk. I&#8217;m like, if you just listen, I&#8217;m cool with you. You cool. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Just let hear my voice. I&#8217;ve had really real talks with some white folk and those are the ones to stick with; the ones who aren&#8217;t going to tell you how you are supposed to feel or about your experience. I had a lot of those moments with some people there, which was nice, but design wise, it was YouTube. I got to figure out how to brand YouTube. I made extensive style guides. I&#8217;ll make you a 50 page brand guide that you will use and share with the video editors, because we had a huge freelance network too, some of whom I still keep in contact and using my own network now. Yeah. The people I met there were worth it. The skills I gained there working on YouTube was worth it. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
As a black woman, it wasn&#8217;t always great. I didn&#8217;t always feel like my voice was heard. I feel like I had a lot of good ideas and they would always be overshadowed, and then every time the white guy said exactly what I said two weeks ago, I&#8217;m like, of course. Of course now it&#8217;s a brilliant idea. I don&#8217;t want to think it&#8217;s always intentional, but you always feel a type of way where it&#8217;s like, is anybody listening to me, but still a good experience. Still a good experience. Again, it made me strong. I had interns be like, because we went through a lot, I was able to handle a really crazy work situation being only in a small team, and I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m glad, because it hardens you when you are responsible for a lot. It was too much. I definitely needed like another designer, but I run my own business now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s interesting. It hardens you. That&#8217;s an interesting way to look at it.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s not 100% great terminology, but that&#8217;s the strong black woman though. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s the trope that we do have to play often.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, this kind of leads into my next question, which is kind of about representation. I mentioned to you before and I&#8217;ve talked about this on the show too when I have black illustrators or fine artists, do you feel a need to quote unquote represent with the work that you do?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Not necessarily. Obviously I&#8217;m going to go for the black female representation or even just a lot of women I&#8217;ve always drawn, because I&#8217;m always going to go to the self first. It&#8217;s an easy subject. It&#8217;s like Frida Kahlo. She says, I know myself the best. That&#8217;s why my best subject. She&#8217;s one of my favorite artists. That&#8217;s why I quote her. That was not a direct quote, but anyway, and then also, because I&#8217;m bisexual, I also love how women look and it&#8217;s so easy to draw women. I always have to be like, oh crap. I haven&#8217;t drawn a man in months. I should probably do that. Men are cool too, but dang, I don&#8217;t know. [foreign language 00:50:26].</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Anyway, I think it&#8217;s important specifically to represent the black women in my work because I pull a lot from my feelings, so I make a lot of sense of what I&#8217;m feeling and what I&#8217;m going through through my illustration work, and because black women have to be hardened by society, I think being vulnerable in that way helps be like hey, I&#8217;m still a person and I&#8217;m really sad or I&#8217;m really frustrated, or I feel like I&#8217;m falling apart, which is why I do a lot of disembodied, disconnected body parts. That&#8217;s kind of a style I&#8217;ve developed. I&#8217;ve always been doing that for I think maybe for 10 years.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
That&#8217;s kind of been the art style where it&#8217;s like just the head or the bust or a hand or an arm. It just shows this disconnect and just feeling really outside of your body, because there&#8217;s so much going on, you don&#8217;t really know the feelings that are kind of taking over you and you feel like you&#8217;re just kind of fractured. I&#8217;m constantly breaking apart and putting myself back together to make sense of myself, to reassemble myself, like a stained glass mirror or a stained glass window. Sorry. That&#8217;s why I think when I try to represent the black woman it means more because we aren&#8217;t allowed to feel feelings like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, you do a lot of work with like Afro-futuristic [inaudible 00:52:02]. You mentioned John Jennings and you mentioned Kindred. You&#8217;ve got a new project that&#8217;s coming out in September with Tananarive Due and Steven Barnes. Can you talk to us a little bit about that?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Sure. We&#8217;re now allowed to talk about it. I was doing hold up because I was the colorist on the project, so I colored that whole bad boy. I had some help with my assistants. They were great, but yes. It&#8217;s funny because I&#8217;ve been coloring with John since I was in college and I&#8217;ve been getting promotions with him. This was the first time I was the lead colorist. Oftentimes I&#8217;m an assistant colorist, like on Kindred I was an assistant, but this time I got to be the senior level colorist and I got to see the inks that Marco Finnegan did. He&#8217;s incredible. He loves film noir. That&#8217;s why the shadows are really heavy. I always forget this name, the really intense contrast. It&#8217;s the [inaudible 00:53:01].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, chiaroscuro. Something like that.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
There you go, chiaroscuro. Yes. I never get that right, but one day I will, so thank you for the assist, but it has that really beautiful effect. It made my job easier because I was like, great. I got to do less shadows because he made this so exaggerated, but it was beautiful. His inks were just so strong on their own. Then I got to just take a look at them, understand the scene. I had to plot out the script to see how many days this story went over. It took a place over seven days. It&#8217;s about this little girl, she&#8217;s eight, which, fun fact, was based on Marco&#8217;s daughter, which is really cute. I love when, again, you&#8217;re using your reality as your subject and that&#8217;s what makes it realer, because the expressions, I&#8217;m just like, this feels heartfelt. I&#8217;m like, well, if it&#8217;s based on your daughter, I get it.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
This little girl, she goes through a lot of death and she is kind of on her own after a while because her caretaker dies and then a monster is summoned to take care of her, called the keeper, but there has to be a sacrifice to keep it alive because it needs life to keep it alive. It&#8217;s a beautiful, horrific story. It was funny because I was listening to a talk with Tananarive Due and she was talking a lot of black history or black stories. They are horror. They&#8217;re horrific, so it&#8217;s technically a horror graphic novel. I think the demo is like around&#8230; it&#8217;s supposed to be young adult, but I think it can skew higher because it reads really well. I highly recommend, not just because I worked on it. It&#8217;s good. We nailed it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. We&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes so people can pre-order it, because this will be out before this comes out. Side note, and only because I&#8217;m a nerd, you talked about [inaudible 00:55:06], and as soon as you said that, I was like, there&#8217;s a song by a British jazz singer named ZR McFarland called chiaroscuro, so if anybody&#8217;s listening and they want to check that out, it&#8217;s a pretty good song. She&#8217;s a good singer, but that&#8217;s a pretty good song.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Nice. I&#8217;m going to be jamming to that after this podcast.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. How do you get back your creativity when you&#8217;re feeling uninspired? Do you have any methods that you go through or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I wish my brain could shut off that I could really be uninspired, but I understand it&#8217;s not necessarily not being inspired, but the creative blocks, I guess, where it&#8217;s like I know I want to do this, but sometimes I don&#8217;t know how. Sometimes I guess going back to traditional media, just doodling mindlessly helps, me going back to nature. I was just going on a walk with my mom and she was so annoyed because I literally was stopping and picking the flowers because I mentioned wild flowers in a blog post, so just taking root of my surroundings, even if it&#8217;s a fire hydrant and the colors on that because I&#8217;m a comic book. I work in comic books, so the background art, you think the things that you just pass by every day, we love. We put that in the background so we&#8217;re always studying the environment.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s been a really good way to, I guess, push through creative blocks where I&#8217;m just like, let me just go outside and collect some research and also get in the fresh air and I just want to hike more. I want to get back to nature because I think as we get back to nature and respect it more and I want to raise more plants, I want that to help revitalize me when I&#8217;m feeling like down with my creativity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny. As you said that about creativity and even as you mentioned this about horror before. Have you been to Elba before? Is this going to be your first time visiting this summer?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
No, I used to go when I was a kid, but it&#8217;s been a while. It&#8217;s maybe been over five years, so it&#8217;s been a while.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. One thing I remember about Elba is that it&#8217;s flooded a few times. At least in my lifetime, it&#8217;s with the river there, the town is flooded. I don&#8217;t know. As you started talking about that I was thinking, what if there&#8217;s some interesting southern gothic horror story of this town that&#8217;s been repeatedly flooded with people that can breathe underwater or something. I don&#8217;t know. My mind is wandering a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I would love that. No, please, because it&#8217;s funny. We have another piece of property and on it there&#8217;s this little mini house and they call it the doll house, and it&#8217;s near a lake, so I&#8217;m like, oh, you might be onto something. Okay. We might have to talk. Okay. We&#8217;ve got to talk about this little story over here. That sounds awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have a dream project or anything that you would love to do that you haven&#8217;t done yet?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I am literally working on a dream graphic novel, so yes. It&#8217;s pretty much I have very vivid dreams because I&#8217;m very stressed out a lot, I guess. Yeah. People would call them stress dreams, but I&#8217;ve started getting them again. They&#8217;ve been hilarious. One dream someone said that&#8230; like I was an X-man and someone was like, your sister&#8217;s a normie, and I pimp slapped them because I was like, she&#8217;s amazing. Don&#8217;t you ever talk about my sister like that. These are the kind of weird dreams I have. I&#8217;ve recorded at least 70 plus of these. I&#8217;ve started organizing into a story because there has been a lot of through lines between all of these dreams where it&#8217;s like, there&#8217;s this underlying plot or there&#8217;s this love interest, so it&#8217;s been very interesting mapping out all these symbols because I also love dream symbolism and dream interpretation.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve used that as a resource for this story because it&#8217;s literally writing itself. I literally just have to go to bed and dream and that&#8217;s part of the writing and now it&#8217;s tightening it up, but then I&#8217;m paralleling it with my actual life to be like, what is going on to instigate these dreams? It&#8217;s biographical as well as a dream memoir, so I&#8217;m pulling from my journal entries at the same point in time and I&#8217;m creating this beautiful story that weaves in and out from reality and dream world and creating a narrative. This is going to be a hybrid piece where it&#8217;s graphic novel, but there&#8217;s going to be written pros and there&#8217;s going to be dream dictionary-esque aspects of it. This is a passion project. I&#8217;ve already finished the beginning and figured out the beginning and end. I&#8217;ve just been working on it diligently and hopefully I am going to get this published maybe next year or the following year, given how much time I&#8217;m able to work on it with everything else going on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds amazing. I&#8217;d love to read that once you have it. Once it&#8217;s out there and ready, I&#8217;d love to read that.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Absolutely. I will send you a link personally.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is the best advice that you&#8217;ve ever been given regarding your craft?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I guess reserving my passion for my own projects, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s actually the best advice because I&#8217;m so passionate about everything. I think just focusing more on myself though is important because I&#8217;ve always been worried about everyone else. Not that I&#8217;m going to drop the execution that I spend on projects, but I just need to be a little selfish nowadays and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that because it&#8217;s a balance between selflessness and selfishness, but with my work, I want that dream to come true. I also want to have an exhibit. If I want all these dreams to come true, I&#8217;ve got to think about me, so I think that&#8217;s probably the best advice. Balance, letting myself get a little bored, re-centering myself and just letting go a little bit. That&#8217;s, I think, what I need to continue to grow and not stagnate or burn myself out or give up on this because I feel like I&#8217;m onto something.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
I want to do more environmental design. I want to figure out how to help the environment more. I&#8217;m not really sure. I&#8217;m still very new about sustainability. I do it in different ways. I don&#8217;t have a car, so I don&#8217;t add to the carbon footprint. I take the public transportation. I recycle plastic bags and use them as garbage bags. There are little ways I do it, but I want to know how to build that into my business more. I also want to build interactive spaces for people to be able to enjoy separate&#8230; hopefully including sustainability. I want to get more into the museum exhibition space and just create a new world that you walk into whenever you go to a show or some kind of piece. I want to get out of the 2D space because I&#8217;m ready to graduate to 3D.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I like that. That&#8217;s good. Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Sure. Well, I&#8217;m actually not as active as I need to be, but I will be more active on Instagram. That&#8217;s where I prefer to post work. I&#8217;m also on Twitter. It&#8217;s all Foxee Design, F-O-X-E-E Design. Then I&#8217;ll be on YouTube this year too, so those are my main platforms, and then you can find other links through there, but that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ll share for now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Alexandria Batchelor, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I was familiar with your work, like I said, through YouTube and watching the videos and being like, this is so really well done. Who is behind this? Then of course now being able to talk to you and really get the passion and the fun and the energy and the vitality that you have behind your work. I&#8217;m excited to see what comes next, because it sounds like you are working across a lot of different spaces, doing a lot of just really cool stuff. I&#8217;m excited to see what your design future is going to hold, so thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Alexandria Batchelor:</b><br>
Of course. Thank you so much for having me. I had a blast.</p>
