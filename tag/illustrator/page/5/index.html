Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>This week&#8217;s guest is a real treat for me. Sean Mack is an illustrator and graphic artist in Detroit, and I first ran across his work around a decade or so ago on Tumblr. His work has really taken off since then, so having him on to talk about his journey as an artist was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>We started off talking about his recent work on a commemorative comic for the late hip-hop artist MF DOOM, and Sean went into how he and writer Brandon Howard came up with their popular comic <a href="https://therevtimes.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">The Revolutionary Times</a>. We also talked about balancing his art while working a 9-to-5 job, working with big clients, and creating new work through the pandemic. If you&#8217;ve never heard of Sean or seen his art, then this interview is a great place to start!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
My name is Sean Mack. I&#8217;m a graphic artist, illustrator, graphic designer, comic book artist, storyboard artist, just all-around graphic artist, mostly all art, basically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, so, how are you feeling right now? How&#8217;s the year going so far?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
The year has been challenging. I&#8217;ve been trying my best to keep up with things, keep up with my craft, keep trying to stay the right path for the most part. I think I&#8217;m doing an okay job.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, you sound like &#8230; What&#8217;s the guy&#8217;s name in Kung Fu that has to walk the path? I forget his name, played by David Carradine.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Oh, I know who you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;re trying to walk the righteous path.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Right, right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me about what kind of projects you&#8217;re working on right now.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Mostly freelancing at the moment. I just got done with a tribute comic for the rapper MF Doom.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
It&#8217;s nothing like anything official. It&#8217;s just a nice, small, short story that covers his career in an entertaining way. I&#8217;m not too sure when that&#8217;s coming out. It&#8217;s still in the process of being produced. But, that should be coming out this year, and then just a few freelance projects here and there, just a couple &#8230; music stuff, covers for musicians and so on and so on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Were you a big MF Doom fan?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I was, I was. I wasn&#8217;t the biggest MF Doom, but I loved the music that he put out. I think it was &#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say weird, but it was weird. It was weird and it was eclectic. It was something I had never heard before, something I had never heard put together before quite like the way he made music. So, when he died, I was like, &#8220;Ooh.&#8221; That was a heavy one. So, just to be able to do this comic, it was pretty cool, actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, the way the news came out especially with his wife saying he actually had passed away months prior, and she had just, I guess, waited until the end of the year to drop the news. Not many people know this, but, I think every episode, most episodes of Revision Path that I recorded here in my little makeshift studio, there&#8217;s a 24&#215;36&#8243; poster of Madvillain to my right.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if many people know how much of an MF Doom fan I am, but yeah, when I heard that, man, that got me. I got the action figure. I got all the CDs. I got the magnets. I got a bunch of stuff, MF Doom patches and stuff. Man, what a loss, what a loss. How did you get involved with doing a tribute comic to him?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
So, I am friends with &#8230; Her name is Maia Crown Williams. She actually was the person who helped put it together. It&#8217;s written by a great writer by the name of Troy Allen. She basically was what got me involved with the project because she&#8217;s known me over the years. She runs a comic convention out in Detroit called MECCAcon, and I&#8217;ve done it once before. We&#8217;ve just been in touch over the years because she likes my work. She thinks I&#8217;m cool. So, when he was looking for artist, she hit me up to do a test drive for what would be the final comic. He liked what I did and it was just history from there on. He just knocked it out over the, I think, last month or so. Well, yeah, I worked on the art the last month or so, and, right now, it&#8217;s still in the post-production stage of everything. So, it turned out pretty good, I would say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, hopefully they put it up for sale or just have it online somewhere where people can take a look at it because he has a legion of fans around the world, me included. That sounds pretty dope.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve only seen a few of the finished pages so far, and they look phenomenal. I really like how it&#8217;s turning out. I think people will dig it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, now, you mentioned doing some album covers, some music covers and stuff. You&#8217;re kind of connected with a music company, is that right, called Soulstar?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah [crosstalk 00:09:25]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Soulstar is actually Musiq Soulchild&#8217;s company.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh!</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, Musiq Soulchild, that&#8217;s his imprint for not only his regular music Soulchild stuff, but his side passion projects as well. I&#8217;ve actually had a chance to work on all facets of those projects, so that&#8217;s been pretty cool to do. Yeah, that&#8217;s Musiq&#8217;s &#8230; I think it&#8217;s his label and his imprint at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, that name takes me back all the way to, God, maybe freshman, sophomore year in college, the year 2000. Oh my goodness, it&#8217;s funny you mention that because I know he&#8217;s done some work with India Arie. Oh my God, this was years ago I had designer for India Arie on the show, Denise Nicole Francis. This was years and years ago. I don&#8217;t know if that name sounds familiar to you or not, but I know they&#8217;ve done some work together in terms of doing design and imprint and stuff. So, when you&#8217;re working with a label like that, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s more than just album covers and stuff. What all kind of stuff are you designing?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been like his side projects and whatnot. I don&#8217;t know if I can&#8217;t talk about one of them because we&#8217;re still working on it, so it&#8217;s still behind the scenes. But for the most part, I had designs for logos like certain badges for his certain personas, his musical personas. That&#8217;s where his side projects came in. So, for instance, I had a badge for just Musiq Soulchild. And then, there was a badge for his persona called The Husel, which is like his rap hybrid persona. And then, there was another one called P. WondaLuv, Purple WondaLuv, and that was his Prince, funk-inspired persona. I did badges for all of those. I also did covers for them, as well. I did the latest album that came out, Feel the Real. I did the artwork for that one, and then his Husel side project and his P. WondaLuv side project. I did the art for that, as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Very cool. I can imagine there&#8217;s no shortage of interesting and creative ideas that he can come up with that now he can just turn around and have you work on. That&#8217;s pretty dope.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
The thing I don&#8217;t think most people know about Musiq is that he is a very, very creative dude. He is also very &#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say nerdy, but he very much embraces geek culture, and that&#8217;s how we connected through our love for stuff like anime and comics and whatnot. The stuff that I work for him, a lot of that influence shows. It showed in the concept and just execution of it, so that was a very cool thing to find out, working with him.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I first found out about you and your work years and years and years ago through Tumblr. You have a comic called The Revolutionary Times.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, so, The Revolutionary Times, it&#8217;s a comic started by me and my longtime friend Brandon Howard. He&#8217;s the writer. I&#8217;m the artist. We started it back in 2008 while I was still in college at the time. We were just inspired by &#8230; Boondocks was off the comic kind of thing for a while. It ventured into TV shows, so we were just like, &#8220;There&#8217;s not many Black comic strips out,&#8221; at the time, so we were just like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s start something. Let&#8217;s start something.&#8221; We were inspired by Boondocks. We were inspired by, obviously, the classics like Charlie Brown, Calvin and Hobbes, and we just put our own personal lives and mixed it with pop culture, mixed it with politics. It just turned into this comic that we&#8217;ve been doing for a while. It&#8217;s been off and on, but we&#8217;re still in the midst of trying to push more comics out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where did that idea &#8230; I guess you alluded to it. Now, you were inspired by the Boondocks and other similar types of comics, but where did that idea first come from outside of that? You just wanted to fill the void that you felt was left behind from those comics?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, because, originally, it&#8217;s all Brandon&#8217;s idea. He came to me one day. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Man, you still drawing?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yo, I&#8217;m in college right now. Yes.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Man, let&#8217;s do a comic.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yeah, let&#8217;s do a comic.&#8221; And then, he just came up with these ideas, these references to pop culture, to politics that was just amazing, and I helped with some of the humor part of it as well. The way it flowed, it was just amazing. Originally, yeah, it was all Brandon. I was just the guy with the pencil at the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you all have still kept up with it. I think the latest one that I saw, it was Madea protecting [Peria Megan 00:15:27] from Security or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, that was a quick one we had to put out because we just had to. It&#8217;s just one of the many crazy things that come across our minds that we say, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s make a comic about this.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know that The Boondocks was supposed to come back on HBO Max last year. Maybe hopefully it will happen this year. Certainly, I would love to see what the next season would be of just what they could pull off. I personally don&#8217;t count the fourth season of The Boondocks. The first three seasons were great. Season four, eh, it was all right. It was okay. I want to see what they come up with for the fifth season.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, I think they pushed it back to later this year. But, I look at the fourth season of Boondocks the same way I look at &#8230; what was that season? The third season of The Chappelle Show. I look at it the same way as that. It doesn&#8217;t exist. It&#8217;s nonexistent in my mind or in my history.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I rewatched it recently because I got HBO Max and I was going through it and everything, and I rewatched the fourth season just to see if maybe I missed something. I think I was watching it like everyone else was watching it on Twitter. They&#8217;ll watch it and give commentary and stuff. It was not hittin&#8217; at all. They had that weird sort of Good Times reference that strung through the whole season. What the fuck was that about? It was not good. It was not good.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Right, and then they tried to spoof Breaking Bad. It was just weird. It was weird.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, they were doing what I see sitcoms do when they run out of ideas in that they sort of start making up these fantastical parodies, and it&#8217;s like the show itself is already a bit of a fantastical parody. You don&#8217;t need to try to mimic something else. Yeah, why are they mimicking Breaking Bad? What&#8217;s that about? Are they just trying to cash in on that cultural moment? I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s just not good.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, so, hopefully, I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing with the newest &#8230; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a reboot season. I don&#8217;t even know. I hope this one is a little bit more Aaron McGruder [crosstalk 00:17:58]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I really hope he&#8217;s out there creating some heat because even Black Jesus was funny, and then it was on this weird hiatus. You&#8217;d catch and episode here or there. It was almost like Steven Universe. It didn&#8217;t stay on a regular schedule. You just had to catch it when you could catch it. So, I hope so, man, because so many people are missing his humor and everything. I don&#8217;t know. So, when it comes to creating comics, what does your process look like?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Well, it depends. For instance, with Revolutionary Times, the script itself, the scriptwriting itself is more so me and Brandon bouncing ideas back and forth recently, yeah. And then, when it comes time for me to actually create the work, I pull up all my references, background references, character references, and I just have them set up in another monitor. I have like, three monitors. I have one monitor for my main art program, and then the others for my reference to just look at while I work. The process is basically just putting all that together to try and tell a story, trying to tell a cohesive story, sometimes without words. It&#8217;s a long process. It can definitely be a long process, but I&#8217;m getting the hang of it, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you say character references, what do you mean? Do you have a file with information on a character or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, for instance, if I&#8217;m drawing, like Madea, I have pictures pulled off of Google of Madea or Tyler Perry or, what are they called, the royal guards. I have them all set up on one screen just to glance at as I sketch out to draw everything into the final, basically. Then, I use that for if I&#8217;m coloring it, if I&#8217;m doing the actual colors. I&#8217;m using that same picture as a pallette to get the right colors, color flats on the characters, basically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, I gotcha. What is the design scene like in Detroit? I&#8217;ve only had a handful of folks on the show that are in Detroit and working as designers. But, for you, what&#8217;s the design scene like there?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
It&#8217;s kind of hard for me to explain about it because, this whole year, everyone&#8217;s been stuck inside, so it&#8217;s hard to describe it. We have our design firms and whatnot. And then, you have the freelancers, the people who are just the wild guns of the design industry. I would say that, art-wise, Detroit is building a lot, I would say. Design-wise, like I said, there&#8217;s the firms. Art-wise, there&#8217;s a &#8230; What is it called? It&#8217;s called murals in the market. Well, they didn&#8217;t do it this year, unfortunately, of course, but they have it set up in the place called East St. Market where they pull a bunch of murals, paintings from around the city, and they go around that East St. Market area and they&#8217;re making murals on different buildings, and you get to see the sea of different styles all around you. It&#8217;s one of the most amazing things I&#8217;ve ever gotten a chance to see. I hate that I couldn&#8217;t &#8230; It just wasn&#8217;t a thing this year because of the pandemic, but, art-wise, Detroit is booming quietly but steadily, I would say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We have something similar like that here down in Atlanta called Living Walls, sort of like a muralist fest. Well, actually, it&#8217;s an art organization. They put on an event also called Living Walls. They do little murals &#8230; not little murals. They&#8217;re huge. They&#8217;re on the sides of buildings and stuff. Of course, we have underground artists and such that do all kinds of different interesting interpretations of murals like Fabian Williams, occasional superstar. I live in the hood. For folks that don&#8217;t know that live in Atlanta, I live in the West End. So, there&#8217;s a Caribbean restaurant near me called Mango&#8217;s, and, on the side of that building, he&#8217;ll do different sorts of murals.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think the last one I saw, which had to have been prior to the pandemic, which lets you know how far I&#8217;ve gone outside my apt. It was Martin Luther King, but I think he had a high-top fade and had cuts on the side or something like that. So, he&#8217;s done these modern/&#8217;80sish interpretations of civil rights figures. There&#8217;s Coretta Scott King, but she&#8217;s got an asymmetrical bob, Pepa from Salt-N-Pepa, something like that. But yeah, Atlanta is a big mural city like that, especially if you&#8217;re downtown. If you go outside of downtown, outside of the perimeter, I can&#8217;t be responsible for what you see once you leave outside of the actual city. But, in the city itself, there&#8217;s so much graffiti and murals and wall art and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve been to Atlanta, I think, once or twice, and I&#8217;ve seen some of the graffiti there. It&#8217;s amazing, so I get an idea of what you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, before we get more into your career, let&#8217;s take it back to the beginning. In your bio, you mentioned that you grew up in Saginaw, Michigan. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Ah, Saginaw, Michigan, Saginaw Michigan &#8230; Growing up in Saginaw, Michigan was an experience. Saginaw is a very small town. Well, I take that back. It&#8217;s not a small town, but, if you compare it to someplace like Detroit, it&#8217;s small. Growing up there, I&#8217;m not going to say I had it rough. I lived in the suburban part of Saginaw, but it was just a small town. Everybody knew everybody. If you&#8217;re from Saginaw, it&#8217;s like that Kevin Bacon &#8230; What is that thing called?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, like Six Degrees of Separation?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yes, yes, Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, that is basically living in Saginaw. You know everybody or somebody knows you from somebody. But, living there, it built me up. It built who I became to be, and that&#8217;s &#8230; I&#8217;ve fallen in love with art. We don&#8217;t really have an art scene, well, not that I know of, now. At the time, there wasn&#8217;t really an art scene in Saginaw, but there was always comic book stores, and that is where I found my love for art, in the comic book store. My folks would take me to a 7-Eleven, and there would be that lonely stand of comics just rotating in my face. That&#8217;s where the love came from. And then, I found actual comic book stores to just peruse and look at. It just grew out from there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Marvel or DC?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I am neutral.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Aw, come on! Okay, all right.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I&#8217;m sorry. I have a ton of favorites on both sides. I love Batman. I love Spider-Man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Did you watch the Snyder cut of Justice League?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I did. That, I&#8217;m still astounded by the differences that that movie has. I watched the original one, the Wheaton version before I watched the Snyder one, and it&#8217;s just night and day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Really?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yes, man. It&#8217;s just so night and day. I&#8217;m still astounded by it. I don&#8217;t think there has been a director&#8217;s cut that is this drastically different from what was put into the theater since Blade Runner. That&#8217;s how I feel about it. I loved it. I loved the Snyder cut. I&#8217;m sad that it wasn&#8217;t the first movie that I saw in 2017, but I&#8217;m glad it came out because it was everything a comic book person would probably want.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Does it help if you watch it from a 2017 perspective? Because, that&#8217;s when the original Justice League movie came out. I was wondering if it had aged over the years since it&#8217;s been in obscurity because of the studios and everything.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t think it aged, necessarily. There&#8217;s still a bad joke in there or two. There&#8217;s definitely some bad &#8230; not cringeworthy, but it&#8217;s eye-rollable, kind of.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s four hours. There&#8217;s got to be something in there that&#8217;s &#8230; Everything can&#8217;t be a hit.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
It&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s not. Have you seen it?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I have not seen it, and I refuse &#8230; Okay, refuse is a strong word. I don&#8217;t feel that DC has earned enough good will for me from their current movie offerings to sit through four hours of that.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Understandable, understandable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I did watch Justice League. Did I go to the movies to see Justice League? I don&#8217;t remember. I did see justice league. I have not seen Suicide Squad or the Harley Quinn movie. They just didn&#8217;t interest me, and that&#8217;s not so say I&#8217;m not a DC fan. I am a DC fan. I&#8217;m pretty split between marvel and DC, myself, but I feel like marvel does better live-action movies. DC does better animated movies.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, that&#8217;s definitely the case because the latest animation &#8230; No, I think the latest one we did was a Batman movie. But, the few animated ones that I&#8217;ve seen have been like, &#8220;This is the same company?&#8221; The quality is far beyond what you would get with the live-action stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right, but the writing is good. They all have a consistent art style. They have that kind of Bruce Tim art style and they take bold strokes in terms of storytelling. It&#8217;s not all canon types of things. You have Justice League Dark. I think they did one like with the apocalypse one. They take broad strokes in terms of storytelling that, of course, with live-action, would probably be expensive and risky to do. But, with animation, it&#8217;s probably cheaper, I would imagine.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, and that&#8217;s partly why it&#8217;s the more superior brand. But, I will say I did enjoy Birds of Pray. I enjoyed Shazam. That was a nice one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, Shazam was good! Shazam was good. I forgot about Shazam. That is a DC.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah. Shazam was good. Aquaman was good, but the fact that they shelved this version of Justice League is just one of the most baffling things in my entire viewpoint, because there had to be a way to just trim it down to two hours.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How long was the original Justice League?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
The one that came out in theaters?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
It was under two hours, I think.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
From what I&#8217;m guessing, Josh Wheaton reshot a whole bunch of everything, really, because even the endings are completely contrast of each other. It is an interesting thing just to see how different things movie came out to be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;re convincing me to see it because I don&#8217;t remember that much from the original Justice League except for the showdown where they all fought Superman, and I remember Cyborg, it felt like Cyborg was a bigger part of the story, or was at least a substantial part of the story in the original. And then, from what I&#8217;ve heard, he has a much more substantial role in the Snyder cut.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
So, the part where they&#8217;re fighting Superman, that&#8217;s still the same, still mostly the same thing. The way it ends is slightly different, but Cyborg is the main character in this movie to me. Once you get into the later parts of it, he is the heart and soul of this movie. I feel like I just repeated like a critic somewhere, [inaudible 00:31:20] but it&#8217;s the truth. It&#8217;s the truth. The fact that his entire storyline, which is cut for him to say booya at the end, it was weird to see. So, I would say, if you do watch it, watch it &#8230; because, it&#8217;s cut in chapters, so I would watch it in chapters, honestly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, so it&#8217;s not just a full four-hour slog. You can watch a chapter, come back to it?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, I would watch it in chapters because it&#8217;s worth to see. I think it&#8217;s worth seeing that version of the story.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, all right, you&#8217;ve convinced me. I say this like I won&#8217;t sit through and watch four hours of Bridgerton or something like that, so I can watch Justice League. You talked about earlier going to school for art. You went to Detroit College for creative studies. What was that like? What was your time like there?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
It was pretty interesting because, before that, I went to &#8230; My high school was called Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy, and it was a school that focused, basically, on sciences and arts. It had a heavy focus on the visual arts, performing arts like theater and dance. Then, you had your global studies, your biology, your scientific aspects. It was a unique school experience then, so it kind of prepared me for when I did move to Detroit to go to CCS. It was just more of an expansive view on art because I&#8217;m in this place where there&#8217;s different personalities, different styles. That was an eye-opener. That was a real introduction to just a lot of people that I still know to this day, honestly. It was eye-opening. It was a good experience for not only social-wise, but it was a good experience for me growing in my art, in my craft, because I learned so much at that school, and it&#8217;s just a lot of things that I still carry with me to this day, as it should, because it was expensive. It was just a good tool. The professors there were amazing, and they&#8217;re still people I still talk to to this day. They still help me out in my career, so I think it was a good experience. It was a good thing to utilize, still a good thing to utilize to this day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. It&#8217;s so interesting because I often hear the opposite from people that say they went to an arts college. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Eh, it was okay,&#8221; or that it didn&#8217;t really prepare them for going out into the working world, doing what they do. But, it sounds like you had a great experience. That&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Well, I would say there were those parts, too, the long nights of trying to finish projects. It was more so focused on our craft. There were classes here and there about the actually business side of the art world, but it was more so focused on bettering us as artists. I would say I learned more about the business side of illustration, for instance. I learned more so about the business side of that just through experience, honestly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Gotcha, gotcha, okay. What were some of your work experiences when you graduated?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
It was more so just freelancing because, when I graduated, I moved back to Saginaw, and then I was just more so freelancing, so it started off in event posters, mixtape covers, album covers, logos, and then it grew into more granter things like full-on album designs and full promotional designs or promotional releases or whatnot. Yeah, it just grew, and I started getting actual clients like Musiq or like ESPN or Complex.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I see you&#8217;ve done some work with some pretty big brands and big clients. When you look back at those past projects, what did they teach you?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Patience, patience, definite patience. I consider myself a pretty patient person as is, but freelance can bring a side out of you. I would say patience and just seeing a project through the end. I think, that part, a lot of people, it&#8217;s hard to get to the end, honestly, with some projects because of the time put in, the energy. There may be changes, and there are changes after changes. But, just seeing a project through to the end is one of the most satisfying things, no matter how you feel about the project itself. Just seeing it through the end is a satisfying feeling in itself, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Aside from that, you&#8217;ve also done a lot of collaborative projects. We talked about The Revolutionary Times, of course, being probably one of the bigger ones. But, for you, what&#8217;s the value of collaborating on projects?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I think collaboration opens your world up to other people&#8217;s viewpoints, other people&#8217;s creative world or creative ways of doing things. I think if you find that right person that you can mesh with, you could bring something pretty cool to the table. I&#8217;ve done, aside from working with Grid &#8230; and I&#8217;ve done collaborations with &#8230; There was one guy, his name was CJ Johnson. We worked on a full graphic novel. It was called Kill Or Be Killed, but it wasn&#8217;t some action type of graphic novel. It was a story about rich Black Manhattan type of people like bohemian style characters. It was just a story that you typically wouldn&#8217;t see in a comic book, just telling of a life of these classy but still kind of edgy characters. It was just something I had never done before because I was just used to doing funny comic strips and whatnot. That, for instance, is something that I always see as a good collaboration because it was a mixture of something that I&#8217;ve never experienced before, which, I think, bettered me as an artist to be able to tell CJ&#8217;s story. So, I think if you find that right collaborator, yeah, something magical might come out of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I&#8217;m mentioning this not in any sort of disparaging way, but you have a full-time job that doesn&#8217;t deal with art [crosstalk 00:39:28] I&#8217;m not going to ask you what that job is. I know you have a full-time job that doesn&#8217;t deal with art, but how do you balance the two? How do you balance having that extra time to pursue your creative passions?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
It is very difficult. It is almost impossible. There was, unfortunately, a year or two where it was impossible because of how this job just took out my energy. Well, I will say it is an essential job, so I was pretty much still working all last year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, so, last year being one of those years where it was just difficult to do art, it can get to you. It can overcome your passion. But, I think that you just got to find a balance. Because, at the time, it was impossible. It was impossible to really get a balance of work and getting time to be creative. But, I just had to set time aside because this is something I want to do. I don&#8217;t want to do this job, the essential job for the rest of my life. I want to do art for the rest of my life. So, I just had to set time, had to do what I can. It was just like taking a little sketchbook and sneaking in some art in the middle of the job. I had to do what I could just to be like, &#8220;Hey, I am still an artist. This is what I want to do.&#8221; So, it&#8217;s hard. It&#8217;s hard. I&#8217;m still dealing with it to this day, but it&#8217;s just something you just got to keep pushing for.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would it look like for you to be a full-time illustrator, or full-time graphic artist, I&#8217;ll say?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Definitely wouldn&#8217;t have to wake up at 4:00 in the morning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oof [crosstalk 00:41:33] my God.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s not fun. I would say just being able to spend time on projects whether it be just one main project or small multiple projects, just taking time out of my day to work on these different ideas. Because, in my head, I have a lot of ideas just running around in my head that I never have time to actually get out. But, being a full-time artist, that would open up that time to be like, &#8220;All right, this will be my hour of personal creativity, food, and then another hour of professional work, and whatnot.&#8221; It would just be a day full of creating, basically. That&#8217;s what I would want, just to be able to create whether it is just a sketch or something more polished, basically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of your artistic influences?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Names or genres?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Both.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
The first name that pops up in my head, his name is &#8230; Well, there&#8217;s a couple names, but John Romita Jr., Chris Bucello, Aaron McGruder, obviously, LeSean Thomas. He worked on The Boondocks, but he also has his own anime that&#8217;s on Netflix right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Cannon Busters or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yes, Cannon Busters, that&#8217;s exactly it. There&#8217;s a few other names. J. Scott Campbell, he did a comic book called Danger Girl.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, I remember Danger Girl. I actually have two of those issues, I think, of Danger Girl.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I loved Danger Girl. I loved his work, just how detailed his work was. Oh no, I&#8217;m going to ruin his name, the creator of Cowboy Bebop, Watanabe.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Watanabe, Shinichir≈ç Watanabe?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yes, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m a nerd over here. I know stuff.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Thank you, thank you. There&#8217;s like 1,000 others, but those are the ones that pop up to me first and foremost.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, Chris McCulloch work on early-stage Generation X and the &#8230; I think that had to be in the &#8217;90s or early 2000s. His work is so indelibly seared into my mind when I think about great comic work. He did some work for the larger X books, too. But, particularly with Generation X, I just have a big fondness for that team in general. They were done so dirty with that movie on Fox in &#8217;96. I think it was &#8217;96 when they had the Generation X movie.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Oh, I know exactly what you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s on YouTube. If you&#8217;re listening and you want to find it, first of all, buyer beware, i&#8217;s very bad. And, I think it was one of the first if not the first &#8230; well, not one of the first because I&#8217;m sure they had Fantastic Four shows and movies and stuff. But, to come out of the Mutant X kind of realm, Generation X was just so bad. I hate how bad it was.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
No, that was like the first live-action thing they did with X-Men, because they had the animated show and whatnot, but that was like the very first live-action. They went onto the movies, but yeah, that was-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, like, Jubilee was played by a white girl. Come on. It was so bad. It was so bad. And, they got a British woman to play Emma, but maybe Emma&#8217;s mom. She was way too old to be playing Emma. It was not good. It just wasn&#8217;t good at all. They deserve better. Although, I&#8217;m glad Monet, who was my favorite &#8230; I mean, I didn&#8217;t like how she was portrayed in the movie, but she was my favorite of the team, that she&#8217;s part of the main X Team now. Although, I still need to &#8230; I&#8217;m so behind on the comics, now, especially marvel stuff. I just catch a trade paperback here and there because that&#8217;s the best I can do these days.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s the best advice you&#8217;ve been given about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
This advice isn&#8217;t necessary exclusively on what I do, but it&#8217;s one that sticks with me the most. It&#8217;s advice that my dad always gives me whenever it involves a project or just anything, just life in general. But, it&#8217;s like, if you do something, do it to the best of your ability. And, if you do something, see it all the way through. That is literally what runs in my mind every time I do something. It&#8217;s just like, &#8220;If I do something, I have to do it to the point that, when you look at this, you know that I drew it. You know that I was a part of this project somehow and just being able to finish it all the way through.&#8221; Like I said before, it&#8217;s just a wonderful feeling no matter what project you do because it&#8217;s a feeling of accomplishments. So, I think it has nothing specifically to do with art, but, that advice that my dad gave me, that my dad gives me all the time, that&#8217;s the one thing that pops in my head all the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have a dream project that you&#8217;d love to do or that you&#8217;d love to work on one day?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I would love to storyboard for a movie. Well, I take that back. I would love, for instance, to make The Revolutionary Times into a movie. That&#8217;s a top goal, basically, but I would love to do some kind of work for a major production storyboarding or character design or something like that. A personal goal would be to draw a Deadpool comic. I don&#8217;t even have to do a series. Just give me a few pages or something. That&#8217;s definitely a goal. Yeah, I would just love to be able to work on something that&#8217;s a big production, just be able to have my style on something that&#8217;s going to be seen by millions of eyes. That&#8217;s something I would love to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is keeping you motivated and inspired these days?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I think the one thing that&#8217;s been motivating me has been &#8230; because I follow a lot of artists on all my social media, Twitter, Instagram, all that. Just seeing all this work that people are able to create, even in the midst of all this insanity that we&#8217;re dealing with, that&#8217;s inspiring to see the different styles, the different techniques, techniques that you could bring back to your own work and try and see if that&#8217;s something that you can adapt to your own style. That&#8217;s just the way of artists. You&#8217;re constantly growing. You&#8217;re constantly building yourself up to be like the better part of what you were before. You&#8217;re always transforming. You&#8217;re always evolving, basically.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
So, I think that&#8217;s one of the ways that I keep motivated, just trying to elevate myself, trying to see what I can do differently or see what I can mix up to create something that I haven&#8217;t done before. And then, there&#8217;s always just taking a day off and watching anime for a whole day. That&#8217;s one way to do it, as well. So, it&#8217;s a lot of ways. It&#8217;s a lot of ways that I&#8217;m trying to be inspired.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What shows are you watching right now?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Honestly, I&#8217;ve just been rewatching Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
That, when I&#8217;m down, when I&#8217;m not sure what to do, it&#8217;s always, just pull up Cowboy Bebop and running through a couple of those episodes. I did start rewatching Attack on Titan, which is traumatic, to say the least. There was another show that I just finished watching. It&#8217;s on Hulu. No Guns Life, I think it&#8217;s called. That&#8217;s what I started watching. It&#8217;s pretty good. It&#8217;s a pretty interesting concept to it. For the most part, I just go back to the classics. I&#8217;m always open for people to give me some new ones to catch because I feel like it&#8217;s like comics. That&#8217;s another thing that I&#8217;m trying to catch back up on because I&#8217;m still trying to find the new joints, basically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What genre of anime do you like the best? Comedy? Action? Supernatural?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I like a little bit of hybrid. I like the ones that have a mix of comedy and action to it. For instance, one of my favorite ones is Trigon. That has the comedy. That has the slapstick comedy, the action to it, the serious tones. So, that has a little bit of everything. I think the one that I fell in love with was the more so space-centered ones, because then you had Gundam. You had Cowboy Bebop, Outlaw Star, a lot of those space-centered stories. I would thank Toonami and the Syfy Channel for all that, but you know. I would say I like a mixture of all the genres, I would say, the hybrid ones where you have its funny moments. You have your stressful moments as well, so yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you see &#8230; God, what&#8217;s the one? You were mentioning one, and I was wondering if you saw it because it did come on Toonami, I think &#8230; not Toonami, Adult Swim. What was it called, Eureka Seven? Did you see that?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I did not see Eureka 7 no, that I haven&#8217;t seen. I think that&#8217;s one of the ones on my list that I have to sit down and watch. Yeah, I have a list of so many movies and anime that I just haven&#8217;t watched yet. It&#8217;s a long list, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m ever got to get through it at this point, but it&#8217;s on there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I&#8217;ll also give you a recommendation, but this one is pretty old school. I think it&#8217;s probably on &#8230; It&#8217;s got to be on one of the anime streaming services like Crunchyroll or VRV or something like that, but Legend of the Galactic Heroes. It&#8217;s an old one. It&#8217;s like an &#8217;80s anime, so it&#8217;s got that different kind of &#8217;80s anime style, but very complex storytelling. It&#8217;s set in space. It&#8217;s very much a space &#8230; I was going to say a space opera. That&#8217;s kind of the best way to put it. It&#8217;s like a military space opera kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
You said it&#8217;s called Legend of the Galactic Heroes?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Okay, all right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s pretty long, though. It&#8217;s over 100 episodes, so it&#8217;s not a quick one.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s not a quick watch.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Oh, it&#8217;s one of those, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think Eureka Seven is like 26, like a standard 26-episode thing, but it&#8217;s not as long as Naruto, which is like 500-something episodes or more.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Yeah, see, when you get to the shows that have like 1,500 seasons like Naruto and One Piece, I&#8217;m just not going to be able to get into that. I&#8217;ll enjoy the references along with everybody else, but I can&#8217;t sit down and watch 500 hours of Naruto. I&#8217;m sorry, I can&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think the last modern anime that I watched &#8230; I&#8217;m saying modern like within the past five years. It was either &#8230; It was a couple. It was SSSS.Gridman, which was pretty good. I watched [Personify 00:54:24] the animation because I played the video game, and, oh God, this one called Inuyashiki, which is &#8230; I&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s an acquired taste. I think it&#8217;s a 13-episode series. The protagonist is an old &#8230; I don&#8217;t want to spoil it, but the protagonist is an old man that is also a heavy robot arsenal. It&#8217;s an interesting [inaudible 00:54:50] I&#8217;ll put it in the chat so you can see it, but it&#8217;s an interesting story, Inuyashiki. There were some clips of it floating around in 2017 or so because I think Donald Trump is featured at some point in the anime. It&#8217;s kind of out there. I don&#8217;t want to say it&#8217;s morbid, but, you know what, you watch it and you tell me what you think about it. Also, for those of you that are out there listening, if y&#8217;all have seen it, let me know what you think about it. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
Well, hopefully not waking up at 4:00 in the morning every day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Amen to that.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
The only thing I would definitely love to be saying that I would hoping to be doing I five years is just still doing art, still creating. I can&#8217;t honestly say what the next five years would look like, but I would just hope it has me creating something whether it&#8217;s illustration or even doing that big production, doing art for that. I just want to be able to keep &#8230; be able to create, basically, and, yeah, maybe I&#8217;ll be part of a studio or still doing my own thing freelancing. Or, maybe Brandon and I are able to take Revolutionary Times and make it to a bigger platform. It&#8217;s a lot to say. Five years, you never know. We didn&#8217;t know what last year would be like, so &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true. That&#8217;s very true.</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
At this point, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t make any plans,&#8221; because life is very weird. Life is way too weird to make plans. Plan making is still important. Don&#8217;t go through life without a plan, but just know that life can always throw that one curve ball just like, &#8220;Oh, hey, there&#8217;s your plan in the bottom of the ocean somewhere.&#8221; I just would say I want to be able to still be creating in five years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, just to wrap things up here, Sean, where can our audience find out more about you and your work and your projects and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Sean Mack:</b><br>
I guess the main place, Instagram, @silentsmack, all one word. I am on Twitter. Follow me if you want. It&#8217;s not much art on there, honestly. @ShizukaSam, I can&#8217;t spell it out right now, but @ShizukaSam on Twitter, and then @RevTimes on Twitter, @RevTimes on Instagram, and therevtimes.com for the comics. My personal site: smackillustrations.com.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Sean Mack, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. But, first of all, I was really just excited to talk to you because I&#8217;ve been following your work for such a long time, The Revolutionary Times and everything, so it was good to actually talk to you about the process and everything behind it. I think, certainly, with the work that you&#8217;re doing, the fact that you are such a keen collaborator and that you&#8217;re putting work out there that speaks to people, I hope that&#8217;s something that you will continue to keep doing throughout the years. I mean, the work that you&#8217;re doing, I could see this blowing up. I really can. We got to find a way to break you out of Michigan, but I can see your work blowing up in the next few years. So, hopefully, folks that are listening, make sure you check out Sean&#8217;s work. But, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>

<p>Meet Hank Washington, the owner of Hank Design Studios. His studio&#8217;s mission is to help brands turn strangers into friends, and Hank does this through the design and illustration. I was glad to catch up with him recently, not too long after his move to Atlanta.</p>
<p>We spoke about weathering the pandemic, and Hank shared how the first few months of business has went for his studio. He also talked about growing up in a small Southern town and being exposed to design as a kid, moving to Alabama to consider pursuing his dream, and gave some great advice for any designers out there looking to hone their unique style. </p>
<p>Hank&#8217;s illustration style is a good indicator of what kind of designer he is &#8212; creative, playful, and willing to think outside the box. And now that he&#8217;s struck out on his own, there&#8217;s no telling where his skills will take him!</p>

<p>What do you get when you combine top notch graphic design and illustration talent, the intensity of punk music, and world class skills in facilitation? Why, you get this week&#8217;s guest &#8212; Kendall Howse! As we head into this festive holiday week, I couldn&#8217;t think of a better person to share their story and remind us of the power of inclusivity and empathy.</p>
<p>Our conversation began by exploring Kendall&#8217;s current work as a senior marketing designer at Red Hat. From there, we talked about employee resource groups at tech companies, the crisis of consumption in the Bay Area, and Kendall&#8217;s time growing up in Boston before moving out to California. We also discussed Kendall&#8217;s work as a facilitator with¬†<a href="https://frameshiftconsulting.com/ally-skills-workshop/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Frame Shift Consulting</a>, his community work with¬†<a href="https://www.bayareablackdesigners.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Bay Area Black Designers</a>, and his Black liberation hardcore punk band¬†<a href="https://massarrest.bandcamp.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Mass Arrest</a>. For Kendall, creating the space to thrive is key to who he is, and I hope that&#8217;s a message we can all take into the future. Happy holidays!</p>

<span class="thst-toggle-title">Full Transcript</span><div class="thst-toggle-inner">
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: All right. Tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: My name is Kendall Boo Boo Howse. I am a marketing designer for Red Hat, and I&#8217;ve been designing for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: How did you get started at Red Hat? What does your regular day-to-day look like there?</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: I&#8217;m on a really fantastic team that was called creative strategy and design, but we&#8217;ve just absorbed the brand team as well. I think now it&#8217;s brand and creative, but it&#8217;s a team of about 30 to 40 people including graphic designers, animators, filmmakers, 3D illustrators. It&#8217;s really a dynamic team.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Within that team, I do a lot of graphic design, digital graphic design and illustration, for everything from web assets to print assets to our major annual trade show conference called Red Hat Summit where we cater to about 8,000 attendees and do a full-immersive three-day experience with that. There&#8217;s a lot of variety to the work, which I really appreciate.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Now, before that you were at CoreOS, which got acquired by Red Hat. Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. At CoreOS I was hired. I was an employee in the 60s. I was the third designer. At that time, the design team was doing all of the marketing design and all the product design. It was a software company, one of the first companies in the Kubernetes space. We were doing everything from social media ads to conference booth work, but also doing the user interface to the actual product. After a little while we ended up splitting the design team into marketing and product, where I then became the sole marketing designer.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: I was supposed to build the team, but we ended up doing a hiring freeze because, unbeknownst to me, we were in the process of being acquired. When that happens, you stop spending money. I then spent the final year of CoreOS as the only person doing all marketing and sales design, but that led to us being acquired by Red Hat, me being acquired by Red Hat. Then about eight months later, Red Hat got acquired by IBM. A lot of little fish being eaten by bigger fish.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. Has there been a big shift in the work or the work culture since the acquisition?</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: There has. CoreOS was a really small startup. I think in the end we had 130 employees, after four years. Very San Francisco, very venture capital, Y Combinator. A lot of hoodies. Young. Really young, too. Most of the employees, I would say, were under the age of 30. When we were acquired by Red Hat, Red Hat had been around for 25 years. Red Hat is based in Raleigh, North Carolina, so opposite coast, and was like 13,000 people, so a big cultural shift.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: When we were acquired, as often happens, the majority of the original employees, within the first year, left for other opportunities. There was a massive shift of culture, not for the worse in any way. I mean, there&#8217;s I think appeal to a lot of people, the idea of working at a startup, but the thing about startups is it&#8217;s very touch-and-go. It&#8217;s very insecure. Whereas a big company&#8230;I mean, like a startup, you don&#8217;t have HR until you have to have HR, right? Where a big company like Red Hat has worked a lot of this stuff out literally decades ago, and so it&#8217;s a much more secure environment. It&#8217;s a much more fully realized idea.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Going from being a team of one to being on a team of 30. I&#8217;m someone who much prefers to work on a team. I&#8217;m really inspired by the work that other people do. I also really like contributing as much as I like creating. For me it was amazing to suddenly be on this big creative team. Culture change, yes. For the worse, no, definitely not.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Okay. Now, as I was doing my research about Red Hat, I saw they have&#8230;it&#8217;s funny that you mentioned this, about these larger companies having it all worked out. They have a whole nine-page white paper that addresses culture, diversity and inclusion at the company. In that paper they talk about one of their five main D&amp;I communities. One of them&#8217;s called BUILD, which is a acronym for Blacks United In Leadership and Diversity. Now, you co-lead this group, is that right?</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: I do, yep. Employee resource groups are I think a really important thing. When I was at CoreOS I had co-founded Blacks At CoreOS, which was our black employee resource group. There were three of us. We all worked on different teams and didn&#8217;t even live in the same cities. Just having that, being afforded the space and the resources to come together and advocate for ourselves and our community, was really important.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: When we were acquired by Red Hat, that was the first thing I looked into. There was some trepidation from me being in the Bay Area, living in Oakland, walking down the same streets as the founders of the Black Panther Party. That spirit is still very alive in Oakland. Being acquired by a company out of the South was for me pretty intimidating, or I just didn&#8217;t know what to expect.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: That was the first thing that I did, was try to see if they had a black employee resource group, and that&#8217;s how I found BUILD. BUILD, as I understand it, was Red Hat&#8217;s first ERG. It&#8217;s the pilot program. It started organically, where a few brothers who were software engineers started getting together unofficially and had their own IRC chat or some such. At a certain point&#8230;and I don&#8217;t know exactly how it developed&#8230;they were able to approach someone in the company and say, &#8220;We think that this is something that Red Hat should be supporting officially. It should be open to not just black employees but also allies as well, and should have some executive sponsorship.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: It&#8217;s great to be a part of this ERG, because it is the most established at the company. I think it&#8217;s about three years in, but it&#8217;s also the pilot program. We&#8217;re the ones who&#8230;there&#8217;s a lot more pressure&#8230;I would say&#8230;on us&#8230;but we are the ones who are forging the way for all of the other employee resource groups. I mean, now, like you said, we have five. We have a queer employee resource group which is hugely supported. We have one for veterans, one for indigenous people. I don&#8217;t know if we have a Latinx one.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: I don&#8217;t know, but all of which is to say like it&#8217;s great to see that this is a movement. The employee resource group movement is something that&#8217;s growing, and my trepidation about working for this Southern company has shifted severely, because this ERG is really, really well funded.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. I&#8217;m thinking about what is the nexus point in a company where they decide that they want to do this. Because you said when you started it, CoreOS was a small company. BUILD was initially just three people. Do you think that there is a certain time when a startup should be taking this thing into consideration when it comes to diversity and inclusion?</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Yeah. I mean, especially for startups, day one. I mean, it should be a part of the culture. We talk about diversity is something that tech companies and people who work in computation find really appealing, because it&#8217;s really quantifiable. I mean, it&#8217;s easy to say we have X number of a subgroup. Inclusion is the hard part, because it&#8217;s not measurable, it&#8217;s not quantifiable, and it&#8217;s not visible to the people who aren&#8217;t a member of the marginalized group that&#8217;s being included or excluded. My white manager can&#8217;t know if I feel included or not. I mean, unless she asks me, right?</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: I think when the D&amp;I big push was happening in San Francisco five years ago, the focus was really on diversity and hitting numbers, but not about shifting culture in any way. That&#8217;s a top-down decision, which means it&#8217;s a lot of cis, straight white men, just filling their numbers, and that proved to be ineffective.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: With employee resource groups, what you&#8217;re doing as a company is you are giving the people who are the marginalized group the resources to be able to advocate for themselves. We know, through community-building going back a hundred years, that&#8217;s the best way. To say, &#8220;You know what, I don&#8217;t know what, say, a woman from El Salvador needs to feel welcome and included in an environment. Why don&#8217;t I give her the tools and the resources to be able to start advocating for herself?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: In that way, we can build a more positive and inclusive culture, because then the ERGs too will work together. There&#8217;s five ERGs at Red Hat, but we&#8217;re constantly working with each other as well. Not only are we learning how to advocate for ourselves, but we&#8217;re also learning what our colleagues, who are of another marginalized group, also need.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: I think that when you&#8217;re forming an organization, whether it be a startup, whether it be a Meetup group, whether it be a Slack channel or anything like that, you should be thinking that as early on as possible, like day one, for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Honestly, I think if you start a company, your first black employee, be like, &#8220;Hey, do you want to have a employee resource group? What do you envision might be helpful for you? Like how can we open the door to more people like you, so that we can have true diversity and have people feel welcome being here?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: It feels like there&#8217;s been a shift with that, because I remember. You&#8217;re talking about five years ago. I know that a lot of the language around then was about not putting the onus I guess on the employee, in a way, to do the D&amp;I work, that it should be a top-down thing. Which I still agree that it should be, but now it seems like putting those resources in the hands of employees is a safer bet.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Yeah. I think you bring up a really good point there. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I as a black person have definitely been in a lot of situations where it&#8217;s been shoved into my lap. &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know, you figure it out.&#8221; It&#8217;s a lot of unpaid hours. It&#8217;s a lot of unsupported work, like where maybe the chief of operations is saying do this, but your direct report manager is like, &#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t have time to do this.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: I think the key to good D&amp;I is executive sponsorship. It has to be supported at the highest ranks, so that your manager can&#8217;t tell you that you can&#8217;t work on it. Your PM has to pencil in time, because it has to be the company has to show from the top tier that it&#8217;s deeply dedicated to this work.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: It can&#8217;t be leaving an individual or a small group of people to seem rogue, to seem, for lack of a better term, special needs. That isn&#8217;t the case. The executive leadership has to say, &#8220;No, this is a part of the core tenant of this organization, of this community that we are building, and including our customers. All of this is core to our values, and so we&#8217;re going to put in the time, the money, the resources, to make sure that this happens.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Now, one interesting thing that happens in a lot of companies is the executives are still straight, cis white men, and so I don&#8217;t know of a single ERG&#8230;actually, I probably know a couple, but the vast majority of the ones I know of, including my black employee resource group, it&#8217;s technically led by a white man, because our executive sponsor is a white guy.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Now, I could see situations where that can be problematic, but in our case it&#8217;s actually great, because there&#8217;s an opportunity where I know that there are people. I mean, at this point there have been so many leaked Google memos that we know that there are people who aren&#8217;t a part of these groups that are really taking offense, and that are really having an issue with the fact of these groups. They just don&#8217;t understand the value and the necessity of these groups. To have someone like them saying, &#8220;Well, look, I&#8217;m okay with it. Not only am I okay with it, I sign off on it. I support it. I&#8217;m facilitating this thing.&#8221; I think that that representation is really important as well.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. Five years ago, to that point, you said earlier there were a lot of these really big tech companies&#8230;Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft&#8230;that were all about, &#8220;yes, we&#8217;re going to put our numbers out there and we&#8217;re going to try to bring in more people of color to diversify our workforce.&#8221; I think all of these companies have certainly had great business success. Like Microsoft bought LinkedIn and Github, Facebook doubled their monthly active users. They&#8217;ve had all this business success.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Then when it comes down to diversifying their workforces, the percentages are still single-digit, plus-or-minus rises or falls. You would think that if you put all of that money and resources into this, if after five years you didn&#8217;t get anywhere, you would think that someone probably wouldn&#8217;t have a job. It doesn&#8217;t seem like there&#8217;s any consequence for not diversifying.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I even know in some circles&#8230;I mean, this conversation I think was coming up a lot last year&#8230;where people, mostly white people, were vocally being like, &#8220;I&#8217;m tired of hearing about D&amp;I.&#8221; Like, &#8220;Oh, how convenient.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m tired of hearing about diversity.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s nice.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: The inclusion part is&#8230;I liked that part where you said that diversity is quantifiable, inclusion is not, because it&#8217;s all about once you have those diverse hires in the door and they&#8217;re working for you, how do you keep them? What does that attrition data look like, once you&#8217;ve brought these people on? It seems like it&#8217;s probably falling in a lot of these companies.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: I think too that a lot of these companies&#8230;like imagine being on a product team, where you&#8217;re shipping constantly and things. You&#8217;re working in scrum, you&#8217;re doing these three-week sprints. There are real milestones that you&#8217;re hitting constantly, right, and everything is deadline-driven. Then you have this vague thing called D&amp;I that doesn&#8217;t have a goal, not a clearly-stated goal. It doesn&#8217;t have an established timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: It&#8217;s just this vague thing, that a lot of people&#8230;there&#8217;s so much eye-rolling, of majority-group people and minority-group people. Eye rolling, like, &#8220;Ugh.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, yeah, I went to your website. It looks like you have one black employee, but you made sure that she&#8217;s in every single photo.&#8221; Like a lot of that eye-roll, and I think that&#8230;I mean, I blame the leadership. I blame the lack of direction. I have not been in the boardrooms where it was decided that a lot of these companies were going to focus on diversity and inclusion, and really diversity. To be honest, no one was talking about inclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: I don&#8217;t know exactly what prompted it, but there were these things that were happening, these scandals that kept hitting the news, that were terrifying people. Uber was the first one that I remember being really big. Google I think was next. There&#8217;s that, &#8220;Oh, we have to do something about it,&#8221; but there are all of these stories and things I experienced myself where maybe somebody comes in and gives a slideshow, and says like, &#8220;It&#8217;s really tough to be a woman in the workplace,&#8221; and like&#8230;and then, okay, what do you do? One company I worked at, they just set up a Slack channel called Diversity, but there were no [inaudible 00:17:05] and there were no guidelines. There was no mediator. There was no expert. There was no&#8230;there was nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: There were some horror shows that occurred, and then there was just a lot of like really well-meaning people really hungry for solutions, wanting. I mean, like straight white guys who were like, &#8220;How do I help? How do I advocate? How do I become an ally?&#8221; There was no one there, and no system in place to help guide them. It doesn&#8217;t surprise me at all that there are people eye-rolling. I remember one time standing up front of the company at the Monday morning all-hands check in.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: My colleague and I, who is a wonderful designer, she and I got up and were giving a D&amp;I presentation, and this is pretty early on in my D&amp;I work journey. I just remember one of the engineers who does customer support&#8230;so he&#8217;s a problem solver, he&#8217;s solutions oriented&#8230;says, &#8220;Well, how many black people should we have?&#8221; It was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; you know what I mean? He wanted to know what the goal was.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: I was so at the beginning being like, &#8220;Oh, we need to open the doors,&#8221; but he was asking to what ends. I think that if solutions-based people aren&#8217;t given a goal, then it&#8217;s nothing. It&#8217;s nothing. I mean, it can just sit in the ephemera, just hover in the atmosphere and just never been taken seriously, because there&#8217;s nothing to solve against. You&#8217;re not trying to beat anything, beat a deadline, beat a quota. It&#8217;s just&#8230;it means nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: When you take a lot of these companies where their mission statements would be so vague or fluffy, where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Change the world with positive influence.&#8221; You&#8217;re just a grocery delivery app. How about just [inaudible 00:19:14] groceries to people efficiently? When you already have these vague notions, I think a lot of people just think of it like marketing-speak or think of it as just like it&#8217;s bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. I wonder certainly, I think, as we&#8217;re going now into a lot of companies starting to partner with other organizations, or like I know Google most famously. I think it was back in maybe 2015, 2016, they did like this partnership with Howard where there&#8217;s Howard West out at Google&#8217;s campus, and so some of the freshmen from I think the computer science department were able to go there and learn and study from Google engineers.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I&#8217;m interested to see how some of these programs, what the dividends are from some of them, because a lot of them I feel like have certainly been started in the wake of these horrible numbers that are coming out with workplace percentages of diversity. Then like you say, there&#8217;s also these horror stories of people that have worked there and then it goes south. It&#8217;s in TechCrunch, it&#8217;s in Mashable, it&#8217;s in USA Today. You&#8217;re hearing about it, and I don&#8217;t know really how much of an effect that has on hiring. For some of these companies&#8230;to be honest, I think Facebook probably might be one of them&#8230;they might just brush it off, like, &#8220;Oh, okay. What&#8217;s next?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think the reality is, around here at least, I don&#8217;t think that there are people of color or queer people or queer women of color. I don&#8217;t think that they&#8217;re turning down jobs at Google because they&#8217;ve heard it&#8217;s a toxic culture. I&#8217;m sure that there are some, but the reality as I see it is that there&#8217;s been&#8230;the pipeline argument has just been around forever, and I&#8217;m of the opinion that it&#8217;s been disproven over and over and over again.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: People hire themselves, in one way or another, so frequently. They want to hire from the program they went to in school, because they know those professors. They know what&#8217;s being taught, they know what the challenges are, and they know what the results. Or they&#8217;re hiring from the company that they worked for last. What was the team they were on at their last company? Well, they&#8217;re going to poach whoever they can. They&#8217;re establishing their own pipelines the whole time.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: I think that, to really have a diverse enough space that diversity no longer is even a topic, you have to fundamentally change. You have to break up the pipelines, and so it&#8217;s going to happen on a lot of different fronts and it&#8217;s going to happen at every single level, from the individual contributor all the way up to the CEO. Everybody should be, in one way or another, focused on it, in order for it to work in any sort of timely fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Some of these programs, like working with Howard, yes. I love that about BUILD at Red Hat. They&#8217;re down south, they&#8217;re in North Carolina. They are in HBCU heaven. There&#8217;s so much outreach going on in partnership with the local HBCUs. That is how we change pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: A thing that I was working on at CoreOS&#8230;we were acquired before I was able to realize it&#8230;but our intern program was building, building, building. It was getting bigger and bigger. It was all from the same university, or one of three universities. It was where the CEO and CTO went, together, where the head of one of the engineering teams went himself&#8230;he went to Rochester, they went to Oregon&#8230;or Stanford. That was it. It doesn&#8217;t get more homogenous than that.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: I mean, so we were just getting like 17, 18 of these interns in, and they all were&#8230;they all knew each other. They&#8217;re all the same. We&#8217;re in the Bay Area, where there&#8217;s this crisis where the tech industry is eating up everything, and you have an area that had such great black representation, Latinx representation, Chinese and other East Asian and Asian Pacific Island representation, yet none of these people are working in what&#8217;s becoming the only industry in town.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: When I was a kid, especially immigrant parents, black parents, would be like, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ve got to grow up and be a doctor, or you&#8217;ve got to grow up and be an engineer.&#8221; Now it&#8217;s like you&#8217;ve got to learn to code. It&#8217;s not a generational thing, because most of these people, it&#8217;s not like their parents had been doing this stuff. It&#8217;s like their parents were building websites in the &#8217;60s. The industry the way we know it didn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Here they are, trucking in all of these interns from all of these places. Meanwhile at their feet, literally, like on the ground floor of the building, is a cafe full of people from the neighborhood, from the area, that are working there with absolutely no access.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: That&#8217;s when I was pushing it to try to partner with some of the local colleges, of which there are many, and try to get a pipeline built in. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;All right, for every two Rochester kids you bring in, bring in one from Oakland. Bring in one from Berkeley. Bring in just one, because there&#8217;s no reason to believe that your own path that you&#8217;ve taken, your own experience, is the only legitimate one or the best one.&#8221; It&#8217;s that type of thinking that really limits the opportunities for others.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Will working with Howard make the company better? I don&#8217;t know, but is it a good idea? Absolutely. Absolutely. I support it. These programs shouldn&#8217;t be left to stand on their own. They should be a part of a fully-supported, fully-fronted &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: A part of a fully supported, fully fronted, I guess, war on homogeny. Wow, that sounded really dark.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I feel you&#8217;re coming from though, like you have to be able to utilize those resources if you want to make that change.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Absolutely. Yeah. And it&#8217;s wild to me that like HBCUs aren&#8217;t even being talked about around here or women&#8217;s colleges. It&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s like&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: I just wish there were more black people at Stanford. Well, I mean I wish that too, but there are lots of other colleges to look at. You just&#8230; You got to go out, you got to you got to put in the work of finding people.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I remember doing some consulting with, I think this is with Vox back in like 2015, and I had just made mention like, &#8220;Oh, well have you all done anything at Howard?&#8221; And it was like, you could see people&#8217;s minds explode. Like, &#8220;We never thought of that&#8221;. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Really, it is not that far from y&#8217;all. Like you&#8217;re headquartered in DC. Like it&#8217;s not that far. Go to a career fair. Talk to some people&#8221;. It&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s interesting. Just to kind of switch gears a little bit here because you mentioned the Bay Area. Did you grow up in the Bay Area?</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: No, so I lived in&#8230; I grew up in Boston, in and around Boston, and I moved to the Bay Area 11 years ago. It was a 2008, I moved to the Bay Area.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Okay. So growing up in and around Boston, were you exposed to art and design kind of in your childhood?</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: I was, so I was raised a musician and my brother, who was a couple of years older than me, is a phenomenal illustrator. He was that kid that was a little&#8230; He was shy and so he&#8217;d be in the corner with a pen and a sketchbook at all times and now he&#8217;s really kicking off his career as an illustrator. But he&#8217;s just unbelievable. And so I was always&#8230; He was my older brother and my hero. I was very influenced by what he was doing. And probably I started going to shows where was like 11. Joined my first band when I was 12 and at that time, this is 1991, we were broke. Everyone that I knew that was from the area, we were just poor kids. And so when we were starting our first band, somebody had to make a t-shirt, somebody had to design the tape cover, somebody had to make the flyer and being influenced by my brother and being kind of aesthetic minded, I was oftentimes the person who was doing it and I loved doing it.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: And so I was doing it for myself at 12, 13, 14, and then other bands are asking me to do designs for them. And then record labels and tour managers are having me do posters and t-shirts and record covers for them. And so that kind of kicked off design as a hobby/passion for me for years. But I didn&#8217;t have, by my estimation, I didn&#8217;t have access to college. And so this was a side thing that I did for a long time, for about 20 years, 15 years, something like that. And it went from then bands, labels, tour managers to then small brands, coffee shops, tea brands, things like that, and then I just found that I was getting more and more into it and then&#8230; And just devour whatever books I could read on the topic.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Whenever I met a person who was practicing design, who was also interested design. It just, it really like blossomed for me into, really, obsession. And then I hit the point where I was tired of being a barista/bouncer/bike messenger/a chef and just really wanted to focus on the design. But for me I was a pretty latecomer. It wasn&#8217;t until my mid twenties where I was able to focus on design directly and with the school and was able to refine my craft.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Nice. It&#8217;s interesting how I think a lot of designers tend to get into this through music in some sort of way. I was actually, I interviewed Erica Lewis. We&#8217;re all in the same slack group. So I interviewed Erica Lewis and she&#8217;s a jazz singer and she was talking about how she got into doing design through like being exposed to like posters and album covers and stuff like that. And it got me to thinking actually about this, as we&#8217;re sort of talking about design a little bit here, how websites have all started to kind of look the same. I heard this in a podcast from Adobe, they have this podcast called Wireframe and so one of the latest episodes, they were like, &#8220;Oh, you know, all websites are looking the same,&#8221; with the rectangular hero image and the parallax scrolling and how in the early days of design, like in the, I don&#8217;t know, late nineties, two thousands, et cetera, probably a little earlier than that, a lot of design was very free form because you got on the web and you realize you could make anything.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: A lot of that stuff, at least from when I remember, back in the old days of table based design, you basically made something in Photoshop and you export it in slices and it came in these tables and you uploaded it and that was your website. And you could really kind of go wild with how it looked because you weren&#8217;t&#8230; I guess you weren&#8217;t really designing so strictly within the concept of a grid, even though that&#8217;s what tables are. You were able to kind of be a little bit more free form, but now that everyone is kind of speaking the same design language through, I would say, bootcamps and education and just the way companies are now taking design more seriously. Now everything is starting to kind of look the same. Which is, it&#8217;s an odd concept when you think about it because, I would say, digital graphic design is still a fairly new thing.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, especially compared to poster design, for instance. But I think, I feel like I&#8217;m of the last generation of the LP, where as a kid, I would get a record and put it on, and this 12 and a half by 12 and a half thing, sometimes with a the poster inside. I would just sit there for hours and hours and hours looking at this art and looking for the Easter eggs. And it was okay for there to be hidden elements. It was okay for there to not be immediate comprehension, that you could have&#8230; You could have a period of your brain trying to unlock the message. And I think early days of web were very much about that. I think there was this idea of personal expression, much like jazz poster art, for instance, where you could break rules or bend rules at least.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: And that was really exciting for designers. I think the big difference is, it&#8217;s not necessarily as exciting for the viewer on the web because I think that most of the web, we&#8217;re using very differently than poster art or LP art. And I think that when I talk with newer designers, I think that I spend a lot of time trying to talk about separating the ego from the work because you&#8217;re not designing for yourself and it&#8217;s not necessarily representative of your personality. You&#8217;re aiming for clarity, you&#8217;re aiming for accessibility, you want, you have a client that has a message, a point of communication. And so you want it to be clear. You don&#8217;t want the brain to have that time of trying to decipher the message. You want it to be right up front.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: And so it makes sense to me. Though, I know that for some creative people it&#8217;s a real bummer that the space looks so, I guess kind, of prefab. But from an accessibility point of view, it makes a lot of sense. And I think that that&#8217;s where the web is maturing in so many ways, where it&#8217;s not just&#8230; Early days of web was just backend engineers that knew HTML and putting things up and a lot of it is just, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s just good enough,&#8221; or, &#8220;Oh, you can read this,&#8221; but it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh really? You did like yellow type on a black background? Like okay, like that&#8217;s not necessarily the best answer&#8221;. And so as much as I bemoan, the lack of creativity, I applaud the increase in accessibility and more understanding that there are just so many different types of people that are trying to get the information that meeting them where they&#8217;re at makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Now because of that is why I designed professionally, but then I do my poster art and stuff on the side because when I&#8217;m designing, I&#8217;m not designing for myself, but when I&#8217;m doing my poster art or my own band&#8217;s work, that gets to be completely my ego. That gets to be my complete expression of my own personality and I get to keep the two separated, which I think is important.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Now, when you were deciding to do this professionally, you said you kind of came into it in your mid twenties was your family supportive of you going into this route?</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Yeah, totally. In fact, my stepdad is a graphic designer himself. He runs Anchor Ball Studios and he was a great resource for me too. Yeah, I was [inaudible 00:34:53] my first couple of years I did a lot of freelance work with him and so really helped me learn about that separation, really helped me learn the difference between designing a punk flyer and expressing myself and my subculture and speaking in an insular fashion where I&#8217;m speaking to an existing audience, as opposed to something on a much broader platform where I&#8217;m trying to attract new audience and I&#8217;m trying to attract as many people as possible. So that was huge for me. Huge for me. And then again, my brother is an illustrator. We definitely have blue collar upbringings and my brother actually has only gotten this, starting his career very recently. He&#8217;s a decorative plasterer for 20 something years and now he&#8217;s getting to focus on illustration. So my family, I&#8217;ve been really, really fortunate. It&#8217;s a small family, but a very supportive family.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: What was your early career like? This is pre-Red Hat, pre-CoreOS. What was that early design career like, when you look back at it?</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Hungry, scrappy, desperate. Yeah, I started off freelance. My goal was to eventually get into an agency was my hope. And so I was by Kruger, by Crux, I was just trying to find freelance clients. And so I was fortunate to do a work with Anchor Ball and that was probably 20% of what I was doing. And I was just out there hanging up business cards, shaking hands, meeting people. I remember I played, my band played a show. I played a festival in Oklahoma City where I met a woman who&#8230; We ended up at the airport, going our separate ways and she was like, &#8220;Oh, well I run like demand generation,&#8221; or, &#8220;I work for a demand gen company. We&#8217;re always looking for design&#8221;. And next thing I know, it&#8217;s 20% of my work now is doing design for her.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Like it was anywhere I could find somebody that was willing to pay. And I did that for years. I did that for years and it was hungry work, especially in November, December. A lot of companies, so that they can post fourth quarter gains, one of their tools is they just don&#8217;t pay any money out. And so you can be doing 40 hours of work a week for a company through November and December and they&#8217;ll just stop answering your calls about pay because they&#8217;re going to pay you in January, but they need the work out of you and&#8230; But they&#8217;re not going to pay you. And I had some really lean months and really scary months. Yeah, it was a grind. It was a grind every day.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. I remember when I first started just doing freelance work, I was still in college. I think I started doing freelance for other people and yeah, those early clients were&#8230; It was tough because one, they already, at least for me, they were like, &#8220;We don&#8217;t really take you seriously because you&#8217;re not in design school&#8221;. Like I was in school studying math. No one was looking at me. Even though I had design stuff under my belt, people were like, &#8220;Oh no&#8221;. And I would have, I mean my clients, my early clients were rough man. Me and I had this one client who only wanted to pay me in Sunday dinners because she didn&#8217;t really&#8230; It&#8217;s not that she didn&#8217;t believe in paying, she just preferred to pay in a non-monetary fashion. We&#8217;ll just put it that way. She was like, &#8220;You can come over and I&#8217;ll fix you a plate&#8221;. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not really&#8230; I mean I have a meal plan at the caf. I can just get whatever,&#8221; but&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: And then even when I started my studio years and years later, my first few clients I had would really be trying to stiff you on just the most minuscule amounts, like 200 bucks. Like dude, it&#8217;s $200 worth of work. Now granted I probably shouldn&#8217;t have been doing that little amount of work, but I had just started my studio and I was hungry to just get a few client names under my belt and it was rough.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I ended up landing into working on a political campaign, I&#8217;d say maybe about a year after I started my studio, which really came at the right time because I was looking for jobs after that. Before that I was like, &#8220;This is not working out. Like I thought it was&#8221;. I had quit my job kind of in protest. Obama got elected and I was like, &#8220;Yes we can&#8221;. And I already hated the job that I was working at and I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m just going to do it. I&#8217;m just going to put it out there and try to do it&#8221;. And yeah, those first few months, really that first year was really rough and my mom was sending money and she was like, &#8220;You know,&#8221; you can put your pride to the side and just like get a job. I was like, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m going to do it&#8221;. And I landed in this campaign and it ended up working out from there. But those early scrappy days man, something has to be said for just the time where you will just do any kind of work just to get the money.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Oh yeah. Oh, and it may talk about like removing the ego. There was just so much times where, as designers, we&#8217;re essentially problem solvers, right? So I will use my training and my skillset to come up with a solution. But so often these people, they&#8217;re bringing you a solution and not only are they bringing you a solution, but in their mind they&#8217;ve already solved the problem and they know how much that that solution is worth. And so they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, could you do this thing? I already have an idea of what it should look like and I already have an idea of how much it should cost and how much&#8230; And because it only took me five minutes to come up with it. I think I should only give you $10,&#8221; and there was just&#8230; I was just eating so much crow being like, &#8220;No, that&#8217;s not the way to do it. That isn&#8217;t&#8230; I can show you research, I can show you best practices, I can show you examples and show&#8230;&#8221;. They don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah, clients, they&#8217;re not looking at that. They don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: No, and especially, I think that&#8230; I mean there&#8217;s a ton of devaluing of design. It&#8217;s something that comes up all the time that, as designers, we&#8217;ve talked about all the time, but it&#8217;s this idea that people think that it&#8217;s just a gut shot. It&#8217;s just all intuition and it doesn&#8217;t occur to them that there is research behind it, that there is method and best practices. And so there&#8217;s a lot of notion of like, &#8220;Oh well, my nephew or niece, they are good with colors&#8221;. That&#8217;s what that means, you know what I mean? Or their outfits always match or something like that.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: And so there&#8217;s a lot of that tug of war before&#8230; As a designer you have like a realized sense of self, a realized sense of realistic worth, worth of work, not worth of person. We&#8217;re all worthless, like are&#8230; Not worthless, priceless. We&#8217;re all priceless. But a lot of that tug of war where you don&#8217;t want us to know. Most of the clients that I did work for, I wouldn&#8217;t do work for now. Clearly the way you look at design and the way you look at solutions and what you want out of the designer is actually not what I provide. So, best of luck. I wish the best for you, but we&#8217;re just not made to work together. But back then it&#8217;s like, &#8220;All right. Yeah, no cool. Only $10?&#8221; Or, &#8220;Only a Sunday dinner?&#8221; Like, I&#8217;m not hype on it, but I got to eat.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. I remember I heard from a designer one time at a conference that I think it was something along the lines of what you were saying about kind of the speed it might take to do something. If you do a job and say, I don&#8217;t know. If you can look at a job and say, &#8220;I can do that in an hour,&#8221; but the reason you can do it in an hour is because you spent five years learning how to do it in an hour. So you&#8217;re really paying for the years. You&#8217;re not paying for the hour.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Right, right. I mean isn&#8217;t it-</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: And company. Yeah. No, I&#8217;m saying companies look at&#8230; Companies, I think clients too, they just look at the hours as if like that&#8217;s the discrete amount. Like &#8220;Oh that&#8217;s what the cost is? Well how many hours is that?&#8221; And it doesn&#8217;t break down that discretely that you can just take the cost and chop it up in that way. Because it then commoditizes design to the point where you think, I guess anyone can do it and it&#8217;s not really the case.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Right, absolutely. I mean&#8230; What is the&#8230; Is that an old story? I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s even true or not, but about Picasso later in life. Having like a&#8230; A woman asked Picasso to draw something and he-</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah, I heard that.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Just something very simple and she&#8217;s like, &#8220;It only took you five minutes,&#8221; and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;My dear. It took me my whole life&#8221;. I think that there is real value to that. I mean someone like Aaron Draplin for instance, when he does a tutorial on how to do a logo in five minutes. I feel like what he&#8217;s trying to show is that anybody can learn to design and I 100% believe that. I don&#8217;t think that it takes inborn talent. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s inherent, I think that anybody can learn the craft of successful design. 100%. I think though that there are some spectators who see Aaron doing that, that think, &#8220;Oh, well I could do that,&#8221; in a dismissive way. The whole, &#8220;Like if my kid could draw this, then it&#8217;s not art,&#8221; that bullshit line.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: And so not to get in the weeds about this, but I think that people are&#8230; Because it is an hourly charged thing so frequently, there&#8217;s a lot of people with a dubious attitude that are like trying, without knowing what actually goes into it, they&#8217;re trying to figure out how you, as the designer, as the hired person, are trying to pull one over on them and they [inaudible 00:44:43] mistrust. And that&#8217;s why like I think it is important to, when you&#8217;re specking out a project, to put as much information as possible. Like &#8220;Oh, like first thing I&#8217;m going to do is like this many hours of research, but here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll be researching. Here&#8217;s what about looking at here&#8217;s how much time I spent putting together this brief and this outline&#8221;. Because it&#8217;s tough that so often as a designer, especially earlier on in your career, you have to be constantly defending the value of design. Constantly. But that&#8217;s part of design. Part being able to speak to your design, being able to build the value into it and express the value. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s a part of the part of the games.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. Part of the game. I feel you. Now, aside from your design work, you also do some facilitation work with Frame Shift Consulting. I learned about that because at Glitch we had Valerie Aurora, she gave an ally skills training to us earlier this year and I was looking at the website. I was like, &#8220;Wait a minute, I know him&#8221;. How did you get started with them?</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: So when I was at CoreOS, the CTO, Brandon, of CoreOS, is a great guy and he had been&#8230; When he was going to Oregon, he was a Linux developer and he met Valerie as one of his Linux mentors. She was a developer for the Linux kernel, which for developers, is a very impressive thing. And so at the same time she was doing the ADA Initiative. She was part of the Geek feminism. She was doing a lot. She was already doing advocacy work within her direct tech communities. Really for women, fem-identified and queer people. And over time she stopped developing computer software and really focused her attention, a hundred percent, into Frame Shift Consulting and into this facilitation work. And so Brandon had her come and teach her ally skills class to our small company. And I got so much out of that workshop as an ally and as a member of a targeted group.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: It was really clear, it was really concise. And watching the discovery process, I&#8217;m in a room of, maybe, 30 people, nearly every single one, nearly every single one, CIS straight white man, but it&#8217;s a volunteer only program. So it&#8217;s people who wanted actual skills to be better at advocating for people around them. This is the inclusion part. Here&#8217;s the difference between diversity and inclusion. Inclusion is how we work to make ourselves and each other feel comfortable, invited and welcome. And so it was great seeing them actually learn these tools, and myself as well, learn these tools. And I learned things about my own privilege and privileges that I didn&#8217;t know before.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: And so after that workshop was through, she then came back and did a code of conduct development and enforcement workshop with us and I was doing a lot of event work at the time. And so I got to work with her again. And then she had announced that she was doing a train the trainers and CoreOS paid for me to go and get trained. And since then, Valerie and I have developed a friendship and a real great kind of idea sharing around this stuff. And so it wasn&#8217;t long before, it just made sense that I love the work so much and it&#8217;s so important to me, that I just come on board with Frame Shift and start facilitating the workshop on my own, which has been a really great experience. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Nice. And now also, I mean aside from your design work, you&#8217;re doing consultation, you are also helping out with the design community sort of in the Bay Area. Is that right? You&#8217;re, co-leading or co-chair of a group called Bay Area Black Designers, which is founded by Kat Vellos, who we&#8217;ve had on the show before. How have you started to see the Bay Area kind of change in terms of the design community since you&#8217;ve been there?</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: It&#8217;s changed quite a bit. One of the things that&#8217;s interesting about the Bay Area, I think, I don&#8217;t remember, maybe it was Mike Montero that heard point out that in places like New York, design is its own community and its own industry. Whereas in the Bay Area, design is very much a niche of the tech industry and the tech community. So whatever we do is kind of predicated on tech and that solid innovation, which really, I mean it changes a lot. So right now design, is huge in the Bay Area. I would say it&#8217;s primarily UX design. They get paid the most and there are award-winning UX design teams at most of these major tech companies. I&#8217;m seeing&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: &#8230; these major tech companies. I&#8217;m seeing that design is being more readily accepted as a worthwhile thing. But again, UX has a lot of quantifiable aspects to it, right? Resourcing gets so much hard data back, whereas graphic design is much more nuanced. So, the difference between a graphic designer and a UX designer in this town is probably about $80,000 annually.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Yeah, it&#8217;s pretty dramatic. It&#8217;s one of the reasons why I don&#8217;t attach the word graphic to my design title. So when I discovered the Bay Area Black Designers, which Kat had started at about two years before I did, I was working at a tech company. I was one of the only, if not the only black person there. I was the only black designer I knew. I did not know a single other black designer.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: This was around the time of, I want to say it was pre-Ferguson, but it was the month, the year leading up to between Oscar Grant and Michael Brown, Oakland was on the march. We were marching all the time. We were out in the streets, we were being teargassed by police, chased down. This was my reality after work and the horrors I was facing. Then I was going into work with these 25 year old guys that just &#8230; it was just across the Bay in San Francisco, but it was a world apart.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: It was incredibly isolating, incredibly isolating. I remember one day I was just really, really frustrated and I Googled black designers Bay area. Well, thank goodness Kat Vellos has her SEO game on point, because it popped right up. A week later or two weeks later, I was at my first meetup and was able to meet all these amazing black designers. What I noticed right away was none of us were from the Bay Area.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: It&#8217;s grown from there. I mean, there&#8217;s now, on paper, there&#8217;s around 400 members of Bay Area Black Designers, and that coupled with the employee resource groups, a lot of the ERGs, Autodesk for instance, has a great black ERG. Salesforce&#8217;s ERGs are unbelievable. They&#8217;re so well-funded, well-supported. You have people like Rachel Williams who is just an amazing DNI leader.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: They get us all together in these rooms. I mean, gosh, we got to be in a room with Issa Rae and Ryan Coogler two weeks ago, thanks to Salesforce. It&#8217;s all of these black professionals in tech, almost none of us are from the Bay area, which tells me that we&#8217;re still not supporting the area. That&#8217;s really important to me, because a lot of the older folks my age and older in BABD started as print designers and pure graphic design, typography, things like that, and haven&#8217;t had the opportunity or the means to shift into digital design and are being left behind, which is a real tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: So, I mean, even like Mike Nicholls who does Umber Magazine, which is a blessing to our community.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Shout out to Mike.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Shout out to Mike, all day. That itself is a tool for him to stay relevant, and it&#8217;s a tool for him to stay visible. Because otherwise as an analog illustrator and a typesetter, there&#8217;s just not space for him. So I am seeing more black faces in the crowd, but I&#8217;m not seeing more open faces. I&#8217;m not seeing more San Francisco, Richmond, Vallejo, the Bay Area isn&#8217;t being represented. That&#8217;s terrifying to me, because we&#8217;re seeing an eradication and a replacement of entire communities, at a scale which I&#8217;ve never seen before.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: So, I would say that&#8217;s how I&#8217;m seeing design change. But also, design is so popular and there&#8217;s a lot of self-aggrandizing, self-back-patting that I see happening. I was a member of the San Francisco AIGA and they did a mentorship program about two years ago. I remember I signed on to be a mentee, because I&#8217;m not done developing my career, I&#8217;m not done developing in my skillset.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: I remember one of the mentor, mentee mixers, talking with a guy who was probably, I would guess 23 or 24, very cocky, very self-assured. He was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m here as a mentor, I&#8217;m a mentor.&#8221; I&#8217;m not going to begrudge anyone. I mean, there are brilliant, very, very young people everywhere, so it&#8217;s not unreasonable to think that this guy could be a mentor.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: But the way he was talking was just so cocky and self-assured. Then the more and more he talked, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh yeah, I&#8217;m a creative director.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Gosh, wow, you&#8217;re a creative director at your age, that&#8217;s really impressive.&#8221; But then it turns out it&#8217;s because his brother is the founder and CEO of the startup. There&#8217;s only six people at the startup and this person is pole vaulting over a whole career path. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, well, where&#8217;s your mentee?&#8221; &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t know where she is.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: She is just out of college, she&#8217;s 22. She&#8217;s looking for real development, real assistance, real anything, and this dude is not &#8230; I realized that he was much more into this idea, this persona of the designer, of the creative director. In doing so, in my opinion, was doing this really great disservice to this woman of color who&#8217;s just finished school, is a member of AIGA and is looking for development.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: That, I think, for me it was a very San Francisco moment, where there are great swaths of people &#8230; of course, there&#8217;s incredible talent in this area, and I don&#8217;t want to take away from that. But there are also a lot of people who think of designer as more of a lifestyle and are just getting in these rooms where they&#8217;re just patting each other on the back and it&#8217;s being like, &#8220;We&#8217;re the best, we&#8217;re the best, we&#8217;re the best.&#8221; That&#8217;s disheartening.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah, I see that a lot on Twitter, which is why I really am not on design Twitter a whole lot, because I see so much of that. Designer as a lifestyle sort of thing, where they&#8217;re not really giving back to the community in any sort of way, they&#8217;re just providing unnecessary snarky kind of &#8230; I see that a lot. I see a lot of that.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Yeah, look at when any company rebrands. Suddenly everybody is an expert in design and it&#8217;s just finding new snarky ways to really devalue something that took years, right? Your hot take doesn&#8217;t matter, there&#8217;s a whole team. You don&#8217;t know what they were solving for, you don&#8217;t know why they changed it. There&#8217;s a lot of that that goes on. Then also, there&#8217;s, like you said, giving back to the community.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: I remember I think about five years ago, there was a group of tech people who had moved to Oakland and they were like &#8230; this, I would say, the era of app building as a career. They were like, &#8220;We got to get together with the community of Oakland. We&#8217;re the new people, we&#8217;re the newcomers, we have to give back.&#8221; So we&#8217;re going to start meeting at city hall and we&#8217;re going to develop things for the community.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: At that time, Oakland was very black, very brown and very white, but also very working class, very poor. There were a lot of struggling communities at that time that could have used a lot of help from people with means, with access, with money. What this group did was they developed an app to make it easier to call the police. Black folks don&#8217;t need that. Black folks, the Projects don&#8217;t need that, the Arab communities down in the Acorn and lower bottom, it couldn&#8217;t be further from what they need.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: What these people did is they walked in and said, &#8220;Well, what do I see missing compared to what I&#8217;m used to? Oh, there&#8217;s crime? Let&#8217;s not try to chip away at the [inaudible 00:58:42] reasons why there may be crime, let&#8217;s just bring in the cops.&#8221; That for me, that&#8217;s a problem, that&#8217;s an inherent misunderstanding of really what&#8217;s at stake and what&#8217;s going on. It goes to show that your hot take, your designer persona and whatever, none of it matters if you&#8217;re not solving real problems, if you&#8217;re not doing the research to find out what needs to be done or listening, asking.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: These hot takes on Twitter or in other designer spaces, it just really tells me that you&#8217;re just responding to your own ego. You&#8217;re just responding to your own desires, your own way of life. To me, that&#8217;s the antithesis of design. For me as a designer, my two greatest tools are empathy and compassion, that&#8217;s it. Without those two things, I cannot be effective at my job, because I&#8217;m never the demographic, I&#8217;m never the person that I&#8217;m designing for, it&#8217;s always for somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: If I&#8217;m not spending the time to learn what their challenges are and what their needs are, it&#8217;s moot, it&#8217;s ineffective. So on Twitter, yeah, okay, go ahead, talk all the shit that you want to talk, but who are you actually helping? Who are you serving? Because if it&#8217;s just been like, &#8220;Oh, the new Instagram logo is crap,&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t care less. It&#8217;s not an opinion with any foundation and it&#8217;s not useful, it&#8217;s not useful critique.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. So speaking of empathy and compassion, you&#8217;re also the lead singer for a hardcore metal band.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Right, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I&#8217;d would be remissed if I didn&#8217;t mention your music [inaudible 00:10:32]. Talk to me about Mass Arrest.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Okay. Mass Arrest is my black liberation hardcore band. It&#8217;s a political punk band with a very singular message, which is really promoting the ideas of black liberation, representation and survival. Punk in general, hard core punk in particular, which is the faster, harder and more political wing of punk that started in the early 80&#8217;s, it is very often very, very, very white. I have been involved in it since I was 12 years old and I&#8217;ve been touring and playing in bands since then.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Oftentimes, I was hearing a lot of political rhetoric that was very vague. There&#8217;s a lot of say anti-police sentiment, but it&#8217;s, &#8220;Fuck the police, because they won&#8217;t let us break the law. They won&#8217;t let us like drink on the streets,&#8221; or whatever things like that. I was like, &#8220;But there&#8217;s these people over here that are actually being killed, that are being murdered, that are being incarcerated, that are being unjustly persecuted. I mean, if we&#8217;re going to talk about the police, can we talk about that rather than talking about them not letting us drink 40s on the sidewalk?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: So a lot of what I learned about community building, a lot of what I learned about do-it-yourself culture, a lot of what I learned about self-advocacy, I learned through punk. I mean, I never would have been able to travel to Europe when I was 19, had it not be touring with a band. I never would have had friends and connections all over the world, were it not for punk. I mean, really important skills came out of it. But what I was finding was what I was learning from punk wasn&#8217;t being reflected within punk, and I was still feeling very left out and underrepresented.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: So there are a few kind of single topic bands, shout out to G.L.O.S.S. from Olympia, who was a trans hardcore band. The singer Sadie, she just made sure that everyone knew that this band, you&#8217;re welcome to come to the show, you&#8217;re welcome to party, but these songs are specifically for and about trans folks. I was just really inspired by what they were able to do with their band.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: So, friends of mine were starting a band, who were white, friends of mine who were white, were starting a band. Asked if I could sing for it, and I was like, &#8220;Okay, but it&#8217;s going to be a black power band.&#8221; They were like, &#8220;Yeah, we know you. It&#8217;s fine. We understand that that&#8217;s what this is going to be about.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: So, I just hit a point where I realized I had a platform, where for years and years and years I was being invited into rooms to sing to people, to talk about things, and I was talking about a lot of issues that weren&#8217;t specific to my own experience. So with this band, I made a really conscious decision to make sure that when we play, what, we were in Oklahoma city a couple weeks ago, we played in Toronto, Canada, Olympia, Washington.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Oftentimes, I&#8217;m in these majority white spaces and so it&#8217;s an opportunity for me to advocate for our people to people who are interested in doing work for improvement and liberation for all people, but they just don&#8217;t have access or knowledge of, they have point of access, but they don&#8217;t have knowledge of the specific challenges that we&#8217;re facing. So, it&#8217;s just more of that work.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Now between your design work and the facilitation work and the community work and the music, what do you think helps fuel all these ambitions that you have? Where does that drive come from?</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: I mean, you&#8217;re probably one of the busiest people I&#8217;ve ever known, but I bet you don&#8217;t even think of yourself as being that busy, except in frustrating moments. For me, I feel driven, I think because of the punk, I think because of growing up poor, having to create a lot of the things that I wanted. If I wanted something, I had to make it or I had to find someone who could make it or work with someone. So that, I think, has driven me to want to create. But I also realized that I&#8217;ve had a lot of help through my career and through my life, and that I wouldn&#8217;t be anywhere. I probably wouldn&#8217;t be around, were it not for that. I want to give back, I want to lift people up.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: I mean, that moment where I felt so isolated to be the only black designer I knew, I don&#8217;t want anyone to feel like that. So thankfully for me, Kat Vellos had already put the work into creating the community, the least I can do is uphold and promote that community. Because honestly, I feel like if I&#8217;m not putting this time and this work into these things, then I won&#8217;t get to have them in my life, right?</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: It can be tough to be the only person of any targeted group, any marginalized group in a majority room, right? Well, if I can do some work to help that room understand what this person is going through or how to advocate for this person, that means that eventually, ideally, I&#8217;ll be in a room full of people that may not look like me, but can understand some of the challenges and concerns that I have, and can approach me with empathy and compassion and make my time easier.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: So I guess in that sense, it&#8217;s self-serving, but also, it&#8217;s appreciation as well. They say be the change that you want to see, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;That&#8217;s so real.&#8221; Even in the most granular level, that is absolutely so real. I think that we all have influence, small or large. It was a big &#8220;Aha&#8221; moment for me when I realized that, and Mass Arrest is part of this, where I realized that I had influence, I had a platform, but I wasn&#8217;t taking ownership of it. So all of this stuff is me taking ownership of whatever influence I have and whatever platform I have, to make sure that I&#8217;m using it in a thoughtful way, that, ideally, it would benefit my life and the lives of people I touch.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah, is there a dream project or anything that you&#8217;d really love to do one day? Because I agree with you, in the sense that &#8230; I feel the same way. You have to create the experiences or create the space for yourself, especially in this society that is continually trying to marginalize and push out and press out black people in general. I mean, people of color in general, but specifically black people. It can be hard to kind of see where we in the future, let alone in the present. So, I get the sense of having to make that space.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I mean, we&#8217;re really fortunate that technology has kind of democratized creation in a way that allows us to do that. I mean, there&#8217;s so many things I can do now, that even just 10 years ago would&#8217;ve really been, I wouldn&#8217;t say impossible, but it would&#8217;ve been a lot harder. But technology has allowed me to kind of take different pieces from here and there and make the spaces that I need for whatever it is that I&#8217;m trying to do or trying to accomplish or trying to just put out there in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Yeah. So what&#8217;s the question?</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Oh, sorry. I said it, then I went on another tangent. No. Do you have a dream project that you&#8217;d love to do one day?</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: I have so many. I mean, really, I&#8217;m a collaborator more than I am a creator, I really love working with people. So I think of the people that I want to work with, and there are so many people right now that I really look up to. I mean, whether it be Essa Rae or whether it be Walter Hood, brilliant Berkeley architect and designer. The opportunity to collaborate with people is something that really excites me and that I&#8217;d like to do more of and let the project be just the product of that.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: I think that right now we&#8217;re seeing a black Renaissance in pop culture removed from hip hop. Kind of like 90s black TV, I think we&#8217;re seeing some of that in Hollywood. So I would love the opportunity to work with some of these people that are making the things that are enriching my life. I mean, I know that &#8230; shout out to [inaudible 01:09:48]. He&#8217;s a designer, young dude, young brother from West Oakland. He&#8217;s 22 years old, he has a brand called [inaudible 01:09:56] Future.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Every time he puts something out, I buy it right away. He&#8217;s hell of young and endlessly creative, endlessly talented. If he called me up tomorrow and whatever the project, he was like, &#8220;Hey, would you work with me on this?&#8221; Like, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; That&#8217;s what I want to do, because I need to be inspired and I want to be a part of interesting things with interesting people.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Now we&#8217;re coming up on the end of the year. We&#8217;re coming up on the end of the decade, really. When you look in the future, let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s 2025, which already seems like a long way away, but what do you see yourself working on? Where would you like to be in the future?</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Well, I mean, I like where I am, I really love the team that I&#8217;m on. Getting to work on some of the most interesting and cool projects that I&#8217;ve gotten to work on professionally. So, I really hope to continue to develop my career within that space learning new tools. This is the year where I &#8230; motion graphics, really, I&#8217;m all about it. I want to learn animation, I want to learn After Effects, I want to learn 3D rendering. [inaudible 01:11:16] has been doing really interesting work around that.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Then, I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t see myself in the Bay Area. It&#8217;s untenable, it&#8217;s getting too expensive. There&#8217;s just too much greed from the property owners taking too much money that they don&#8217;t deserve. I don&#8217;t know where I will be. I see myself ideally doing more advocacy work, maybe a book, and still designing and hopefully making cool stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: All right, sounds good. Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, I know we&#8217;ve been going for a while now, but where can people find out more about you, about your work, about your music? Where can they find all of that online?</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: The best place to find all of it would be my Instagram, which is resistance.is.brutal. Then on Twitter, I&#8217;m kchowse. H-O-W-S-E.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: All right, sounds good. Well, Kendall Howse, Boo Boo, man, it has been so good to talk with you.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Always a pleasure, Maurice.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I mean, I think just one, hearing your story about the work that you&#8217;re doing right now through Red Hat, and I can really feel the passion with your advocacy work through facilitation and things like that. But also, just this whole notion of making sure that we&#8217;re using our creative talents for good things, to put good things out there in the world. That&#8217;s something that I really walked away from this year&#8217;s kind of Black in Design Conference, really kind of feeling in my core, our creativity is going to be what saves us. Us as a people, us in the future, that&#8217;s how we&#8217;re going to survive.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I really think that with the work that you&#8217;re doing and the spaces that you&#8217;re helping to cultivate and create and everything, that we&#8217;ll make it happen. You&#8217;re out there, through your music, giving a voice to people, you&#8217;re helping community through the Bay Area Black Designers. You&#8217;re, of course, working at Red Hat doing all this great stuff. So I&#8217;m going to really be interested to see what you&#8217;re doing in the next five years. But yeah, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>Kendall Howse</strong>: Thanks for having me, brother. I always enjoy spending time with you. I&#8217;m a big fan of the show, and so this is a great honor. Thank you.</p>

<p>Kevin White calls himself a &#8220;UX strategist&#8221;, but that title barely scratches the surface of what he does. Aside from his work as a senior experience designer, he&#8217;s also a talented illustrator, a design educator, and a devoted family man. But according to Kevin, his origin story as a design professional is an example of what <em>not</em> to do. (Naturally, I had to know more about this.)</p>
<p>We started off talking about the ubiquity of UX in today&#8217;s modern design industry, and from there Kevin goes into the early days of his career, and we take a slight detour to discuss social media, sound design, branding, and even the historical archives of the Internet! We touched on a lot of topics in our conversation, but I think what stands out the most is that there is no one true path to becoming a designer. Learn more about Kevin in this week&#8217;s interview!</p>

<p>When I first had the idea to do a month dedicated to Atlanta&#8217;s art scene, Sean Fahie&#8217;s name immediately came to mind. Sean really does it all &#8212; he&#8217;s a designer, an artist, an illustrator, an author, a film maker, a podcaster, and more. I knew that this conversation was really going to be a good one, and Sean did not disappoint.</p>
<p>Sean started off talking about the release of his third book, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2NjAByY" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Chocolate Covered Honey Buns</a></em>, and he spoke about what it&#8217;s like for him as a working artist. Sean also talked about what drew him to Atlanta, how the city has changed over the years, and we take some questions from the Revision Path audience as well! He even shared some of the Atlanta artists we should all look out for, and talked about his upcoming book tour (coming to a city near you). Thank you Sean for representing Atlanta and for sharing your talents with the world!</p>
