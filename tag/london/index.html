Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>We&#8217;re back across the pond this week and having a good ol&#8217; chat and a spot of tea with one of London&#8217;s most brilliant artists &#8212; Azarra Amoy. It was a good time to catch up with her since she just got a new studio!</p>
<p>Azarra spoke on how art is like her diary, and she walked me through some of her inspirations and talked about growing up in London and even spending time in Bangkok before transitioning into her current artistic career. Azarra&#8217;s colorful, kinetic designs are a welcome sight during these times, and may also inspire you on your creative journey!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
My name is Azarra Amoy, and I am a multifaceted RS and designer, creative thinker and a student of this crazy world we call life. Or shall I say, yeah I work as an artist, and I&#8217;m also a part-time designer. So I work with presentations for a creative agency called Empire. So I do that three to four times a week. And then the rest of the days is all for art.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. What is the feeling in London like right now?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Quiet because we&#8217;re back in lockdown. So we&#8217;ve been in lockdown just before Christmas, which was a bit mental because it was literally a last minute thing. They were like, yeah, you can spend Christmas with your family. And then literally three days before they&#8217;re like, no, everyone&#8217;s on lockdown. Basically all the presents you bought, send them back.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh no.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
You aren&#8217;t seeing your family. So I don&#8217;t know how many people actually stuck to that. But right now, I feel like a lot of people are fed up because this is our third lockdown. And it&#8217;s just like in and out, in and out. But I&#8217;ve just been trying to keep myself busy personally. And check up on friends, family, and try and find some normality in this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How have you been doing just kind of overall this year so far?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So far this year it was quiet. I literally took time out for myself. I was like, before everything gets a bit crazy or if it does get a bit crazy, I just want time for myself because the end of 2020 was a bit nonstop crazy for me work-wise. So it&#8217;s just been nice just to just chill, let me think. Write down some goals that I want to achieve personally and professionally. And just take time, eat right, detox from all the drink and food that I ate over Christmas period and just yeah, just reboot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you I guess &#8230; Can you talk about just some of those goals you might have for this year?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So one of the goals was to sort out my studio. So I moved out of my last studio just before Christmas, and I needed to find &#8230; It was a bit last minute.com. And I&#8217;ve been trying to find places, but it&#8217;s really hard because we&#8217;re on lockdown. So it&#8217;s through video calls and just trying to work out through pictures if it looks okay. But luckily yesterday I got the keys to a new studio. So I&#8217;m really excited to get in there and just fix it up and make it my second home.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh nice.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s a bit hard sometimes working from home, separating from work and personal time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, congratulations on the new studio.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Thank you. I&#8217;m really excited.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s one thing that I&#8217;ve been thinking about over this whole pandemic quarantine thing, is I got to get my own space. I like my apartment where I&#8217;m at. And I&#8217;ve worked out of my apartment for a long time. I&#8217;ve been doing the working remote thing since 2009. So I&#8217;m not unfamiliar with it, but the difference is that I had the option to leave the house.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I could go and work from a coffee shop or work at a client location or travel or something like that. And granted, right now our restrictions aren&#8217;t super strict at all. I&#8217;m in Georgia, which honestly has been open since last May. There&#8217;s been &#8230; We had three weeks of lockdown in April. And then we&#8217;ve kind of been open. To that effect, our rates are super high because people have been traveling and just coming and going as you please. But as I&#8217;ve been working, I was out of work and then got a new job. And I&#8217;ve just been thinking, I really want my own space. Granted, my apartment&#8217;s nice, but I really want to have that separate workspace that&#8217;s just for creativity.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. It does make a difference. I miss having my studio space. I was like, I just need to get something.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
But luckily I found a place that&#8217;s really nice. It has a balcony and all sorts, so I&#8217;m just really happy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh nice. So what do your days look like now with lockdown and the new studio space and everything?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So I usually have a routine, I get up early, do a little meditation, work out. So I&#8217;m addicted to spin at the moment. And I login to work at 9:30, so I work three to four days a week depending on how busy they are. And yeah, I login and I usually have schedules set out for me already. So I just crack on with the work. And my team is really small, they&#8217;re really lovely. We all have game nights and stuff, and just try and make it as normal as possible. And yeah, I do that until 6:30, and then I usually eat and then spend time on personal projects, whether if that&#8217;s just me just trying to do a sketch or a digital collage, those are sort of my go-to things that I do.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
And I do them without even noticing that I do them, if that makes sense. Some people chill and watch Netflix and stuff. But for me, doing a little sketch, a little doodle on something is my chill time. And not everything that I create, I show. So basically I always say that my art is like my diary. It&#8217;s like what I feel in the day, or something that&#8217;s on my mind because I&#8217;m not really &#8230; I feel like I&#8217;m not a great communicator with words, but I communicate well when I draw. So that&#8217;s my output.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I got you. What are some of the projects that you&#8217;re working on right now?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Art-wise or work-wise as a designer?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;ll say art-wise. We&#8217;ll say art-wise.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So art-wise, I&#8217;m working with a publishing company. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m allowed to mention them yet, but looking to do some illustrations for a children&#8217;s book. So I had just recently done a mock-up of stuff. So I&#8217;m just waiting on feedback if they&#8217;re liking the direction that it&#8217;s going. I&#8217;m trying to do some personal paintings because fingers crossed with COVID, I will be able to have a solo exhibition, which has been on my list for forever. And last year was meant to be the year, but obviously with what happened, it was a no-go. So I&#8217;m hoping come October, that will happen. So I&#8217;m just slowly putting their stuff into motion.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m going to be on a panel for a studio space that&#8217;s in Brixton, London. And I&#8217;ll be on the panel for their residency. So I&#8217;ll be helping select who gets a year&#8217;s residency with them. So I&#8217;ve been working with that team just discussing a few things. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing art-wise.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, you&#8217;ve got your hands full with a lot.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah. I try to keep as busy as possible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you usually have sort of a limit of the number of projects that you try to take on?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
I listen to what my body tells me, if that makes sense. So if I feel like I&#8217;m really run down, then I have no problem just saying no to whatever project comes. It&#8217;s like, no, sorry, you need some you time just to just relax. So I just go off on how I feel, and that&#8217;s how I take on the work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So these are &#8230; Just the projects you mentioned between a book cover, personal paintings, doing this panel, talk to me about how you approach a new project. It can be any type of project. What&#8217;s sort of your thought process when it comes to that?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
I guess with a lot of projects that do come my way, they usually come to me because they know my style of artwork. So for example, I feature a lot of black &#8230; All the women I feature in my artwork are black women. Me myself, I&#8217;m a black woman. So yeah, I think it just comes from &#8230; I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to be able to navigate where the direction of the artwork goes because they know my style. So they know that&#8217;s the sort of direction, and what I&#8217;m trying to portray and uplift black women in the artwork that I do. So that sort of is usually the base. And then from there, I just then add on what the client wants, if that makes sense. And yeah, and then from there I usually do a mock-up. And then they give feedback.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve always really done it. So and usually I research into certain stuff. So right now, I&#8217;m really interested in the black Madonna, which is religious, the black Virgin Mary.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s put it that way. And I&#8217;ve been looking to the history of that, which is really interesting because these countries that are really popular with the black Madonna are not exactly the most black-friendly places. So it&#8217;s really interesting how they worship this idol of this black Virgin Mary. But in day-to-day sort of experiences, they&#8217;re not like that with people of color in real life. It&#8217;s just a weird, she&#8217;s allowed to be worshiped, but if you put a black woman in front of them, they&#8217;ll do anything to put them down, if that makes sense?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
I just go off of what surrounds me, what comes to mind, stuff that I see [inaudible 00:12:42], things that I see in movies, magazines, blogs that just trigger something, and I&#8217;ll just start researching.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;ve actually got a church here in my neighborhood here in Atlanta called Shrine of the Black Madonna. It&#8217;s a church, it&#8217;s a cultural center. They do events and stuff there. So I&#8217;m familiar with the concept that you&#8217;re talking about. Do you usually try to have some religious iconography in your work, or is this just a particular &#8230; Or is it a particular figure I guess you&#8217;re kind of obsessed with right now?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s just a particular figure that I&#8217;m obsessed with right now. So yeah, not all work features, but it just &#8230; I don&#8217;t think I have any religious features, no, in my work. So this is just something new that I&#8217;ve come across that I find really interesting, and we&#8217;ll see where it&#8217;ll take me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Is there anyone out there that you would love to collaborate with?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Oh. I guess right now it would be interesting to &#8230; I have no one in mind, but there are a lot of people that I have collaborated with have been London-based. So it would be nice to collaborate with people from different countries to gain their experience, to understand their experience and how it&#8217;s similar and how we can collab. Does that make sense?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
But I can&#8217;t think of no one from the top of my head right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
From looking at your style, your style actually reminds me a lot of another mixed media artist that I had on the show. God when was that? That might&#8217;ve been about two or three years ago. This guy in &#8230; He&#8217;s in New York. His name is Kendrick Daye, D-A-Y-E.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He does kind of this similar collage mixed media kind of work. So your art reminds me a lot of what he&#8217;s doing. You all have very sort of similar styles in terms of I think the color and the elements. I think your work at least from the work that I&#8217;ve seen, there&#8217;s a lot of play on symmetry.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
With portraiture and things. You try to have a lot of symmetry, which I think is really nice.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah. I like the whole kaleidoscope kind of effect in my work. So there&#8217;s always some sort of symmetry as much as possible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the hardest part about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Knowing when to stop. As an art issue, always something try to over-perfect. And I speak to my cousin every day, and there&#8217;s this painting that I&#8217;ve literally been working on for about two and a half years. And I just don&#8217;t know when to stop. I&#8217;m like, no, it&#8217;s not right. It&#8217;s not right. And he&#8217;s just like, it&#8217;s never going to be right. Just show the world. The art is amazing. I&#8217;m just like, no, it&#8217;s not ready. And just know when to say, okay, that&#8217;s enough. It&#8217;s never going to be right sort of thing. And you can always add &#8230; The beautiful thing about art, you can always add to it. Just because you start and you show the world, doesn&#8217;t mean that, that&#8217;s the end of it. You can add on to it. You can take away. You can make it into something completely different.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true. That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So kind of switching gears here a little bit, were you born and raised in London?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yes I was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, tell me about that. Did you kind of get exposed to a lot of art and design growing up?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Most definitely. My parents are both creatives in their own way. So my dad paints. And well, he enjoys painting. He&#8217;s a painter and decorator by trade. And my mom just dabbled in everything I guess. I guess that&#8217;s where I get a lot of my creative talent from. So she was a hairdresser. She was that crazy mom who had the bright hair, then green hair, and then orange hair. Every time she turned up to pick me up from school, her hair was always different colors. So she was the crazy, cool art mom. And she&#8217;d done fashion, yeah just around the house little DIY projects. Whenever she was sewing, she always used to set me little tasks to do. So I&#8217;ll make a pencil case from scratch. Make little bags for myself.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Just stuff like that. So and I think she got that from my grandma because my grandma&#8217;s like, &#8220;You must know how to sew. It&#8217;s a key thing because you don&#8217;t have any money or you don&#8217;t have anything, at least you can sew the clothes on your back.&#8221; You can make curtains, you can make a chair, you can do whatever. As long as you can sew.&#8221; So that&#8217;s one of the skills that was drummed into me from a very young age.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it sounds like being exposed to all this so young, did you have a feeling that this is what you wanted to do? Or was this just a part of your world?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
It was just a part of my world to be honest. I didn&#8217;t even think of it as a career choice or anything like that. It was just a way of life, and it only hit me that actually this is what I really want to do as my career choice was not until I moved to Bangkok and I went there to work in doing something completely random. I was working as a governess, which is like a nanny almost for a family out there. And I was just getting really down. I was like, no, this is not being homesick, this is something else. And it just wasn&#8217;t clicking to me. And then one day I was just sitting on the sofa and I was like, I know. I know why I&#8217;m so down. I know why I&#8217;m feeling a little depressed.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
And I was like, I haven&#8217;t picked up a pen, I haven&#8217;t drawn anything. I haven&#8217;t made anything. That&#8217;s what it is. So as soon as that popped into my head, I jumped in the bike taxis, I went to the nearest shopping center and bought up a whole load of art supplies. And it just that feeling of just being creative again, I was just like, yeah, I&#8217;m coming back home and this is what I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Were you studying abroad? How did you end up in Bangkok being a governess? That seems like such a random kind of departure from what you were doing.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So my friend was actually working as a governess out there. And she&#8217;s like, oh, there&#8217;s this family that&#8217;s looking for a governess. I&#8217;m going to put your forward, do you mind. And I was like, I have no experience in this. She&#8217;s like, it doesn&#8217;t matter. Go interview and if they like you, then come over. And I was like, well, this is a bit out of my comfort zone. I was tempted to say, no. But I felt like it was one of those things that in a few years time I&#8217;ll kick myself like, why didn&#8217;t you just take the opportunity. So I went with it, and I had about three interviews with this family. And they&#8217;re like, yeah, just we&#8217;ll pay for your ticket. Apartment&#8217;s paid for, just come over.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
And I was like, oh okay. And I stayed there for a year, and yeah, it got to the point where I was just like, this is not where I&#8217;m meant to be. But I absolutely love Bangkok. There&#8217;s a place in my heart for Bangkok.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You are the second person that I&#8217;ve interviewed recently that has had some tie or connection to Bangkok. That is so &#8230; Yeah I just interviewed an artist in Washington DC here named Reggie Black. And he spent four years in Bangkok as a designer and doing talks and stuff like that. You let me know because you were there, was Bangkok a really creative city?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah. There&#8217;s loads of stuff to do. It&#8217;s like the city that kind of, it doesn&#8217;t sleep. Which is not like London. London, people always think that London&#8217;s busy and stuff. But come a certain time, things just shut down. But Bangkok&#8217;s just, they have a night market. There&#8217;s just lights, there&#8217;s culture, there&#8217;s just artwork everywhere, music. It&#8217;s just a really nice atmosphere. So yeah, definitely I would love to go back to Bangkok under creative or creative reasons anyway.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now you went to the University of the Arts in London. Can you tell me what your time was like there?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Oh, I was there for a while because the University of the Arts, they have different campuses.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So, well different colleges under the University of the Arts. So the first one I went to was the Art College in Camberwell. Camberwell Art College it&#8217;s called. And I had done a foundation art course there. So that course is just to help you build your portfolio and understand which direction you want to go in creatively. So you do a bit of fashion, a bit of graphic design, a bit of sculpture, painting, et cetera. And then from there you branch off into which field you&#8217;re more comfortable with. So that was my first college, and I actually went into graphic design. And now looking back at it, I was like, why did I do that? Because I was really interested in sculpture, but I thought, oh, how can I make money as a sculpture?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
I&#8217;m just thinking, I think people are in your ear like, how can you make money from being a sculpture. Graphic design makes more sense. So I went down that route. And then I ended up in London College of Communication, which is where they do mostly sort of graphics, digital courses there. And I had actually done a foundation degree, which then turns into a full degree if you did the final year. So I had only done two years of that. So I have a foundation degree in graphic communication. And I was like, I actually absolutely hate this. So I was like, but I want a full degree. So I managed to sort of blag my way onto another degree course, which was something completely different, magazine publishing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So I spoke to the head of the course. I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m really interested in doing this course. I have experience.&#8221; which was not true. I was like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; She was like, &#8220;Oh okay.&#8221; She looked at my grades. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, you can join the course, but over the summer you have to do some coursework to make up.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s fine.&#8221; And she&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; And I made it happen thank God. And from there, I graduated in magazine publishing, which is a weird course because it&#8217;s a bit of design, a bit of PR, marketing, all of the stuff that you need to know basically of how to run a magazine.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So by the time I graduated, it was that weird shift between print into digital. So I was like, this course was mostly about print. And now I&#8217;m graduating and everyone&#8217;s transitioning to digital. I was like, what is going on? I was like, all the places where I had done work placements at, their print &#8230; All the prints of their magazines were being shut down the department, the print department of their team. So I was just like, everyone&#8217;s just shutting down. I don&#8217;t know anything about digital. So I think that kind of scared me and I just sort of was stuck for a while thinking, what am I going to do next? I don&#8217;t know anything about digital. Should I take a course or something?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
And I think I was stuck in a rut for a long time. And I just continued at my job that I was doing during uni, which was working in retail. And that, that&#8217;s when &#8230; After that, that&#8217;s when I went to Bangkok, and that just opened my eyes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Well, it sounds like that trip to Bangkok was what you needed, if you were at this point where you had went through all this school and you were feeling stuck.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
A change of scenery will do it.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah, because over here I saw they sort of sell you a dream. They&#8217;re like, yeah, once you leave uni you&#8217;ll be able to get a job. And that&#8217;s what I thought. I was like, yeah, as soon as I go through it, I&#8217;ll be able to get a job easy. No. Not like that at all. Everyone I speak to, they&#8217;re like, yeah, we saw the same dream. And then it hits you. Life hits you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I know that feeling all too well. I graduated &#8230; Well, I didn&#8217;t go to design school, but I graduated with a degree in math. And I really had no career prospects lined up after school. I was still working like you. I was working the job that I was working while I was at school, which was just selling tickets at the symphony. Just selling to old white patrons that wanted to hear Chopin or whatever. Telling them where to sit and stuff.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it wasn&#8217;t until a few years after that, that I sort of ended up falling into design. But yeah, sometimes that&#8217;s how it is. School&#8217;s &#8230; And that&#8217;s not really I guess the fault of &#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say it&#8217;s the fault of the schools. It&#8217;s really the fault of the market.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Just because you come out with a degree, doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that you&#8217;re ready to go right into working somewhere because maybe you need a portfolio or maybe the school that you have has a different reputation that this company doesn&#8217;t go for. So I don&#8217;t know, it can be tricky. I know it&#8217;s tricky here in the States. I can imagine it&#8217;s the same way overseas as well.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. It&#8217;s not easy. And as you said, it&#8217;s true, you can&#8217;t blame the institutions for the lack of opportunities once you leave. But I think with the course I was saying, the foundation degree course, that was meant to be heavily work experience-based. And when we joined, everyone was like, where&#8217;s this work experience? Because we were meant to have industry teachers come in every week.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
To teach us from different companies and stuff. And we literally had one the whole year. We&#8217;re like, this is not what we signed up for. And we were all meant to be allocated sort of a mentor from the industry, which they were going to provide. So there was meant to be a mentorship scheme and stuff. But yeah, it didn&#8217;t work out that way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
But here I am. I found my feet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So you went to Bangkok, you worked there as a governess. You didn&#8217;t like it. That sort of sparked you wanting to become a designer. And you came &#8230; Did you come right back to London after that?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah. Straight back to London.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So what was your plan once you got back?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
I had saved some money whilst doing this job because I didn&#8217;t have to pay rent or anything like that. So I had saved, and I was like, okay, I&#8217;m going to give myself a year to really try and get this running. And if there&#8217;s no progress, then I&#8217;m going to have to really rethink this. So when I came back, I was just applying for sort of any artist call-outs and stuff like that. And I was just &#8230; I just began painting. And luckily I had a friend who used to do an evening called Arts Meets Music. And he was like yeah, why don&#8217;t you display some of your artwork at one of these events? And I was like, amazing, jumped on it. And then from there, that&#8217;s how I met people. And someone told me about, oh &#8230; Some of my artwork [inaudible 00:27:32] murals.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Because my paintings are such large scale paintings. And they&#8217;re like, why don&#8217;t you do murals? So I was like, oh, I never thought of that. I just thought street art is murals. Spray paint, I&#8217;d never touched a spray can in my life. How can I do this? Well, let me just apply for a call-out that I saw, which was local to me. And I actually had a dream that told &#8230; People think I&#8217;m crazy when I say this. I actually had a dream about it. And I was like, I woke up from this dream and I was like, yes, let me do the application now. And I actually won. And I was like, oh, this was a sign. So I had done it, I was like, okay, I&#8217;m going to literally win this because I&#8217;ve never spray painted in my life.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
And the mural actually came out really nice. And it&#8217;s still there in Brixton until this day. And from there, people just started contacting me. &#8220;Oh yeah, do you want to do a mural here?&#8221; &#8220;Do you want to do a mural there?&#8221; And I was like, wow, I was really not expecting this. And I found a new passion for something else as well. That&#8217;s how I got into the murals.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And speaking of which, that&#8217;s the mural that&#8217;s &#8230; People can see that in the cover art for this episode. The one that you&#8217;re standing next to.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s quite a mural. So you worked on all of that by yourself? Or did you have a &#8230; Did you work with another artist or anything?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yes. So this, the mural that you&#8217;re talking about, I worked with another artist called Lynette [inaudible 00:28:49]. And I worked with her on two other projects as well. So the person who created the project, [inaudible 00:28:57], she knew both of us. So she knew that we worked together, and she wanted two artists who had a good relationship who can work well together. And she&#8217;s more of a calligraphy artist. And I&#8217;m more of a sort of paint now, visual graphics. So both of our styles just seemed to work together. So she commissioned both of us to do the project. And yeah, and it worked out amazing. I&#8217;m really happy with the outcome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s a beautiful mural. It&#8217;s a beautiful mural.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;ll make sure that I will link so people can see the full thing because with the cover art it&#8217;s just sort of cut off in that square. As I was looking through your website and looking at your projects, one project I saw that I really liked was the work that you did with MTV. How&#8217;d you end up working with them?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So they contacted me last year about the award. And they&#8217;re like, it&#8217;s a really short turnaround. But we really love your style, and really think that it will suite &#8230; My art style will suite the award winners. So all the award winners for the &#8230; It was &#8230; Let me get the name off the award. Generation Change Award. All the winners are black female women or women of color, sorry. And I was like, well, I paint women of color and I paint women. So I was like, yes. All these women who have won, so it&#8217;s Raquel and Willis, [inaudible 00:30:23], Louisa Brazil, Kathea &#8230; She&#8217;s going to kill me for pronouncing her name. [inaudible 00:30:32] and [inaudible 00:30:33]. Sorry, my pronunciation of the names are terrible. And yeah, these women are amazing. They&#8217;re doing so much for our generation, for the future generation, fighting. They&#8217;re all amazing activists within their field.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
I was just so excited just to be asked just to create something personal for them. So all of the awards &#8230; Each of their awards is hand-painted and customized to them. So it was a very special project. I was very happy to be selected and honored.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So these days when it comes to big, high profile projects like that, are the projects coming to you, or are you seeking them out?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Luckily they seem to be coming to me. I have no idea where MTV saw my stuff from because when they contacted me, they showed me some of the artwork that they liked. And I was like, this is so random. It&#8217;s literally just random artwork that I just posted on Instagram, not thinking anything of it. Just, oh, this is what I&#8217;ve been doing during lockdown. Here&#8217;s a painting sort of thing. Just didn&#8217;t think about it. And those are the ones that they selected. So it was interesting because I would&#8217;ve thought it would be something that &#8230; Like another big project that I&#8217;d done before or something like that. But no, they contacted me. I was very lucky.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of your influences? Like I mentioned, the work that you&#8217;re doing, this sort of collage work is very vibrant. And certainly very unique. Who influences you or what influences you I should say?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
As I said before, a lot of the collages and painting that I do are stuff that I do daily. So they just represent my mood. It could be influenced by a song that I&#8217;ve just had on repeat all day that makes me feel good. I&#8217;m like, oh, I&#8217;m going to do a collage on that. I know it sounds typical, but literally the women that I have around me are amazing from my sister, my mom. A lot of the other artists that I work with are mostly females. So yeah, they push me and inspire me constantly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
At this stage in your career, you are doing these large scale projects and things of that nature, what does black art mean to you?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Black art for me is a place to be free. It&#8217;s a way for me to share my experiences and also hopefully uplift other black women. I think that&#8217;s important because representation especially in the art world &#8230; I don&#8217;t know about in the States, but over here the art world is very white male-based. These institutions are very white man, paint a sculpture sort of thing. And that&#8217;s even projected in the education within the art education when I was at uni and school. So for me, it&#8217;s about representation, authenticity, and just uplifting. That&#8217;s what art means to me. It&#8217;s just being free.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is sort of the London design scene like for you right now? Being on lockdown, are there ways that you&#8217;re able to connect with creatives?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah. So I&#8217;m part of &#8230; What&#8217;s that group&#8217;s &#8230; I sign up to online courses. So one of the courses that I use is Black Blossoms. So it&#8217;s an online art school. And you sign up and there&#8217;s different art courses. So every week there&#8217;s a different course. And I&#8217;ve been literally killing those. I&#8217;m right now, the course that I&#8217;m on is the Art Revolution in China, which is really interesting. Just opening up my eyes to different genres of art that I just wasn&#8217;t exposed to. And having these other women in these blossom art groups, and all of us just sharing opportunities like oh, someone&#8217;s contacted me to do this, but I just don&#8217;t have time. Any of you sort of have any idea of someone or if you want to do it? And we&#8217;re just sharing contacts, sharing opportunities because everyone&#8217;s just trying to eat. Some people have been made redundant from jobs and stuff. So I think, I feel like there&#8217;s a real sense of everyone coming together and just trying to help each other out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s a good thing that you&#8217;re able to kind of use technology as a way to reach out to people and to sort of have that fellowship and that &#8230; Also the ability to kind of work together. I don&#8217;t know if you collaborated with anyone solely on a virtual level with any work?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
I worked with a team who I had done murals with in the past. And I was actually scheduled to do a mural with them summertime last year, but it didn&#8217;t work out. So in the end, it ended up being a digital project. So from there it&#8217;s just, it was all online-based having to work from that sort of platform, I wasn&#8217;t able to research how I usually research sometimes. So especially if I&#8217;m doing artwork in a certain location or reference if it&#8217;s referencing a certain location, I usually go out with my camera, take photos. I just spend the day there, really just take in the atmosphere, but being obviously locked in the house, I&#8217;ve just had to find other ways. So YouTube, and watching old documentaries on the area, just trying to gain as much information. Trying to put out contact people via Instagram, which is a bit wild. But just people who you see off on the area and you can try and, &#8220;Hey, this is a bit weird, but I just want to get an understanding what this location means to you.&#8221; Or get as much interviews and stuff like that, which I&#8217;ve never really worked that way.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So definitely even after we come out of lockdown, I think I&#8217;ll be using those forms definitely to my practice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Sounds like you picked up a new skill over the pandemic.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah. Which is cool because I&#8217;m literally &#8230; I&#8217;m a person who keeps themselves to themselves. So it&#8217;s definitely pushed me out of my comfort zone having to talk to people. And even doing interviews, I don&#8217;t like my first Instagram Live at the end of last year. And I was like, I&#8217;ve never done this before. I was so nervous. And just doing radio shows as well I&#8217;ve been doing. So it&#8217;s been practice. I&#8217;m not great at interviews, but I&#8217;m getting there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Practice makes perfect, let me tell you. Just the more that you&#8217;re able to do it, the more comfortable you&#8217;ll become. That&#8217;s really the best way to do it. You get more comfortable, you end up kind of being able to pull on &#8230; Particularly if you&#8217;re talking about different projects that you&#8217;ve done. You&#8217;re able to kind of pull those narratives out really easily. So if I could give any advice, I would say, take all the opportunities that come to you because each of them is just a way for you to get better at it.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah. Definitely. And it&#8217;s just fighting the inner demons as well because it&#8217;s so easy to sort of self-sabotage. Be like, oh, I don&#8217;t want to do this. It&#8217;s out of my comfort zone. But you just &#8230; I just push myself all the time, and just be like, come on Azarra. Come on. Do my little speech to try and motivate myself and be like, you&#8217;re going to look back at this and think, oh, what was I panicking about? It&#8217;s so simple.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Because the flip side to it especially I think with doing a podcast interview is that the audience is vast and varied and diverse. There may be someone that&#8217;s out there listening that is like you. And is like, oh, well if she&#8217;s doing it, then I can do it.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah. And I hope there is someone out there. You can do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you define success right now?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Success for me is doing what I love. Yeah. Doing what I love and getting paid for it, which is the dream. So I&#8217;m always selective as well on what I work on. If it doesn&#8217;t feel right, if it doesn&#8217;t sit right with my core, or if it doesn&#8217;t feel authentic to me and feels forced, then I try to avoid it in a sense, but not restrict myself at the same time. So for me, it&#8217;s just what brings me joy at the moment because especially in times like this, you have to be selective with your energy. Even though you&#8217;re not being around a lot of people, it&#8217;s draining. So just trying to find happiness in everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you think your life would have gone if you weren&#8217;t a working artist? What else do you think you would&#8217;ve been doing?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
I can&#8217;t even imagine that life. Something creative definitely. But maybe in a different field. For ages, I wanted to be an architect. Which is completely random. And I was actually so close, I applied for it at uni and everything. And I just last minute changed my mind and done the art foundation course because I was like, I haven&#8217;t explored all that&#8217;s out there creatively. So for me to just rush into being an architect doesn&#8217;t feel right at the moment. But yeah, probably an architect or maybe something with children. I love kids, so a teacher. There&#8217;s one. I probably would&#8217;ve been a teacher.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What sort of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So I would love to be working full-time as an artist, and hopefully have my own creative agency and be doing what I do full-time. Even though as much as I love being a presentation designer, I would like to have more time to do projects that I really well. Whereas, working as a presentation designer, you&#8217;re restricted by what the client wants, Gram brand guidelines and stuff like that. It&#8217;s very sort of corporate, I would say corporate design. Whereas, as a creative, if I had to &#8230; My agency, I would be able to be selective and really push the boundaries and collab more with other people. Which is definitely on my list of things to do. Just get myself out there and just learn and work with other people. That&#8217;s the big thing for me, learning new skills as well. And just bringing that all together.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find more about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So you can check out my website, which is azarraamoy.com. And I&#8217;m also on Instagram @AzarraAmoy. And also on Twitter, which I don&#8217;t tweet that much, but just in case. It&#8217;s, ThisisAzarra. That&#8217;s my Twitter account.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Azarra Amoy, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you really for kind of sharing your creative journey and showing how you can really sort of find creativity in sort of the most seemingly unlikely of places. You were a governess like you said, in Bangkok. And you decided, oh, this is what I want to do. But no, the art that you&#8217;re creating is so vibrant and beautiful. And I&#8217;m just really excited to kind of see where you go from here. Hopefully one day we will be hearing about that exhibition that you&#8217;re planning.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yes, definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, so thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Thank you for having me. It&#8217;s been a pleasure.</p>

<p>I am absolutely thrilled to share my conversation with Angela Bains with you this week. Along with being the co-founder and strategy director of international branding agency <a href="https://transformexp.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">TransformExp</a>, Angela is also a design educator at <em>two</em> prestigious Canadian colleges &#8212; OCAD University in Toronto and BCIT in Vancouver. Wait until you hear her story!</p>
<p>We took a trip down memory lane as Angela talked about growing up in the 1970s in London, being exposed to graphic design and typography as a young woman, and starting her own design studio in the 1980s along the advent of the personal computer. Her story continues with emigrating to Canada in the 1990s, starting over and networking as a designer in a new country, and keeping the spark for design alive for then next generation of designers through teaching and decolonizing old design traditions.

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Hi there, my name is Carolyne Hill. I&#8217;m a creative director. I&#8217;m a specialist in branding and I have my own brand called ChillCreate and I&#8217;m a designer. I&#8217;m an all around creative.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What was your impetus behind starting ChillCreate?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve always wanted to do from when I was a little girl and I got to a point in my career, I was the director, art director, creative director of a design firm and that was my goal from when I started out in my design career. And I got to this goal and I was just really bored and I wasn&#8217;t really feeling the type of clients I was working for anymore. I wanted to do something different. And to be honest, I was even questioning whether I wanted to be a designer anymore. So I went off traveling, I took some time out, explored a bit, went full hippy, went off with a camera and a sketchbook. And when I came back, I just had some designs, some ideas, which were a lot more just completely different to anything else I&#8217;ve ever done. And it was a print. I ended up making some fabric and experimenting with a few products, which I got a friend to make for me. And that was the birth of ChillCreate. I basically wanted to start a fashion brand.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So what is sort of an average day like for you these days with ChillCreate?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Well, at the moment ChillCreate has kind of taken a back burner because although that&#8217;s there, it&#8217;s online, it&#8217;s ticking away, online sales still happen. Last year, I had to focus a lot more on my branding side of things to actually pay the bills as, I don&#8217;t know if you know, but yeah, as a creative, you often have the balance between the work that is your passion and the work that pays the bills.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
So ChillCreate is my passion and the work that pays the bills is my branding work. So I&#8217;m an independent design consultant. I help people build their brands, their communications, that type of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. How do you go about sort of choosing the types of clients and projects that you work with?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Well, I&#8217;ve been really lucky thus far. I&#8217;ve been an independent creative now for three years and I haven&#8217;t actually had to go out looking for work. So my way of getting work is through networking. I like socializing. I like being out and meeting people, so it&#8217;s really old school. But I get my business cards out, I chat to people, I tell them what I do and I get my clients that way. But I have to say I&#8217;m now in the process of actually beginning to think, &#8220;Right. How do I now choose the type of clients going forward?&#8221; I think trying to find clients which I can believe in what they do is really important to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I guess they would also have to mesh with sort of, well, if you&#8217;re coming to them as a brand consultant and they might, I guess they&#8217;re like at the beginning stages of their business or does it really matter?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I do have people at that beginning stage of their business and that tends to be kind of start-up entrepreneurs. They are super excited and great and have super amounts of passion, but they don&#8217;t necessarily have big budgets. So the type of clients that I like to try and work with more are people that are perhaps already on the road with their own entrepreneur side of their business, they&#8217;ve probably been doing it for some time and now they&#8217;re trying to take it to the next level. They&#8217;re trying to step it up so they&#8217;ve already got their brand. They&#8217;ve already got their philosophies, but they now need time and help to hone in on their key values, strategies and identities.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. At work, we just wrapped up. We just wrapped up and launched a project last month where we use, it was a independent branding agency, I think kind of similar to what you&#8217;re doing with ChillCreate, and it was amazing just kind of seeing how precise they were with asking all these questions and really making sure to get to the root of what the brand was about that we wanted to build. It wasn&#8217;t just, &#8220;Oh, make us a pretty style guide.&#8221; It was what are the values and everything that go into it, which I thought was pretty cool.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah, I think it&#8217;s so important. For me, it makes the design process easy because sometimes if you&#8217;ve got a client who just wants you to make them a pretty logo, something that looks nice, I can go off, I can create a pretty logo. Yeah, but then they come back, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s not quite right. It doesn&#8217;t pop.&#8221; You know, the classic it doesn&#8217;t pop. But if you work with the client and you then start to understand their values, where they&#8217;re coming from, who they want to attract, then it really hones in on the actual style, the content, the philosophy, and it then becomes really easy to work with the client developer relationship where you both have an identity or project at the end which everybody&#8217;s really happy with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When it comes to approaching a new project, what&#8217;s your process like?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I think to start with, it would be to sit down with the clients, have an open discussion about what it is they hope to achieve and I take them through kind of a brand strategy process that I used to use a lot when I was working for these other agencies. It&#8217;s where you build up a set of values, you then build up to the next stage. So it&#8217;s like a pyramid chart where you build up from the values, to the promise, all the way up to the brand essence. And then once you&#8217;ve got these things, you&#8217;ve got essentially without the actual design, you&#8217;ve got the brand. And then from there we go through sort of imagery search and creative stages of designing, feedback, and then applications. So it&#8217;s quite a straightforward process.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are there any companies or clients out there that you would love to collaborate with?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Oh goodness. I guess I think for me, I actually asked, I&#8217;ve started lecturing recently and I actually asked my students this question just the other day. And while I asked them, I felt myself, &#8220;Who would I like to collaborate with? What would be the ideal, the most amazing project?&#8221; I think for me it would be, I&#8217;ve worked perhaps this year a bit more on my own personal graphic style and then I imagine that, I don&#8217;t know, [nightcore 00:08:08]. Somebody comes to me and says, let&#8217;s do a collaboration. I&#8217;m talking out of this world kind of ideals. So yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well hey, put it out there in the universe. You never know.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
You never know, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the hardest part about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I think the hardest part for me is often working solo. I used to be the director, have a whole team, so I would have bosses above me. I had kind of strategy stuff on the left and then I had a whole team that I managed. And so going from that, basically being the boss, the middle person, and the person doing the running around, that has been one of the hardest challenges. And at times I have people to share the work with and other times I don&#8217;t. I sort of have to expand and contract, depending on the job. So that&#8217;s been quite a major challenge.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So let&#8217;s kind of switch gears here a bit. I know just from doing my research that you&#8217;re from London, right? You&#8217;re London proper.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yes. Born and bred.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Born and bred. What was it like growing up there?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I have very fond and happy memories growing up in London. I grew up in Brixton, which is South London, I guess the equivalent to stateside, massive might be like Brooklyn or something like that. So it&#8217;s a very Afro-Caribbean neighborhood with a lot of energy, a lot of vibe about it. And school and everything for me was great. I loved school, growing up in London was fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When did you know that art and design were things that you were interested in? Were you exposed to that a lot in Brixton?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah, I was exposed to a lot from my parents. They were very creative parents themselves. They&#8217;re not creatives themselves, but they just have lots of creative friends, lots of artist friends. My grandmother was a painter and we used to go and visit her. She lived in Cheltenham, which is sort of just past Oxford and she&#8217;d have watercolor paintings going on the whole time. And I always wanted to be an artist. I think from a very young age, I was really excited when we&#8217;d go to galleries and look at art. I remember being about 10 years old and loving Andy Warhol exhibitions that my parents had taken me to. And of course lots of my parents friends were artists. So I&#8217;d grew up in this very creative community. So I knew from a young age that I wanted to be an artist or a designer or a fashion designer. And then yeah, I got to school and quite quickly I was kind of told, &#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t want to be a starving artist, Carolyne.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Were your parents and family kind of supportive of you though, going that route?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Oh yeah, they were super supportive. I never had any problems in terms of convincing my parents that I was going to be an artist because I&#8217;d been saying it from when I was, like I said, about 10 years old, maybe younger even.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But at school you were hearing something different.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yes, quite often at school you&#8217;re paired up with careers advisor. And I remember the careers advisors saying, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know really about you being a designer or an artist. Maybe you should be a social worker, something a bit more achievable.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah. Can you imagine?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can&#8217;t imagine. When I was in high school, I had my guidance counselor at the time was always telling me that you need to learn a trade. And here in the States, learning a trade is blue collar work, like a mechanic or fixing air conditioner units or something like that. And now granted, I was valedictorian in high school. I graduated the top of my class. But she was like, &#8220;Well, just think about it. You might want to think about learning a trade or something because you never know. One day&#8230;&#8221; I&#8217;ll never know one day what, that doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
One day, what? Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah I was the same. I was top scorer in the school. So there&#8217;s no reason why we shouldn&#8217;t have been pushed to do exactly what we wanted to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. And you went to the London College of Printing, which I said this before we recorded, I was like, &#8220;It sounds like a college for printing.&#8221; which seems like a very intensive thing to study. But what was your time like there?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
It&#8217;s changed names now. It&#8217;s the London College of Communication because essentially the printing world is dead or depleted. But yeah, I guess it&#8217;s background, the London College of Printing was that it was an arts college, part of the London Institute, which focused on the kind of printing, publishing and arts, which then moved into digital. So I actually studied retail design and business management, which was actually an interior design degree for public and commercial spaces. So it was a mixture of sort of design, but also business and branding was very heavy, was a big part of it. So you had to both design the interiors, brand the interiors, and understand how you are going to make this commercially viable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. That actually sounds like a really modern program. When I think about what a lot of schools try to teach, it&#8217;s more so just the design and not the business aspect of it.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yes. At the time, I remember thinking, &#8220;Oh my goodness, the business side is so boring.&#8221; But actually, having left university when we only had access to computers one day a week, I kind of feel like everything I learned in university on the creative side was great. But as soon as I started the job, I was on the computer 24/7. So all this hand drawing skills that I learned, I never actually had to use in my job for a number of years. But the business side of things was very informative and I still kind of think about what we did learn and it was very good in that respect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, that&#8217;s really good. I mean we had back on the show, I think it was maybe about&#8230; God, I&#8217;ve been doing the show for seven years now. I think it&#8217;s been about two or three years ago, we had Douglas Davis who wrote this book about kind of the business of design, learning basically what you learned in college, learning the aspect of not just branding, but how do you design towards business goals. How do you keep those in mind while also still creating something that looks nice, that serves the client&#8217;s needs but is more than just a pretty thing?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Exactly. It&#8217;s the strategy. I think they changed the name of the course after I did it and they switched it around a bit. I&#8217;m not sure if they still combine the design with the strategic side anymore. But I remember there was one book which was really important at the stage. It was called the Design Agenda. It&#8217;s so old now, but that was like the course bible and it was basically brand strategy and design management.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And what did you say it was called? The design what?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
The Design Agenda.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The Design Agenda. That sounds kind of sinister, but I kind of like it. The Design Agenda. No, I liked that a lot. So what were your first design jobs out of college. You graduated, you now have this not only design skill but the business skill. You&#8217;ve got the degree to back it up. What were those first design jobs like for you?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
So my first job I got was designing for Tesco&#8217;s, which is one of the UK&#8217;s biggest supermarkets and I got the job and I was super excited because it took me a while to get my first job and I said, &#8220;Great, thank you. I&#8217;ve got the job. Sorry, what is the job?&#8221; Because I didn&#8217;t actually know what the job I was applying for. They said, &#8220;Graphic designer.&#8221; And you just heard me say I actually graduated from an interior design degree. And that&#8217;s when I said, &#8220;Oh great. Yeah.&#8221; They said, &#8220;You can do that?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; I was just so happy to have a job. I wasn&#8217;t about to tell them that I&#8217;m not a graphic designer, I&#8217;m an interior designer. So I did it. I learned straight in at the deep end, designing for one of the UK&#8217;s largest supermarkets. I had to design buy one get one free messages, frozen food signage, just really boring till messages, anything and everything that you see on the kind of point of sales side within a supermarket.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
That then gradually grew into being put in charge of whole departments, graphics, art direction for photo shoots of frozen food, being in charge of the entire UK&#8217;s carpark signage packages. So it was a fast paced agency, it was a massive agency. It was a sink or swim kind of situation and yeah, I went in, front stroke, swimming hard.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well I think it&#8217;s good to kind of be in those sorts of situations because it pushes you to become a lot better I guess pretty quickly given how large Tesco is as a brand.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah. You had to, you really had to deliver quickly. It was one of those agencies where you would work &#8217;til sometimes midnight, two in the morning and you still had to be there at 9:00 AM. I learned a lot in that company. And I also learned straight away from my experience there that I didn&#8217;t want to work at another big agency like that again. So after that, I went to smaller agencies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s amazing. I feel like the agency experience is universal. No matter who I talk to in any country about working for an ad agency or something like that, it&#8217;s the same type of breakneck speed or the same type of huge, just workload. That&#8217;s wow.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah. I think you can handle it for a while and some people love that.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I think you can handle it for a while, and some people love that kind of vibe consistently.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I think when you&#8217;re young it&#8217;s good, because you&#8217;ve got the energy to do that.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah, and you&#8217;ve got the fire to keep fighting and pushing back, constantly delivering. But I think I figured out very quickly that I didn&#8217;t really like working for other people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, you were doing these sort of small agency gigs. We spoke about this also before recording, that you worked even here, in the U.S., for a little bit. Just briefly, right? In New York City?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah, I always wanted to come to New York and, I don&#8217;t know, I wanted to be a designer in New York. I came out, I did some house-sitting in Brooklyn, and then I got a really cool gig looking after somebody else&#8217;s apartment in the Lower East Side. While I was there I just was trying to find jobs, and it was very difficult, as a Londoner, trying to get into the New York agencies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What made it difficult?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Well, there&#8217;s the whole issue of your green card and who was going to be your sponsor, and you had to prove that your service was not able to have been filled by a United States citizen. Agencies, they kind of weren&#8217;t really interested in having to go through all that rigmarole, and maybe I didn&#8217;t have the right contacts at the time. I was quite na√Øve in that respect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s still tough. I have a friend, he&#8217;s from India. He went to school in Canada and he was here in Atlanta for a while, but now he lives out near L.A., in California. I remember even when he was looking for jobs how difficult it was, because of those same kinds of issues with companies that wouldn&#8217;t sponsor him, or he had to be sponsored on a certain visa so there were only certain types of jobs that he could look for and not something that could really advance him in his career. It had to be something more lower level, so you kind of were stuck at one point because the job may offer you the paperwork that you need to stay here, but it&#8217;s not really something you can succeed in or you can grow in.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Exactly, and that&#8217;s where I found myself. In the end I had a great time exploring New York, living the life, doing yoga. I was just hot-desking, going to cafes with my laptop, working on &#8230; I was actually working for magazines at the time and record labels from London, so it was quite a fun time. You know, coming out of the big corporate chain of supermarkets, high street retailers for a while, there was me designing cute stuff for record labels and magazine spreads for [Touch 00:20:49] Magazine, which was one of these kind of R&#038;B Hip Hop magazines in London. So, it was fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What year was this, just to kind of put it in context?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Oh, my goodness. In context, I would say that would have been around, oh gosh, 10 years ago, now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so right around late-2000, something like that?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Gotcha. Okay. All right.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I know. Time&#8217;s gone fast.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at your early career experiences, up to what you&#8217;re doing right now, when you look back at those, what do you feel like those experiences taught you?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been quite varied. I enjoyed being a freelance designer, as well as then going full-time to be an employed designer. The bits that taught me the most were probably the freelance parts, because you got to jump around to lots of different types of agencies and work on lots of different projects. Of course, each time you work on another project you kind of come back and you say, &#8220;Well, actually I can charge more.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
So, it gave me a really good experience across a wide range of types of projects: working with interior designers for a long time, which was great, because that&#8217;s where my original training started. I also worked with architects, and did a little bit of work with ad agencies. I worked with TV companies, mobile phone operators. It&#8217;s been really random and quite varied, so I think that&#8217;s the advantage that was given me, is that now that I&#8217;m working for myself, I do have a very varied type of client base. And I like that. I like things when they&#8217;re varied.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s one thing I really enjoyed when I was freelancing, too, that I could sort of bounce around and see how I can use my skills with different types of clients. Back when I had my studio, I would &#8230; maybe one month I&#8217;m doing something for a cosmetics brand, and then it&#8217;s pivoting to work for a software company, and then it&#8217;s pivoting to work for a solo entrepreneur that&#8217;s writing books, or something like that. And so, you find a way to kind of use your skills in these different ways.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What I think, and maybe this is different in other places, maybe this is unique to Atlanta, but what I found sucked was that once I went out looking for a job, they wanted you to sort of be a specialist. Instead of being a generalist that could take your skill and apply it to anything, they wanted you to only have worked in this particular type of design for years or something, which &#8230; I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Is that when you were applying for jobs in big agencies?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I don&#8217;t know if they were all big agencies. Mostly they were software companies or tech companies. I think they just wanted to make sure they had someone that understood, I guess, tech. Like, right now I work in a software company. There&#8217;s a lot of jargon that goes around that I know probably most designers either don&#8217;t know, or don&#8217;t care about. I&#8217;ll be honest. I don&#8217;t care about it most of the time, but I know enough to be able to translate it, and know what I have to know for my work. But it wasn&#8217;t something where, &#8220;Oh, you have to have had this many years of experience in a SaaS company.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like &#8230; This is something that I want to explore more this year in general, is that it feels like everything is converging towards tech, every single profession in some way is converging towards technology. Maybe it&#8217;s because tech is everywhere, maybe it&#8217;s because even in things that I don&#8217;t think we realize, AI and machine learning are parts of them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Even in the most seemingly low-tech job, like farming or something like that, there&#8217;s so much technology in farming. It feels like everything is certainly converging at some point towards tech, so having those singular kind of work experiences almost &#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know if that really prepares you for this sort of new world, where everything has to do with tech.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah. I don&#8217;t know. I do think about that sometimes because I think, like you, I don&#8217;t really care for the techspeak and the &#8230; I use tech. I love tech. I love new things and learning new things, but I don&#8217;t necessarily want to be in tech, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. No, that totally makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I think for me, I would rather &#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I think personally, for my own creative ambitions, I want to [inaudible 00:25:19] more to the art side of things to step away from tech. Because although I understand a lot, I can learn, but I don&#8217;t really want to spend my time having to become a specialist in it. And I think so many people do it so much better, so why should I &#8230; I don&#8217;t want to make that my purpose. I want to stick with creative thinking, because I don&#8217;t think that will ever go out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, no.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I think it might be short-sighted in the sense, &#8220;Oh, you need to be [inaudible 00:25:47] in tech,&#8221; but actually, it&#8217;s a very different skill to think creatively and to come up with creative strategy and ideas. Tech exists, but it needs ideas to make it functional. So, even if perhaps, I don&#8217;t know, maybe in the future I might have to get into tech, but I would hope that I get into it on the ideas side of things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I see now &#8230; You can tell when a solution has been thought up by a group of engineers and there&#8217;s no tech people in the room, because it may work, but it doesn&#8217;t look good or it&#8217;s not user-friendly. Granted, design is a very visual medium, but there&#8217;s also UX design, and a lot of that has to do with more psychological things about-</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How does the user feel about this? Is this word choice proper? Things like that. I know one, this is a project I worked on with &#8230; this is with a client years and years and years ago. It was very clear that they wanted to have this new content management system for their newsroom, and the software developers there had come up with a solution. They were like, &#8220;Oh, well it works because it does these technologies and this, this, and this, and all this stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But the actual user interface was so bad to use. I think it was &#8230; God, was it DotNetNuke? It might have been DotNetNuke. It was something super-obscure that 0.01% of companies probably use right now. It&#8217;s not WordPress, by a stretch, it&#8217;s not something that&#8217;s simple to pick up. It&#8217;s like if you were making an article, you had to make an article in these blocks, and so you had to think of &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Say you were writing a piece, and the piece has five paragraphs and two images. Each of those paragraphs is a block, and each of those images is a block, and so you now have to abstract, &#8220;Oh, well you just take this paragraph and put it in this block.&#8221; Then someone&#8217;s like, &#8220;What if I want to put a picture next to it?&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, we didn&#8217;t think of that. Well, why don&#8217;t you put the picture underneath it?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They&#8217;re like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want the picture underneath it. I want the picture next to it.&#8221; Like a pull quote or something going outside the margin. It&#8217;s like the engineers didn&#8217;t even think of that. They were like, &#8220;Oh, we never considered that use-case.&#8221; That sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
So, it&#8217;s important. I think there will always be room for the non-tech, but in tech.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
At this stage in your career, what is the London design scene like? How do you experience it?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I live and work in the Shoreditch area, which is like designer central. I&#8217;ve always worked in and around this area, which is how I ended up living up here. It&#8217;s fast-paced, there&#8217;s design companies on every corner. It&#8217;s big business, some of the worldwide agencies are here. But for me, my design community is perhaps a bit more local: as in my peers, my friends, the sort of creative family, and there&#8217;s a lot of crossover in between our creative endeavors.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Since working for myself, I&#8217;m beginning to perhaps work with fellow creatives, but on different things. So, I have people who are photographers, who are artists, who are fashion designers, writers, TV people, all in my circle of friends and associates, and I think there&#8217;s a great crossover.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I think at this moment, especially within the black arts scene in London, it&#8217;s a great opportunity and time, because there&#8217;s been a lot going on. I&#8217;m starting to see some of my peers, people that I&#8217;ve known for a long time now, actually reaching sort of great heights of success. I&#8217;m reading about them in publications, and seeing friends of mine who are now the artists being featured on packaging for quite famous products here in the U.K.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
So, I think it&#8217;s a really good time. It&#8217;s an exciting time. It&#8217;s like if you&#8217;ve got the staying power to just keep going and reaching out to these connections, I think it&#8217;s a good time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It sounds like it&#8217;s booming, if that&#8217;s the case.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know about booming. I think London is one of these places where you can boom, but you can also bust real quick. There&#8217;s opportunity, definitely. There is definitely opportunity to boom, but it&#8217;s, I think, probably like anywhere at the moment in our societies. It&#8217;s quite hard work, but then you get these little nuggets of goodness and growth and prosperity, which keep you going until the next-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I know here in the States the conversation around diversity in design, it seems like it&#8217;s ongoing. Is that the case also in London, or I guess in the U.K.? Do you find that there&#8217;s a lot of conversations around having more people of color involved in the design industry as a whole?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yes. Yeah, there&#8217;s always this conversation. I think for myself, as a person of mixed heritage from Brixton, London, I&#8217;ve always been the only person of color, and often the only woman in the room in these design agencies that I&#8217;ve worked for. Working now for myself, I&#8217;m just working with all black people and loads of women, and loads of people who are just open to be creative. It&#8217;s kind of refreshing, because in my earlier career I&#8217;ve always been the only one in the room, so to speak. So, that discussion is going on. I don&#8217;t know how much it&#8217;s going on within these big agencies itself, because I stepped out of that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, that makes sense. Because a lot of it, what I hear is mostly about employment. It&#8217;s not necessarily about all over, general numbers. Here in the States it started from the diversity in technology conversation, which was looking at big tech companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, and seeing how their workforce broke down. It started to go over into design, but I feel like it&#8217;s mostly been just about design departments at tech companies, and not about these ad agencies, or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Well, we&#8217;re seeing it a lot in the press. It&#8217;s slightly different, but even in the BAFTAs this last week we&#8217;ve had, there&#8217;s nobody of color that&#8217;s been nominated for anything, and that&#8217;s just completely shocking. Then you&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;Well, who&#8217;s doing the nominations?&#8221; Well, of course, is there anybody representing there?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
But then over in the literary field, we&#8217;ve just had the first black woman to win the Booker Prize for her book, &#8220;Girl, Woman, Other,&#8221; a writer called Benardine Evaristo. Her book is fantastic. I recommend everybody go read it, it&#8217;s really good.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
There are sometimes things are changing, but I don&#8217;t know. There always has to be the first, and then are there any others? And how do you keep it going? I think it&#8217;s a constant discussion and a constant struggle, so to speak. I think at the moment, with the society that I&#8217;m in at the moment in London in [Brexit 00:33:09], I feel I just have to get on and do it myself, in whatever that is that I want to do to make the change that I want to see.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like here in the States, it&#8217;s similar to that. I think it depends on the industry. We just had the Grammys here a few weeks ago, I think. For people that are listening, we&#8217;re recording this in early February, so this is &#8230; Grammys were last week. My whole calendar is a blur, so I apologize. But I know the Grammys were recently, because unfortunately they happened the same day that Kobe Bryant passed away.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There was conversation, I think, around some of the big names in the music industry, black folks in particular, like Puff Daddy, some other folks, et cetera: about how the Grammys are not treating black artists well, and they sort of lump us in these other categories and things like that. I was having a conversation with some people, and the thing that came to me was, why don&#8217;t they just start their own awards?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I got pushback from it, I think for two reasons. The first reason I got pushback was because, how come we always have to make the solution? Like, the system doesn&#8217;t change if we just sort of make an alternative to it, which I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But then, the other pushback I got was the value of what that even means. A lot of people in the music industry look to Grammys as some pinnacle of success that you&#8217;ve reached in your career. For some artists it means you will get paid more, it opens the door to more opportunities, collaborations, et cetera. That may not be the same case with a perhaps lesser-known award. So, it&#8217;s also about, I guess, the value that the industry gives to these types of honorifics. It&#8217;s like a whole power structure thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I agree with you about, we have to do it ourselves. Because if we keep waiting for the system or keep pushing at the system for things to change, sometimes it changes. Sometimes it does. It can be slow, it can change in unexpected ways.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But then if we&#8217;re able to do these things ourselves, we sort of become the masters of our own fate in that way. We can control and shape the exact message that we want to get out there without having to go through some filter, or gatekeeper, or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yes. I think sometimes if you&#8217;re constantly trying to prove yourself in a structure that has no interest in hearing you, you just get worn out and worn down. So, I think there&#8217;s a point at which you just brush it off and do your own thing.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not saying you stop trying. I&#8217;m just saying you&#8217;ve got to focus on what means something to you and the passion that you have within yourself, creatively. Because the whole system can get on top of you to the point where you lose that creativity, and you lose that buzz, and the inspiration which made you want to enter these roles-</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
&#8230; inspiration, which made you want to enter these roles, competitions yourself in the first place. It&#8217;s kind of like you have to do everything, but for me the priority is you&#8217;ve got to focus on your own passion and your own self and your own community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So speaking of knowing friends of yours that have had these sort of big campaigns and this visibility, you yourself had a popup exhibition at the Tate Modern last summer. Can you tell me a little bit about that?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yes. That was so exciting. It was a really random opportunity that came my way, and I just said, &#8220;Yeah, cool, I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221; And I had no idea what I was going to do, but I was given a sort of loose topic to explore, and I ended up exploring the question: where do you come from? Because as a person of mixed heritage from London, I&#8217;m always asked, it&#8217;s the second question, apart from, what&#8217;s your name, that people ask you, &#8220;But where are you from?&#8221; And you say, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m from London.&#8221; &#8220;No, but where are you really from?&#8221; You say, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m from Brixton.&#8221; &#8220;No, no, no. What&#8217;s your heritage?&#8221; You say, &#8220;Well, my mother&#8217;s Jamaican, my dad&#8217;s English.&#8221; &#8220;Oh!&#8221; And so you&#8217;ve always got all these layers of questions that come your way.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
So I felt, especially as the Brexit drama we&#8217;ve been having, this negative rhetoric about identity, which is going round. I wanted to explore it. So I did some posters, had this exhibition, was up there for a week, and it was just the most satisfying and exciting experience being at the Tate Modern, which is one of my most favorite places in the whole of London.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What was the reception that you got from it?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
It was great. I had the posters and then I wanted people to come in and ask and answer the question themselves, where are you from? So I had people from all around the world come and make their own versions of my posters, which filled all the walls in this kind of pop-up space. And even this week I had a message on Facebook from a lady from Peru who came and was part of the exhibition. She was a poet and she just wrote me a message this week saying &#8220;Hello, I miss the time we had at the Tate Modern.&#8221; I was just like, this is amazing. I met so many people. It gave me so much confidence to think that I can be an artist, I can take my design skills, my creativity, and I deserve also to be here in this space at the Tate. Yes, so it was really good fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I guess, also with taking those skills, you&#8217;re also now a part time lecturer at Ravensbourne University. So you&#8217;re putting it out there in the community as well.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yes, that&#8217;s right. I wanted to have the opportunity to give back and to be that inspiration that you see. And like our conversation at the beginning here when we were in college or university, we didn&#8217;t necessarily have people that looked like us to necessarily guide us in that direction. And I just feel that my experience as a Londoner would be valid and useful to anyone at university for whatever their background. And so I&#8217;ve just recently started, I&#8217;ve given one or two lectures, and I&#8217;m really enjoying the tutorials and getting to know the kids. Yeah, really it&#8217;s quite exciting. It&#8217;s very different to my usual day job.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are you finding that they teach you?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Man, they&#8217;ve got so many ideas. They&#8217;re teaching me a bit about tech. They&#8217;ve all got the latest computers and every single app and all the applications. I don&#8217;t necessarily have the latest computer myself. So what are they teaching me? Definitely just different kind of thinking. They&#8217;re coming from a different place to myself and they&#8217;re just ready to explore. They&#8217;re at that point of exploration. And I think for me it&#8217;s great to see that because it just opens your eyes again to exploring.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s an interesting thing about lecturing and teaching, especially if you&#8217;re self taught or you&#8217;re entrepreneurial in any way, because you take all these things that you&#8217;ve learned from trial and error and now you&#8217;re like teaching it to someone else. It&#8217;s a weird kind of feeling because, I don&#8217;t know, for me, when I did it, I used to kind of feel a bit of imposter syndrome, like, why am I at this place teaching this? Like I taught a brief class at Savannah College of Art and Design, and I was like, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t go to art school. What am I doing here? I&#8217;m just a guy off the street teaching these kids and stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s amazing how that, I feel like they want to hear that though. They want to hear that kind of real experience because in a way that&#8217;s sort of where they&#8217;re at. Like they&#8217;re not a known entity or they don&#8217;t have these years of experience yet. So they kind of want to hear the real thing. They don&#8217;t want to hear the package speech, I guess, about, work hard and all your dreams will come true. Like will they? That sort of thing. So yeah.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah. I think they want to hear the sidesteps, the roundabouts, the up and down that you go through. Because I think maybe this generation, they know that it&#8217;s going to be quite hard to get a job. They&#8217;re seeing it all the time. There&#8217;s no such thing as a job for life anymore. And even getting a job is going to be really hard for them. So I think they&#8217;re aware of that. And so I just think, I know what you mean about this imposter syndrome by the way, because on the first time I had to get up and speak, I was really nervous. And the senior lecturer, she did her speech, her lecture, which was good. And when she put up on the board all the clients that she&#8217;s worked for, I looked at it and thought, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ve worked for pretty much the same clients over the years.&#8221; So that&#8217;s one layer that dropped off of my insecurity, because it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ve done what you&#8217;ve done.&#8221; Her whole experience was completely different though.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
And then the other lecturer gave her talk and she&#8217;s, I would say much younger than myself and the other lecturer, I mean, her experience was also completely different. And that&#8217;s when I actually became really comfortable because I was like, &#8220;This is exactly where I&#8217;m supposed to be. I&#8217;m different to these other two. I don&#8217;t need to be what they are, who they are or where they&#8217;ve been, because I&#8217;ve got my own story and my own journey.&#8221; All of that imposter syndrome dropped off, and I saw the kids looking back at me smiling, which meant they must be engaged. So I&#8217;m good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s so good when you reach that point, because I mean, one, it instills in you this confidence that you know exactly what it is that you&#8217;re talking about, what it is you&#8217;re doing. Because it&#8217;s your experience. Who knows it better than you do? Your own experience. Right? So of course you can speak on that from a position of authority. I think the imposter syndrome does sort of come in when you try to do that comparison to what other people are doing.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
It&#8217;s the worst thing you can do, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And it&#8217;s interesting because I&#8217;ve talked to people lately about, and it&#8217;s mostly just been about podcasts and some stuff about design, but they&#8217;re always like, &#8220;Wow, you&#8217;re so confident.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve worked my ass off to get here. So yes, I am confident because I know what I&#8217;ve done to get to this point to be able to talk about it with authority.&#8221; So it&#8217;s a good feeling once it does go away. So how do you define success at this point?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I think success at this point means being happy, yeah, success means being happy. If you&#8217;re working to pay the bills and you can&#8217;t quite make things stretch, are you happy? I don&#8217;t know. You need both the commercial success as well as the creative passion success. So for me, being happy means that I&#8217;m successful. That means that I&#8217;ve got enough money to pay the bills, I can take some holidays, but I&#8217;m also creating things that I am proud and happy to work on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything that you&#8217;re obsessed with at the moment?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Just music. I&#8217;m always obsessed with music, listen to different music every single day. It&#8217;s what keeps me designing and keeps me working.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are you listening to?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Today is a complete mix up of music and tracks. I started off the day listening to, okay, then judge me, it&#8217;s going to be really random, yeah?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Beyonce&#8217;s Homecoming was the first thing to get me out the house, a bit of Curtis Mayfield, then I jumped into some Nina Simone, then I&#8217;ve just seen Queen and Slim, so I listened to the Queen and Slim soundtrack. And then this afternoon we listened to some Alfa Mist. I would say I&#8217;m very obsessed with Alfa Mist, they&#8217;re are kind of UK ambient soul jazz band. They&#8217;re really good. I listen to them a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s a very varied playlist for today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s actually a really good playlist. That&#8217;s really good. I&#8217;m into like, so I don&#8217;t know, my music taste is all over the place. I don&#8217;t even know if this is something I&#8217;ve talked about on the show, especially when I was in college and my early 20s I was so, so big into British music. You have no idea. My favorite band was Jamiroquai. I listened to Radio One just on the internet or whatever. So I knew about producers and artists like Alice Russell and Ben Westbeech and Will Holland, and I mean, I still listen to a lot of that stuff. I think Alice Russell has a new album coming out this year, knock on wood, I hope she does. But I listened to a lot of stuff from the UK, a lot of music.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I went there, it was the first time I was in London, it was in 2017 is actually, it was the first week that I started this job. They sent me to London for the first week. I was like, what? That was so mad. I did not get to listen to the radio, go to any bars or anything, because it was all work. I didn&#8217;t have time and I didn&#8217;t know where places were and stuff. I was like, &#8220;Oh man, I missed the golden opportunity to really be in the UK music scene or whatever.&#8221; But, oh man, I love it, love it, love it. But I&#8217;m not going to pull up my music director and everything, but I&#8217;m a big, huge British jazz fan, British soul. Oh, all that. Love it. Love it. Love it. Love it.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah. Well I listen to a lot, and it&#8217;s what gets me designing, and I feel really happy when I&#8217;m at my desk. I share a really nice little studio in Brick Lane with two other creatives, and I love it. And we play music all day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s something that perhaps maybe not many people understand about you?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Gosh, put me on the spot there. I think one of the things, maybe not understand, but they don&#8217;t maybe realize is, you can very easily put out this persona, especially being like a brand owner, that everything is always going amazingly and ticketyboo. But when you&#8217;re a creative working for yourself, that there are often those times which are like major highs and that&#8217;s what everyone sees. So maybe people don&#8217;t necessarily understand that, me, this big vibrant person who&#8217;s very happy to be out socializing, can also be at times a bit of an introvert and can have those moments of self doubt.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Because I think now, especially with social media and design, it&#8217;s like you always have to be putting something out there for people to see so they know that you&#8217;re still doing it or that you&#8217;re still out there making work. So it&#8217;s hard to kind of, I don&#8217;t even want to say take a break, but you rarely see the downs, you mostly only just see the ups.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah. And I think when you are working for yourself and you&#8217;re running your own business, you know, I run two businesses at the moment, you&#8217;re doing it all yourself, so you don&#8217;t necessarily have anyone to share that burden with in terms of on a business level. And to the outside, people don&#8217;t necessarily see that. And well, I think that&#8217;s just life at times, but maybe that&#8217;s what people don&#8217;t see or understand about me as much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Where do you think your life would&#8217;ve gone if you weren&#8217;t working in design? Like did you have a backup plan or anything?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I really enjoyed sociology, studying that at school. I think if I wasn&#8217;t in design, I don&#8217;t know if I would have gone into that kind of social world, but maybe a different type of creativity if I wasn&#8217;t a designer, you know? I think stage design, it would be something that I would love to have explored, because it&#8217;s so conceptual and fantastical and random.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I guess London&#8217;s a big theater city, so that would&#8217;ve worked out.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
That could have worked out. Yes. I do a lot of work with theaters at the moment, and I really enjoy working with people, helping them visualize their creative concepts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What do you want your legacy to be?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
CarolYne Hill, creative from Brixton. I don&#8217;t know. I think my legacy would just be to be remembered as somebody who was a creative who designed and was here, maybe did a little something to change things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? It&#8217;s it&#8217;s 2025, what are you working on? Or what do you want to be working on?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I would like to think by 2025 my businesses are going really well. I&#8217;m perhaps actually running a team, not perhaps, I&#8217;m running a team. Things are pretty organized. And those things are ticking off nicely, but I think personally I&#8217;d like to have explored my artistic side more and be in the process of creating artwork as opposed to design and designing for other people. I think that would be a really nice thing to aim for for the next five years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I have a website which is carolynehill.com. That&#8217;s Carolyne with a Y rather than an I. My other brand: chillcreate.com</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Carolyne Hill, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you for really just kind of sharing your journey. I know we didn&#8217;t include this in the interview, but the connection that you and I both have is from the late Jon Daniel, who was also on the show, and I know you mentioned him being a big inspiration to you, a big mentor to you. And I think with the work that you&#8217;re doing with ChillCreate, I mean, having an exhibition in the Tate, and then really I think just living a proud creative life, I think that&#8217;s kind of the dream for all of us, and I know, I really feel like that would have been the dream that Jon would have wanted to see from you. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Thank you very much. You&#8217;ve been a wonderful host.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re starting off 2020 with the one and only Anthony Harrison. If you loved the streetwear ads of the 90&#8217;s from brands like Akademiks and Nikel, then you&#8217;ve seen Anthony&#8217;s work. Currently, Anthony is overseeing graphic design and identity at Adidas over in Germany, and helps makes the intangible tangible for the massive multinational sportswear company.</p>
<p>Our conversation started off with Anthony talking about his work at Adidas, and from there he guided me through a retrospective of his career as a designer. We also talk about moving past the romantic area of design, the top two skills a creative person really needs to know, and what success looks like for him know at this point in his career. Anthony&#8217;s longevity in the industry and the scope of his work are worthy of praise, and I think beginning the year with this interview is a great way to get those creative juices flowing!</p>

<span class="thst-toggle-title">Full Transcript</span><div class="thst-toggle-inner">
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    My name is Anthony Harrison and I am a creative director, mostly would describe myself as an art director, but I think that definition has expanded. So I&#8217;ll go with creative director.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     You&#8217;re currently working at Adidas, is that right?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m a senior director of graphic design and identity for Adidas. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Can you talk a little bit about sort of what kind of work you do in that capacity?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Yeah. So in my team on the identity part, that&#8217;s the root of what we do. I&#8217;m in the brand design department and what we do is we come up with the full on graphic expression for any innovation or initiative that the brand is undertaking. So if there&#8217;s a new technology that comes out, we do the wordmark, we come up with the logo. We meet with the scientists, we look at the process, we follow how it goes. Then from there, we create a wordmark, but then the fully graphic expression. A lot of these are treatments that they&#8217;ll give to an outsole or an inner layer of a piece of footwear. So we&#8217;ll actually look at what those aesthetics are and build a graphic language from it. Also, around all of those wordmarks we create an animation.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    So it&#8217;s really building little brands inside of the brand for different technologies and innovations, which is really super interesting because our job is to make the intangible tangible, right? How do you take a sports innovation and make it something tangible for the average consumer. So that&#8217;s a big, big part of the challenge. The other side obviously is overseeing graphic design throughout the company for apparel, footwear, communication, equipment. We also do all of the brand management as well in terms of guidelines and that sort of thing. So we&#8217;re a pretty, pretty nimble team. Part of us sit here in Germany and the other half sit in our Portland, Oregon office and we bat things back and forth. We are truly a global operation.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Wow. Adidas is such an iconic brand. I can only imagine just the amount of, I don&#8217;t know, I feel like that&#8217;s a big heavy lift for something that is so well known worldwide in terms of identity because there&#8217;s so many ways that you could take&#8230; The simple three stripe logo, there&#8217;s a lot of ways that you can interpret that. There&#8217;s a lot of ways you can play around with that.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Exactly. Welcome to my world. That&#8217;s part of it. You know? I think that&#8217;s the big thing for me too. Just speaking frankly, the first logo I drew as a boy was the trefoil logo, the three leaves. Really not even realizing at the time that it was three leaves, but that&#8217;s one of the first logos I drew along with the Nottingham Forest kit because Adidas made the Nottingham Forest kit at the time my dad bought me. For me, it&#8217;s just a relationship with the brand like that is kind of coming home. Again, it&#8217;s a 70 year old brand, started in 1949 right here. So it&#8217;s really kind of an honor to be recruited to such a prestigious brand with a rich history and being trusted with kind of carrying that legacy forward. You know?</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     How has your role changed since you first started at Adidas?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Well, when I first got in, I was in creative direction. So the identity part wasn&#8217;t part of it. I came in under product really. So I worked with the SVP of design and the VP of design to kind of oversee a product across the brand. We&#8217;re set up a lot like other large sport brands where we&#8217;re broken up by sport, right? So each sport kind of creates its own product specialized to that sport and we oversee all of the graphic design that goes throughout those. My job is to build that graphic umbrella and we work, product wise, we work about two years out. Currently, we&#8217;re working on all winter &#8217;21.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Yeah. So you&#8217;ve got to be able to kind of forecast where you see the world going looking at trends, but not following them and then but at the same time, balancing that out with staying true to the culture of the actual brand. It&#8217;s really about looking out. That&#8217;s the most fun part for me was the fact that the role sits at the sweet spot of culture in between sport, music, art, film, food, travel. It&#8217;s right in the center of that and that&#8217;s where all of that art is created from. When I first came in, that was specifically my role. The role was a large role, I think for myself, but it got to be a bit&#8230; I&#8217;m very fidgety like most directors and graphic designers in general.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    So I needed more and in my spare time, I do a lot of kind of brandalism in my Instagram and my boss saw it and said, &#8220;Hey. You know you have like a passion for like logos and stuff. How do you feel about taking over this other team?&#8221; I thought, &#8220;Yeah, awesome.&#8221; Because there were some people in that other team that I really wanted to work with and it&#8217;s just been great. So I&#8217;ve been doing this role now for about a year and a half and with a really great team. My team are just the warmest group of people that I&#8217;ve probably ever worked with and we&#8217;re&#8230; Again we sit here in Germany, but we&#8217;re two Brits, two Argentines, one Portuguese, two Germans. It&#8217;s a nice diverse group and we just basically talk football, sports banter all day as we work.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     So how do you approach new projects given that one, the just sort of iconic stature of the brand and the logo and the fact that it sits at so many cultural intersections. You&#8217;re two years out. I&#8217;m just curious how you even concept for that amount of time and how you approach new projects.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Oh man, that&#8217;s the fun part. I think for myself, it&#8217;s crazy man. I gave a presentation a couple of weeks ago and I had to kind of look back at my career and think about how I do what I do and why I do what I do and something came to light. When you talk about how do you create new projects? I think it comes from never turning off. As a graphic designer, I saw someone, I cannot remember what doc I was watching, but someone was saying that they were describing the laundromat down the street with a really bad letter spacing. Right? That&#8217;s kind of how we see the world. It&#8217;s just part of never turning off. So I think the way that I always approach new projects and if you&#8217;re thinking about two years out, how do you forecast? Naturally drawn to socio-political, the arts and how it&#8217;s all connected, those are the things that I&#8217;m naturally interested in, in my spare time, so I&#8217;d just pour all of that into the work.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Also, we have a brilliant team of cultural trends and insights people, one of whom is my colleague Liz Callow. Upon coming into the brand, she and I got really, really close and she&#8217;s just all about insights, you know? My thing again, our job in graphic design is communication, right? Rather than decoration and embellishment. So what are we actually saying? What I get from her and from her team is, what are you saying? Right now, Muse is a 17 year old athlete, global. So what does their world look like? I love being able to look into this new world and juxtapose it against my own experience and just talk with as many people as I can and listen to as much as I can and imagine a world in the future, what tie graphic design to that? What does graphic expression look like? Just so we&#8217;re not stabbing in the dark and we&#8217;re making culturally, relevant, resonant graphic communication.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    I hope that answers the question.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     No, it does. I can only imagine how much research you have to do because it&#8217;s not just in the realm of athleticism. Like you say, you&#8217;re looking at sociopolitical issues, and art, and music and even other fashion or apparel brands. There&#8217;s a lot that you have to take in and sort of sift out what you think might be relevant. Two years from now, it just feels like that&#8217;s such a big&#8230; It&#8217;s a lot to think about.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    But you never turn off.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    You know what I mean? I think not everybody has such an easy time letting go of their heyday and understanding. I hear a lot of people my age lambaste the young and just say, &#8221; That&#8217;s not hip hop? What do you know about hip hop,&#8221; &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s not punk. In my day, we used to&#8230;&#8221; Well, that&#8217;s irrelevant. I love to listen to what the young ones are saying because my music pissed my dad off. Right? That&#8217;s their job. So it&#8217;s our job to kind of get over this hump and just accept the new things that are happening and create for that, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Yeah. So before Adidas you were kind of doing your own thing as a design consultant and an art director. Tell me what that time was like because I recently&#8230; Well two years ago or so, I was doing my own thing kind of as a studio and then went into kind of a full time job. So tell me about kind of what that transition was like for you.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Well, here&#8217;s the thing. After I left the music industry, I went into apparel and worked at a few street wear brands and hopped around here and that. That&#8217;s when I decided to do my own thing around 2006, 2007. That was great. For me, it was really about&#8230; I&#8217;m a very entrepreneurial mind, entrepreneurially minded with [inaudible 00:09:12] 10 jobs and that&#8217;s kind of the root of it. Always wants you to do my own thing and understand, before I was even had a chance to graduate, I had a job, right? I was in the industry working. Once I realized that it was a living, breathing industry and that I was part of something bigger, right? This ongoing conversation of graphic design, it gave me a little bit of companies to go out there and just do all of these, use my fidgety nature to my benefit and be able to do all of these projects, release things I was working on: movie posters, branding, product design, graphic design, tee shirts, posters and copywriting as well and caricatures and that sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    But it was the most fun time. I&#8217;d just wake up. We lived in Harlem at the time, so I would just on Eighth Avenue, sorry, Seventh Avenue and 138th Street and I&#8217;d wake up, play with my cat and just work. I&#8217;m a bit of an early bird, so I&#8217;d be up every morning just cranking stuff out. It was great because I was in no meetings, no summits, no meetings about meetings. It was pure work. That&#8217;s when Nike came into the picture and they were my pretty much my biggest client from that point. I got the chance to do some really kind of fulfilling work with those guys at that time too. Yeah, doing my own thing. Then I went in house there, came, then I left in around 2015, moved back to New York and then again, was just bouncing around doing my own thing and freelancing here and that, which is when Adidas came calling. Within a couple of months, we were here in Southern Germany.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Was it a big shift? Well, granted I&#8217;m sure it was a big shift just geographically from New York to Germany, but going from that sort of freewheeling, entrepreneurial kind of thing and now being part of a regimented sort of nine to five corporate structure. How did you adjust to that?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    I was ready. You know? I speak to a lot of people who do freelance and have their own little shops and after a couple of years, you can get cabin fever. You get a pain in the ass of dealing with a bunch of different creatives and marketing and meetings. You&#8217;re a bit more numb to it. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;I&#8217;ll deal with that.&#8221; Because it&#8217;s all give and take.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Right? Because on the corporate side, you have the obvious to deal with. But then all of the solo side, your time is basically split up in three sections, right? Chasing new business, doing the work, and then chasing payment for the work that you&#8217;ve already done. So you&#8217;re never really turning off. It is a benefit that you have your destiny in your hands. However, with the corporate side where it&#8217;s a gig, it&#8217;s kind of give and take. You have your good days, you have your bad days, but then you have that security that you have there as well. So that was the big difference for me.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     It can be a trade off. I remember when I stopped doing my studio, I did my studio for nine years, and then I started at the place where I&#8217;m currently at, at Glitch and it was interesting how from&#8230; Some of it was from my peers, but I think also it was just some folks here in the Atlanta design community who thought that I sort of failed in a way. [crosstalk 00:12:17] Like, &#8220;Oh, you were doing your own thing.&#8221; Because there&#8217;s the whole culture around you, &#8220;We sleep, they grind, hustle hard.&#8221; If you&#8217;re doing your own thing, you&#8217;re your own boss and now you&#8217;re back at the plantation. That sort of thing. [crosstalk 00:12:31]</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    I know where that comes from, but that&#8217;s romanticism, man. There&#8217;s something to be said for being part of something. You know what I mean? It&#8217;s all give and take. It&#8217;s the same thing at the end of the day. Whatever you&#8217;re doing is going towards something. Being your own boss is great, but it&#8217;s not as easy as one would like. I think about New York, the amount of tax that you pay, you&#8217;re really discouraged from doing that. You know what I mean? You really can&#8217;t get a foothold. I know someone, I met someone the other day who&#8217;s moving to Ghent to start his studio because he loves it, right? He&#8217;s from London, but he&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Hey, listen man. Belgium&#8217;s got a nice little city and it&#8217;s a bit remote, but like I can do what I do and they have a creative community. I&#8217;m going there,&#8221; you know?</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Yeah. You&#8217;ve already touched on a few things that I want to dive more into. You briefly mentioned music career. You briefly mentioned Nike. So I want to talk about those things. But first I want to just kind of go back because I&#8230; Of course, we said this before you recorded. I&#8217;m picking up on the British accent. You&#8217;ve mentioned sort of bouncing around. Talk to me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    I was born in &#8217;71 in a place called Edmondson about 40 minutes outside of the city and it&#8217;s North London. It&#8217;s just up from Tottenham, in &#8217;71 and yeah. My dad was an engineer, my mom&#8217;s a clerk. My younger sister and older brother just grew up playing football. Football was like my life. I was telling people the other day that I had three loves. It was drawing, football and drawing football. So if I wasn&#8217;t playing it, I was watching it. If I wasn&#8217;t watching it, I was drawing it. It was my religion and that&#8217;s wall kind of took up all my time. It was a really progressive time for kids; late seventies, early eighties was a really progressive time for kids in England and there were just countless television series that were saying that, &#8220;You can do anything you want with a little bit of effort. You can be whoever you want to be.&#8221; That was what they told us as kids.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    At that time, there were a lot of people in their late twenties who were punks that were writing all these books for children and making all these television series for children. There was one in particular called, &#8220;Fungus the Bogeyman .&#8221; They&#8217;ve since then made a live action version of it, but the original one was about this fictional family of ghouls that lived under the city in grime and they would eat disgusting things and things rhymed. It was completely disgusting and I discovered this around the age of like eight and nine and me and my friends absolutely loved it. That was the thing that really taught me about form and content because this world that they lived in, the way that it was illustrated was messy and dirty and grimy. I was like, &#8220;Wow, okay. This is how they&#8217;d get that world across, is it looks like what it is.&#8221; So very subtly, it was kind of teaching me those things.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     So it sounds like you sort of got exposed to design kind of early on in that way.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Very early on. I like to say my career started at age six because my parents, I think with my dad particularly. I was just always in front of the television, but with my dad, I just really bonded around words. If I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Hey dad, why? What does this word mean?&#8221; He&#8217;d say, &#8220;Well, look it up and you come and tell me.&#8221; So from then, even to this day, we still call each other with, &#8220;Hey, I heard this word the other day,&#8221; that kind of thing. So that&#8217;s what kind of introduced me to the language that we use. I was always watching television commercials. I loved the supermarket. It was my favorite place to go just to look at all of the packaging and like, again, before you even know what logos or packaging or branding is or are, you&#8217;re just immersed in it.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    So it&#8217;s just naturally where I went, but I think the thing that really drove it home for me was football because around that time, like 1980, 1981 is when, not only names on the back of the jersey&#8230; Names weren&#8217;t on the back of jerseys yet. There was only a number, but on the front there were sponsors and in Britain, there was a natural reticence to brand things, right? So there was a real big push back to sponsors on jerseys. But in 1981, &#8217;82 was when it just kind of exploded and that&#8217;s when you started seeing logos, not just on the sideboard of the pitch, but on the jerseys across the stomach. They were these really like super intricate logos and Panasonic, Candy, JVC, and I think that&#8217;s what thought that was it for me.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     When did you first know that, I guess, design was something that you could do for a living?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Oh man. Let me think about that because in high school&#8230; I went to high school in Yonkers, Yonkers, New York, which is where like the Locks and Mary J. Blige and DMX are from. I went to high school with both of those guys.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    But around that time, I had a guidance counselor when I was in the art program at school, again around that time, 1988, 1987 everything else that happened in the US in the sixties and seventies happened in Yonkers in the eighties. So the government kind of stepped in and said, &#8220;Look, your school system is completely segregated and we&#8217;re going to have to mix it up.&#8221; So they basically created magnet schools. Same thing they&#8217;ve done around the country where each school would have a different vocation and you would get college credits for attending each school and this is how they were able to integrate the schools. However, that first year was pretty, pretty tough. The signs with, &#8220;Go home,&#8221; and all the rest of it, we had to kind of endure. But by 12th grade, that had all kind of calmed down.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    I had a guidance counselor who basically said&#8230; Again, that magnet school was around fine arts, so I&#8217;m taking fine art AP classes all through. My guidance counselor said, &#8220;Hey, there&#8217;s no money in art, so you want to go into architecture.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;All right, fine.&#8221; So my first year in university, I&#8217;m in architecture and I just absolutely despised it. It was the worst. I was like I don&#8217;t care about foundations and sedimentary rock. I don&#8217;t care. I want to draw. So I transferred over to the graphic design department, which at the time was called commercial art. I thought [inaudible 00:18:24] just made me cringe, you know? It gradually it became graphic design, but that was it.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    As soon as I moved into that department, it just opened up a completely new world and I started learning about Paul Rand, Paula Scher, George Lois, and other little luminaries in the field following a young Stefan Sagmeister and really understanding what an art movement was and the importance of graphic design and art to society. That&#8217;s when I really found that out. But I think the graphic design bug really hit me during my first internship. I was interning at Jive Records at the time that they were doing, &#8220;Midnight Marauders, &#8221; A Tribe Called Quest [crosstalk 00:19:00] the art direct there was a guy named Nick Gamut and just watching him wo-</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    [inaudible 00:19:00] There was a guy named Nick Gamma. And just watching him work in Photoshop&#8230; I think it was Photoshop Two. No layers.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     No layers?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Yeah, no layers and one undo.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Woo.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Right. Do you want to save some copies? You better save 10 versions of the file on your desktop.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Oh, man.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Those were the days. Those were the days. Yeah. When I saw this dude working in Photoshop and Illustrator, I was like, &#8220;Oh, my God.&#8221; That was it. That was it for me. And that&#8217;s when I knew, I was like, okay, this is what I want to do all day, every day, you know? And then my second internship right after that was at the Source Magazine. And working with Chi Modu&#8230; And Chris, the art director there was just another, just massive learning. Just sitting in the office and Tupac walks by, and it&#8217;s just one of those experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Wow. So you really got to be there at this, really, you&#8217;re at this like, really pivotal point of design and music and culture. Wow. I can&#8217;t imagine just how dope that must&#8217;ve been.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Yeah, it was great. Man. I mean, there was another guy who was ahead of me. He&#8217;s like, again, iconic, Cey Adams. He worked at the drawing board.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    And just again, being a black dude, you want to see yourself represented. And he was an Elder. Him and another guy, [Ebon Ese 00:01:19] was the art director at Triple Five Soul. These dudes were just insane graphic designers and it just pushed me to do the best that I could, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Yeah. I remember being exposed to those brands and things really through magazines. I mean, I grew up in rural Alabama, so we had nothing. Like, no mall, no movie theater.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     I mean, we had television but didn&#8217;t have cable. So like, the things that we were exposed to were extremely limited. And I just remember kind of living out my fantasies through magazines. There were so many magazines. I mean, The Source, Vibe&#8230; I mean, there were like, kids&#8217; magazines, like Zillions, Sports Illustrated stuff&#8230; But there were even like black magazines like Y S B, Emerge, Ebony, of course&#8230; Jet. And like, these were things that kind of expanded my horizons as to like, there are all of these possibilities out there. And there are people that look like this, that don&#8217;t look like the people in my town. And to be at a place where you&#8217;re really documenting and controlling that, and portraying it. Wow. I just, that&#8217;s just seems like such a pivotal time to really be a designer.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    It really was, man. And you know, what&#8217;s the crazy part about it, the thing that it taught me, and looking back, because again, I think we&#8217;re past the romantic era, right? Where people of my generation and the people a little bit older than me, are telling the youngers like, &#8220;Yeah, we did this,&#8221; and kind of making myths about themselves. Because we didn&#8217;t know what we were doing. Right? Like, we were just doing it because it was cool, and we enjoyed it. Then it became something, it was like, gained like, a larger cultural footprint. But I do feel really fortunate to have been there at a time when you could basically take your portfolio, and just go knock on the door of a brand and talk to a creative person. And you don&#8217;t get routed through HR. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    It was a really, really fortunate time. And I remember it was super pivotal, because when I got hired as a junior designer at Arista Records, within a year, our entire mechanical room was gone. We had a full staff of mechanical artists who basically put albums together the old way, with the acetate and the burners type, Xerox machine and the non-repro blue pencil, and the stack machine. Like, I use all of that stuff very early on, and I feel fortunate to have learned it the analog way. And then within a year everyone had a Mac. And even though we had one undo in Illustrator, it was still Illustrator.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     So, talk more about that time at Arista records. Because you were there for like, about seven years, right? What do you remember from last time?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Oh, man. It was great. It was so mad. It was bugged out. So, just in how I got the job. Again man, it was such a time. And I find design now is quite tribal and kind of insular in the big places. And it&#8217;s just kind of groups of people who know each other and networks of, it can be that way. And I think the young ones are opening that up a little bit. But back then when, I was looking for my first full-time job, after having two internships in my school and not really having that many connections after work. I am going to do this myself. So I gathered all of my albums and went to the back of it.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    You know on the back. Usually there was like, the copyright line would give you the address. And sometimes it had the phone number, but if not then I would have to go to this thing called the phone book and look up the phone numbers and stuff. So I remember I had a list of like, maybe 28 companies, and I remember getting all the way to the bottom, calling each one and saying, &#8220;My name&#8217;s Anthony Harrison. I&#8217;m a graphic design student. I just want some experience. Paying or not paying, fine. I just want the experience.&#8221; Most people were really encouraging and polite. I remember getting to the bottom, and there were three left, and Arista was one of the three. I thought, &#8220;All right. Well, I may as well continue.&#8221; And I called Arista, and basically, the art director there at the time, this woman Susan Mendola said, &#8220;Hey, you know we&#8217;re looking for a junior designer because we just signed a bunch of subsidiary labels. Why don&#8217;t you come in?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Now, at the time when she said that and I was walking into the office, I didn&#8217;t know that those labels were Bad Boy, Rowdy and LaFace. So when I got there, I was like, &#8220;Oh, okay. Cool.&#8221; And it was really funny because I got the usual thing that I get at job interviews, where you call over the phone&#8230; This happens when I&#8217;m looking for apartments sometimes as well&#8230; Like, you call people over the phone, and you open the door, and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, Mr. Harrison.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Yeah, is the job still open?&#8221; But the great thing about that experience was that that wasn&#8217;t the case. You know, she was basically like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;, One of the things that I said was like, &#8220;Look, I know you&#8217;ve signed these labels. But I don&#8217;t want to get pigeonholed into doing all the R and B and hip-hop. I want to do everything, because I&#8217;m into everything.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    And they were like, &#8220;All right, cool.&#8221; So as a junior designer, man, it was just like, it was like the Karate Kid. I got to learn in the trenches under like some really great designers. I had a boss named [Angela Scluris 00:06:02], and she was an art director formerly from Rolling Stone. She&#8217;s done just, iconic work. I learned so much from her about typography and composition. And [Mop Bodet 00:06:13] was another one of my bosses. He came over from Sony. Those times when you&#8217;re stuck on something and you go to your boss and you say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m stuck here.&#8221; And they don&#8217;t give you the answer, they show you the path to the answer. You get what I mean? It&#8217;s that kind of, give a man a fishing rod, give him a fish, whatever the analogy is&#8230; Teach him how to fish, or give him a fish kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    So being there as a junior designer, I&#8217;ve got to work on Annie Lennox, Kenny G, really kind of high profile. Patti Smith, stuff like that. And then when I became an art director, I was able to work on Whitney Houston, Waiting to Exhale, Monica, and Brandy, some of Monica&#8217;s solo stuff, Goodie Mob. My colleague in the office next to me did all the Outkast stuff. So we were working on Goodie Mob and Outkast at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    We also did a lot of the TLC stuff. So all this stuff. Basically, for the seven years that I was there, Arista was the top-grossing label in the industry. And it was just this building on West 57th street, like right around the corner from Trump Tower. So it was 7 West 57th street, right on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th street. So I would drive into the city every day down the Westside Park by the river, and walk through this mass of people every morning just to get to work.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    But it was seven like, fantastic years of really learning. Back in those days when you were an art director, you were a proper art director. You did everything. And I was really fortunate to be there at that time. And I was 23, and I thought, &#8220;I&#8217;m a junior designer. And by the time I&#8217;m 29, I want to be an art director. So I&#8217;m going to work my ass off to get there.&#8221; And then the next year, they promoted me to art director. So it was one of those &#8220;All right. Now what?&#8221; situations.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     You were so young, working for such iconic artists like that.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, you were in the elevator and like Freddie Smith, Freddie Jackson gets in. And you&#8217;re like, okay [inaudible 00:26:58] just walked by. Yeah, at an early age.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Wow, wow. And like, I know that was like, early nineties then when this went on, right?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Yep. &#8217;93. &#8217;93 I got hired.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     So this was after like, the big Milli Vanilli scandal with Arista.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Yeah, exactly. Yeah, the record industry was still reeling from that, but you know, there was, they&#8217;d been getting away with murder for years, so they got over that really quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Now, aside from just being a designer in the music industry, you are also a recording artist.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Yes, yes. So again, as a football was my religion as a boy. Track and field. I loved track and fields, and sports was my life. And moving to New York, it just wasn&#8217;t available. It was&#8230; The last thing on my mind was sports. It was really kind of adapting to this new place and fighting every day because, I think there was a myth. People who&#8217;d watched a lot of Benny Hill, and they thought &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re going to pick on the English boy.&#8221; Because they&#8217;d watched a lot of like, Oliver Twist. They had no idea that we used to fight in London more than them. So you kind of set the record straight.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Part of my survival tactic was to really immerse myself in music. And around that time, I hated rap because I was just like, at the time it was like, Sugarhill Gang and Furious Five and all that stuff. And the first time I&#8217;d heard that was when all these like, English pop groups were kind of taking it off. So Adam and the Ants was one of my favorite bands, and they did like, Ant Rap. And that&#8217;s what I associated with. But by 1985, I heard Sucker MC&#8217;s by Run-DMC. And then, a little bit after that &#8220;Slow and Low by the Beastie Boys. And they were both produced by Rick Ruben. And that for me was like, the future. And that&#8217;s when I started kind of writing. When I heard Slick Rick, it was just like, &#8220;Okay, this is future music.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    So that&#8217;s when I started writing. So it was just always a hobby from that time. And then when I was an art director at Arista, I still performing at the time. At night, just on the underground circuit with Shabaam Sahdeeq, Modal Technique, [inaudible 00:09:57]. Like, I&#8217;m going to forget all the names. It was like, the New York city underground rap scene, the Juggernauts, the Company Flow guys, all those guys who were all part of the, of the New York City underground. And I ended up getting a deal from that. So during the day I would work for Arista, and at night I would record my album for MCA. So I did that for about two years. You know, worked on the album. And it was a lot of fun, but it came to a point where I had to really decide what do I want to do, do I want design or do I want music?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    And again, when you work at a record label, you understand how the sausage is made. So this whole thing about being a star and being famous and making hits to me was just like womp, womp, womp. I couldn&#8217;t care less. I wanted to create art. And when I got signed&#8230; The first thing they do when they sign you is like, &#8220;We think you&#8217;re great,&#8221; and immediately they want to turn you into something else. So at that time, it just happened that everyone was a hard rock and hip-hop. And they were like, &#8220;Yeah, we want you to make some harder stuff.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not what I do. I make funny stuff. I make political stuff like. And that&#8217;s just not what I&#8217;m going to do.&#8221; So the choice was really easy and I decided to just go into art and graphic design full time.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    I&#8217;m really happy as a fan these days, of music.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     So I&#8217;m curious, is your album like, on streaming services? Can people listen to it?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    It&#8217;s funny. There&#8217;s a lot of it on YouTube. Just like, the live radio shows. So there was an iconic radio show out of New York City, out of the NYU by Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito. And they&#8217;ve actually got a documentary about it on Netflix. But I was a guest on there several times with my friends Breezly Bruin and Juggernauts, and with Organized Confusion. We were on there together. So on there with my MC partner at the time, [inaudible 00:11:37]. But those videos are all over YouTube. They&#8217;re just audio. But yeah, I held my own.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Okay. All right. So after your time at Arista, you worked for Mecca, which is a streetwear brand. And I mean, I&#8217;m not going to lie, I rocked Mecca hard around that time. Like, mostly thanks to Vibe magazine and&#8230; God, where do I get my Mecca stuff from? We had a store called On Time Fashions, and I honestly, I believe some of it was probably bootleg, but I wore anyway because it was the only place you could get it. But you&#8217;re like, you&#8217;d see it in the ad and then it&#8217;s in the store. And it&#8217;s like, why would they be shipping to rural Alabama? It doesn&#8217;t make any sense.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    You&#8217;d be surprised. They ship everywhere. Like, when we talked to our sales team, our sales team knows about all of the spots across the country. You&#8217;d be really surprised, man. They go everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     What was it like shifting from music to apparel that way? Was that kind of your first time working in that industry?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    It was. It was. So a friend of mine, Alioscha, he ran a brand called Alphanumeric, and the sister brand was Mecca. So the sister brand Alphanumeric was all skate and snow. It was like, super cutting-edge, and they were based in San Diego. And Mecca was based in New York and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, I need an art director. So come on in.&#8221; So this is where, as I mentioned before, as an art director for a record label, you could take care of your artist from soup to nuts. So you meet with them. You go to the studio. You develop their logo. You speak with their management. You talk about them about their lyrics and then work with them. So you&#8217;re really building them along the way. And all the way down to TV spots, video shoots, and the rest of it.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    So I found being in the apparel industry, I found making myself useful pretty easy. So I worked on graphic design for Mecca when I first got in, but then I just started doing all of the ads and a lot of the packaging. And then T-shirt graphics, and then kind of copywriting and that sort of thing. So, it was fun at the time. And that&#8217;s actually where I met my wife. So, she was an intern at the time, in the women&#8217;s department. And then she would assist me on photo shoots. And we just celebrated our 19th anniversary the other day.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Yeah, yeah. I like to say I took her on full time.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     That&#8217;s an interesting way to put it. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Her fingerprints are all over pretty much everything I do.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    We have that kind of a creative relationship where anything I&#8217;m doing, I&#8217;m always kind of getting input. And she knows me like a book, so kind of serves as a mirror.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     And now, after Mecca you went and did work for Akademiks. Was it a big shift?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    It wasn&#8217;t actually. I&#8217;ll tell you what was cool about that, was that Mecca was, this was the great thing, like back in those days, and my wife actually tells the story. She was at FIT, the Fashion Institute of Technology. And when you would go to&#8230; See, and I&#8217;ll backtrack a little bit. During my high school years, rap music, you have to understand, those same circumstances around busing. Right? Think about it. This is where rap music came from. You know, we as people of color was shut out of mainstream art and mainstream culture. We weren&#8217;t wanted at Studio 54, right? So we went and created our own thing. So by my high school time, we were still being told as kids like, &#8220;What you&#8217;re doing isn&#8217;t music,&#8221; right? Like, &#8220;Your fashion is not real fashion.&#8221; So when my wife was at school, she was told by fashion teachers that, &#8220;This urban thing you&#8217;re doing isn&#8217;t real. You guys basically wear what we make for the mainstream. So it was not really real.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    By the time Akademiks came around, everyone knew it was something. And you know, it was euphemistically called urban, when it was actually streetwear in its prime. But it was really funny to see brands that kind of separated themselves and said, &#8220;We&#8217;re not urban. We&#8217;re streetwear.&#8221; It was just this silly, silly mind-</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Yeah. That&#8217;s an interesting distinction.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Yeah, it&#8217;s ridiculous. It&#8217;s ridiculous. It&#8217;s using one euphemism to cover another. But by the time Akademiks came around, my boss&#8230; It was owned two-thirds by the boss, right? Who&#8217;s a Black man, Don Juan Harrell from Virginia Beach. And when I came in, I came in as senior art director, and then was promoted to design manager. But I always had my hands in the work, and I have to say my time in Akademiks is probably one of the best jobs I&#8217;ve ever had.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    We were given complete creative control because our boss knew that we knew who we were making things for. Like, if we wanted to see who was buying our clothes, we could just go right out front and look at them. And you could see them. You take the train with them in the morning. Like, we live amongst who are consumer is. And they&#8217;re like, the next generation. They were younger people than us. So we knew what they wanted. And I think one thing that we were able to do with all of our themes, play these double entendres. So we were able to play Mainstream Americana, which is the stuff that we came up on. We came up on Nautica, Polo, and all those kinds of Eastern seaboard brands and like, along with like, Head and Prince. All these super preppy brands that weren&#8217;t made for us, that we would wear just because they weren&#8217;t made for us. All this like, super preppy [inaudible 00:16:37], like those kinds of brands.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    We were able to juxtapose all of that imagery against street culture. So for example, we would do, we were all into like, Americana, right? We all loved plaids and denim and work boots. So we did a whole theme around lumberjacks, right? But if you&#8217;re doing a lumberjack theme for the hood, we called it Big Papermakers, right? And we did these caricatures and that. So it was always like, a little chipmunk that says like, &#8220;Stack your chips for a rainy day.&#8221; Stuff like that. [inaudible 00:36:07] speak in these two different languages, which just, it was so much fun. And you know, our boss basically would protect us as a design team. So we basically had about three meetings with sales a year, where sales would give us their input. &#8220;Here&#8217;s what sold. Here&#8217;s what didn&#8217;t. And here&#8217;s why we think this was the case.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    And then for us, we were basically just designing all the time. Putting the work up on the board, collaborating, working in different teams. We&#8217;d have music going all day and it was like death metal, reggae, salsa, Afrobeat, comedy albums, podcasts, like yeah&#8230; Fun, fun stuff. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     So, speaking of this double entendre, I&#8217;m going to show you a photo. And for people listening, I&#8217;ll put this photo in the show notes as well so you all can see it. But I&#8217;m going to show you this photo. First, I want you to describe the photo to the audience, and then second, I want you to tell me the story behind this campaign and the feedback. So I want you to look at this photo now. I&#8217;m showing it to you.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Ah, yes. All right. I remember this. So this is an attractive young lady with a lot of like, specialized like, ripped-up denim and some like, some short-cut denim shorts, sitting very neatly with her legs crossed, kind of in a fifties pose. Looking straight at the viewer, and she&#8217;s sitting on the lap of a man reading a book who&#8217;s paying no attention to her. And he&#8217;s sitting on a pile of about maybe 80 books. Says &#8220;Akademiks, genius level products, read books, get [inaudible 00:37:37].&#8221; So this was a campaign, and I cannot remember what year this was. I think it was 2003. So one of the things that we were always trying to play with Akademiks was subversion. And we understood that the audience that we were talking to understands and appreciates the coded language that we use, right? So like for example, &#8220;Stack your chips.&#8221; Like, &#8220;big paper makers.&#8221; We got another one that&#8217;s like &#8220;classic material,&#8221; and we spelled classic-</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Yeah, we have another one that&#8217;s like classic material and we spelled classic with a C K at the end, like that stuff to play on [inaudible 00:00:06]. They understood that, right? So we thought we&#8217;re about academics and at the end of the day academics was about learning. That&#8217;s what the brand was about. So we thought wouldn&#8217;t it be great because when you look at so many of these acts, they&#8217;re shamelessly selling sex. And when we were looking at culture at the time, at this time, Jay Z was the biggest hero of all of those young people. And the first thing that you would &#8230; If you just grab a kid off the street and you&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Why is [inaudible 00:38:34] the greatest MC ever?&#8221; And they&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Because he&#8217;s smart.&#8221; And it was the first time that we were looking at modern hip hop culture and saying like, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it cool that it&#8217;s cooler and more desirable to be smart than it is to be hard?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    And that we&#8217;ve really actually progressed and that the idea of the nerd doesn&#8217;t really exist anymore. Not like it used to. So that&#8217;s kind of where this idea came from. Read books, get brain. If you read, you get smarter, but also plays on the sexual term of it. And we knew that those kids would understand that was a joke. If you read books, you get smarter. And again, it&#8217;s just coded language for those who know, get it. So what happened was, this was really funny, when this came out, this was on billboards, it was in ads and it was everywhere. Now you know that before these things go out to the general public, they have to go through your own attorneys. They have to go through your own marketing department. So we presented this, I presented this to the team and to the brand broader and everyone knew about it.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Towards the end of the run, some reporter from I think it was the Daily News had seen a train ad and someone on her staff had actually told her what get brain meant as a term that&#8217;s been used in all these songs. So then they come out with this ad and it says like, &#8220;Street Wear company is selling sex to kids.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;These kids are hyper-sexualized. I don&#8217;t know what world you live in.&#8221; That&#8217;s what this is about. It&#8217;s about reading. So again, it&#8217;s cheeky, but we knew what it was. So it was really funny because I got to work that morning and my boss hadn&#8217;t gotten there yet. My boss didn&#8217;t usually get in until around 10:00 AM but all of the office shoots were there just like hand wringing about it.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    &#8220;Anthony, did you talk to them about this?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yeah, yeah, I did.&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have to have a meeting when [inaudible 00:40:23] gets in because you don&#8217;t talk to the press.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;No. I told him exactly what it was. You guys saw it.&#8221; So then we start getting calls from channel two, channel four, channel seven, New York Times, USA Today. They all want to come by for interviews. When my boss got in and my boss was like, &#8220;What&#8217;s the problem? This is great. Anthony put on a shirt because you&#8217;re going to do some interviews.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    It was great because I got to meet Carlos [inaudible 00:40:48] who is like a New York legend journalist and he was working for the New York Times at the time. I think he was a former Latin King. He may have been. I may be off about that, but anyway, he was a big community activist and journalist, and I met him that day and it was such an honor. But for that all to come through this ad was actually really, really funny and I got so many phone calls for this. I also got a few death threats for this, as well. Someone called me on my office phone and shared that I&#8217;d set black people back and I was just like, &#8220;Are you out of your mind?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     What? From a clothing ad?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Again, you think about what year this was. Think about where we are now. This whole fury around being knee jerk reactions and having something to be offended by was just starting. But yeah, it turned out to be a lovely piece of subversion for me. Now would I do this today? Probably not because this is not the climate for it. But yeah, but at the time it was good.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Wow, that is wild. I mean I think one thing it speaks to just the power of design. The fact that something that was so kind of cheeky and clearly spoke to the audience of the brand ends up getting misconstrued in some way. And I think we see that a lot anyway with advertising, although it&#8217;s not as clever as this. It&#8217;d be much more &#8230; I guess I&#8217;d use the term hamfisted in a way.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     I remember specifically seeing this, it was an ad. This may have been several years ago, it was the ad for pop chips with Ashton Kutcher and Brown Face. And it&#8217;s like the dumbest thing. It&#8217;s not clever in any sort of way. It&#8217;s just a really ugly, bad stereotype slash caricature.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    [inaudible 00:42:30] because again, it can quickly go cheap. And the funny thing is that you&#8217;ll hear from really poor marketing people sometimes is sex sells. The fact that people still say that, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Okay and more sex sells. So why don&#8217;t we put breasts in an ad if that&#8217;s the case and just put a logo on it.&#8221; It&#8217;s ridiculous. It&#8217;s ridiculous. You know, I&#8217;ll say, too, to that point, there&#8217;s a lot &#8230; I hear this, this debate all the time about art and commerce and between design and marketing and how there&#8217;s this natural friction between the two. I don&#8217;t think many of those conflicts don&#8217;t come from the natural conflict. They really come from just poor ideas, cheap ideas. They come from laziness and apathy.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     So to that end, what do you think is &#8230; If you could distill this down to a few things, what do you think are the most important skills that a designer or a creative person really needs to have in this current climate?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Oh, man. I think number one is objectivity. Well, before that even a hunger. You can&#8217;t force someone to want to know. You&#8217;ve got to have a hunger to know what&#8217;s current and to join the conversation. Understand that the graphic design and creativity in general, you&#8217;re not just making something new, you&#8217;re joining a conversation of something has probably been approached before. So if you want it to be relevant and to mean something and to actually match it, you&#8217;ve got to know about that conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    But then secondly after just kind of curiosity and wanting to do, you&#8217;ve got to understand objectivity. And really I feel like design, graphic designers, is an anonymous job. If you&#8217;ve really done your job, no one knows you&#8217;re there. You are able to kind of compose this thing that communicates something. A lot of it is manipulation, visual manipulation, but you&#8217;ve got to be objective, and I&#8217;ve found a lot of people just lost their jobs or lost sight of what their job is and I&#8217;ll share this. At work for instance, this happened at a few different jobs I&#8217;ve had. You&#8217;ll find people who are more interested in the rules than creating something new. And I think this is the ultimate lazy thing that people do is revert to the rules.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Oh, my God. Yeah, I&#8217;ve definitely been there where things get so stuck in process and rules that it&#8217;s like you don&#8217;t even get a chance to make anything.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    [inaudible 00:44:50] starts at no. And if you think about your viewing public, they have a wide choice today. So they would just go elsewhere. But yeah, I think the most important thing for you to have right now is objectivity. Complete objectivity, especially in such a changing world and a changing climate. Everything is completely new. So you can&#8217;t apply your old rules to whatever is kind of emerging now and becoming the new.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     What inspires you these days?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Oh, man. Everything. Everything. Honestly, those who came before me and those were coming after me. I&#8217;m able to look back at old stuff. I was watching that Shane [inaudible 00:45:27] documentary the other day, the Rick Ruben documentary and someone in there picked up an old album cover and they said that it was an album of his from, I believe it may have been as late as 68, but he was the first person to use the term hip hop and it&#8217;s right there on the cover. Stuff like that just blows me away. When I think about, I went the other day to see the Kubrick exhibit at the design museum in London. I could&#8217;ve just hid in the corner and just kind of tried to sleep over. It was one of those, I just felt like a six year old. That stuff just inspires me.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Seeing that some of these sets that I&#8217;ve seen, like Full Metal Jacket, that Vietnam scene was actually London. Yeah. They bombed the barracks and flew in Palm trees. But then, virtually, a lot of the stuff that the young ones are doing now, so like Tomboy, that series. So HBO. Euphoria is another one. Just the way it&#8217;s written because for me graphic design is about people. That&#8217;s it, right? It&#8217;s about who&#8217;s on the other end. It&#8217;s not about the rules, it&#8217;s not about the corporate slogan. It&#8217;s about connecting with people and making something for people. So I find myself watching a lot of television and film and reading a lot. I read a lot of crime novels, as well. Yeah. People is it.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Yeah. So when you look at your career, you&#8217;ve worked at Street Wear Brands, you worked in the music industry, you&#8217;re currently still working with apparel, footwear, and stuff like that. How would you compare being one of the few black designers in a place like say Nike in the US? Portland is a very non black city. With like being one of the few at Adidas where you&#8217;re at in Germany.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Yeah. It&#8217;s weird. It&#8217;s really weird. You know what&#8217;s funny? The move from New York City to Nuremberg, Germany felt closer than the move from New York City to Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     In what way?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    I feel more welcome in Germany than I do in Portland, Oregon. I&#8217;ll tell you that much. When you walk down the center of the city on a Saturday afternoon and people cross the street. It&#8217;s real. It&#8217;s very real. I mean, [inaudible 00:47:41] likens it to the boogeyman, being the boogeyman. You go places and people are scared of you. They think you&#8217;re going to harm them. So carrying that around, I don&#8217;t feel any of that here. You know what I mean? I go into stores, people don&#8217;t bother you. They don&#8217;t follow you. Police don&#8217;t mess with me. It&#8217;s very, very different. Now that&#8217;s the city. But in terms of inside the organizations, it&#8217;s the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    It&#8217;s the exact same thing. It&#8217;s the same thing that you come up against, which is again, which I think to myself where objectivity helps me is I like to kind of look at my experience through the lens of being a woman. What my own biases might be, the things that I grew up with, and how to handle it, and objectivity helps me every time. I put it this way. There was an England Bulgaria match the other day and England beat Bulgaria six nil at their own stadium. And there were monkey chants all the way through to the point where they had to stop the match a couple of times. They had to stop the match because England in the start in 11 I think England had six black players and two biracial. Something like that. And that&#8217;s just the way it is.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    So when I was a kid and my dad used to take me to matches, the home fans would boo our black players. And then pat me on the head and say to my dad, &#8220;Oh, you got a lovely little kid there. Isn&#8217;t he great? How you doing, little man? You all right?&#8221; And be super friendly. So having that understanding of it allows me to work in these environments and just you&#8217;ve got to bob and weave and I put myself out there. I&#8217;m an individual who speaks up and I&#8217;m not sensational about it, but I just feel like I have a duty for those who come after me to speak up when I see things no matter what it cost me and I&#8217;ve done it, so I don&#8217;t intend to stop no matter what it costs me.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Now as I was doing my research, I saw that this was an interview you did with the hundreds almost 10 years ago actually. And you talk about that you sort of wanted to try your hand at doing food packaging or writing or illustrating a children&#8217;s book. Are you still interested in those kinds of projects or is there another dream project you&#8217;d like to do?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Yeah, absolutely. I think the children&#8217;s book thing is just something I&#8217;ve always wanted to do. Actually my first internship before [inaudible 00:49:54] records was a children&#8217;s book illustrator on the Upper West side named Barbara Roman. So I used to assist her, but that was when I still had a life. I was like, &#8220;Wow, this is the life. I get to draw and then go see your publisher and again advance. I can do this.&#8221; But just in terms of what it means to children, that&#8217;s the thing for me to. It&#8217;s still a dream of mine I haven&#8217;t done yet. In terms of writing, I&#8217;ve been doing a little bit of writing. I&#8217;ve been practicing. Design is a little bit different. So writing fiction is good. I&#8217;m dabbling in it here and there, but I think my biggest dream project right now that I&#8217;m actually working on is brandilism.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    So on my Instagram I do a lot of that. So I like to say that during the day I create logos and in the evening I destroy them. So sometimes they&#8217;re jokes, sometimes they&#8217;re politically motivated. Sometimes they&#8217;re just an opinion on something. But I like to &#8230; Sometimes it&#8217;s just don&#8217;t make myself laugh or make my friends laugh. But every day I post something because I have to make something that isn&#8217;t briefed. I come home and I make something every night and I posted this thing. So what I&#8217;m doing is making a book of all of it with a couple of interviews with kind of luminaries from the field to people who I admire or have worked with over the years. And I&#8217;m hoping to put that out by the new year.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     At this stage in your, in your career, in your life really, what does success look like for you?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    It&#8217;s funny, it&#8217;s actually a big question. At my age now you start looking back and you think like &#8230; So I got introduced the other day when they introduced me, they were talking about my work and it was a bit embarrassing. If you&#8217;re British, pretty much everything is an opportunity to be embarrassed, but it was a bit cringe-worthy. But then I thought about it and I thought, for me, I have an old boss of mine, Katie Tish, really told me a lot. I owe her a debt of gratitude all through my career. I just had people who looked out, people were like &#8230; Once they knew that you were hungry, they were like, &#8220;Hey, come here, let me show you this.&#8221; So what she said was I feel like I haven&#8217;t done my best work yet and that&#8217;s exactly how I feel.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Success for me feels like giving something back, which I&#8217;m able to do now. Nothing is more rewarding for me than to sit with my team and one of them come to me and go, &#8220;Anthony, look, I&#8217;ve got this thing here that I&#8217;m working on, but look at the S. God. I can&#8217;t get in the middle of that S right. What would you do?&#8221; Being able to just help someone with something as simple as that for me is just the most rewarding thing ever. And managing teams I never thought it would be as rewarding as it is, but it&#8217;s like driving without your hands on the wheel and it&#8217;s problem solving and success for me looks like just enjoying my everyday. I do what I love for a living, you know what I mean? If I could go back and talk to my seven year old self and explain my job right now, even on the worst of days, if I could explain that to that kid, it&#8217;d be, &#8220;Yeah, you&#8217;ve done all right.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     So you are our first interview of 2020. We&#8217;re starting a new year. We&#8217;re starting a new decade. When you look to the next five years, what kind of work would you like to be doing?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    Wow. I think work, no matter what it is, relevant work, number one that matters to this changing world. Something that addresses everything that we&#8217;re talking about. Something that&#8217;s aesthetically pleasing obviously, and something that fits into the function. It needs to be functional. It needs to be purposeful. That&#8217;s my new criteria for what I want to do next because as I see design changing, as I see the nature of work changing, I want to put what I do towards some good. I&#8217;d love to work with inner city kids, rural kids who never thought they had a chance to be in graphic design and just kind of give them everything I can to just infiltrate our really kind of monotone industry with some character.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     Well Anthony, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and your work and everything online?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    I would go to my Instagram, which is Anthony Bones Harrison. That&#8217;s my at Anthony Bones Harrison. That&#8217;s my Instagram and at AnthonyHarrison.solutions. That&#8217;s my website, hasn&#8217;t been updated in some time and it&#8217;s probably about a 32nd of my work. So that&#8217;s kind of my website but I&#8217;m in the midst of rebuilding that so I can put everything on there and making it a little bit more editorial. But where you really want to go is my Instagram, which is at Anthony Bones Harrison.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     All right, sounds good. Well, Anthony Harrison, I have to thank you so much for being on the show. Of course, as you know, this has been a long time coming. I really love that this is the interview that we&#8217;re starting off this year with because something that has sort of stuck with me from last year has been the notion of what are we as designers doing to kind of build a more equitable future? And the skills that we have are often put towards things which are fairly ephemeral, especially if we&#8217;re talking about digital design. We put all this work into these things that in a few years are just, they&#8217;re gone.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>:     And so I think what you&#8217;ve been able to do throughout your career is take the skills that you have and you&#8217;ve been able to morph and move them in so many different ways, in so many different aspects of design that I think that&#8217;s something which is just really inspiring. And hopefully for people that are listening, they can see that you don&#8217;t have to pigeonhole your creativity into one specific type of industry, that you can take that and really use it in a lot of places. So thank you so much for coming on the show, man. I really appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Harrison</strong>:    All right, well, thank you for having me. This was great.</p>

<p>Abraham Abbi Asefaw is not only an inspiring entrepreneur who has founded two agencies but a relatable and inspiring voice in the industry. As the Co-Founder of The Pop Up Agency, which he created before he turned 30, Abraham has stepped into his role as a leader in the industry with gusto. His major clients include Facebook, Adidas, Nissan, and Sky.</p>
<p>During our conversation, we discussed his journey from leaving the legal field and taking the brave leap into entrepreneurship, the major differences between international clients and American brands, his unique vision for the Pop Up Agency, and his goal to re-define the role of creatives in the industry. Abraham is challenging the status quo and bringing us all along on the ride!</p>
