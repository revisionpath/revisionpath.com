Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>Running your own design studio is no small feat, but design professionals like Rob Martin make it look easy. As the founder and creative principal of <a href="https://majorminor.co/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Majorminor</a>, he and his team have done branding and digital work for a number of clients for over a decade, including ICA, Complex, and Sony. On top of that, Rob is a talented musician and producer who goes by the name <a href="https://rcawhatsgood.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">RCA</a>. That guitar you see in the photo ain&#8217;t just for show!</p>
<p>We started our conversation with a quick 2022 check-in, and from there Rob talked about the ins and outs of running Majorminor, working with clients, and the types of projects he wants to branch out and tackle. Rob also spoke about growing up in the Bay Area, attending Sacramento State University and working for a few companies before striking out on his own. We even chatted about his music and his upcoming gig at SXSW this year! Rob is proof that being true to yourself is the real key to success!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Hey, so my name is Rob Martin. I run a studio called Majorminor. We&#8217;re based out of San Francisco, California. I act as the principal owner and a creative director here. Yeah, we do branding agency work. We do brand strategy and graphic design identity systems for a different range of clients. B2B, small local bakery or some more enterprise-level international enterprise. But basically we work with clients and people that are really trying to do something good for people. So we try to do good work for these people at the organization to support them and their vision.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. How has 2022 been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been doing okay. Definitely not a banner year for us or me in person or anything, but it&#8217;s one of those years where we&#8217;re looking back so we can see how we can move forward, right? It&#8217;s a lot of reflection on how we&#8217;ve been running the company, our past clients, what we can learn from those experiences and start to implement things into our workflow, our processes to make it better for us to work, whether it&#8217;s a work-life balance kind of thing, or even just how we&#8217;re serving our clients. How can we get, &#8220;Better clients?&#8221; We just work less to do more.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, because you just hit the 10-year mark not too long ago, right?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yeah. I think 10 years was&#8230; I forget what year that was, but I think we&#8217;ll be turning 13 this year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yeah, it was 2019. So yeah, it should be 13 years. 2009, we started.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
And then yes, we should be 13 this year. July 20th is our birthday.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Thank you. Yeah, it&#8217;s been a long ride.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about the design studio Majorminor, which first off just for those that are listening and might be wondering, where did the name come from?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yeah. So the name actually goes back when I was in college in Sacramento State, our last class was a portfolio building class. We actually have a portfolio to use once we got out of school. I took it upon myself to actually treat it as if I was doing a studio for myself. Actually, since I started school at Sacramento State, one of my friends in school really put me on all the cool studios like Pentagram and Turner Duckworth out in San Francisco. That was my first real exposure to something like that. Even the idea of owning a business, something I&#8217;ve always wanted to do as a kid, but that was like I was a kid in the &#8217;90s, so it was going to be a store, a 7-Eleven/import video game studio or a store/rollerblading store.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
It was a very juvenile idea. That has always been inside of me. So once I had the idea like, &#8220;Hey, I can actually run a studio. I&#8217;m really passionate about graphic design. Here&#8217;s my chance to kind of get that idea realized.&#8221; So in this portfolio class, we start coming up with names and I&#8217;m really digging into myself about who I am, how that reflects my work. And it actually came from the parallels I see in design, in music and also even just myself. So I&#8217;ll kind of explain the names. I think it&#8217;s really interesting. This will help me make sure that it still makes sense years later. So basically when you have a visual, right? There&#8217;s a rhythm between light and that contrasting that creates the form, right? So you remember doing line studies in your first graphic design class. You&#8217;re doing these strips and then see how this black and white can make rhythm or how it can make a form.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
And then even with sound wave, it&#8217;s a up and down wave. But the contrast between those ups and downs and the speed that they&#8217;re going at will make it sound. So those parallels are really interesting to me too. And then even thinking about myself. People thinking about different people like, &#8220;Oh, that person is X, that means they like Y.&#8221; I feel like I was in the middle of all these things like, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re a black dude, but you grew up around South Bay around a bunch of Asian folks. So you don&#8217;t fit that mold in that way.&#8221; So I always kind of saw myself in the middle.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
And then bringing it back to the whole music thing, Majorminor the way I see it as being in the middle of these ups and downs and kind of existing there, even again with the whole balance between form and my shape and color, all kind of making these things. That&#8217;s kind of where I came up with the name Majorminor to then represent myself and the practice that we have at the studio.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So tell me about the Majorminor team.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yeah. So the Majorminor team currently, our core team is there&#8217;s three people; myself, my producer, Vincent, and then my other project manager, account manager, Michelle. One of the cool things about Majorminor is that everyone at kind of the leadership-level, you want to call it, they&#8217;ve always been people that I considered my best friends in life. I&#8217;m very lucky to have people that I call my best friend or a best friend that I could then actually work with and work alongside with in a really healthy, non-toxic kind of a way.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
And this current iteration they&#8217;ve been on the team for the last, two years now. During COVID I took a break. I had a really bad panic attack in 2020, I think it was right before COVID hit. So I took off pretty much that year from COVID or the year that we first had the shutdown. When we started to come back together or when I decided I was ready to get back to work, I brought them along to kind of reshape the team and move forward with a more healthier feel.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s been great so far. They&#8217;re really, really sensitive to that kind of stuff. And just paying attention to that for even our clients. How are they feeling about this? How are we feeling about everything? Making sure we&#8217;re not working too much, but know that when we do need to pick up the pace or something, we&#8217;re doing that in a way that&#8217;s not toxic or berating of anyone. Really considering, &#8220;This is about the work and not the person, but the people here, they need to be in a certain place to able to do their best work.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are the best types of clients for you to work with?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
I&#8217;d say our best type of client is and this is something that we&#8217;ve only recently started to identify maybe in the last year, maybe even two years, but really kind of taking a hypothesis and trying to see if that actually makes sense, which it has. But basically, it&#8217;s a company that has some kind of product they&#8217;ve been able to vet their business. They&#8217;re probably making at least a million dollars a year revenue, but they don&#8217;t have a real brand system or even a strategy. They&#8217;ve just been just doing their thing. And they want to become competitive on either a larger regional stage or a national stage.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
And so usually that means most of our clients have never paid for a design or worked with a strategic design team before. So we already know there&#8217;s a lot of education that comes with that relationship and a lot of handholding, but not like&#8230; It&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Hey, this is the process. And it might feel unintuitive to you in certain ways, but let us walk you through it.&#8221; And we&#8217;ll explain why we&#8217;re doing all this stuff. So we kind of see ourselves as being the stepper for them to get up the mountain. Sometimes people climb mountains, but they never climbed ever. So they need someone that&#8217;s done it before, see how they move and then bring them up the mountain in a way that facilitates their best experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So when let&#8217;s say a company or an individual then contacts you about a new project, what does that process look like in terms of bringing them in, working with their idea? What does that look like?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yeah. So first off, I guess we get some kind of initial email from them, &#8220;Hey we&#8217;ve got this project we&#8217;re thinking about, we got referred to you by whomever.&#8221; We&#8217;ll just hop on a really casual conversation and just talk to them. They can say, &#8220;We need a new brand system. We like this and like that.&#8221; But again, this is their first time actually working with a strategic team. So we want to uncover what that really means for them. And then help them understand what that really is for them. They might need an identity system, but how agile are you expecting it to be? What places will the main touch points, the core brand expressions actually be? And then once we have those conversations, it enlightens them onto what they&#8217;re actually about to get from us, what they actually need. And just the whole thing, just more are detailed and articulated for them.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Then from there, we&#8217;ve kind of uncover all those things. We call it a discovery session. Once everything is uncovered during that discovery session, then we&#8217;ll actually go and write a proposal with a number in there for them, go back and forth. Maybe they can&#8217;t afford it, or maybe they have to get more money, but then we can cut things out of it, put things in there that might have been revealed to them during some kind of board review of the proposal. And then from there, everything is sign the dot line. And this is actually something we&#8217;re about to do, to have a second session after the contracts are signed, going through all the terms of the engagement with them very clear. So everyone&#8217;s on the same page on how the process will move and why we only want you to have six stakeholders and no one else can chime in, why we&#8217;re doing that because we don&#8217;t want too many cooks in the kitchen.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
People giving feedback out of context, or even giving personal feedback that isn&#8217;t irrelevant, but it then messed up the flavor in the pot. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Really trying to get&#8230; And not to be strict, but just say, &#8220;Hey, if you want this to move efficiently, when you want to get done, then we have to move in this way.&#8221; It serves both of our parties, not just us, not wanting to deal with other people. But for us to get that product for them, we need to make sure we&#8217;re all in agreement with the way we all have to move. It&#8217;s like I sign a disclaimer for you to jump out of a plane or something like that, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So aside from clients and everything you mentioned that&#8217;s been going on now for 13 years almost, what&#8217;s been the secret to keep the things going?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a secret, if there is, I&#8217;m still trying to figure it out. So if anyone hears anything from the stuff I&#8217;m saying, please feel free to pull my coat. Let me know what the secret could be. I think if anything, it is really just building. I think the biggest part of it is building and maintaining relationships because people the best way word-of-mouth or word-of-mouth is the best way I think, to get new projects. And even I feel like people see your work, that&#8217;s not what they&#8217;re buying necessarily. So if they come to you like, &#8220;Oh, that was really cool that you did that.&#8221; And their whole traction leads off of your work. It&#8217;s usually, you got to turn that back around because they&#8217;re not really paying for the work.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
While the work is obviously important as the product that they&#8217;re getting at the end of the day, the relationship and the way that you both move, how the designer leads you through this, I think is what really, the biggest thing is. If they&#8217;re efficient, they&#8217;re working right, they&#8217;re being professional, they&#8217;re hitting their timelines. Those are the things that I think you&#8217;re really paying for because you get anyone to do any kind of design work. That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t get hire people like, &#8220;Oh, I can just go on Fiverr and get someone to do this.&#8221; I&#8217;m fine like, &#8220;Fine, if that&#8217;s what you want to do go, but it&#8217;s going to be a way different experience and end product than what you&#8217;re going to get from us.&#8221; And that&#8217;s fine. If you want to go there, I&#8217;m not mad at you because that&#8217;s probably stuff I don&#8217;t want to work with if they&#8217;re going to have that kind of mentality.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Or maybe they don&#8217;t really know the difference. I have to educate them to show them the value of what they&#8217;re actually getting versus a different studio or even another designer or even a Fiverr guy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I mean that education part is important. One, that&#8217;s kind of in a way what they&#8217;re paying for, hopefully they&#8217;re paying for the education because they&#8217;re paying you to do something that they can&#8217;t do. So the hope is that you&#8217;ll be able to kind of show them like, &#8220;This is how it should be done.&#8221; But then also, they&#8217;re also paying for just your expertise. If you&#8217;ve been doing it for this long, clearly you have a track record for knowing what you&#8217;re doing. So it would take, hopefully I&#8217;m thinking on the client end, it would take me less time to hire a professional than for me to hire someone on say Fiverr or some marketplace that I may have to do a whole bunch of explaining towards, I don&#8217;t know the verbiage or the terminology to really talk to them the way they did in order to do the work. It ends up becoming just a lot more work that way.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yeah. And that part, especially with the clients that we have, where it is their first time paying for this large of an effort strategic with design, they don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re getting into. And there&#8217;s actually even a moment I want to say it was about a year ago where this woman approached us for some work. We already knew we didn&#8217;t want to work with her because of her tone of voice. But we still took the time to let her know, &#8220;You have no idea where you&#8217;re about to get into and this is what it should look like. And that&#8217;s why it costs X hundred thousand dollars.&#8221; Just because you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth that much. That doesn&#8217;t mean that it isn&#8217;t worth that much. If anything, you really need to understand what you&#8217;re about to get into because you&#8217;re going to have a world of hurt as you try and do everything you&#8217;re trying to say for $15,000.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
And we&#8217;re not trying to be mean, it&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Yo, this is actually how it is.&#8221; If anything, it should probably cost more because you&#8217;re going to be one of those people that don&#8217;t get it and don&#8217;t want to get it and it&#8217;s going to make more work for everyone. So yeah, I&#8217;m sharing information because I want people to understand what we actually do and take the veer off because it&#8217;s kind of&#8230; If you&#8217;ve never done it before, it&#8217;s kind of nebulous, what it really is and you learn along the way. And that&#8217;s the kind of the fun part about it for our clients too, is them seeing and having those aha moments and say, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s why you guys wanted to.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
One thing that we do that we&#8217;ve been doing for the last few years and we do identity systems. We don&#8217;t just do the logo and then the colors and then the tie, we do the whole thing at once. So they see a very good representation of where we want to take this direction for the system. So they&#8217;ll see the logo, some colors, it&#8217;s a very detailed mood board. And we even mock up like, &#8220;Here&#8217;s a poster or a campaign idea within this.&#8221; So it might only get two directions, but these two directions are thought out and vetted all the way to the point where they can just say, &#8220;We like that one or we like this one or maybe can we try this one with the other colors?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
And we cut down a lot of the really big reviews because we&#8217;re not doing everything one at a time. We&#8217;re showing everything in context. So if you can see this image that we&#8217;re trying to create for them, what the system looks like and how agile it is, how it can scale, what other pieces we think might need to be invented. Maybe they didn&#8217;t think about, &#8220;Oh, we never thought about doing this thing because we never saw the need for it. But we do see the need for it in this image mock up that you&#8217;ve done for us.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Like I said, that education is really important for them to kind of see what goes into it. Because oftentimes they don&#8217;t really know. Especially like you said, if they haven&#8217;t hired someone before, they don&#8217;t know what the creative process looks like. They just think you go in there and punch a few buttons and there you go. There&#8217;s the logo. But when you show them all the thought and the care and the psychology and everything that goes behind it, the hope is that they have that appreciation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I had someone contact me recently that was like, &#8220;Oh, I need a logo for my organization.&#8221; And usually the first question I&#8217;ll always ask is, &#8220;What&#8217;s your budget?&#8221; Because for me that can be the indicator as to whether this is going to be a good project or a bad project. I hate to say it, but that&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so they had a pretty low budget and I said, &#8220;Well, you probably would be better off going to a marketplace just based on what you are willing to spend on this.&#8221; And it was pretty much a full brand identity for a nonprofit organization. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;We need a logo and this and that and the third.&#8221; Because I was like, &#8220;If you really try to hire the services of a designer, it&#8217;s going to be much more expensive than that. And I don&#8217;t know how much more expensive, it&#8217;s definitely going to be more expensive than your budget.&#8221; So you kind of have to ask those qualifying questions and stuff too. And especially when you&#8217;re starting out on your own, you may not know that. You may take those low gigs at first just to kind of have some skin in the game and you realize years and years later, you don&#8217;t do that.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yeah. You know what&#8217;s even kind of crazy about that. They&#8217;re not crazy, but another piece of that is like, this is what I learned a few years ago too, was you might bid the pie and the sky project for them. But really they might not even be able to support that. It might be just be too much. And they spend all this money after you&#8217;ve educated them on it and they can&#8217;t even support it, and the identity just falls apart. Sometimes you&#8217;ll see this new brand comes out there, they wouldn&#8217;t be on brand new or something like that. But you&#8217;ll see the whole, &#8220;Oh, this is really cool. This is really great.&#8221; The way it&#8217;s represented on the designer side looks awesome. Then you go back a year later and it looks nothing like that because the internal team on the client side could not support something like that. Either their designer that they had in staff was whack or the brand guidelines you made them were trash.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
But you also have to be able to make something that people can actually use and support over the length of however long they need it for. So that&#8217;s part of it to consider too. So they might be able to get the money for, but if you don&#8217;t think they have the support system to use that work and make it of even more value for them, then it&#8217;s kind like that&#8217;s another place you got to pause and be like, &#8220;Hey, you know what? Maybe we can just do a smaller scale of this or you should just to go somewhere else and just do something basic until you have the infrastructure to do something more. Just do something bigger to get you to that level, but I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re there yet.&#8221; That&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve had to do a couple of times, but it&#8217;s a good thing to be able to identify as we&#8217;re kind of going through the bidding process.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, that makes a lot of sense, actually. I didn&#8217;t even think about that. You can do this big identity and things for them, but if they can&#8217;t support it moving forward, then it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Do they really need that? Are they going to contract you to do that work for them?&#8221; There&#8217;s all these other questions that end up coming into play.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. And because just me personally, I to do the most and that always nips me in the bud a lot. So I&#8217;ve had to temper myself with trying to do everything I want to and would like to for them to what they actually need, what can they actually use? So that&#8217;s been, I guess, more of a learning for myself but that has been for other people. But we&#8217;ve had multiple times where we&#8217;ve had to encounter that and make a decision.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;ve mentioned doing a lot of branding and identity projects. Are there other types of projects that you want to do in the future through the studio?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Retail stuff is always really interesting because even getting into the graphic design. I remember my mom, she worked at, I don&#8217;t know, some place. It was a big white building called Sintex or something and over by Stanford in California and she would go to work every day and then come back and tell me what she did, it was data research or something. But there&#8217;s never any physical thing to show for it. And I also thought it was weird, at least for me because even as a kid, I liked to make stuff. I was either drawing or arts and craft, lanyards kind of shit. Everything I did, I had something to show for. Even when I was playing video games if I beat the game, I then make a drawing of the game as a certificate for myself like, &#8220;Hey, I did this thing.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
So for me, having some kind of artifact of your accomplishments or things that you do has always been really important to me. So the retail kind of thing, having a product that we then get to design and then package and someone I can point to it on a shelf like, &#8220;Yeah, me and my team did that.&#8221; That&#8217;s always been a really important to me to do more stuff like that. But even with websites, &#8220;Yeah, we made that thing.&#8221; But the physical thing is actually really interesting too. So even with the music that I put out, I put that on vinyl. So I have a record, literally a record of it and-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
&#8230; it&#8217;s like a piece I can look back on. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s pretty dope. I want to definitely talk more about your music. We&#8217;ll get to that I think later in the interview. But let&#8217;s switch gears and talk about your origin story. You mentioned, or you&#8217;ve alluded to that you&#8217;re from in and around the Bay Area, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yeah. So I grew up in Sunnyvale, California, and that&#8217;s in the South Bay Area of the Bay Area and that was really cool being out there. Again, it was a cool mix, melting pot being around all these different people, even the tech and stuff out there. I really would say, I am a product of Sunnyvale, really into video games. Nerdy kind of guy, but cool enough where I could still get around and not get punked or anything. It definitely had an impact on the person I am in good ways, I think. I&#8217;m very proud to be from there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It definitely sounds like you got into art and design and stuff pretty early on. You mentioned sketching the video games after you beat them and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. Video games was one of the gateways into art and design. Skateboarding was another really big one too. I was never, ever good at skateboarding, but I always like the art on them, the culture and the way people dress. That was a really big part of it for me. And then even with skateboarding, getting into punk rock music, I played in punk bands and stuff when I was in high school, sky bands, metal bands. But all those things, they all kind of&#8230; One thing I got into took me into something else, took me into something else. But they all stemmed around the art and the music part of it and the culture too, just the people that built it, seeing how they operate.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
And especially even thinking about, I won&#8217;t say there was a counter culture necessary, but there&#8217;s just alternative lifestyles, the way people get down in there. Some of the crusty punk dudes, I used to kick it with. I would never want to live like that, but I respected the fact that they wanted to live that way. That&#8217;s what they did. And there was very authenticism or authentic part about it. They&#8217;re being themselves, doing what they want to do and whatever you&#8217;re &#8220;supposed to do,&#8221; they weren&#8217;t really worried about that because that&#8217;s what they wanted to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When did you know that design was something that you wanted to study?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Well, so I&#8217;ll say this, I always wanted to do graphic design, but I didn&#8217;t really know what graphic design was from a theoretical kind of practice until I got to Sacramento State.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Before that, I really just wanted a job where I didn&#8217;t have to do any math and I got to sit in front of a computer all day. I guess I wanted to be a production designer at that point. I didn&#8217;t know that&#8217;s what it was. I just wanted to make stuff on the computer and not have to stand all day.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
So once I got Sacramento State, the first class was all about theory again, how we&#8217;re seeing light becoming sense of the form and color. I was like, &#8220;Oh, this is actually kind of dope. There&#8217;s a whole science to it.&#8221; Even the degree that we got from Sacramento State was a Bachelor&#8217;s of Science, not an art degree. I really like that they fought to get that kind of definition around the program because this is all theory. Yeah, you are making something. You&#8217;re making a &#8220;beautiful thing,&#8221; at the end of the day. But there&#8217;s a lot of science, psychology, anthropology, even that goes into the foundation of the algorithm that we used to make whatever we make, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And now prior to Sacramento State though, you started out at a art school, right? At Academy of Art University.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. So I don&#8217;t know if you knew this, but in the Bay Area where Academy is based out of, back in 2000s, they would run commercials late at night when all the anime stuff was on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Show, &#8220;Hey, if you want to draw anime, you can come over to art school over here and we&#8217;ll help get you a job and all this.&#8221; It was very romantic in that way. Trying to play up getting an art degree. That obviously looked very attractive to me. It was very expensive, but I like, &#8220;Mom, I really want to do this. Can you help me get there?&#8221; So we worked over the summer to get me signed up over there. It was a pain in the arse to get signed up there. And I was still living in my parents&#8217; house in Sunnyvale. So getting up to San Francisco to be there for four days a week, a little bit of a stretch being&#8230; I don&#8217;t know how old I was, so I think I was maybe 20 or 19 then.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Were you driving or were you taking Caltrain?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
So I&#8217;d stay at my friend&#8217;s house in Berkeley. He was going to UC Berkeley and I would stay up there for a day or two and then take BART across and then come back on the weekends.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Gotcha.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
So I could work and just be home.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Because that&#8217;s a commute from South Bay to get up to San Francisco. I remember I interned out in San Francisco for a summer when I was in college and I was like, &#8220;It&#8217;s a trek.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. If I had a good car, it wouldn&#8217;t have been that much of a problem, but just the logistics. So I&#8217;d be there till 7:00. I had to get there 9:00 AM, be there till 7:00 and then have to do homework. My friend was like I could just stay with him for a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yeah, so I started school there, just the whole commute thing, the amount of stuff I needed to buy, the work I needed to do. I wasn&#8217;t ready for it. I think I dropped out halfway through the first semester. It wasn&#8217;t what I thought I was going to be. I wasn&#8217;t ready for that. It wasn&#8217;t what I expected it to be, which it ended up being more or the theory stuff. They start you out with all these foundational drawing classes, which are important.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
But in hindsight, I don&#8217;t think that was absolutely necessary for the type of designer that I ended up being. So I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t stick with that, especially for the amount they were charging. It was incredibly expensive.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. I was going to continue with the little bit, the origin stuff, right? So I dropped out of there and I went back to community college and I decided, &#8220;You know what? I&#8217;m going to go to a state school. I would like to get out of the Bay Area slightly.&#8221; So I started working towards going to Sacramento State, doing some painting and drawing classes at the end of community college and then went to Sac State. I think I started in 2003 there and I was at Academy, I think 2002. Yes, maybe like a year. I had an in between just because we had to sign up for the whole school transfer and everything to go to a state school from any other school.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It sounds like Sacramento State was just a much better environment for you overall.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Oh, across the board. I swear I&#8217;m so lucky that this worked out for me because it was like one of those things was like, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to do if I don&#8217;t do this, I have to do something like this because I actually got diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago. And in hindsight that explained my whole entire life up to that point. And because usually if I&#8217;m not in it, I&#8217;ve been saying this thing recently. If I don&#8217;t fuck with you, I don&#8217;t fuck with you. And that&#8217;s kind of, if I&#8217;m not into it, then I literally can&#8217;t do it. My brain won&#8217;t let me. It won&#8217;t be stimulating enough for me to engage with it at all. I didn&#8217;t know that was an ADHD thing until recently.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
But looking back, I told myself, I was like, &#8220;Yo Rob, you got to make this work.&#8221; Luckily the program at Sac State is top-notch. I highly recommend it to anyone trying to save money, but still get a very solid design education. I think their education there is better than Academy&#8217;s. It&#8217;s all theoretical. Although the professors are super Swiss old school trained, but they&#8217;ve been able to be agile and keep up with the times in a way. That really shows how much the theory and the practice of the foundations like becoming sensitive to the way you&#8217;re looking at things and having a critical eye and not personal preference or anything like that. They&#8217;re able to shape someone that&#8217;s maybe not naturally good at design and get them to a place where they can&#8217;t be competitive in the workplace.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s talk about your early career. So you graduated from Sacramento State, you&#8217;re getting out there in the world, working as a designer. Tell me what your early career was like because you were kind of working at a few different places here and there, right?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yeah. Actually, so maybe I should take a little step back. So before I graduated, I went to Dallas for a student design competition and I won my first award there, but I also met a lot of people. I met Armando Simmons out there. This guy, Matt George, I was working at VSA in Chicago. I almost actually ended up working at VCA a few months after that, but I wanted to graduate first and they were trying to get me to get over there before I graduated. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I got to get the degree due. I&#8217;ve been working on this for three years. I can&#8217;t leave a month early and not get the degree.&#8221; So passed on that. And then I graduated and then I think immediately after that, I started sending out stuff for internships and I was able to land one at Chan Design in San Francisco, one of my favorite studios.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
So back in the day, they were very influential on me. I was back again to commuting. So I&#8217;d be taking the train or driving to San Francisco from Sacramento at least three days a week for this internship. Super long commute.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
And eventually it was a pain, but for me it was worth it because that was a place I always admired and I really looked up to. So for me that was worth the commute. Plus I got to listen to podcasts and music all day on the way up and down. So those two and a half hour drives weren&#8217;t too bad back then.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
And then from Chan, I was able to get a full-time designer spot at Volume. I was there for about a year, I think. For the first half of that, I was commuting every day now, but this time I take the train, which took longer, but at least I wasn&#8217;t driving so I could sleep on the way there and back. I did that get commute for a little bit then I moved back to my parents&#8217; house in Sunnyvale. I just drove from San Francisco every day to back home. Then from there I got a spot at this place called Duarte Design. They&#8217;re the PowerPoint keynote specialists for Apple. They did Al Gore&#8217;s Inconvenient Truth stuff. They&#8217;re a heavy player. They are the PowerPoint people. You there&#8217;s no one else that&#8217;s messing with them in any kind of way.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
And I was there for a little bit and this is where my snobbery and the me thinking I was hot shit really came into play because I didn&#8217;t really&#8230; Cool. Working on PowerPoint stuff but I didn&#8217;t know I&#8217;d be working a Windows machine. I got really uppity about that. I think just culturally I wasn&#8217;t a good fit there and we all knew it, but they were trying their hardest to make it work just because they&#8217;re investing in the people and everything that they have. So I guess they kind of short, I am getting fired the day that Obama was elected.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
But yeah, I saw it coming, but I get a little more symbolic on that day of all days. So I left there and I worked at Punchcut for a little bit and then I got laid off there because I was right when Obama got elected was when the recession started to hit. And it hit pretty hard right after that. So I got laid off there and then I was like you know what? I was going to start my studio. I&#8217;m living at my parents&#8217; house. I said, &#8220;I need to make a little bit of money,&#8221; so they let me pay for food and gas and hang on the weekends. So I&#8217;ll be able to do that while I&#8217;m kind of getting my whole process together and actually figure out how I&#8217;m going to do this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I want to interject there for two things. One, when you were at Duarte, I&#8217;m curious. Do you know Jole Simmons? Does that name sound familiar?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
It sounds familiar, but I don&#8217;t have a face.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He&#8217;s a presentation designer. I don&#8217;t know if you and he worked at Duarte at the same time, but you mentioned him. And that made me think of when I interviewed him a while back.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Oh, you mean Armando Simmons or Jole Simmons? I said Armando.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know Armando Simmons, Jole Simmons, J-O-L-E Simmons, Hampton grad. I think Joel is still out there in the Bay now, but he does a lot of big presentations like Apple, Microsoft, et cetera. So you mentioned Duarte and I was thinking, &#8220;Oh, I think I know him. I don&#8217;t know if you all had crossed paths or not.&#8221; But it sounds one interesting parallel that kind of came up to me as you were mentioning that is you left right when Obama got elected, like you said, that was kind of symbolic. And I remember I was working at AT&#038;T right at that time as a senior designer and I quit my job the day Obama got elected. I was going-</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Because of that or just you got hyped up?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think I just got hyped up. It was all in the moment because I&#8217;m not going to get too much into it. Folks who have listened to the podcast have probably heard this story. But I was working at AT&#038;T, I was a senior production designer. It was just a lot of work. And they were scaling things to the point where we were doing&#8230; All the work that we did had point values to it. And so they would lessen the point value of the work and increase the number of points you had to hit every week to make your goal or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then on top of that, I was also getting paid less than other senior designers there, despite the fact that I had more experience and I had sort of lobbied to not my manager because I was a contractor working there, but my contractor manager telling her what happened and she managed to get all of my back pay. There were six months of back pay that was owed to me and the back hit that morning because I remember I went to go vote. I came back to the office and my contractor manager pulled me into her office, told me that the money had hit and everything like that. So we should be all squared away and things like that. And it was like as soon as she said that, and then a little bit later on we were watching the votes and everything in the office and stuff like that. And we had a big team meeting near the end of the day and I just quit. I quit in the team meeting.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yo, props for that, though. Even during the team meeting too, that&#8217;s a hard mic drop thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I&#8217;m curious for you, you had kind of these short stints at these different design agencies and studios and stuff, what was going on during that time. Did you just feel like you weren&#8217;t fitting in anywhere or what was going through your mind then?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yeah, this is actually kind of a personal thing for me, right? Again, with the ADHD thing, I didn&#8217;t know I had that until later in life. So first two spots to Chan and Volume just being contract designers out here, you kind of come in and out, that&#8217;s just how those worked out. At the same time, I think the person I was, my social skills were not where they are now. I&#8217;m way more socially inept or I&#8217;m better as a social person. I fit in with people. I can talk to people now more comfortable with doing that. Before I was really shy. I&#8217;m very awkward on top of me just not being into certain things. At Duarte, I just looked like an asshole pretty much I think to people. Not intentionally, but I was though.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Again, in hindsight I could see how the way I was behaving would look to someone for me outside in. And then even just starting Majorminor and having to now get in of people and sell myself, that really helped with all this being comfortable and being able to approach people, being able to talk to people in a certain way. All that really helped and it started to happen once I started getting my feet on the ground, started campaigning to get work and stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So that feeling was kind of what made you want to start the studio?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Well, I wouldn&#8217;t say that feeling necessarily, but I guess that was a part of it was just, I need to be able to do things in my own terms in order for me to do them at my highest level. Just like the personal investment. Do I really want to do this? Do I care about it versus kind of what you were saying with AT&#038;T just throwing stuff in front of you and you&#8217;re just trying to churning it out. I can&#8217;t do that necessarily, at least for a sustained amount of time, after a while I just start to drift off and daydream in my head and think about other stuff I&#8217;d rather be doing. So I figured why did I just do that stuff in the first place so you never have to feel like that or make someone feel a certain kind of way about you because you&#8217;re treating their work in a certain way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What were those early years of Majorminor like?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Very interesting. I&#8217;ve ever encountered anyone else that had this kind of path, but I didn&#8217;t have any clients that I brought with me or anything like that when I left any of these places or even freelance clients. I literally just went on Craigslist every 20 minutes and refreshed a page and sent out my little cold email to all the people that were looking for stuff. Sometimes it&#8217;d be a little $150 logo. Sometimes it&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Hey, I need a magazine done or something like that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
That experience was really critical because it helped me to build my process for any actual real work, getting my contracts together. Having that experience is where things go wrong, and I now learn not to do certain things. Understanding how to approach people and not just say yes to everything, but like, &#8220;Hey, I can do this, but I can do this. Well, you only have this amount of money. Well, I can&#8217;t do that then, but I can do this for you.&#8221; The negotiation thing, being able to meet people where they&#8217;re at with what they&#8217;re trying to do and really understanding and hearing them and what they&#8217;re trying to do and not just be a factory.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
The beginning years of just chilling on Craigslist was pretty, pretty significant that way. I didn&#8217;t know that at the time, but looking back that was my master&#8217;s program was the first two years of Majorminor, just trolling on there. But the thing is once I was doing that because I started off solo, right? So I&#8217;m doing this just on Craigslist as often as I possibly can, looking for other avenues to get work without having any work to show or any other contacts that could put me in front of someone else. It really built me up in that way and got my process to a place where I can actually run a business.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m glad you said that because I think that way of starting out is a lot more common than people think. I know that-</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yeah, I hope so.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, no, serious because that&#8217;s how I started out. My first year after I quit, I didn&#8217;t have&#8230; See, this was my thing. I thought I would have clients lined up. I had been telling friends of mine like, &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking about starting my own studio or something like that.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, well you got such and such. I&#8217;ll have some work for you.&#8221; And I quit. And those first, I&#8217;d say probably those first three or four were lean. I mean they were rough. I wasn&#8217;t necessarily going on Craigslist, but I was definitely taking super low paying jobs, anything just to get something in the bank account.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was going to a lot of meetups because meetups were big. I&#8217;m in Atlanta to kind of give a context. But here at Atlanta, meetups were pretty big in 2009 or so. So I would go to all these web design meetups, which I quickly found out is the worst place for a designer to try to get a job because there&#8217;s other designers that are trying to get jobs. So you all are all competing for the same scraps essentially. Everybody&#8217;s trying to get something. It was rough those first few months.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I had went to one meetup and some guy had contacted me. He was a business graduate from UGA, this white dude. And he was like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;d love to meet up with you. I have some questions about design because there&#8217;s this project that I might be working on and I&#8217;d like your help on.&#8221; And I was just like, &#8220;Okay, fine. If you buy me breakfast.&#8221; Because at the time I was like, I got $5 off to my MATA card. I can take the bus up there and then walk back to the station and take the trains, so I don&#8217;t have to pay twice or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I went up there. It was a Panera Bread up in Buckhead for folks that know Atlanta. Went to Panera Bread, met this guy and he was telling me, &#8220;Me and this other friend were thinking of starting this business because we&#8217;re trying to&#8230; &#8221; They were basically trying to cash in on the, it&#8217;s funny because Obama kind of ties into this, but trying to cash in on the trend of politicians now wanting to run their campaigns like Obama. So this is early 2009. Everything Obama did in his first run for presidency with social media and graphic design and stuff was really unprecedented.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so this is one of the first slates of municipal races after that. It was like the mayor&#8217;s race essentially. And so everybody running wanted the Obama sheen to their campaign and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well you can&#8217;t hire the Obama folks because now they work for the administration or they&#8217;re going to be super expensive.&#8221; So he had knew this guy and they knew a candidate that was running and they were basically going to put a company together to pitch to that candidate. But they were like, &#8220;We need a designer.&#8221; And so he&#8217;s asking me to basically tell him how to design. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Should I learn HTML or should I learn Dreamweaver? And I&#8217;m like [crosstalk 00:40:09]. I was like, &#8220;You know what? I&#8217;m sympathetic to your plight. I really need work. Let&#8217;s just kind of do this as a trio.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so the three of us had met up and we came up with a name for the business and we had ended up getting onto the campaign of this woman. She was the city council president and she had ran for mayor. She dropped out because her parents got sick and she was about to jump back into the race. So we&#8217;re talking to her campaign manager at this lavish mansion. And I was like, &#8220;This is the fanciest shit I have ever seen in my life.&#8221; I knew people in Atlanta were rich, but I was like, &#8220;I have never seen no shit like this.&#8221; Huge-</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yeah. Rich, rich.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; 10 foot round solid marble table that we&#8217;re meeting at like King Arthur. And we meet the candidate and she&#8217;s told us about we&#8217;re running for everything and she&#8217;s like, &#8220;I like the three of you all,&#8221; because two of us were black and one of us was white. And she&#8217;s like, &#8220;I like the three of you all. This is real diverse like Obama. You got you a white guy? This is real diverse.&#8221; Because she was black.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so she kind of was, ask us about where we went to school and all this kind of stuff. And so is like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ll take a chance. I&#8217;ll take a chance on you.&#8221; So we ended up becoming the new media team for her campaign essentially. She got back in the race and ran from, I think April of 2009 to November. She didn&#8217;t win. She came in third place. But that whole experience set me up basically to continue running my studio for almost 10 years after that. Because if I didn&#8217;t have that experience of that campaign, I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to meet other people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And honestly, like you said, get your process together. The crucible of working inside a political campaign is rough. It reminded me a lot of working as a production designer. You got to crank out stuff really fast. You got to respond to things quickly. There&#8217;s no time to kind of sit and iterate. You got to really come up with something super quick. It was a lot, it was a lot. And actually that&#8217;s where I first met Stacey Abrams because that was who our campaign manager was.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Oh, okay. Cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, so that was pretty cool.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
That&#8217;s what I said. They all comes around full circle.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Those early years, I mean kind of to the point I was saying earlier, you kind of have to get out there and scrap. The hope is that you&#8217;re going to have these clients and people that come over. But the reality is, it&#8217;s a jungle out there. I&#8217;d say probably even more so now than that because the learning curve to design, I&#8217;m using air quotes around design, is so much shorter now because people can learn stuff on YouTube and they can take these courses and stuff. And there&#8217;s people half a world away that are doing this for pennies on the dollar. And how can you compete with that?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s just all the bureaucracy that goes into that, everyone&#8217;s looking at it, everyone&#8217;s got something to say, but you still got to make it in two minutes just really quick. And did you even have a system that you were working with or were you just making stuff on the fly and [crosstalk 00:43:09]?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, I was just making up stuff as I went along. I had no problem process, I had nothing. And like you said, it takes a few times you get burned by&#8230; I was fortunate that with the political campaign, everything worked out as it did. But even the clients I had after that, I didn&#8217;t have a contract. I eventually learned about AIGA&#8217;s design contract and I sort of used that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I had a client that was a lawyer who used to work with the campaign. And so I bartered my service with him. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;ll do design work for you. If you write my contracts.&#8221; And so that&#8217;s how I got good contracts, proposals, templates and stuff. I started thinking like, &#8220;Who do I need to do work for to try to upgrade how I do my business?&#8221; But that process had to come along through a lot of trial and error. Nobody was sitting me, I didn&#8217;t have a business mentor or anybody that sat me down that was like, &#8220;You have to do this.&#8221; I was out here fucking up and just trying to recover from it.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
The contract thing&#8217;s actually kind of funny. So we&#8217;ve always had problems with people running late or not paying us. Actually, we had a really bad one about a year ago. They&#8217;re still paying us. It&#8217;s been a year since the job was over. I&#8217;ve actually found the contracts to be kind of ineffective because if you don&#8217;t enforce them, whether it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, this happened according to our terms, this is what&#8217;s supposed to happen.&#8221; If you don&#8217;t enforce them, they&#8217;re not going to.&#8221; If you do enforce them, you might not get anything. It&#8217;s kind of like a damned if you do, damned if you don&#8217;t kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
So yeah, the whole contract thing, we&#8217;ve been trying to figure that out. Yeah, we have a good contract here. It is &#8220;legal&#8221; because they sign it. But, &#8220;Okay, cool. They&#8217;re not doing anything. Do we now want to spend the money that we don&#8217;t have to pursue the thing legally?&#8221; We can&#8217;t just flash the piece of paper in their face and like, &#8220;But you signed the contract.&#8221; &#8220;All right. I still don&#8217;t have any fucking money for you. What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The one thing that I would do with clients is I would never let them sign the contract alone. So I would set up a contract meeting with them and we would go over each clause in the contract and make understood it and then we&#8217;d sign it together. And then they knew kind of moving forward, this is what you&#8217;re being held to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I was lucky that even with the lawyer that I had, he wrote the contract in pretty plain language. So it wasn&#8217;t a lot of PR24s and the party of the first part and all that kind of stuff. It was pretty straight forward. But I would always have a contract meeting. I would never let them sign it alone because one, the client&#8217;s never really going to read it. They&#8217;re just going to sign it so they can try to get the project started.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And the hope is that they read it. You hope that they read it. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No, we&#8217;re going over this like you&#8217;re five years old. We are going over it clause by clause so you understand what this means. This is what scope creep means. This is what a termination fee means. This is what a kill fee means. I hope we never have to institute these things, but if it gets to that point you know because we&#8217;ve had this meeting.&#8221; I would sort of point back to that meeting if things started to go a little wonky during the process like, &#8220;Well, we had the meeting and you said this and we signed it together.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, okay.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
I think we are going to start doing something like that now. But I think even more so signing it in-person versus talking over the phone, which I think is what we&#8217;re about to do, but that was actually really good. I like hearing that. That was really smart.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, something that you had mentioned to me before we had started recording was the parallels in your design career and your music career. I&#8217;d love to hear more about that.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. So I think more of that is just around the process of my approach. So I feel like all these things are kind of the same as far as the way that they&#8217;re made, right? You have layers in Photoshop and your music software, you have layers of instruments of tracks, right? The way you&#8217;re blending them, the way you&#8217;re using levels or curves or whatever. The same thing you do with mixing EQ, adding saturation to something, even the words, the semantics are similar in some cases.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
So historically I&#8217;ve never done both of them at the same time up until maybe the last few years where I&#8217;ve really taken the design and my music career as seriously as I am. But even outside of the actual creative part, you got to start making relationships. The way you&#8217;re talking to people about your design work and trying to sell them is a similar kind of passion and trust is being built when you&#8217;re trying to get gigs or just talk to people about your music.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve noticed as I do one more, I get better at the other one too. So they kind of lift each other up in separate ways. Well, separate ways, but they do the same thing. When do you do outreach or something like that, you&#8217;re campaigning yourself or your music stuff. When you start doing that in your design field, it&#8217;s a similar process. You&#8217;re running business, the concept of running a business is the same everywhere. You don&#8217;t need to know how to do that certain thing to operate the business so that you can scale it, right?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
I never realized that until recently, but just all that stuff it&#8217;s very similar, even if you know how to use Final Cut, you probably know how to use Ableton or Logic or something like that. But the way they use softwares and the process, the workflow to use them are all very similar.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
The buttons might be a little bit different, but if you get the concept behind how to use it, you&#8217;ll be able to apply it elsewhere.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. The thing is for those graphic tools, a lot of them borrow their UI from music tools. So the layers [crosstalk 00:48:26] and all that sort of stuff. Yeah, it&#8217;s all the same. So what is it that keeps you motivated and inspired these days? What keeps you going?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
I guess there&#8217;s a couple things, I guess first off, just my personal interest. I love what I&#8217;m doing. I love the fact that I can make money from my first two passions, even starting Majorminor and becoming successful with that. I feel blessed I&#8217;m able to do that because I need to be able to do something like this to wake up in the morning, and not become bored or anything like that. So I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m able to be self-sufficient as a man, as a person in society doing the thing that I love.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
So I used to tell people, &#8220;Oh, I got my second dream running the studio and we&#8217;re good.&#8221; But now I want to get my first dream and that&#8217;s to have a successful music career, at least doing music to a certain point. I don&#8217;t want to become famous or anything like that. But just being able to release music and work on it and have people make memories to it. I always have this idea where someone sees me on the street, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re that dude RCA. Hey, you made that beat. I met my girl that almost playing at the club or whatever. And we listen to it all the time, it&#8217;s a memory of ours now. I just want to say, thank you for that.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t know, man.&#8221; But that makes my day. It makes my whole life right there, hearing stuff like that. That&#8217;s from a personal kind of place. So my personal drive, that&#8217;s where that motivation comes from.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
I think the other part of it too specifically to design, and this is funny because this has changed a lot over the last, since I&#8217;ve been a student, but just having see another black person run a studio. I think a lot of times people just like the diversity and design. There&#8217;s people out there&#8217;s doing everything. But in certain places, I only know maybe three or four other studio heads that are black. And I know there&#8217;s more than that, but just personally know or have actually seen on the wild. It&#8217;s just good to see that because I&#8217;m always surprised when I&#8217;m on a company&#8217;s page and I see career director, black dude. Oh, cool. If we&#8217;re getting out there, not just as a team designer, but doing strategy or being the leadership part of the team.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
When I was a kid, I saw none of that. I was always the only black kid in my class historically. So it&#8217;s cool seeing all that change, even just giving back to the community in that way. Just being, not like they need to be the face of anything, but just having people see me in certain ways always feels really good. So that&#8217;s a big motivator too. And just doing kind of talks for kid&#8217;s school or portfolio reviews. I always try to show up to those whenever I can just to give back in the first place, but also represent that we&#8217;re out here like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you have any mentors or other peers that helped you along your design journey?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Not so much. I could call it mentors, but Armando Simmons, he was the first black student I had ever met. I was still in school and we talked a little bit after I met him when I was in school, but I wouldn&#8217;t call him mentor, but he definitely was a source of inspiration, just like, &#8220;Oh, shit. He&#8217;s doing and he&#8217;s been doing it for a minute too. And that stuff&#8217;s tight.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know, that was the first glimpse I got. And he was always really nice to just hang out and talk or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
But as far as mentors, not really. Maybe my professor&#8217;s like Gwen Amos and John Forrest at Sacramento State, they were really positive to me in that way. I always tell them whenever I see them, &#8220;You guys changed my life. If I hadn&#8217;t met you, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;d be doing. I&#8217;d probably be working at Target or something like that.&#8221; They put the effort, they saw the effort I was trying to put it in, and they put the effort back into me and they knew there was something there. So I really appreciate them taking the chance on me like that and just pouring some of my extra effort into someone that they felt was deserving of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Is this how you imagined your life would look like when you were a kid?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Absolutely not. And I&#8217;m glad because when I was a kid, my later life, I was always very nervous to get older because I had no idea what I was going to do. And that&#8217;s even from being a small child. Like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I want to do. I just want to make stuff, I don&#8217;t know what that means, making money, being a person in society and all that kind of stuff.&#8221; But then even as I got closer to becoming an adult, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, shit. I need to figure this out. I&#8217;m getting to a point where I&#8217;m going to be 20 years old. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
So I&#8217;d say maybe actually in the first time in my life, in the last 10 years, I&#8217;ve actually felt like, &#8220;Cool. Things didn&#8217;t work out the way I thought they were as a kid.&#8221; I&#8217;m super glad I&#8217;ve been able to do that for myself. And now it&#8217;s just sustaining that. What&#8217;s going to keep me going? What&#8217;s going to keep me excited in the same kind of rhythm that I have now, be able to do the things I would like to, and then still be able to make money from it, but then also add to other people&#8217;s lives? I can&#8217;t do this all on my own, so I hope whatever people that do get on the ride with me, they&#8217;re getting something out of it and are doing it not for just money, but there&#8217;s personal investment. That&#8217;s why I usually end up hiring a lot of my friends that are really close to me because they seem to be into what we&#8217;re doing. Yeah, it just feels good being able to contribute to their lives because they&#8217;re contributing back to me in that way by team and up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good one. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been talking about internally with the team and just even me thinking about it myself. One thing I&#8217;ve actually been doing, this is kind of like I guess one of the parallels with the music and the design stuff is doing more concert visuals. So I&#8217;ve been working on my own personal show, learning how to do visuals whether it&#8217;s a video synthesizer or software synthesizer or with after effects and premier and integrating that along with the music, whether it&#8217;s programmed and able to live or it&#8217;s just a movie that plays in the background or something with Resolume. And I guess that&#8217;s kind of the marriage of my two passions, as I&#8217;m saying it out loud is how can I bring these things together? And then also now start to offer that as a service and be able to do it for myself as well, too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Yeah. The best place to go. And we&#8217;re working on this now we&#8217;re on a new website, but you can find our stuff at majorminor.co. There&#8217;s a little bit of work on there, but if you&#8217;d like to see more, just feel free to email me, rob@majorminor.co. As far as the music stuff, you can go to rcawhatsgood.com. All the links are on there, IG, YouTube and just see what we&#8217;re all about and what I&#8217;m all about. The music stuff too. I think there&#8217;s a lot of parallels as far as the aesthetics and just how we approach design. You can see both those things on there. But yeah, if you have any other questions, feel free to hit me up on any of those platforms too. I&#8217;m always very responsive. I love talking to people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Rob Martin. I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. We kind of had talked a bit before we had started recording, but it&#8217;s amazing how much our journeys as entrepreneurs and even kind of as musicians in a way have kind of paralleled each other. I think it&#8217;s great that you&#8217;ve really been able to carve your own way and find your own way in the design industry really through hard work, luck and determination and just doing it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
As a musician, it&#8217;s always about practice makes perfect. We always hear that. But with business, oftentimes you don&#8217;t have the opportunity to do that because especially for your own business, everything that you do has to be contributing hopefully towards progressing the business. But it really sounds like with Majorminor going for 13 years now, you&#8217;re doing something good. You&#8217;re putting out good things out there in the world. You&#8217;re supporting the community as well. And I&#8217;m just so glad to have had you on the show to tell your story. So thank you for coming on. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Rob Martin:</b><br>
Right on. Thanks, Maurice. And just for you too, thank you for doing all of your past stuff. I remember we talked a lot back on the Slack channel. I don&#8217;t know if this still exists or not, but that was really great for you to support or just put out there for the community and everything you do. I&#8217;ve always seen it from afar, but I really got a lot of appreciation of what you do and just the fact you&#8217;ve been doing it for this long too, so right off for having me. I really appreciate it. I&#8217;ve been waiting to be on this for a minute too, so it finally happened.</p>
