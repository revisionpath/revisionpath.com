Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>What does accessibility design look like at the largest social media company in the world? According to this week&#8217;s guest, Tolu Adegbite, it&#8217;s a lot more than you may think! Between websites, apps, and devices, there are a lot of considerations to factor in, and Tolu&#8217;s unique background makes her well-equipped to solve these problems.</p>
<p>Tolu gave us a peek into the mood at Meta fresh off the launch of Threads, and she spoke about her day-to-day routine being on the company&#8217;s app design systems team. She also shared her story of starting out as a developer, and went into how recent current events inspired her to get more involved with including intersectionality as a key factor in her work. Tolu&#8217;s also writing her first book, so she talked about how she juggles that with also being a graduate student. </p>
<p>Tolu is a great example of how using your life experiences can shape your creative perspectives!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Hi. My name is Tolu Adegbite. I&#8217;m a product designer. Currently in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. And I work on inclusive design. Right now I work at Meta, specifically working on Facebook, the design system, and making that as inclusive as possible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Nice. How has your year been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>My year so far has been really interesting. I think this year started off kind of tough. There were a lot of just layoffs happening in tech. I felt like everywhere I looked on social media, there were just like a lot of sad messages, layoffs people having to really rejig their lives. So I kind of took a step back. I got rid of most of my social media accounts, which is kind of ironic seeing as I work for a social media company, but I really needed to take some time out to get in a better headspace because of all the tough stuff that was going on. But now I&#8217;m definitely feeling a lot more optimistic. I feel like things are turning around, so I&#8217;m feeling good about the year from here on out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, look, I can tell you as someone that also was laid off during that time, I know what you mean about sort of retreating from social media and just seeing all of that as it takes place. Because there was a period last year where I felt like there were layoffs happening every week for like a few months. And not in small numbers either. It&#8217;s like 200 people here, 1,000 people here, and it can be super demoralizing, especially if you&#8217;re somewhere and you&#8217;ve survived a layoff like that. Survivor&#8217;s guilt. It&#8217;s bad and social media just compounds upon it.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. I totally agree. I know so many people who experienced the same thing, but for the people who weren&#8217;t laid off, there definitely is that survivor&#8217;s guilt. Looking around, realizing that it could have just as easily have been you. It was a really unusual way to start the year, especially given last year was the complete opposite. Everyone and their dog had gotten a new job and was talking about it on LinkedIn.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And this is independent of, sort of, talks about layoffs. Social media as a concept has been in a tailspin this year, particularly with the advent of new services &#8212; and we&#8217;ll talk about Threads &#8212; but with the advent of new services and stuff like that, it&#8217;s causing a lot of people to sort of re-examine their relationship to social media. Like&#8230;we&#8217;ll just talk about it. Twitter is crumbling at the moment and people are looking at all these different alternatives to possibly go it could be on Spill, they could go on BlueSky, they could go on Mastodon, et cetera. And it&#8217;s causing some people to say, &#8220;you know what? What if I just divest altogether from social media and not use any of these new platforms?&#8221; It&#8217;s an interesting time to be a social media user, I think.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>It definitely is. I feel like for so long it&#8217;s been a source of a lot of community. I am a chronic lurker. So for years I would lurk on Twitter without ever having an account. But I don&#8217;t think you can even do that anymore. I definitely can&#8217;t see accounts now that I&#8217;m not currently on Twitter, so it&#8217;s definitely an interesting time. Definitely more difficult to look in from the outside if you are also a chronic lurker like I am.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I hear you. Yeah. Twitter is becoming a walled garden. Some of these other places are similarly like that, where maybe you can only see a couple of things, but you have to join. And it would be one thing if the social media were more inherently social, but then it&#8217;s like tied up with algorithms and data collection, and you&#8217;re just like, I just want to talk to my friends and see what they&#8217;re doing and look at cute pictures and all that sort of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, especially since the pandemic. I think social media started being a major source of interaction for me during those, what, like, years that we couldn&#8217;t really do much in Ontario. Our laws were pretty intense about lockdown. There was a point in time where you couldn&#8217;t even leave your apartment. You couldn&#8217;t go outside with anyone who you didn&#8217;t live with. So social media was pretty much as much as I interacted with my friends and people that I knew.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. What do you want to try to accomplish for the rest of this year?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about my mindset and perspective on my career. I&#8217;m going to keep it short, but ultimately, I think as a Black woman growing up in this country, I&#8217;ve learned to present kind of a palatable version of myself. And I realize in the work world, it doesn&#8217;t always translate to where I want to go in my career and I&#8217;m having to show up differently. I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time thinking about that, and I&#8217;m really focused on my career this year, where I want it to go and how I think my skill set can kind of propel my career forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Can you expand on that a little bit?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. I&#8217;m one of those people who I think, lived in a fantasy land. When I was a kid, I was in my head so much, so I really remember my childhood very well. And I remember as far back as grade one, grade two, sitting in class, feeling like I had to be really good. I don&#8217;t think I could put it to words back then, but there definitely was this feeling that in order for me to not be seen as a problematic child, that I had to present myself in a certain way. I had to be super smart. I had to always be raising my hand and giving answers. I had to be super nice to the people in my class. I just had to be the best student, a model student, and I&#8217;ve definitely taken that through with me today. I feel like I&#8217;m a compulsive people pleaser. And that doesn&#8217;t really translate well into the workplace, especially when you want to take on leadership roles.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. These companies will drain everything out of you and ask for more, so I know exactly what that feeling can be like of always trying to make sure that you&#8217;re showing up in the right way and doing the right things. And oftentimes, even if you&#8217;re doing that, just how you&#8217;re presented in the workplace, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that it&#8217;s going to have a good effect, which can be a bit jarring, I think, especially if you&#8217;re early in your career, it can be a bit jarring because everything that you&#8217;ve been sort of told and seen has been to that point where that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re supposed to do, that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re being told that you have to present and do. And then you get in the workplace and they&#8217;re like&#8230;not so much. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily translate that way.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Especially starting my career as a developer, I definitely did not think about this stuff nearly as much. But I feel like as a designer, half of your craft is just how you show up. You could have the most amazing ideas and innovative, I don&#8217;t know, ideas for apps and ideas. But if you don&#8217;t show up in the right way, if you&#8217;re not confident, no one is really going to take your idea on board as well as if you show up in a certain way, which is really interesting to me. Half of this job is just how you present yourself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. I&#8217;m thinking of like ten to fifteen years ago, when conversations around Black folks in technology, particularly around this new area of tech with social media and stuff like that, and how those conversations have went about and how people are trying to present themselves and making sure that you were a part of all this. It&#8217;s kind of amazing that even now, after all of that, that these are still sort of such big concerns, because company culture &#8212; trust me when I tell you this &#8212; company culture has changed a lot. Like a lot, a lot since then, but yet these are still kind of these pervasive things that mostly people of color have to deal with.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Now that you bring that up, I feel like life kind of exists as life before and after the pandemic, but similarly life before and after George Floyd. And I think I saw a complete kind of change in how I think about work, in what we&#8217;re allowed to say, what we&#8217;re not allowed to say after that. I feel like that completely changed my career. It was recent, but a lot of conversations have happened since then. A lot of conversations that I don&#8217;t think would have happened before George Floyd.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious about this because you&#8217;re in Canada and granted, you know what you&#8217;re mentioning, like with George Floyd and things, this is like&#8230;I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s a uniquely American issue, but certainly it&#8217;s something that people worldwide have been able to resonate with. I&#8217;m just kind of curious know, you being from Canada, growing up in Canada, and now having to sort of hear about these issues and see how it affects your workplace. Like, how does that make you feel?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I think growing up in Canada is really interesting. Our proximity to the U.S. makes it so that sometimes I&#8217;m more aware of American news than I am of Canadian news. Our Canadian news sources are definitely talking about American news, but we definitely felt it up here too. I think there&#8217;s this perception that these are problems that are unique to America. They&#8217;re really not. Whenever I go to the U.S. and I meet Black folks, one thing that really strikes me is that very often I&#8217;m asked, &#8220;is there racism in Canada?&#8221; And it really breaks my heart in a way that the thought of Black Americans is like, is there a place out there where this doesn&#8217;t exist? And the answer is no, it exists up here too. But it&#8217;s definitely a different brand. I think Canadian culture kind of makes it more covert, it&#8217;s less out there than it is in America. But we definitely had those conversations. Definitely was a reckoning here too, but probably not to the extent that Americans dealt with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Hmm. Well, I&#8217;m not going to stay on this. This is not a nationalist podcast about, you know, issues like this. I want to talk about you and your work, so let&#8217;s go into that. So you&#8217;re a product designer at Meta. Tell me more about kind of the work you&#8217;re doing there. You mentioned you&#8217;re on the, sort of, Facebook product. Like, talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I know that when Meta came out as a brand, there was some confusion, but I&#8217;ll just explain it for folks who are listening. Meta is the parent umbrella company that is an umbrella over Facebook. WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, Reality Labs, all that stuff. So Meta is the parent company over Facebook. So yes, I work at Meta, but specifically, mostly on Facebook at this moment in time. And it&#8217;s been really interesting. I think there&#8217;s a very specific external perception, and we&#8217;re not going to talk about that too much. But I will say working at Facebook at Meta, one thing that I&#8217;ve been really surprised by is just the amount of attention that&#8217;s paid to accessibility and inclusive design. It&#8217;s definitely a bigger topic here than it&#8217;s been probably anywhere else I&#8217;ve worked, which is really incredible. Yeah, it&#8217;s really incredible. And I&#8217;m excited that I&#8217;m here at this point in my career that I don&#8217;t have to fight and explain why what I do is important and we&#8217;re just getting to the work and trying to make these products as accessible and inclusive as possible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Tell me more about what does a typical day look like for you? Are you working with a team? Are you working remotely in the office? Like, what does that look like?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>So I work remotely from Toronto. There are several of us here, but not a lot. Most of my coworkers are in the U.S. on the West Coast, in California. But a typical day looks like&#8230;it looks like a lot of conversations with the design systems team; accessibility falls under that team. We do a lot of the typical stuff. We do crits, we talk about components, we talk about the future of our design system. But we spend a lot of time actually thinking about how to make these things considering the largest number of people. When you work on a product that touches billions of people, it really is a huge consideration and something that we spend a lot of time thinking about and talking about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, I know you mentioned you&#8217;re not going to get too much into Facebook stuff. We&#8217;re not going to dive into that too much. But on the show a couple of episodes ago, I talked with Kevin Tufts. He&#8217;s a product designer. He works&#8230;I think he works moreso on the Instagram side from what he mentioned to me. But when we had talked before, this was prior to the release of Threads, which is an Instagram app very similar to Twitter in that it&#8217;s sort of this microblogging platform that you can basically put out&#8230;I mean, I&#8217;m saying &#8220;tweets&#8221;, but you can put out these small posts. It&#8217;s connected in a way to Instagram in that you can share to and from things like that. And that just came out a couple of weeks ago. It&#8217;s had massive appeal. I think there&#8217;s up to 30 million plus people that joined within the first 24 hours or so. </p>
<p>Knowing that, what is the internal mood at Facebook like? Because Facebook has taken some knocks. They&#8217;ve had layoffs, there&#8217;s been the whole thing about the metaverse, et cetera. But now it seems like Facebook&#8217;s got like a win in the win column. Like, what&#8217;s it like there?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>You know, internally the feeling is really optimistic. There&#8217;s some really tangible excitement and that&#8217;s a really nice feeling, especially after how things have been in the tech industry lately. You can tell people are really excited and it&#8217;s awesome. So many people are trying it out themselves, wanting to test, wanting to dog food, kind of to make sure everything&#8217;s working as it should. So it feels really awesome to see that kind of excitement and it definitely is energizing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Does any of your work deal with Threads in any way?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Not so much. It&#8217;s mostly falling under Instagram, so they kind of do their thing. But there definitely are conversations, especially when it comes to inclusive design concepts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to be really interested to see how Threads and these other similar services are going to play out in the market over the next few years. It&#8217;s not the first time that there have been a number of Twitter-like clones that have come out trying to unseat Twitter. And I think I mentioned this actually, I don&#8217;t know if I mentioned this on the show &#8212; I might have mentioned it a couple of episodes ago &#8212; but right around like 2006, 2007 when Twitter was starting to sort of come out of its quote-unquote &#8220;beta phase&#8221;, but it was becoming more popular and more well known. There were a number of other services that tried to compete for that same market share. There was Yammer. There was Pownce. Jaiku. Oh, God&#8230;it&#8217;s Plurk. That&#8217;s what it was. Plurk is another one. And they were all kind of trying to sort of compete for that same space of like &#8220;we also want to be a microblogging platform.&#8221; And this is prior to what people know of Twitter as now. This was 2007, because Twitter had pivoted from this podcasting startup. Actually, I don&#8217;t know if a lot of people know that it started out as this podcasting startup called Odeo &#8212; O-D-E-O &#8212; and then they pivoted into this sort of microblogging-esque platform around 2006. </p>
<p>So I&#8217;m just curious to see how they will fare because a lot of those services now got bought by bigger companies and then they shut them down or they&#8217;re just super popular in other countries and not so much here in the U.S. I know people are trying to migrate to Threads, migrate to BlueSky, migrate to Mastodon, et cetera. I&#8217;m still kind of taking a wait-and-see approach to see where the masses go or where the conversation &#8212; or really where the culture &#8212; ends up moving towards. I mean culture in a broader sense, not just like Black folks, but where the general Internet culture is going to migrate towards because it eventually will settle honestly into one place. Like it&#8217;s not going to be, I think as splintered as it is right now.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I hope that happens, you know, for the culture. I really do miss Black Twitter. That was amazing. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s still happening because I can&#8217;t see Twitter, but I would be really happy if everyone ended up kind of in the same space. That would really be ideal for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, only time will tell. I think it&#8217;s way too early now for anyone to really be able to pontificate on who&#8217;s going to, quote unquote, win. Still a little early to tell.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, we can check back in in a bit and see where this all lands.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Speaking of that, Facebook&#8217;s coming up on its 20th anniversary next year. What do you think their place is now in this modern Internet age?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s an interesting thought. I definitely remember when Facebook became a thing, probably when I was in elementary school, high school maybe. It&#8217;s interesting to see how it&#8217;s progressed now, how the audience has kind of like grown and changed and shifted. I think Mark Zuckerberg has been really good. historically, he&#8217;s made a lot of good bets. Things are going really well. He&#8217;s invested in the right places. And I think going forward it&#8217;s still going to remain like a powerhouse. There are billions of users, there&#8217;s a really big international presence, and I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s necessarily going to change. My great aunt uses WhatsApp. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to change anytime soon, but I think we&#8217;ll definitely continue to see maybe things change, but I don&#8217;t really foresee it, I don&#8217;t know, going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, that international presence is also, you know, there&#8217;s all these other products that are not just Facebook. You mentioned WhatsApp I know there&#8217;s different versions of Facebook in other countries like Facebook Lite, et cetera, and&#8230;it&#8217;s not the number one website in the world by accident. In some places, Facebook is the internet. So to kind guess, you know, prematurely call it dying. Like I&#8217;ve heard a lot, certainly here in the like Facebook&#8217;s everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s growing and changing. And I think Threads is a really big testament to the team being willing to kind of go where the audience needs them to grow with the audience and the base. So that&#8217;s pretty awesome to see.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, seeing that Facebook has that global footprint, let&#8217;s talk more about what you do in terms of accessibility. Can you kind of touch on how your work affects different products at Facebook?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>So I started out as a developer, like I mentioned before. Kind of fell into right out of school working on web accessibility, so finding accessibility issues, fixing them&#8230;, So when I say accessibility issues, I mean things like color contrast. If you go on a website and you can&#8217;t see the text because the color contrast is too low. Or visible focus indicators, if you&#8217;re pressing the Tab button to navigate through a form and you can&#8217;t see where your cursor is. So things like that eventually morphed into working on it from the product design angle. </p>
<p>But it&#8217;s been really energizing to come here and see that this is a focus area and be able to work on these parts of the app design system before they make it to people and starting at that stage. So there&#8217;s a small but passionate team working on that. And I kind of see my role on that team as coming from external places that talked about web accessibility and tried fixing it, working on it in multiple different ways. But these days one of the things I&#8217;m really most passionate about is inclusive design and specifically what intersectionality means in the context of all these things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Talk about that a bit more.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. So I&#8217;ll tell you how I started thinking about that. </p>
<p>I worked at Shopify a few years ago, and while I was there, I wrote an article for the blog. I can&#8217;t really remember why it came to mind. Probably still the fallout of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protest in the U.S., but I was thinking a lot about what this means for accessibility. So there&#8217;s this awesome woman &#8212; she wrote this book called &#8220;Haben: The Deafblind Woman Who Conquered Harvard.&#8221; She was the first deafblind person to ever graduate from Harvard Law, which is a pretty massive deal, in part because before she started at Harvard Law, there were not materials that existed for a deafblind person to make it through the program. Right? Like, they didn&#8217;t have access to braille for all their materials. They didn&#8217;t have, necessarily maybe, interpreters&#8230;things like that. And she got through it. I was really touched by her story, but also her social media presence. She talks a lot about her experience as a deafblind woman who is of African descent. She made a post in particular talking about how when she interacts with other blind people, they almost always assume that she&#8217;s white. And that really got me thinking. Why is that? </p>
<p>It got me thinking, especially [as] someone who works in inclusive design about things like alternative text. So, you know, when you go on a website and the image is broken and you see a little bit of text, like dog, you see that text. If someone has put an alternative text attribute, which basically is what someone using something like a screen reader would hear, when their screen reader hits that image, they would hear whatever alternative text you put on it. If you put any. And oftentimes if a website even has alternative text, it&#8217;s very basic. Let&#8217;s say we go on a news website and there&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know, a picture of a farmer. It might say farmer standing on a field, but it won&#8217;t really say anything about what the farmer looks like. Typically when we do that, I guess in a society where white is kind of the majority is seen as the default, you kind of implicitly are sending the message that this person is white, right? Yeah, it really got me thinking. </p>
<p>I noodled on that for a really long time, and I thought about my own experiences in elementary school. I was one of those kids who had begged to stay inside at recess, so I&#8217;d go to the library and read by myself. I read a lot of books, and I actually didn&#8217;t read a single book with a Black main character probably until middle school. And up until that point, I kid you not, I just assumed that people didn&#8217;t write books about Black people. It never even occurred to me that I just wasn&#8217;t coming across books with Black main characters for a reason. And so I was like, &#8220;okay, this is absolutely an accessibility issue.&#8221; Let&#8217;s write an article about it. </p>
<p>And I did, and initially actually, it&#8217;s a little bit controversial. It initially was not approved to be published, which was interesting, but eventually the editorial team was like, &#8220;okay, we&#8217;ll publish it.&#8221; But my one condition was, &#8220;okay, we cannot publish it during Black History Month.&#8221; I&#8217;m not going to publish this during Black History Month because I don&#8217;t want this to be like a topic that we relegate to Black History Month and never again. But I wrote that article, and it was the first time I&#8217;ve ever gotten hate mail. So believe it or not, some folks from the inclusive design community, I&#8217;m assuming it was those folks who were reading it, some people made fake email accounts and just, like, sent me hate mail. And I was like, &#8220;wow, this is kind of wild, kind of offensive.&#8221; But I&#8217;m like, you know what? If this is upsetting people to the extent where they&#8217;re sending me hate mail about it and telling me that race is irrelevant to people who are blind, then it means that I need to talk a lot more about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, look, I can tell you, as someone that has done a podcast where I talk to Black designers, I can completely believe that you got sent hate mail because people are really shook by the acknowledgment of race. Like, what you&#8217;re saying is not pinpointing this on any specific person or people. You&#8217;re saying like, &#8220;this is a behavior that needs to be corrected for greater context.&#8221; And then people are sending you hate because you want clarification. It&#8217;s madness. But I can 100% believe that you got that, which I&#8217;m sorry to hear that you&#8217;ve gotten that, but unfortunately, I can believe it.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And I guess people had very strong reactions. But I guess working in accessibility, you kind of have these rose-colored glasses &#8212; or I did &#8212; thinking that, okay, this is a space where we&#8217;re talking about exclusion. We&#8217;re talking about people who are from marginalized groups. There absolutely should be a conversation about this. And I was really surprised that that conversation wasn&#8217;t necessarily welcome, which tells me that the folks who have the loudest voices in this community are maybe from one marginalized group, but aren&#8217;t seeing the intersection with others. Like the experience of a white woman who is blind is going to be very different from Black African immigrant who is blind, who is deafblind. And I think having more conversations about that is really important. But I&#8217;ve just really learned that for some reason, these conversations have not been at the forefront of the inclusive design movement. That tells me I need to talk about it more.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Do you think that it&#8217;s getting better?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m seeing enough conversations happen about it. The vast majority of people I know who work in inclusive design are white people. And I inherently&#8230;obviously the people who are going to talk about this issue the best are the people who&#8217;ve experienced it, right? So I think getting more Black folks in the inclusive design community will make it so that those conversations happen more often. But of course, people who don&#8217;t experience kind of what happens at these intersections of multiple marginalized identities, of course they can&#8217;t talk about it. They definitely shouldn&#8217;t be silencing us either.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Now, we&#8217;ve talked a lot about. Your work, what you&#8217;re doing at Facebook, et cetera. Let&#8217;s kind of shift gears and learn more about you as a person, as a designer. Tell me about where you grew up. Are you originally from Toronto?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. So I was born in Nigeria in a place called Il√©-If·∫πÃÄ, and I moved here when I was about four years old, and I&#8217;ve lived in the greater Toronto area, like, Toronto, the towns in and outside of it ever since. So I definitely feel very Canadian. But at the same time, I think a lot about my culture. I speak Yoruba. My parents speak Yoruba. To me, we&#8217;re immigrants, and it&#8217;s something that I think a lot about. Even though I think people often don&#8217;t read me as an immigrant, maybe because of my accent, I think it&#8217;s still a very important part of my identity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Were you exposed to a lot of design and stuff growing up?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely not. I did not think this was a job, which is why I started out as a developer. I felt like that&#8217;s the closest I could get to making things online look nice. When I told my parents that I was going to do design, I think there was a bit of a freak out. My mom was like, &#8220;what are you going to design? Like, houses?&#8221; There definitely was a disconnect in what that meant. But yeah, it&#8217;s interesting what design actually means on the inside. It&#8217;s been really amazing, and I think there&#8217;s, like, nothing else I&#8217;d rather be doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now you ended up going to the University of Toronto. Tell me about sort of, like, what your time was like there and whether it really kind of helped you once you got out there as a working designer.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I went to U of T for my undergrad. I studied psychology. U of T was the first university I kind of knew of in Toronto. There&#8217;s kind of this joke in the Nigerian community that U of T, for some reason, is like, the only university Nigerian people in Nigeria know about. So when I was little, my dad would take us there, take us to downtown, and he asked me once, when I was like, maybe five or six years old, :which university are you going to go to?&#8221; And I looked around and we were at U of T. So I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go to the University of Toronto.&#8221; And then I kind of did. </p>
<p>I think in my head I thought I would always go there because it&#8217;s just the one that I knew of. So that was really interesting. I learned so much studying psychology, and it&#8217;s probably very cliche because I know it&#8217;s, like, one of the most common undergrads that people take. But I learned so much about myself and the way that I look at the world in classes like sex roles and gender and cultural psychology, I just completely shifted my worldview. How I think of things, especially as an immigrant. When my parents and I argue, I look at it from a cultural psychology lens. Why are we arguing? It&#8217;s because our collectivistic versus individualistic outlooks on the world are colliding. So I think it definitely helped shift how I look at the world. And I think that&#8217;s been really important as a designer to not singularly look at things from this individualistic lens, but think of things from kind of how alternate cultures will look at things. And I think I definitely live in between two cultures, so maybe it makes it a little bit easier to shift my mindset.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And I would imagine, kind of with the work you&#8217;re doing with inclusive design and accessibility, that psychology background is probably super helpful.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to think so. I definitely try to look at it from that perspective. But ultimately, there&#8217;s so many different disabilities that people have, you&#8217;re never going to understand necessarily where all your users are coming from. So I try to, I don&#8217;t know, stay humble, try to not fall into that all-knowing designer kind of stereotype.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, I think at least it probably gives you some empathy into knowing what those kind of different disabilities would be. So tell me about your early sort of post grad career. I know you ended up working for Publicis Sapient as a product designer and as a developer, and you were there for a little over three years. Talk to me about what that experience was like.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yes. So after undergrad, I was like, okay, psychology is awesome, but what am I going to do now? And I kind of just went online trying to find interesting things to do, and I was like, oh, web development looks cool. I could do that. So I studied web development for a year at Humber, and then I started working at Sapient as a web developer. That was really interesting in that I worked mostly on websites, on the digital side of things, worked on a lot of different things. But it was also my first time working with designers, UX designers and visual designers. And I just kind of spent a lot of time working with them. I felt like they were kind of like my people. We talked a lot about how users might think about their perspectives, and I was like, I kind of want to do this. I feel like I could do this. Eventually, I convinced my very supportive director to let me kind of dabble in both, and eventually I moved over to UX.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, usually when I think about designers that are working at an ad agency &#8212; that&#8217;s what Sapient is &#8212; it&#8217;s moreso, like visual design or art director or creative director. But you were working on the development side. So they had, like an in-house team, it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. So we&#8217;d work on different accounts, creating their websites or digital campaigns, like mini microsites and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And you said this is your first time kind of working with UX designers and such; did that give you a greater sense of the type of work that you could be doing?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I had no idea that that job even existed. I think I always have loved creativity. I love art. I took art in grade eleven. Grade twelve. I took art as often as I could. I would go to art classes. But there was this one art class I took where the teacher told me I had no technical talent, and I kind of believed her. So for years&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I know, right? She was kind of right. But for years, I felt like I couldn&#8217;t even broach that world. I didn&#8217;t draw anymore. I didn&#8217;t paint anymore. I was never very good, but there were fun things to do outside of work. But for the first time, I saw design through a lens of not necessarily being making pretty things, but working on creating products and functional things that could exist in the real world, in the digital world. And I felt like I was more able to do that. I&#8217;m not going to be able to produce a beautiful oil painting rendering of you, but I can definitely design a landing page or a form. So I think that kind of work really appeals to me. It feels very logical in a way that appeals to me, but also creative in that you&#8217;re bringing together these elements in a way that kind of makes sense for your audience. But to me, it&#8217;s like the most creative job, even though you&#8217;re not necessarily making anything visually, like, groundbreaking or anything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now back then, were you focused on inclusive design and accessibility, or is that something which kind of came about later on in your career?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I think starting as a developer working on web accessibility, it definitely was the lens through which I always wanted to work in UX design, product design. And it was kind of how I made my case in that we didn&#8217;t have a lot of people who are specializing in accessibility, but even fewer who did that from the product design side of things. So I was able to make a case for that need on the team by working on things through that lens.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, after you were working at Sapient, you worked at Shopify for a while, which you kind of mentioned a bit earlier. Tell me about that experience. I&#8217;ve heard that their internal design culture there is really good. Is that what your experience was like?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I felt like their culture was really intentional, and it kind of presented design through a different lens for me. Yet again, that&#8217;s when I started thinking of design not only looking like building interfaces, but building your team, building very intentional relationships with your partners in product management, in development. Yeah, definitely very intentional. Definitely lots of process behind the way that things were done. It was a really nice way to broaden my horizons I feel it was a really good experience. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And from a design perspective, what sort of things were you working on there at Shopify?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>At Shopify, I specifically worked on Shopify Fulfillment Network, which &#8212; rest in peace &#8212; they had a recent round of layoffs, which is basically shedding that part of the company. But it was kind of their answer to Amazon Fulfillment. It was enabling merchants, small merchants, to ship out things from warehouses from centralized locations. And I felt like design was just taken very seriously there. </p>
<p>I was working on a project to build, like, a system for the warehouse. And so I started by requesting a visit to the warehouse because I had never visited a warehouse before. And so I went to a warehouse. I worked there for a couple of days, chatted with all the folks on the ground and yeah, got to experience the warehouse through their eyes, I guess. And then I went to start doing the design work, but it felt like they took it so seriously. They actually listened to me. They actually let me experience what I was designing for. And that was really cool. That&#8217;s still, I think, one of the most maybe interesting projects I&#8217;ve worked on. I feel like it was kind of like that seminal project that I worked on that made me officially a designer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I get what you&#8217;re saying. Yeah. Sometimes once you start to get that internal validation, or rather I would say, once you get that external validation from your team, that the work that you&#8217;re doing is making that impact, it does so much for morale. It does so much for sort of just building yourself up as a designer to know that you are making good decisions and that you&#8217;re doing good work.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. I guess it brought that aspect of maybe what I love about psychology, getting to understand other people into it. It wasn&#8217;t just sitting in a room and I guess making decisions from afar.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Now, you&#8217;re also currently working on a book about intersectionality and design, which we&#8217;ll get to. But before we talk about that, I&#8217;d love for you to kind of give your definition of inclusive design. What does it mean to you and why? Is it something that other designers should be sort of aware of as they work?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I think inclusive design to me is going beyond just compliance and following accessibility laws and making sure you&#8217;re up to code. It&#8217;s about truly designing for a variety of experiences to make a good experience for the variety of users that you have, whether that&#8217;s users with disabilities or users without disabilities, maybe users with temporary or situational disabilities. </p>
<p>But for me, specifically, bringing intersectionality into it is what I thought of a lot after know those few rounds of hate mail. I think that word is so often kind of divorced from where it initially came, intersectionality. Kimberl√© Crenshaw, like, that whole thing was about the multiple types of oppression that Black women experience, right? Like the misogyny and the racism, how does that intersect to create a unique social experience for Black women? Let&#8217;s pivot and look at accessibility in that same way. How does being disabled and being a Black person, being a brown person, being an immigrant, how do those things intersect to create a unique experience of disability, of exclusion, but kind of bringing Black folks back into that conversation? I&#8217;ve had experiences where I&#8217;ve seen people use the word intersectionality, and never do they even mention Kimberl√© Crenshaw or Black people, which I&#8217;m like&#8230;.that&#8217;s wild. That&#8217;s where the word came from. So I think we need to have those conversations. I think we need to acknowledge where this word came from, what the concept means. Kimberl√© Crenshaw&#8230;shout out to her. She is still making books. She&#8217;s still writing things. She&#8217;s still talking about this. We need to acknowledge where this term came from and what it actually means.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, how does this sort of factor into the work that you&#8217;re doing with your book? Is it kind of expounding on this in terms of design?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I think what I&#8217;m hoping to do is have more conversations about this. Get people thinking about it, get people to understand that just like a lot of other places in tech in which we have kind of our dominant group in society, white men driving things, it&#8217;s the same thing in the disability movement right now, in the accessibility movement right now. And that needs to shift in order for the accessibility movement to truly be helpful for people who are not kind of the dominant societal group, right? People of color, immigrants are more likely to be disabled because of things like environmental racism, less access to essential health care. It absolutely is an important conversation to have because we make up so much of the body of disabled people in our countries.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I remember super early conversations around web accessibility back when I was &#8212; oh, God, I keep aging myself when I say these things &#8212; back when I was designing websites in 2005, and even just trying to advocate for alt text on images and being told that, &#8220;oh, well, that&#8217;s only for disabled people and they&#8217;re not really using the web and stuff like that.&#8221; And I know that a lot of the technology around accessibility has increased, especially as browsers have gotten better. but I remember when it was just like pulling teeth to get people to even consider accessibility when it came to their work. They just wanted to make interesting, cool stuff online and didn&#8217;t think about anybody, but just impressing, I don&#8217;t know, other designers or friends of theirs, not thinking about who the people were that could possibly be using the thing that you&#8217;re designing.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, and I think in some circles that&#8217;s still the situation, unfortunately. But I think a lot of people maybe don&#8217;t know people who are disabled or like a lot of folks don&#8217;t maybe or didn&#8217;t know people who are Black in the past and that kind of painted their worldview on who Black people are. But if you know people who are disabled like anyone else, people who are disabled just want to have their independence and be able to do things that everyone else does. So if we don&#8217;t make our banking website accessible, the consequence of that is&#8230;the real world consequence is that someone out there needs to trust a third party to handle their money, and that&#8217;s not really a situation that would be acceptable to anyone else. So why should we subject disabled people to that experience? </p>
<p>I definitely think that things like laws and getting sued and lawsuits are a big reason why people are starting to care. Companies are starting to care, net-net honestly, if that&#8217;s what gets them to make their websites accessible, that&#8217;s fine with me. Be nice if it came from a place of &#8220;this is what&#8217;s right,&#8221; but if it&#8217;s going to come from the law, that&#8217;s cool too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I totally agree with that. Having that accountability is unfortunately the only way that some companies are going to make that happen. Like they have to be fined or otherwise censured in order for them to actually take it seriously.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. And if that&#8217;s what gets us where we need to be and having the right conversations, I can live with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a book on inclusive design written by Regin√© Gilbert. She&#8217;s been on the show a few times actually, who wrote &#8220;Inclusive Design for a Digital World&#8221;. Really great book. If people are listening and they want to just learn more about this, they should check that out. But I&#8217;m super interested in seeing what your book is going to be like when it comes out because I think definitely what you mentioned with intersectionality and race as it relates to design is something that is still super important, especially during this current &#8212; I guess you could say in the U.S. &#8212; this current political climate. But I think it&#8217;s probably worldwide or starting to become worldwide as it relates to things like critical race theory and things like that, where things are being either rewritten or omitted that just leave race out of it or completely rewrite history in some odd ways. So I&#8217;m really going to be interested to see the reception that your book gets once it&#8217;s out.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I am interested in seeing myself finish writing it. I&#8217;ll definitely keep you posted. I&#8217;m excited to have this conversation; hopefully get less hate mail this time. But yeah, the fact that people have reacted so strongly to conversations about that tells me that we need to have more of those conversations and it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re not talking about enough right now. But we definitely have folks who are starting to build that conversation. So I&#8217;m excited to join the chat.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So between your product design work that you&#8217;re doing at Meta, you&#8217;re writing this book, I think you also mentioned a bit earlier that you&#8217;re in another educational program. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s right. So I&#8217;m starting a Masters of Inclusive Design program at OCAD U. So kind of a funny name, but Ontario College of Art and Design&#8230;University? It recently became a university. I&#8217;m so so excited about that. It&#8217;s a really small program, but it&#8217;s been really foundational in the accessibility and inclusive design community. And I&#8217;m excited to be surrounded by people who&#8217;ve done a lot of thought in this area and just to absorb their knowledge and learn from them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I know Dr. Dori Tunstall was the dean there. She just came out with a book recently called &#8220;Decolonizing Design&#8221;, but I think she recently stepped down. And there&#8217;s another Black woman or BIPOC woman that&#8217;s stepping up as dean, I think.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, Dori&#8217;s amazing. I ran into her on the street in Toronto once and I talked to her for a while and she was super nice, and I was like, a weirdo. But she played a huge part in the creation of this program, actually, and in making it actually truly inclusive. This program has, like, remote and asynchronous options. It has options for folks who have to work while doing the program. And I&#8217;ve never really come across a program quite like that. So when Dori says inclusive design, Dori means inclusive design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s awesome. Yeah, I had her on the show back in&#8230;oh God, 2015. Maybe she&#8217;s like episode 107 or something like that. At the time, she was still teaching in Australia. She was still teaching at Swinburne. This is before she came back to North America. So it&#8217;s been amazing to see just her glow up and change and really how fiercely she&#8217;s advocated for decolonizing design and inclusivity in her work. It&#8217;s been really a powerful thing to see.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And it&#8217;s one thing to say it, but actually doing it and creating a course that&#8217;s actually centered around being inclusive and providing multiple ways of learning where you&#8217;re able to codesign your education, that&#8217;s just walking the walk. And I really admire that. I never come across another higher education program like that, and I hope other programs take note and we can see more options for inclusive education.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So, Tolu, what does your downtime look like? I mean, I imagine a lot of this work takes up a lot of just, like, brain space and things like that. What do you do in your downtime?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on that. I feel like I&#8217;ve been called by people in my life a bit of a workaholic, and I&#8217;m trying to just find hobbies that do not necessarily relate to my work. I&#8217;ve been doing some photography lately, which is fun. I really love plants. Trying to spend more time outside, but also watching movies, shows. Again, I feel like you really can&#8217;t unsee inclusive design. Right now. I&#8217;m watching &#8220;I&#8217;m A Virgo&#8221; about a 13 foot tall Black man from Oakland trying to find his way in the world. So, yeah, I really enjoy things like that. I need to get out more. But I love movies. I love film.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I need to catch &#8220;I&#8217;m A Virgo.&#8221; I know it just came out, I think last month &#8212; we&#8217;re recording in July. This will air in September. But I think it came out like June-ish something like that. I need to check it out because I&#8217;ve heard it&#8217;s really good.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never seen anything like it. It&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What are some pieces of advice that you kind of find yourself coming back to? This could be, like, life advice, career advice, et cetera.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>This sounds kind of silly, but I say this. I think this is a quote from Winston Churchill, who is otherwise very problematic, but &#8220;when you&#8217;re going through hell, keep going.&#8221; Honestly, whenever something weird happens, something demotivating happens, I just think of that and I find it incredibly motivating. If you&#8217;re in hell, why would you stop there? You got to keep going so you at least move yourself out of hell. I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;m in hell, but I find that quote really motivating and I think of it often.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Who are some of the mentors that have kind of helped you out in your career? And these could be peers as well, but who are some people that have really kind of helped you to get to where you are today?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Oh, my gosh. Basically everyone you&#8217;ve talked to on this podcast. But I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to have some really amazing mentors in my time. The person who I worked with at my first company, Allison Walton, who got me started in web accessibility, amazing mentor. Zoltan Hawryluk, who I worked with as a developer, I got to dip some of him once a month. Just people who have been in the industry for a really long time have taught me so much. Tory Hargro, who works at Meta, has been such an incredible mentor to me. He&#8217;s amazing and he&#8217;s so accessible, even at his level, which is amazing. I work with a designer called Alexis Cotton, who has just been an incredible mentor to me. I&#8217;ve learned so much from her about how to show up. She&#8217;s a really unique and interesting person, and I feel really lucky to have access to all these people who have made themselves so available. And, yeah, it&#8217;s very humbling, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be doing the things I&#8217;m doing now if it wasn&#8217;t for those folks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to text Tory and I&#8217;m going to let him know that I talked to you for the show. When you think back on your career and sort of what you&#8217;ve learned to get to this point, and I think you may have somewhat answered this earlier, but what are you still working on unlearning as you grow as a designer?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to unlearn that kind of being a wallflower, being humble, minimizing and shrinking myself to be palatable. I think it&#8217;s going to be a long process of unlearning. But, yeah, I&#8217;m trying to just show up more. I look around at my peers and kind of how they show up in rooms and how they take up space, and I&#8217;m like, I should take up that space too. And I think a lot of women struggle with this in general, but I want to take up more space, and I want to show up as that person who yeah. Who just puts themselves out there and doesn&#8217;t need to shrink themselves to make a version of them that they feel like is palatable to the people around them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Do you have like, a dream project or something that you&#8217;d love to work on one day?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Honestly, I can&#8217;t even think of one off the top of my head. My dream project is talking about inclusive design and intersectionality and where Black people, where people of color, where immigrants fit into this design story.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, as you look kind of into the future, of course, like you said, you&#8217;re still working on this book, you&#8217;re in this program. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? Like, what does Tolu in 2028 going to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I see myself deleting a lot of hate mail.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Hopefully more than that. Hopefully more than that.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I see myself having more conversations about these things, about it becoming more of a mainstream conversation. I think in the larger tech community, we&#8217;re definitely at the point where we&#8217;re talking about needing more diverse representation. I&#8217;m really hoping we can talk about that in the inclusive design community as well. I see myself growing, helping other folks in the way people have helped me. It&#8217;s funny you mentioned that. I feel like ever since the pandemic, I&#8217;ve learned to think a lot more short term back then. Couldn&#8217;t even plan, like, two weeks ahead. And so right now I&#8217;m focusing a lot more on what&#8217;s on my plate.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Look, I&#8217;m right there with you. People ask me now about stuff to do in October, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;do I want to do that in October? Where am I going to be in October?&#8221; So I think we&#8217;re all, in a lot of ways, still kind of trying to come out of this pandemic and think about the future. But it feels like with what you&#8217;re doing, your path is set. It feels like if you keep on this path now of working on inclusive design, I think you&#8217;ve got a bright future ahead. Especially as we look at things like Web3, the metaverse, other social media platforms, things of that nature. There&#8217;s just going to be more and more opportunities because the Web is expanding in a way to include everyone that it just hasn&#8217;t before. Because technology is changing.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, there&#8217;s a new frontier. There&#8217;s the Wild West, where no one has ever done these things before. And there&#8217;s definitely a lot of conversations to be had about how to make these completely new things inclusive and accessible. I definitely am super excited about the people who are around me at Meta. There&#8217;s actually surprisingly a huge number of Black folks at Meta now, kind of starting with Tory. I think he was actually the first Black designer on Facebook, which is pretty wild. But I definitely look around work and I feel like there are the right people around to help on that path, the right mentors, and that feels really awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and your work? Where can they find you online?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>My website is tolu.xyz. Tolu is T-O-L-U. My Threads handle/Instagram is the same &#8212; tolu.xyz. Email. I&#8217;m also on LinkedIn. You can&#8217;t find me really anywhere else. I&#8217;m trying to reduce the amount of things that I consume, so those are probably the best ways to find me. Also via email. Old-fashioned.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, you also have the distinction of being the first person on the show to mention that they can be found on Threads.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>That feels pretty awesome. Hopefully future guests will follow that trend.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, Tolu, it&#8217;s been such a pleasure to have you on the show. So great to learn more about you and about your you know, like I said, the web is expanding in many different, know, virtual reality, et cetera, and the work that you&#8217;re doing just speaks to the greater need to include everyone in the conversation. So I really hope that with the work that you&#8217;re doing that we are all moving forward and closer to fulfilling that goal. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>

<p>Kevin Tufts is the real deal when it comes to tech and design. With over two decades of experience working across a number of companies in the Bay Area &#8212; Lyft, SendGrid, and Twilio, to name a few &#8212; he&#8217;s now a product designer at Meta working on their Creation team. So believe me, we had a LOT to talk about.</p>
<p>Our conversation begin with a look at the current climate inside Meta (pre-Threads, FYI), and he gave some thoughts on where the company is going as it approaches its 20th anniversary. From there, Kevin talked about his path to becoming a product designer, and we took a trip down memory lane recalling the early days of web design and what it was like working during such rapidly changing times. He also spoke on what he loves about product design now, and how he wants to help the next generation of designers through mentorship. </p>
<p>Kevin&#8217;s secrets to success are simple: seize opportunities for growth where you can, embrace collaboration, and remain flexible. Now that&#8217;s something I think we could all take to heart!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
I am Kevin Tufts. I am a product designer currently working at Facebook, and I live in San Jose, California.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has this year been treating you so far?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
I&#8217;d say personally the year has been pretty good. I am grateful to be employed and obviously you&#8217;ve seen in the media that Meta has had several waves of layoffs, unfortunately. So all things considered, I feel pretty grateful. Feel pretty good, but a little anxious. I&#8217;m human, so it&#8217;s definitely some wild times not just within Meta, but the tech ecosystem as a whole.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Do you have any plans for the summer?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Plans for the summer are going to be pretty chill. So one of my side hobbies is I&#8217;m an avid cyclist, so I&#8217;ve been doing bike events from beginning of April up until just a couple of weeks ago. So this summer I think I&#8217;m just going to chill, stay local and got some family stuff happening. I got some folks coming into town, so should be hopefully a quiet summer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. That&#8217;s good. Is there anything in particular that you want to try to accomplish this year, like for the rest of the year?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s some kind of like more career-oriented things that I want to sharpen up on and that&#8217;s with mentorship and maybe doing more design oriented workshops where I&#8217;m teaching kids from different backgrounds but mostly from people of color how to use design tools and how to get into product design as a whole.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think that&#8217;s a really good thing, especially now when I&#8217;d say I feel like over the past two or three years we&#8217;ve started to see a lot of the younger generation, like Gen Z and younger are starting to look at tech more as a viable opportunity for them to go into for their career. So that&#8217;s a good thing. I hope you get a chance to do that.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, looking forward to there&#8217;s a couple of avenues and programs that I&#8217;ve been working with here in the Bay Area that&#8217;s been awesome. So yeah, there&#8217;s some big things on the horizon for me personally.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Talk to me about the work that you&#8217;re doing at Facebook. Like, are you working on a specific product there?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, mostly working within what&#8217;s called Creation, and that&#8217;s the organization that handles a lot of our creation tools like Reels and Stories. And so for me, a lot of my work swirls around Stories, so I get to touch everything from the gallery to the Stories composer, just the experience itself, which has been pretty cool. And then I also work across Facebook, Lite, iOS and Android. And I call that out because most people that are listening, that are here within the US. May not be aware that we have such an app called Facebook Lite, but it&#8217;s a stripped-down version of the app that runs on Android and it&#8217;s a popular app in kind of like more developing nations.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So like if you&#8217;re using, say, like, I know there&#8217;s this terminology of a dumb phone as opposed to like a smartphone, but like a phone that&#8217;s not maybe always connected to the Internet.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
You got it. Yeah, you nailed it. So there&#8217;s different flavors of that where you can go into low data mode, and then you&#8217;ll see almost just a very plain Jane. Just a few images and some text, just a stripped down version of the core app.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does your team look like that you work with?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Team is pretty big, so within the organization there are different pillars that handle different aspects of the experience. I&#8217;m on the Creation Growth team, so we run tons of design experiments. It&#8217;s a really fast moving, fast paced.org, can be challenging, but really fun because you get to try all types of different unique design directions that you wouldn&#8217;t necessarily try in other product spaces around Meta. And we have quite a number of designers as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, what does a regular day kind of look like for you? Are you working remotely? Are you back in the office now? What does that look like?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m working remotely, and just recently, like most companies in the Bay, we have a new return to office policy. So a lot of us will be continuing to work remotely. And some of us that live here in the Bay are going to be going in three days a week.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you would have to be going into the Menlo Park office then?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s my closest office.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m trying to place the Bay geography. How far away is that from where you&#8217;re at in San Jose?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s about a 20 minute drive. 25 minutes? I mean, it takes a while because of traffic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Okay, that&#8217;s not that bad. That&#8217;s not that bad at all. Yeah. The last time I was in San Francisco was in God. Oh, that was 2016, actually was 2016. I spoke at Facebook, and I remember it took&#8230;oh, wow. I think it took an hour to get from San Francisco to Menlo Park. And I was thinking, &#8220;people make this commute every day. This is a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
That sounds great compared to doing like an hour and a half or two hours if there&#8217;s an accident.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I want to approach this part of the conversation rather gingerly. I feel like there&#8217;s a third rail that I really don&#8217;t want to touch with regards to Facebook. But what&#8217;s the mood like there right now? I mean, as you mentioned, they&#8217;ve been in the news recently because of conversations around the metaverse. The Meta Quest 3 just dropped fairly recently, and then right after that, Apple dropped their AR headset. Yeah. What&#8217;s the mood like at Facebook overall?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
I think because of the frequency of the layoffs, you know, we went into the end of last year with the first big wave, and then we just had the two more recent ones. People, they seem to be resilient, but a lot of us are kind of reserved and really just a little numb because all this stuff has been in such close succession, right. So ultimately everyone is just kind of moving forward and performing their duties as they always would. I think a lot of us are just trying to like, ride this out because we know that it&#8217;s going to be challenging for at least quite a few number of months before the dust truly settles. After every large layoff at any company, then there&#8217;s always the trimmers that you experience, right, because you&#8217;ll have a series of reorgs, so then you have to ride those waves. So that&#8217;s kind of where we are right now. But for the most part, everyone is pushing forward and we&#8217;re now into roadmap planning season. So it&#8217;s like our minds are occupied with just trying to plan for the next half.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it can be a very odd place to still work somewhere after a layoff. Sometimes you have I guess the best way to call this, or the best thing to call it, would be survivor&#8217;s guilt that you&#8217;re here when maybe a team member has left or someone else you knew at the company has left. And then especially when these kinds of things happen in succession like that, it can almost kind of feel a bit like you&#8217;re walking on eggshells, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, in some regards it&#8217;s exactly like that because this is also impacting our performance reviews, right. So a lot of us engineers as well, you&#8217;ve been working on a project or maybe you&#8217;ve been reordered. So now the work that you had going on, you had to drop it midstream to go pick up something else from someone else&#8217;s team. And yeah, it&#8217;s chaotic and so there&#8217;s the stress of like, hey, how is my performance review going to look? That&#8217;s just kind of like where we are. It&#8217;s like you can only worry about what you can control. And I guess we&#8217;ll cross that bridge when we all get there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now for those of us who have been online for a very long time, when I say that at least 20 years or so, we remember when Facebook launched. Facebook launched in the early 2000s, like 2003, 2004&#8230;I think right around that time. And we&#8217;re now about to come up on Facebook&#8217;s 20th anniversary, which is wild to think of for an Internet company. What do you think, like Facebook&#8217;s place is now in this kind of modern internet era that we&#8217;re in?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Well, obviously we&#8217;ve tried to well, I shouldn&#8217;t say try, but we&#8217;ve entered the VR space, so I don&#8217;t see that going away anytime soon. But I think what we&#8217;ll start to head is maybe putting more development and focus into AI things as everybody is sort of racing to get there wherever there is. So we may have more of a shift towards AI oriented experiences and less attention on the metaverse and then obviously just kind of moving forward with the ultimate goal of just having a totally connected planet. Right. And what I noticed between the US. And just working on things that will be tested in other countries is that here in the US. The way the media spins things is that Facebook&#8217;s dying. And it&#8217;s really just kind of how the media frames things. But it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s like the popularity of the app hasn&#8217;t really dipped and it&#8217;s actually increasing outside of the U.S. market. And then within the U.S. market, there&#8217;s quite a number of unique things that I think we&#8217;re going to be able to latch onto and really just kind of like shock the general public.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sort of reminds me of that saying about the reports of my death are greatly exaggerated or something like that. I think Mark Twain said that probably. I mean, with a company as big as Facebook that has a global reach like that. I get what you&#8217;re saying about the media, like tech media here or even the more mainstream outlets here will make it seem like, oh, Facebook is this big dying site. But Facebook is still the number one website in the world. And the world is a big place. It&#8217;s not just the U.S. I mean the U.S. media scene, the U.S. tech scene, et cetera. Facebook has not only just Facebook the social network, but Instagram and WhatsApp. And there&#8217;s other apps and things that are out there in the world that are heavily used. So to say that Facebook is dying feels kind of premature just because it has a reach that eclipses so many other products, so many other companies. It&#8217;s a lot bigger, I think, than we might think that it is based on what the media might say it is.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
And we don&#8217;t think about a lot of the other sub-products. Right. We have Groups, which is the communities based product within the app. It&#8217;s extremely popular messenger. We&#8217;ve got our foot in so many different pools right now that it&#8217;s really just kind of like the media, the U.S. focused media that&#8217;s always basically picking on the company.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. And I mean, folks that have listened to this show for any period of time know I am not a Facebook fan. I&#8217;m not going to say I&#8217;m a Facebook hater, but you can&#8217;t knock the fact that Facebook has&#8230;it&#8217;s got its reach in a lot of different places across a lot of different products. And so just the social network itself is not the entirety of what Facebook is about.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
And I never thought that I would be working here. And now that I&#8217;ve been here almost three years, I could definitely see both sides of the coin, especially in terms of how the media positions things, but also rightfully so. We have a huge trust deficit that we&#8217;re continuing to try to improve. But it&#8217;s a hard mountain to climb, especially after the ways of layoffs that we&#8217;ve just seen. And some of the initiatives that the integrity teams have been cut. It&#8217;s tough, it takes time, and unfortunately things move faster than we can react to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And some of those things are not even in Facebook&#8217;s control. Like the things that happen with workforce reduction and things, a ton of tech companies are doing that because they&#8217;re looking at the economy and seeing is the country going into a recession? So they&#8217;re trying to sort of react and pivot to what might happen. Like they&#8217;re trying to forecast the future here. So I think the longer a tech company and I&#8217;d say this is any company, not just tech companies, I think tech companies are specific in this case because they span so many different industries outside of just like software development or whatever. But the longer a tech company sticks around and almost feels like the more issues people will find with it one way or another, the companies are going to mess up. They&#8217;re going to inadvertently say something or inadvertently do something or maybe purposely say something or do something. Like the longer a tech company sticks around, it feels like&#8230;I&#8217;m a Math guy, so if I think of the duration of a tech company as like the limit of a function, it&#8217;s like as the limit approaches zero, or wherever the end of the company is, so to speak, things are going to happen. Things are just going to happen because social media influences culture and that influences technology. And so what might have been good five years ago is no longer good now. And if there&#8217;s one thing that&#8217;s going to be constant, it&#8217;s change. And I think when a tech company sticks around long enough, unfortunately they&#8217;re going to possibly come up on the short end of the stick when it relates to that.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, enough pontificating on my part.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Love it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s turn this back on you. Let&#8217;s learn more about you and about your journey as a designer in tech. I want to really take this back to the beginning here. So talk to me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
So I was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the town and city known for LeBron James and it&#8217;s river catching on fire in the 1970s and terrible sports. Right. So that&#8217;s where I was born and right around the time I turned like eight or nine is when I moved to Southern California. So I have a big group of large group of family in Ohio, and then I have a family based in Southern California between the L.A. and Orange County area.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Were you exposed to a lot of design and technology growing up?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, so I was fortunate growing up that my dad, he was a computer guy, so I had a computer in the house growing up, which is completely rare, especially for the 1980s. So my dad, coming out of Vietnam, he was in a program that taught him how to work on mainframes. So when he got out of the military, he ended up landing a job in downtown Cleveland at one of the it&#8217;s really just kind of like a storage company, I guess you would say. I remember going to work with him and one computer took up the entire room and there&#8217;s these big reels and tapes. Yeah, I&#8217;ve always been exposed to tech stuff. And he was also like a big science fiction guy. And between having a computer in the house and then playing games at the arcade at the mall and just really watching science fiction flicks with him, there&#8217;s no surprise that I ended up doing what I&#8217;m doing today as for a career. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you went to Cleveland State University where you majored in design. I&#8217;m curious, before that, did you know that design was something that you really wanted to study?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah. So by the time I went to Cleveland State and it was a total fluke because I moved to Ohio for other reasons. And while I was there, it looked like I was going to stay for a few years. I just come from Southern California and went to Ohio and got myself enrolled in university because I wanted to make sure I didn&#8217;t have any huge lapse in time to get my education out of the way. By that time, I had already been doing freelance things. Like, I was pretty much thinking I was going to be a print designer around that time. So the late 90s, probably around like &#8217;96, &#8217;97 is when I had thought, &#8220;okay, yeah, I&#8217;ll get into graphic design.&#8221; At the time, I didn&#8217;t even know it was called graphic design, but I was always the kid at high school doing the hip-hop flyers, a lot of flyers for open mics raves. So it was like the starter. The inkling of me being coming to designer was back in those days doing like bootleg flyers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, those early print days back then were something else. Just the amount of creativity that you had, even though the medium itself was sort of fairly limited, I mean, that was a lot of fun.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah. Do something like really weird on the computer and then print it out. And then I would take some markers and then do something on top of that so it&#8217;d be like this multimedia flyer thing. Cut stuff out, paste it on and then xerox it again like at Kinkos. All that kind of stuff. Using QuarkXpress.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, man. QuarkXpress. I just had someone on recently and we were sort of talking about those early days with like PageMaker and Quark and trying to figure all that stuff out because I remember Quark specifically because I used that along with PageMaker to design my high school newspaper. And the instruction manual that it came with could choke a horse. That thing was huge.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
And you had no one to read that stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nobody was reading through all that. This is way before online documentation. I mean, this thing came with a brick of an instruction manual that you had to go through. And I&#8217;m like, I have to know all of this just to use the software. It almost didn&#8217;t feel like it was worth it.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Right. Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, while you were in college, you were also a working designer too, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah. So I went to college, I was probably in my mid 20s, so basically I thought I had the world figured out because after high school, I didn&#8217;t go straight away to college. And that&#8217;s when a lot of my high school friends and people around me were just getting hired out of high school to just do HTML and build some wacky website. So I followed that path. And then when the.com bubble burst, it was a hefty smack in the face of reality. So that&#8217;s kind of like, what got me into Cleveland State. But by that time, yeah, I was working for E-Business Express, which is a web hosting company. So I was very fortunate. I was already kind of knowing my destiny, what I needed to do, where I wanted to go. And then I was also, like, in practice where other students in the class were just kind of like, figuring out what Illustrator is or Photoshop.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
E-Business Express is like a quintessential 90s online business.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Exactly. What kind of stuff were you doing there?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
I started off as a Linux server admin, so I wasn&#8217;t even doing, like, design stuff. But what I was doing that was valuable was because it&#8217;s a web hosting company is now I understand how things work behind the scenes, like how websites function. So I had that foundation of, like, I guess you would say webmaster at that time. That&#8217;s what it was considered. But yeah, just understanding how DNS works for www, your web domain, registering names, taking servers offline, like, really heady stuff. But I enjoyed it. It fulfilled, like, a side of me that I really like to tinker and explore things, and just being a Linux admin that it did it for me. But then it also gave me access to kind of like host my own little microsites and really just enable certain things on the server that people just don&#8217;t have access to. Right. Or if you&#8217;re designing a website, you&#8217;re certainly not thinking about uploading things on the command line and just really kind of Star Trek stuff at that time. That&#8217;s how I treated it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I mean, also the thing back then is a lot of that stuff around web hosting was very opaque. Like, you almost had to be a command line or a terminal coder to know how to really get around, because the graphical user interface, or the GUI, I guess what we called it back then, like, the GUIs, were just not super user-friendly to that point. So you did have to know maybe how to telnet or how to or use a Linux command in order to change the permissions on a directory. Like you couldn&#8217;t just click a button or something to make that happen.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
That is a great point. Yeah, in the early days it wasn&#8217;t for everyone. You definitely had to have some technical prowess in order to upload a file or to get your web address, like get it all working, pull up a page.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember I was in high school in like the late 90s, and I remember even doing FTP stuff and being told at the time&#8230;I think maybe one of my teachers that told me was like, &#8220;oh, so you&#8217;re hacking, you&#8217;re a hacker now.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, it&#8217;s not hacking, it&#8217;s just FTP. But because they don&#8217;t see any graphics, all they see is just code. Because you know, this was like right before The Matrix or right, Matrix came out in &#8217;99. I remember because I was a freshman in college, it came out in &#8217;99 and yeah, all that stuff about FTP and oh my God. </p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, it was crazy, right? It&#8217;s like the only context the common man had was like some science fiction movie and then you think about it&#8230;it&#8217;s really like quite simple stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, in hindsight, when you look back at it, it definitely is simple stuff. But yeah, during that time, just knowing how to do some of that sort of stuff, like people thought you were like a magician or something. You can make a website, you can put a picture of yourself online. How do you do that? And even what does online mean? Because the concept of being online in the 90s, like mid to late 90s, is such a different thing than now because social media didn&#8217;t exist. So for you, do you remember what that time was like for you?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, it was a whole new world and it felt like there wasn&#8217;t much online to look at. But I do remember like in the early days you had to work hard to make friends. So forums were real big, the IRC channels, so forums and chats, so AIM or Instant Messenger, Yahoo Chat. I remember all those different worlds and rooms and just whatever your interest was, you would just go out into that forum or chat, find your folks and then it was just kind of like not even instant replies, especially in the forum. You go in there, you chatted up, and then maybe 24 hours later you got a response. A lot of that stuff was amazing. I remember downloading my first video and it was a clip of a race car. It was like a drag strip. It was a 30 second clip. And I think it took like an hour and a half, maybe even two hours for that 30 second clip to download so that I could watch it over my 56K or whatever the modem was at the time. But yeah, it was just such a cool adventure and tinkering around with HTML and doing all the corny stuff like making the animated tickers. It was the Wild, Wild West, and I loved every bit of it. But it definitely took some patience. And you had to work hard for anything that you wanted to do on the Net.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Going back to E-Business Express for a minute, I mean, you worked there for almost eight years. When you look back at that time, what do you remember the most?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
I remember that it really helped me understand how the web functions and everything that&#8217;s needed for standing up a business. Because E-Business Express also specialized in helping medium, like small to medium sized businesses get set up online to sell. So it also gave me experience working within the realm of e-commerce. And then while working there, I worked there for eight years. And part of that was because the first few years I spent doing Linux admin stuff before I moved into becoming a full-blown just web designer for the company. So I&#8217;d switch roles, and the back end of my tenure there is what gave me experience with design, working with clients. So working more in, like, an agency style format is where I cut my teeth, as I guess you&#8217;d say, a traditional Web designer before moving into product.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, let&#8217;s talk about that shift. After E-Business Express, you&#8217;ve kind of started your career as a product designer at DotNetNuke, which now is known as DNN. How can I explain DotNetNuke? It&#8217;s a content management system. I have minimal experience with it. I worked with it briefly at WebMD and just thinking, like, how could someone make software so convoluted and confusing?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Well summarized.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Tell me about your time there.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, so the company is very unique because, as you said to CMS, and we had a lot of big government contracts, and there&#8217;s some educational institutions as well. And it was I&#8217;m trying to think of how to compare it maybe like a behemoth compared to WordPress. WordPress was really easy to get up and running. But there is a large community for Net Newt and primarily ran on Windows. So then you&#8217;ve got the IIS crowd of folks that are into it. So you got the engineer side, a lot of developers that supported the community. And then you also have the support side because there&#8217;s a lot of folks that were spinning up businesses around, like installations and helping you get up and running. On DNN, we also had those services as well. And then for me, it was awesome because it was my first foray into product thinking and product design. So when I worked at the company, we had, I think, three designers. Two of them were in marketing, I believe. And it&#8217;s just one product design person that did everything. It was like the jacket of all trades, but it. Was really cool. This is the first time getting experience with a design system where at that time we had a sticker sheet. So working in that capacity and then also working on product features. So where I&#8217;ve kind of come from more or less building websites that are catering to businesses to sell online now I&#8217;ve moved into kind of like more enterprise software. And a lot of the nuances of working within these product spaces and different product features and how to plan accordingly and doing a light amount of user research to the community, things like that. So kind of like an entry level crash course into product design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now. Was it a big shift from E-Business Express? I mean, you&#8217;re going from this web hosting environment where you said you were in the back half of your time there doing design to now focusing on product, which I feel like during that time, if we&#8217;re talking like, the early 2010s, product was still kind of a new ish sort of term in a way. Did you know what a product designer was when you started there?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
No, because I think around that time also, we were still seeing on job listings, UI/UX. We were seeing like a myriad of job titles that meant the same thing, like visual designer or UI/UX and product designer. So when I moved out to the Bay Area, I had to kind of wrap my head around like, okay, I&#8217;m seeing these titles, but the job description is just a product design role interaction designer even. And then the description would be nothing more than just, like, a product design role. So, yeah, it took a while to kind of figure out what the companies were looking for. And then also, what did that mean? Like, what are the job functions that are necessary for me to be successful?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, there was definitely a shift in the industry right around that time where web designers, graphic designers, visual designers just suddenly started becoming product designer, UX designer. And, I mean, that&#8217;s something even I&#8217;ve encountered now. Like, if I tell people I&#8217;m a designer, I feel like nine times out of ten, they&#8217;re going to think that means a UX designer. And I&#8217;m like, oh, actually, I haven&#8217;t done UX design. Maybe not in the way that they&#8217;re thinking it, but I feel like that shift just kind of happened. Was that something that you noticed also?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, I did notice. It naturally sorted itself out because prior to that, I guess in our era, we kind of came up around the time where you&#8217;re expected to know all these different things. You had to be a visual designer. Also, Flash was pretty big too, so it&#8217;s like you had to know Flash and then programming languages, right? There are all these things. And I was also a front end developer at E-Business Express, so I did a lot of the integration work as well. And when I came to the Bay Area. I still had that mindset that I had to be a jack of [all] trades and know all these things. And then I was noticing that there are actually specialized roles now. Like, no longer are we living in a day and age where they&#8217;re expecting you to be a webmaster. Like, I hated that term and seeing that, it&#8217;s like you have to know Java. JavaScript, there was all these back end languages that were on our job description roles. When you just want to use Photoshop.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. When I worked at AT&#038;T as a designer, I think my title was just web designer. But we were doing web design, we were doing graphic design, we were doing front end design because we had to, of course, actually build the whole thing from scratch. And this was at the time when layout switched from tables to CSS. So you had to learn that with all the different cross browser compatibility, especially with IE6. And yeah, we had to know like, a little bit of Flash. Actually we used&#8230;oh my God, do you remember Swish? Yeah, Swish was like &#8220;Flash Lite&#8221;, I guess. It wasn&#8217;t made by Macromedia, which Adobe ended up buying, but it was a totally different company called Swish, and it was a more, I guess, sort of user-friendly interface to make Flash animation. But we had to know Flash. We had to know a little bit of Java, and I mean, like actual Java, not JavaScript. Ironically, we didn&#8217;t have to know JavaScript, but we had to know Java because we would do these web audio applet things and so we had to know how to troubleshoot the applet. So this is one position, graphic design, web design, Flash, Java, and you&#8217;re also sometimes doing some debugging of other people&#8217;s stuff. It was a lot into one particular title, and I feel like now that&#8217;s five different jobs at a company. After your time at DotNetNuke, you worked for a lot of other companies out in the Bay Area. You worked for &#8212; I&#8217;m listing off here &#8212; Workday, eBay, SendGrid, Twilio. And before Facebook, you were at Lyft for a short period of time. When you look back at those positions collectively, like, what stands out to you? Do you remember any particular things?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, I remember at DNN had an amazing time there and I felt like that was the kickstarter to my official tech career in the Bay and just getting my feet wet with engineering teams because we had a team of roughly like 100 engineers or so. And so that was the first time going from like a small web shop where there&#8217;s three developers and they&#8217;re within arm&#8217;s reach, to now I&#8217;ve got to talk to engineering leads and have these presentation reviews. So that was kind of like the world that I was living in at DNN. </p>
<p>And then when I moved over to Workday, that was my experience into the world of enterprise software and really how to work within the confines of a design system. Coincidentally enough, I worked on the internal tools team, so that was really unique to be on the team that has to essentially vet and take in requests from other product areas, different components that may need to be built or reviewed to see if there&#8217;s any efficacy to having engine spin up resources to bring to life. And then also working across different time zones. So Workday was amazing. And having to work with engineering teams in Ireland, and I&#8217;ve also got a couple of trips to Europe out of that as well. So can&#8217;t complain with that. The design culture at Workday at the time was growing, so design hadn&#8217;t been around at Workday for too long before I got there. I think maybe like a couple of years at the most. So we had a young but super talented design team that was working at Workday at that time, research, I want to call that out as well. So we did have a few research partners that were at Workday. So that was my first time interacting with research, other than me standing up some guerrilla survey or just doing kind of like personal research. My own living from Workday.</p>
<p>So I left Workday and went to eBay. And eBay was awesome because I met some incredible people and I&#8217;m still friends with a lot of them to this day. eBay was just a special time in my career where I was able to again, work at a massive company, work on different product spaces. And also, I&#8217;m an avid eBay user, so I came in with some personal knowledge of how the product works because some people that work at eBay, they don&#8217;t necessarily use the product. I&#8217;d say the same thing is probably like for a meta as well, right? Which probably is problematic. But I actually used the thing that I worked on, so that was really cool. Several opportunities to travel throughout Europe, mostly Germany, and eBay was close to home, so I didn&#8217;t have that long commute, like a lot of folks in the Bay Area. So that fulfilled my mood, was incredible back then. </p>
<p>And then transitioning from eBay, this is where things get interesting. So I ended up at a company called SendGrid. And SendGrid is kind of like an API communications company, more around the email marketing space. Really powerful tool. A lot of companies use it today. It&#8217;s kind of like the rival to Mailchimp for anyone that&#8217;s not familiar with SendGrid. So if you know Mailchimp, that&#8217;s basically what SendGrid is. And SendGrid was acquired by a company called Twilio. So that&#8217;s how I ended up at Twilio &#8212; through an acquisition. </p>
<p>When the acquisition took place, SendGrid had a very mature, young, but mature design organization, and Twilio was engineering centric, so they really did not have design. And I think literally there may have been like four designers, four product designers there at the time of the acquisition. Funny story. I&#8217;d actually interviewed with Twilio before the acquisition, maybe like a half a year prior to that, and got an offer. Decided that wasn&#8217;t quite where I wanted to be in my career because I wanted to go somewhere that had a mature design organization and I didn&#8217;t want to go somewhere where it&#8217;s just you kind of have to fight for your seat at the table. So I&#8217;ve seen some things at that time during the interview process that the folks were incredible, they were great, but I&#8217;m like, maybe I&#8217;ll pass. So I ended up going to SendGrid and I kid you not, on my first day, my first day in the office with my team and our first team meeting, we got an announcement to basically shut our laptops and we need to receive some news. And the news was that we had been acquired by Twilio. So the company I ran from was the company that ended up acquiring. They got me anyway, so I was the most expensive hire ever.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah. So to wrap things up, Twilio was just an interesting time. PDs were basically working across like anywhere from 4:00-9:00 p.m. At a time. I think I had eight that I was reporting to. So it was pretty chaotic, but at least you were shipping work like, daily. We didn&#8217;t have enough design resources. And also it was challenging because I mentioned that Syngra had a mature design culture and organization. So when we came in with a lot of our process oriented things and checkpoints with design briefs, which is necessary, especially in large, fast moving companies, we were trying to get the company to slow down so that we can improve the quality versus just kind of like PM coming up with an idea and ends just building it. And if it doesn&#8217;t work, oh well. We wanted to kind of move away from that mantra and more towards being design led. So tiny bit of friction around there, but ultimately they&#8217;re getting to where they need to be. And Lyft, I know I&#8217;ve done such a tour of duty here in the Bay Area.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I was going to say.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Finally &#8212; it&#8217;s going to stop now. But Lyft, I would say Lyft was a cherry on top for my career. It fulfilled so many things that I had been looking for, where I want to move fast, ship quality work, have a mature design organization, and a mature design system. Right? You don&#8217;t ever have to worry about what&#8217;s real, what&#8217;s not real, what&#8217;s in flight. Our design systems team at Lyft, product teams, everyone was just incredible to work with. And so I worked on the community safety team. My short stint at Lyft and the team that I worked on was unique because we got to wedge ourselves in between different product spaces without actually being a full-fledged member of the team. So I got to work on the Driver app and the Rider app. And then there&#8217;s some kind of like, unique things around the rental car space, which is Fleet, so there&#8217;s a lot of interesting work. And because it wasn&#8217;t a massive company, you could move fast. There was a researcher embedded on my team, so it was almost like bi-weekly we were testing things, and I just loved it. So I didn&#8217;t have to worry about the design system. Inevitably, when you&#8217;re working on the thing, sometimes you&#8217;re not working with a system that&#8217;s flexible enough to adhere to your needs and what you&#8217;re trying to solve. But while working with Lyft, I didn&#8217;t have to worry about all that. I just worried about the experience itself and everything else just fell into place. </p>
<p>But the pandemic is what got me to Meta. So when the pandemic hit and no one was going anywhere, no one&#8217;s driving, no one&#8217;s riding, I&#8217;m watching my colleagues, like almost weekly, like different goodbye emails that are going out. And it was a wild place to be in the year that everything seemed to have melted down. So out of self-preservation, and a need for not legit thinking the company was going to go over, I ended up making the jump over to Meta. </p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll stop there. And that&#8217;s the whole transition to where I am today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, like you said, that is quite a tour of duty. One question I think that really stands out among all of that is, like, how have you seen product design change over the years? I imagine from company to company, it&#8217;s probably fairly similar because you&#8217;re working on software products. I guess you could say Lyft is software, but it&#8217;s transportation as well. But how have you seen product design change over the years since you first started?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
The tooling. I would definitely say, in terms of ease of collaboration, that is one of the biggest things that I&#8217;ve seen change. And then the tooling itself. So now that we&#8217;ve got these robust prototyping tools, it&#8217;s so much easier to demonstrate the design and the experience that you&#8217;re working on without having to know some hardcore programming languages. Like, back in the day, it was like you had to know JavaScript or jQuery just to maybe animate a dropdown, right? Or you may have had some ideas around something fancy that you wanted to do, maybe you wanted to have a side drawer appear on a website. But in order to do those things, you had to know a programming language or just mock it up in After Effects, which is also tedious. So I would say just the sheer volume of tools in the collaboration space and prototyping is just incredible.</p>

There&#8217;s another podcast that I produce &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to mention the name of it &#8212; but there&#8217;s another show that I produce, and one of the things that we have been exploring through that that I feel like is also relevant to our conversation is like, just how much the browser has become a tool in and of itself. Like, the browser used to just be about presentation. You made a website or something like that, you put it online, whatever. But now, as the browsers have gotten savvier, as different frameworks have been created and such, the browser itself is such a tool to the point where there are services now that only exist in a browser. They don&#8217;t exist as standalone software, like an executable file or something like that. Like Figma, you can do full fledged graphic design all within your browser. And like, ten years ago, that would have almost been unheard of.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
It is mind blowing to do that in a browser. Like, through Figma, you&#8217;ve got these other tools like Webflow, and trying to think of some other ones that are out there canva I mean, it&#8217;s just totally jealous of the new designers, by the way. Every time these tools come out and I have to interact with them, and I&#8217;m just like, wow, I really couldn&#8217;t use this back in the day when I had maybe 100 buttons that I need to make a change on it. I had to go touch every hundred, you know, component.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Listen&#8230;modern designers will never know the pain of cross-browser compatibility. They will never understand how much of a pain in the ass it was to try to get one design to look the same across different versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox and Opera. Oh, my God.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Safari. Safari behavioral things. Yeah. [Internet Explorer] 6 through 8 were probably like the nightmares. Six and seven, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, for a while. I know. There was, like, a whole cottage industry around basically browser emulators. Because if you were on Windows, of course you couldn&#8217;t really use Safari. You&#8217;d have to use I mean, the Windows version of Safari you could use, but it didn&#8217;t even render the same between Windows and Mac. And so you had this software that you&#8217;d use that could hopefully reliably look the same between everywhere, and you had these little HTML shivs you had to do to make certain properties work. It was man, it was a jungle out there. It&#8217;s only like ten or so years ago. It was wild. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Not that long ago, when I was at E-Business Express, we bought a dedicated iMac for that very reason, so that we could run all the browsers on the Mac to see how they were responding as well. It&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t miss those days, but I am so grateful that I got to experience it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right? No, absolutely. Because, I mean, I think there are certain skills, I think, that you build because of that, like being able to really debug and even to sort of refactorize your own code that you&#8217;re doing, because you know that if you do it this other way, it&#8217;s going to look bad in this browser. So now you sort of learn all these little eccentricities and stuff like that. So now things are pretty standardized between the browser, I feel like, and I haven&#8217;t done front-end in a while, but I feel like things are pretty standardized now between the modern browsers like Edge, Safari, Chrome, Firefox are pretty much going to render things pretty much the same.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yes. And I think a lot of it&#8217;s like the proliferation of frameworks like the CSS frameworks have helped out with the consistency as well. Right. The browsers have the support built in for a lot of the neat CSS tricks that you can do. But then also a lot of people have adopted these frameworks that have that stuff built in as well. So it just really speeds up the design and development process. And I could say, like, for people that are front end developers and they&#8217;ve moved over to just being a designer, it&#8217;s always been easier to communicate with your engine partners too. So when you need to go into engineering meetings as well, it&#8217;s always refreshing to communicate in their language as much as you can. Right. So it helps you out that way as well, career wise.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve said that there&#8217;s no better time to be a designer than now, and I feel like we may have kind of talked about that a little bit now, just with tooling, but expand on that for me. Expand on that thought.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah. So let&#8217;s say FigJam, the collaboration tool within Figma. It has really opened up my world where I could send people just a design, like an early design. They can go in there, they can comment, or we can comment, live the collaboration aspect, especially in the remote world. Obviously we&#8217;re not all in the same space, but it has been world-changing to get early buy in through Figma, through sharing a link and even doing research. The tooling for research has been a lot better over the years. The last ten years, it&#8217;s improved greatly. And so speaking to that, yeah, I&#8217;m all about collaboration tools because we have to do a lot of virtual brainstorm sessions or design sprints. And without having that mechanism, I&#8217;m not sure where we would have been today. We could have probably been doing design sprint in Google Sheets or something like that, right? Which would be terrible. That has just been world changing for me in terms of just building more momentum and getting buy-in. </p>
<p>But also with prototyping. I&#8217;m a big fan of prototyping and I do remember the days of struggling for weeks and weeks through using JavaScript and jQuery to do something relatively simple or maybe I had an idea that&#8217;s kind of elaborate but do not have the technical skills to pull it off. So prototyping in Figma, Origami and some of the other tools that are out in the market today. It&#8217;s like you spend maybe an hour or two going over some tutorials and then all of a sudden you&#8217;re off to the races, making a really immersive, native-feeling prototype that you can view on your phone and even share it. So that&#8217;s why I kind of like saying, I&#8217;m so jealous of all the folks that are becoming designers now because they&#8217;ll never know the pain of taking days or even weeks to do something really simple and sometimes it just ends up being like a throwaway thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I didn&#8217;t even touch on mobile. But you&#8217;re like, absolutely right about that. I mean, mobile is another thing where a bunch of different environments across different smartphones are going to render things differently. That&#8217;s a whole other part I didn&#8217;t even consider. I&#8217;d say also just education back in the day a lot. I mean, this stuff was really online. We were all just sort of reverse engineering and looking at View Source code and trying to figure stuff out. And there were books that came along eventually because some people might have been a little bit ahead of the curve, but you couldn&#8217;t really go to school for this. And now you have like, Treehouse and you&#8217;ve got General Assembly and there&#8217;s no short share skillshare. There&#8217;s YouTube videos. There&#8217;s so much stuff now around education that just did not exist when we were trying to learn design back then. Especially if you were self taught. Like, if you were self taught, you really were self taught because there were not even just these educational platforms to help you to figure this stuff out. You really were doing a lot of trial and error.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, great point. I don&#8217;t know how I could even forget that because that was a huge part of my life and career and I felt like I took a long road to get to where I am because of that fact. Back in those days, there were very few tutorials online. You could find some Illustrator tutorials. Shockwave. I&#8217;m trying to think of some other Macromedia products. That ColdFusion. Fireworks. Yeah, you could find some really remedial tutorials out there, but that was about it. And so those early days, I had to go to a bookstore and look at design magazines. I think Computer Arts was a godsend coming from publishing [in] the UK. But yeah, that was it. It&#8217;s like you go to a bookstore and you get all these design books and then I would get some programming books just to see what&#8217;s going on. But like you said, maybe you found a website that was cool and you got to go view Source and like, okay, what&#8217;s going on here? And then you try to break it down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
So, yeah, all this stuff that we have, like, access to education and just these online schools and I love it. I&#8217;m here for it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I remember back in the day I used what was it called? Dynamic Drive. Do you remember Dynamic Drive?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So Dynamic Drive was the site that basically just had code snippets. Like, they didn&#8217;t really give tutorials. They kind of told you how to implement it, but say you wanted to make it so someone couldn&#8217;t right click on your website. Right? Yeah. You could go to Dynamic Drive and find the code. Snippet copy it, copy it, paste it between the head tags, and then all these different no one could right click. Yeah, they really tell you how it worked. You just were like, oh, this can do this. There was a lot of trust, I&#8217;ll put it that way, that you weren&#8217;t putting something malicious in your site. You would just, oh, copy, paste that and&#8230;oh, God, what&#8217;s the other one I used to use a lot that was sort of more educational based that&#8217;s still around now called&#8230;W3Schools. Yeah, that&#8217;s right. W3Schools. And I remember because I was also teaching design at the time, this was like, what was this, 2011, 2012, maybe? And I remember telling my students, like, don&#8217;t use W3Schools. They call themselves W3Schools because it was www. But I think folks also confused it with the W3C, which is the Worldwide Web Consortium. And I was a member of their Web Education group. And they would tell us, do not tell people to use W3Schools. It is not sanctioned by us. It is not our thing. But it was also still teaching people. It was teaching me how to use some of this stuff. But I would have to tell my students, don&#8217;t use W3Schools. Think of it as a reference, but don&#8217;t just copy and paste stuff from W3Schools and then turn it in as homework, because I&#8217;m going to know that you did that, because I do that, so don&#8217;t do that.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Oh, my goodness, man. Yes. Absolutely. We said dynamic drive. I wasn&#8217;t even like it didn&#8217;t even ring a bell. But I remember using them to get a script, to do the animated cursor. It had all the types of weird, just weird things. It was almost like the dollar store for scripts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Not the dollar store! That&#8217;s a very accurate piece of comparison there. Back when HTML&#8230;I think it was called DHTML back then. Yeah. Oh, man, what a time. What a time.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to someone out there who&#8217;s they&#8217;re hearing your story, they want to follow in your footsteps. What advice would you give them?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
You know, as you&#8217;re trying to figure out what aspect of design you may want to focus in? Experiment, try it all. And as we were just talking about, there&#8217;s so many resources online where you don&#8217;t even have to pay a penny to try something out, right. But really just be curious on how things are done, whether it&#8217;s processes related to product design or maybe how to run a design sprint. There&#8217;s so much, and you&#8217;ll kind of eventually find your way. Some people generally know, like, hey, I&#8217;m not a great visual designer, but they want to get more into the UX of things. Right. And that&#8217;s great too. So it&#8217;s all about kind of like, figuring out your career path and what your passions are, what your strong suits are. </p>
<p>For me, I love product design, but I&#8217;m also really heavily into micro-animation, so I lean towards these prototyping tools. But yeah, it&#8217;s like, sky&#8217;s the limit. It&#8217;s kind of like the advice that I would give them informal training. Like, if you are able to get into a good school that has a great product design program, that is awesome. I know Carnegie Mellon has one. Tufts University has, like, an HCI class. I think most big universities these days probably have some facet of, like, a product design class, but then don&#8217;t also have to go to a giant university for this type of an education. Like we already mentioned, it&#8217;s all right there online. Just use the resources that are available to you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I noticed that the URL to your website is pathstraightforward.com. What does &#8220;path straight forward&#8221; mean to you, like, in terms of your life and your career?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah. So I was trying to have a domain name that sounded relatively cool. And at first, I&#8217;m like, this is not going to have any type of esoteric meaning or anything, but really, it just summarizes the journey that I took in order to get to where I am today. Because it was really long. It was hard, but I knew that I had a plan, and I just kind of stayed focused on the journey and the path moving forward, and that&#8217;s kind of what&#8217;s got me here. And I still have a long way to go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? I mean, you&#8217;ve mentioned this kind of tour of duty that you&#8217;ve had around the bay at these different companies and such. What does the future look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
So there&#8217;s a couple of things. I think I want to start to move more towards design systems because I really do enjoy working with my design systems partners. And so over the years, I&#8217;ve had a number of contributions to different systems that are available. But between that and mentorship becoming, like, having a stronger influence in mentoring younger designers, I mentioned that I was involved in a program here in Oakland, but it&#8217;s really impactful when people can have someone that they can talk to and get directional advice for their career. So I want to have more of a stronger influence in mentorship circles.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience where can they find out more information about you, your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yes, you can reach out to me on LinkedIn. So it&#8217;s LinkedIn.com, and it&#8217;s my first and last name, Kevin Tufts. So feel free to connect with me. I am always willing to have a coffee chat with anyone that&#8217;s curious about my background or just really general questions about design and my website since I&#8217;ve been employed for so long. I&#8217;ve kind of taken down a lot of the work there, but also there are some social links in there. You can reach out to me on my website and contact me directly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Kevin Tufts, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I mentioned this prior to us recording. We have a mutual colleague, Kim Hutchinson. Now she was Kim Williams when I first interviewed her, but Kim sang about your praises. She was like, &#8220;you got to get Kevin on the show. He&#8217;s such a cool guy. He&#8217;s such a good guy.&#8221; And I can tell just from this conversation, like, she&#8217;s 100% right. You&#8217;re down to earth. You know your stuff. And anybody that I talk to that has been around since the early days of the web that has built stuff from scratch is, like, automatically cool with me because, you know, the trenches that we&#8217;ve had to go through to still be&#8230;I would even say relevant. I want to say that. But to go through the trenches, to still be working and doing what we do now after 20 years is amazing. And I think you certainly built a fantastic career for yourself, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing what you do along with the mentoring track and everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So thank you for coming on the show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Maurice, thank you. And I really appreciate you having me on the show. And it is awesome that you&#8217;ve got a platform that you can expose different types of people from various backgrounds. So, yeah, man, kudos. I appreciate it.</p>

<p>After years of asking questions to designers and developers all over the world, now I&#8217;m in the hot seat! For this special mailbag episode, I answer your questions about Revision Path that you sent in from our website and via social media. (And I have to say, you all definitely asked me some hard questions!)</p>
<p>How long does it take to put together a podcast episode, and have I ever had to take an episode down? What happened to our design anthology RECOGNIZE? Why did we have Facebook as a sponsor? What are my thoughts on AIGA? And why do we charge for job listings? Listen to this episode for the answers to these questions, and several others. Keep sending us your questions, and I may do another one of these episodes in the future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So this first question is from Jarvis J., and he asks, &#8220;how far are you from where you thought Revision Path would be right now?&#8221; That&#8217;s a great question. I promise not to say that before every question, although these are some great questions that I got in. I would say very far, but also not far at all.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When I started Revision Path back in 2013, I really wanted it to be kind of an online magazine. And then, I&#8217;d say probably within the first year or so of doing Revision Path and trying to keep it on a fairly regular schedule of it being an online magazine, I discovered it was just easier to make it a podcast. I could turn it around much quicker and stay on a schedule. I would say just that first transition was more than what I thought it would be when I started doing this whole project.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But as far as like where we are right now, and if we&#8217;re far from where I think I wanted to be, I would say yes. I mean, we&#8217;ve been doing this podcast now for almost nine years. I think it&#8217;s been a good, steady resource in the industry. Like people are always coming to Revision Path for one reason or another, whether it&#8217;s finding out about black designers or placing a job or something like that, and I think that&#8217;s been good. However, there are bigger things I would love to do with the show. And we&#8217;ve sort of over the years had opportunities to do some of those things, but just not on a consistent basis. For example, live shows.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We did our first live show in 2017. That was here in Atlanta. We did it with Facebook Design, and that was a great show. We did our 300th episode in New York City at The Greene Space back in 2019. That was good. And in 2020, actually we were planning to do a live tour across the U.S., in conjunction with different chapters of AIGA. So we were going to start in Los Angeles, and then do, and not necessarily in this order, but I&#8217;m going from west to east, but doing Seattle, Houston, Little Rock, Chicago, Atlanta, D.C., New York. That was the plan, because I had talked to people from each of these chapters. We had talked about doing some kind of programming. I was going to just basically pay out pocket to go to each of these places, and schedule and do live shows.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so we did the first live show in 2020 in Los Angeles. That was with Roland A. Wiley. We recorded that at Leimert Park in Los Angeles, and then the coronavirus happened. And then once that happened, the flights got canceled, plans got changed. There was talk of me trying to take these same instances, this tour, I should say, take it online and do digital things. But if you remember spring of 2020, we didn&#8217;t know what was happening. The pandemic was just beginning and people were still trying to figure out what all this was and what we were going to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So the thought of sitting at home and doing a live event on Zoom didn&#8217;t really vibe well with me. Like I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I don&#8217;t know if I want to do that.&#8221; And then also I lost my job because of the pandemic in May of 2020. So I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I really don&#8217;t want to do it now.&#8221; There are bigger goals I have. For a while in the past, Revision Path had a blog. We had a blog with fairly regular entries from guest writers. I would love to continue to do that. I would love to do live shows again, once it&#8217;s safe for us to congregate in that way. And I&#8217;ve even thought of ways that Revision Path could maybe branch out more and do more video things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can tell you this, last year there was&#8230;or there are plans, I should say, because they&#8217;re still on the table, to do some sort of a live video show with Revision Path, like on Twitch or something like that. I think at one point we were talking about doing it with Facebook, and doing it on their Facebook Watch platform. But now Facebook book is Meta, and they&#8217;re doing stuff with the metaverse. And so that kind of fell through a little bit. So I would say right now my goal is just to keep hitting these milestones with the podcast.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;ll hit episode 450 this year. We&#8217;ll hit episode 475 this year. We&#8217;ll hit episode 500 next year. And then of course next year will also be Revision Path&#8217;s 10th anniversary. Do I have plans for those things yet? No. I should probably start thinking about that since it&#8217;s going to be coming up sooner rather than later. I&#8217;d say just in terms of the initial idea of Revision Path with it being this online magazine, and now to it being this sort of steady staple in the design industry for us to have the respect of design organizations, tech startups, tech companies, et cetera, for it to be in the Smithsonian, I would say, is very far from where I thought Revision Path would be. I hope that answers your question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Our next question here is from K.B. who asks, &#8220;how long does it take to put together an episode of the podcast?&#8221; How long does it take? It varies, because putting together the episode, if we&#8217;re just talking about postproduction from when I finished the interview up to when I get it back from RJ, who is our editor, I would say it roughly takes a week. But the thing is, I record so far in advance that RJ just kind of gets to them week by week by week. And so we have a regular production schedule. I record the intro and outro every week. So we record that in the beginning of the week, I pass it on to him. He already has the raw interview file. He does his edits, gets it back to me. I get a transcript done, upload everything, and it&#8217;s good to go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So usually in the postproduction stage, takes about a week. If we&#8217;re talking about everything before that, also kind of adding into it, I would say that also will vary, because when the guest books on the show, that&#8217;s usually everything that I need to go ahead and get started with the actual interview for the episode. So I&#8217;ll do my research. I&#8217;ll put together a few bullet points. Then I have the guest on the show. We do the interview.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I&#8217;ll put it like this, the time that we book for the interview is roughly 90 minutes. 90 minutes doesn&#8217;t mean that we use everything in that 90 minute. We may use probably only about an hour or so of that audio, but I do 90 minutes, one, to handle any sort of technical difficulties that might arise on my end or on their end. Sometimes maybe they&#8217;re not in a super quiet space, or there&#8217;s like mic issues or headphone issues. We work those out before we start recording.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then when the guest is ready, I let them know I&#8217;m about to start recording. We do the recording, we do it all the way through, hopefully, fingers crossed. I&#8217;d say now it&#8217;s much better. Sometimes we would have issues with the recorder that I use or with Skype or with the guest internet connection or with my internet connection. There can always be things that go wrong. But within that 90 minute timeframe, I&#8217;ve got everything I need to go ahead and send off to RJ to start to get the episode together.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
While I&#8217;m doing the interview, I also will take notes, like edit notes to say like, here&#8217;s a timestamp where I coughed, or here&#8217;s a timestamp where the guest dropped something or something like that. And he edits through all of those and it&#8217;s good to go. Roughly the interview portion, including everything else, I would say it takes about like a week or so to put an episode together. I try to do them in advance because I&#8217;m also scheduling them around different events that might be happening, or trying to see which episode can I place in this spot for maximum reach or that sort of thing. So it kind of varies, but roughly about a week, I would say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d say the quickest turnaround I&#8217;ve done on an interview has been maybe a couple of days. Like we record, I get it to RJ, he gets it back to me, and then we have everything together. But if I&#8217;ve got everything that I need to get started, and we request with the guests, we get that going, we record it, I send it off to RJ, get the transcripts, all that stuff, roughly about a week to put an episode together. And then it&#8217;s out for the world to hear.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Ryan B. asks, &#8220;have you ever had to take down an episode for any reason?&#8221; So luckily within the 430+ archive of Revision Path episodes, I have never had to take down an episode; knock on wood about that. I&#8217;d say 99% of what I record with the guests ends up in the final episode. We&#8217;ll edit out a cough or a sneeze or something like that, but there&#8217;s very few episodes that I&#8217;ve had to really aggressively edit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And to that end, because everything that we talk about goes in the show, and the guest has reviewed it and everything, we have not had to take any of those down. Now, what has happened, I&#8217;d say in recent years is that we will get people who will write to the show leaving, I would say the equivalent of a negative Yelp review about the guests, but not about what the guests said on the show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s never about what they said on the show or what I said on the show or our conversation or our topics, but they will leave a negative review about their personal interaction with the guest, and using that as justification for why I should remove the interview, which I never do. If you had a negative run-in with this guest for one reason or another, that&#8217;s on you. That has nothing to do with the episode that I&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And usually these are for like old episodes too. Like ones I&#8217;ve done maybe 3, 4, 5 years ago. There&#8217;s someone that sort of comes out the woodwork and is like, &#8220;Hey, this person said this thing to me or did this thing to me. I don&#8217;t know why you have them featured on your website. You should take it down.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m not going to take it down. That&#8217;s a problem you had with them. That has nothing to do with what I talked about with them, or anything like that.&#8221; So I don&#8217;t take those down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, it&#8217;s a different story with 28 Days of the Web. 28 Days of the Web is our sister site, 28daysoftheweb.com. We do these profiles for every day in Black history month in February, where we profile a different Black designer or developer or something. I have had to take quite a few of those down for different reasons. The biggest reason being that the person just doesn&#8217;t want to be recognized.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
None of the information that I have when I put those profiles together is coming from like some secret private place. Like it comes from their public LinkedIn, their public website. I&#8217;m getting that information from there, so I&#8217;m not creating anything myself. Like it&#8217;s all from them. And so they&#8217;ll see it and they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Oh, well thank you for the honor, but I want you to take this down.&#8221; And so I&#8217;ll take it down in that instance, because it is something that I&#8217;m doing to recognize people that I may, for one reason or another, not have on the show, because I haven&#8217;t reached out to them, or&#8230;I have a long list of people, like potential folks that I could have on the show. I think it&#8217;s maybe about 2,500 people at this point.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So everyone that I have on the show that I could talk to, I can&#8217;t have because we just do it every week. And so some of those people will end up becoming 28 Days of the Web profiles. I mean, even if you go back all the way to 2014 when we started that, you&#8217;ll see some of those people have been guests on the show eventually. Have not had to take down a podcast episode, but I have had to take down a 28 Days of the Web profile here and there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
This next message is from Jordana T. who asks, &#8220;what&#8217;s the biggest blessing in disguise you&#8217;ve gotten from Revision Path?&#8221; I&#8217;d say the biggest blessing in disguise is probably the rooms that Revision Path is mentioned in that I&#8217;m not a part of. I think that&#8217;s probably the biggest thing. I&#8217;ve done this now for a long time. I&#8217;ve interviewed a lot of people, and those people will talk to other people who talk to other people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s oftentimes I&#8217;ll be researching something for work or anything like that, and I run across someone who&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh yeah, I know you. You&#8217;re from such and such.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s probably been the biggest blessing in disguise is knowing that the work that I&#8217;ve done is being mentioned in other rooms and other places without me necessarily having to be in them. That&#8217;s probably the biggest thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think the other biggest blessing in disguise for me is the network that I&#8217;ve been able to build, just personally and professionally. Interviewing all these people has gotten me an in with different companies in different ways, whether that&#8217;s for sponsorship purposes, whether that&#8217;s for consulting or any number of other things. I&#8217;ve been able to get my foot in the door so I can say, oh yeah, I know someone at Microsoft. I know someone at Dropbox. I know someone at Meta, or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s not to say it in a braggy sort of name-droppy sort of way, but it is a blessing in disguise to be able to have that one-on-one access to someone who could possibly get me access to someone else. I think that&#8217;s been the biggest kind of a blessing from the show. Doing this interview-based show is always good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Another big blessing in disguise is honestly just the fact that so many people are appreciative of hearing these conversations. Like I will get messages from people who are just glad that they found this as a resource, whether it&#8217;s through their own research, or a friend or a colleague of theirs is on it. Like hearing back from people, what they thought about the show or what they thought about the interviews, and how much of a help it&#8217;s been to them has been a real blessing. Knowing that I&#8217;m putting something out there in the world that, yes, is educational, and that you&#8217;re learning about these people, but is also inspirational.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m glad that people are finding that inspiration from listening to these stories and listening to people and learning about what they do and being able to expand their own kind of personal knowledge of black designers and the work that black designers can do. Yeah. That&#8217;s kind of been the biggest blessing in disguise from doing this whole thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Next up is this question from Rosie. Rosie asks, &#8220;how come some of the podcasts have transcripts and others don&#8217;t? When will that be fixed?&#8221; The simple question is that some podcasts don&#8217;t have transcripts because I don&#8217;t have the money to pay to get them transcribed. That&#8217;s the easiest way to answer that question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We do have an accessibility sponsor that we&#8217;ve had now probably for the past year, which is this great studio in D.C. called Brevity &#038; Wit. When we were part of the Glitch Media Network back in 2019, we had podcasts for a couple of episodes, well, not a couple, for a lot of episodes. And those are the ones I think in the like 250 to maybe 340 range of episodes, those have transcripts. But no, all of the podcasts do not have transcripts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We use a service called Rev, R-E-V, to do our transcripts. And they&#8217;re roughly, I think it&#8217;s like a $1.25 a word or something like that. So you can imagine with 400 plus episodes, that&#8217;s a lot of money to transcribe all of those episodes. Now, if you are a company out there who would love to sponsor us so we can get all of our episodes transcribed, I would love that. Like please hit me up. I would love to make that happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But no, because of that, that&#8217;s why some of the podcasts do have transcripts, some of them don&#8217;t. One of the goals I would love to have is to have the entire archive transcribed, but that is probably going to happen way off in the future. That&#8217;s something that we have to have the funds to be able to do. I do know that now there are these sorts of automated services where you can send them a MP3 or an audio file of some sort and they&#8217;ll spit out a transcript. They sort of do this speech to text kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But what I find with those is that the transcripts that you get back, unless you&#8217;re speaking in absolute like perfect English, they are always going to be messed up. Like with Rev, I know that there are real people that are transcribing them. So there are certain words and things that they&#8217;ll pick up on and spell correctly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If I use one of these automated services, by the time I get all those transcripts back, I&#8217;d have to then probably go through all of them individually to make sure the words that were said were right, especially if we&#8217;re talking about interviews that have slang terms in them, or the names of companies or things like that, that will be hard to spell out. I guess that would be hard for an AI to kind of figure out, but a human could figure it out. That&#8217;s why not all the episodes have transcripts, but that is something in the future I would love to do. And if you&#8217;re a company that&#8217;s listening and wants to sponsor us to make that happen, I am all ears. Hit me up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, this is a really good question. This one is from Cole M. Cole asks, &#8220;what are your thoughts now about AIGA? In early episodes, it seems like you didn&#8217;t like the organization, but you&#8217;ve also worked with them in the past. And now you have the new president of AIGA as a guest on the show, which is it?&#8221; Okay. Fair enough. I would say I probably still continue to have a complicated relationship with AIGA. Part of that complication, I&#8217;d say it comes in waves.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Back when I was starting out as a designer in the like mid-2000s, and trying to really become a part of the design community in Atlanta, I did reach out to AIGA Atlanta several times, and never really heard anything back. They never responded to my emails. I would go to events. I would feel out of place at events and things like that. And so it wasn&#8217;t until, one, I started this podcast. And two, they saw that I was doing work with AIGA National, that the local chapter here started to pay attention to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d say probably the most egregious example of that is when I spoke at HOW Design Live here in 2016, and the president of AIGA Atlanta at the time had reached out to me, and was like, &#8220;Oh my God, I feel like I should know who you are. I don&#8217;t know who you are. You&#8217;re one of two Atlanta people that are speaking in this conference. We should get to know each other.&#8221; Which I was like, &#8220;Whatever.&#8221; Super transparent. We didn&#8217;t know who you were before, but now that you&#8217;re hot, we kind of want to know more about you, that sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like Cole said, I have volunteered with AIGA. I was on their national diversity and inclusion task force for three years. Did a lot of work there. Ended up making my exit from the organization. And then a few years after that decided to cancel my membership with AIGA. I do have a complicated relationship in that respect. I&#8217;d say within the past, what&#8230;almost 10 years now? I&#8217;ve seen AIGA go through now three executive directors. Like I knew Ric Gref√© back when I started the show. I knew Julie Anixter, who was the executive director, and I still keep in contact with. And I know Bennie, Bennie F. Johnson, who was our 375th episode guest, who was the new executive director of AIGA, not the president.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve had relationships with each of them. Bennie and I actually talk fairly regularly outside of podcast stuff. I would say Bennie, and this is to the organization as a whole, I mean, it&#8217;s over a hundred years old, and they have not done a great job with keeping up with the times. I think anyone that is a modern designer, particularly if you&#8217;re a product designer or a UX designer that came about in the past 10 years, like AIGA doesn&#8217;t really have any relevance for you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s partially the organization&#8217;s fault with not really keeping up, in that respect, with the trends of where the design community has gone. I think they are starting to make those changes now, and starting to become more of a professional organization that offers services and access and information of things that are of importance to current working designers. I can say they did not offer that before.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So like there&#8217;s different conferences and webinars. There&#8217;s like continuing education courses and things you can get now through AIGA. They&#8217;re really trying to turn things around. I&#8217;ll say from the time that I have worked with AIGA, I&#8217;ve even been to the headquarters in New York. Recorded, not an episode there, but I did record an interview there. Got to sit in the AIGA boardroom, and talk to people. They&#8217;re a small organization. I&#8217;ll say that they&#8217;re may be about 25 to 30 people. So they&#8217;re not this like massive group. They&#8217;re a small organization that happens to have these different chapters across the country. And each chapter kind of operates independently, for the most part, of AIGA headquarters.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so a lot of people&#8217;s, I think experience with AIGA, particularly through their chapter, is what colors their perception about the organization as a whole. Certainly that was the case with me. Now that I&#8217;ve worked both with local and with national, yeah, I have kind of a conflicted relationship. Am I an AIGA member now? No, I&#8217;m not. But I do think that they are starting to become an organization that is doing what needs to be done for the modern designer now, which is really be not just an educational resource, but I think also becoming a resource that is important to the design business community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ll give you an example. In Canada, there is a organization called RGD, which is kind of, I don&#8217;t want to say Canada&#8217;s answer to AIGA, but it is a professional organization for graphic designers in Canada. And a lot of employers in Canada really look at your RGD membership as a good thing to have on your resume, or something like that. So if you take the skills tests and things that RGD has, and you are able to put those on your resume, then it means you&#8217;re a designer of a certain caliber.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Whereas I think if you&#8217;re an AIGA member and you put that on your resume, it probably doesn&#8217;t mean anything to most companies. They probably have never even heard of AIGA, or know why it&#8217;s important, or why hiring an AIGA member is a benefit over hiring someone who is not an AIGA member. Those are things that I think the organization still is trying to work out for itself. Those are kind of my thoughts on AIGA.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s still an organization that is doing great things. Like many other companies and organizations, they&#8217;re trying to find a way through this pandemic, because AIGA does and continues to do a good number of in-person events and things like that. It&#8217;s just different when you can&#8217;t congregate like you used to. Like how do you have the big AIGA design conference, for example, that&#8217;s like a four or five day event, how do you have that when everyone&#8217;s at home? You bring it online. And so they&#8217;ve managed to bring it online and make it more accessible to more people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now that they&#8217;re using online as kind of that event space, they&#8217;re able to have other types of events that they can spin up for different sort of niche parts of the design community. They&#8217;re doing what they can. I am still not a member, like I said before, but I think they are taking steps in the right direction to make the organization more of what it needs to be for the modern designer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sarah Z. asks, &#8220;why are you charging for job postings? The job board on Where Are The Black Designers is free, so I don&#8217;t understand why I should post a job here instead of there.&#8221; Okay. So I debated on whether or not I was going to include this question in the episode, because it&#8217;s a question, but it&#8217;s also actually a very common gripe that I get from companies that write to the show. So I figured this would be a good public way to say what I&#8217;m already saying privately to many companies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I understand that companies are trying to diversify where they post their listings. It&#8217;s something certainly I think that has been a thing that&#8217;s been present in the industry, but especially after the kind of &#8220;summer of racial reckoning&#8221; in 2020, a lot of companies were like, oh, we need to seek out the black voices and where the black people are and blah, blah, blah, and all this all kind of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, I get that. And people will look at Revision Path, they&#8217;ll look at other black/POC focused job boards, like Where Are The Black Designers, or People of Color in Tech&#8230;there&#8217;s a number of them. There&#8217;s actually a lot of them now more than there used to be. Some of them do allow you to post for free. Some do have a charge that&#8217;s associated with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When I started the job board, which I think was back in maybe 2015, 2016, I think, the price was $99. So it has not changed the entire time that I&#8217;ve had the job board. Actually, what we did, I want to say around 2016, 2017, was we started to offer lower priced job to your listings based on the type of job that you were posting. So, full-time and part-time jobs were $99, but if it was say an internship or a contract gig or a freelance gig, it would be $49. So we would make it half price.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And what I found was that people didn&#8217;t even want to pay the $49. They expected it to be free. A lot of people expect some kind of discounts. Like I will have multi-billion dollar organizations that will contact me and want a discount on a $99 job posting. Usually they want it for free. But when I say it&#8217;s $99, they want to know if there&#8217;s any discounts. I don&#8217;t offer discounts. Like I keep the price low to make it accessible. I know that if I were to have it for free, everyone would post jobs here, which is not to say that&#8217;s a bad thing. But then on the back end, I would have to spend so much extra time trying to filter out what&#8217;s quality from what&#8217;s not. And what I find to be the differentiator for that is putting a cost on the listing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The cost is $99. We mention it on the podcast, like three or four times when you post it, depending on when it falls within our production cycle. So it&#8217;s getting out to thousands of people worldwide, which I think is a pretty big reach, aside from it just being on our job board. We also used to do a newsletter. We found the newsletter was not very active in terms of people finding out about stuff. So we would just put them right there on the podcast. And actually, if you go to the job board, I think it&#8217;s still there. But if you subscribe to RSS feeds, I don&#8217;t know if people are still doing RSS feeds in 2022, but you can get a RSS feed to the job board. And then you can get the jobs as they&#8217;re posted, like with no delay. So, it&#8217;s a big reach.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And the reason that I have that cost is to make it so I can differentiate between that. There&#8217;s this comparison thing in this question that I also wanted to address, which is, why is this black job board free, but this black job board isn&#8217;t? Don&#8217;t do that. Don&#8217;t do that. If you&#8217;re a company that&#8217;s doing that, don&#8217;t do that. Like, one, black people are not a monolith. But two, we&#8217;re catering to different, I want to say we are catering to fairly different communities with Where Are The Black Designers does, with Mitzi Okou and what I&#8217;m doing with Revision Path.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m sure in the Venn diagram of our two communities, there is some overlap, but it&#8217;s not a perfect circle. So to try to compare and say, well, their job board is free, and your job board is $99. What&#8217;s the deal with that? I mean, it&#8217;s $99 because it&#8217;s $99. Also all the proceeds from the job board go right back of the show. Like the money from that pays RJ. It pays our transcripts. It pays for advertising. So it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m just pocketing the money. I don&#8217;t see any of that money. It&#8217;s a direct loop right back into the show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So every job listing that we get, yes, it makes sure that it goes out there, but then also it keeps the show alive. I mean, for several years we had a Patreon, and we still have a PayPal where you can donate either on a one time basis or on a monthly basis. But I found those weren&#8217;t ways to really keep the show going. The job board really keeps the podcast alive. And so those listings go directly back into the show. So that&#8217;s why I charge that much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One is quality control. And two, because it&#8217;s a source of revenue to keep Revision Path open. Well, I mean, not like it&#8217;s closed like a business, but you know what I mean. It keeps the show going. But I will say, the jobs that we get are from all over. There&#8217;s educational jobs, there&#8217;s private sector, jobs, there&#8217;s small businesses, et cetera. We just did this thing last year, where we created kind of like an enterprise type job board sponsorship. So if you wanted to sponsor for like the entire year for one flat price, which is, to be completely transparent, is $2,000. You can post as many jobs as you want to the job board, no problem. You get a code. You can post them all the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One of the current job board sponsors we have is Work &#038; Co, and they post all the time. I&#8217;m sure if you&#8217;ve listened to this show within the past, what? Maybe like five or six months, there&#8217;s been several Work &#038; Co positions that we&#8217;ve put up. And they&#8217;re a pretty well known reputable agency. As to why we charge for job postings, like I said, one, it&#8217;s quality control. Two, it actually keeps the show going. Like it goes directly back into the production of Revision Path. That&#8217;s why I do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Next. Y&#8217;all are giving me some really spicy questions here. I&#8217;ll answer them. Anyway. This question is from R.G. who says, or who asks, I should say, &#8220;why is Facebook a sponsor of Revision Path? It feels hypocritical given all the harm Facebook has done to this country and this democracy that you would cape for them so hard on this show. Why is that?&#8221; Y&#8217;all are a trip. Okay. I&#8217;ll answer it. I&#8217;ll answer it completely honestly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Revision Path first came on Facebook&#8217;s radar in 2015 back at South by Southwest, when I did the Where are the Black Designers presentation. I did it there. Some people from Facebook were there. They invited me to their Facebook house. For those that don&#8217;t know for South by Southwest, it&#8217;s this big interactive, film, and music festival that takes place in Austin every year. And so companies, particularly for the interactive part, will rent out spaces like restaurants and things like that, and basically turn it into their base of operations, also known as their house. So you&#8217;ll to have like a Facebook house, a Microsoft house, an eBay house, whatever.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So Facebook had a house there, and I got to meet folks. That is how, from doing that, I ended up not only speaking at Facebook to close out their design lecture series in 2016, but also got to visit the campus, be on the headquarters, record a number of interviews while I was out there. And yes, Facebook has, in the past, financially sponsored Revision Path. Facebook has not been a sponsor of Revision Path since 2018, I think, 2018.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When we joined the Glitch Media Network, again, I&#8217;m trying to be as truthful here. I&#8217;m just trying to think of the best way to put it. When we joined that network, the CEO of Glitch, who is Anil Dash, has said a number of very kind of inflammatory things about Mark Zuckerberg, who is of course the CEO of Facebook. And so let&#8217;s just say that that didn&#8217;t really mesh well, the fact that we were joining this network, and Facebook is like, yeah, you know what? They kind of just gave me the silent treatment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So for the year that we were on the Glitch Media Network, Facebook was no longer sponsoring. I think there was conversations and opportunities around re-upping that sponsorship in 2020, but then with the pandemic and everything, it all just kind of fell through. We were even at one point, and this is kind of leading up to our 300th episode, we were going to do that episode at Facebook&#8217;s headquarters in New York, and had been talking about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The team that I had at the time &#8212; shout out to TK and Deanna and Britt &#8212; yhe team I had at the time had even went to Facebook&#8217;s campus in New York to scout it out for the event, but it ended up falling through. We ended up getting The Greene Space. The rest is history. I&#8217;ve had conversations with folks from Facebook since then. Facebook is now Meta, but Meta is a huge organization. Even the people who I talk to back in 2015 have moved on from the company, or they&#8217;re in other parts of the company. So I have to speak to like a whole new person about what Revision Path is and why it&#8217;s important. So I often have to like plead my case to them several times.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And after a while it&#8217;s just like, well, why even bother? Especially once we joined the Glitch Media Network in 2019, and that wasn&#8217;t a fit in terms of being on the network of a company that has openly disparaged the sponsor. Kind of not the best thing to do. I&#8217;ve had conversations with folks from Facebook. I mean, of course we&#8217;ve had still people from Facebook on the show, but they have not been a sponsor for a minute, Facebook/Meta. I mean, even at the top of the year, we had Charlene Atlas, who was a researcher at Meta Labs, their Reality Labs. Yeah, that went fine, but that was not a sponsored thing. We haven&#8217;t spent Facebook&#8217;s money on this show in years, but I appreciate that people are, I guess, calling me out in a way, or calling the show out for that sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I do appreciate that because it keeps me honest. It makes sure that the audience knows like this is where we stand in terms of like certain issues and things of that nature. But no, Facebook/Meta has not been a sponsor for a long time. I could see how, that sort of hypocritical remark, I could see where that would come from, particularly because we were taking their money during the time of like Cambridge Analytica and all that sort of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I get that, but a lot of that information came out after we had already took and spent the money. So like, I can&#8217;t unspent the money and give it back to them. But I also never told them like, we are no longer sponsoring. They just sort of moved on, especially once Facebook themselves got into podcasting. I think, and I&#8217;m speculating here, so if you work for Facebook and this is the case, don&#8217;t come after me, but I&#8217;m speculating that once they got into podcasting themselves, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, why are we sponsoring shows?&#8221; That kind of fell through. And to be honest, I haven&#8217;t pursued it since then.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Rob asks, &#8220;I have a question, but it&#8217;s about something related to Revision Path, RECOGNIZE. What happened to it? And is it coming back this year?&#8221; I&#8217;ll answer that second question first, which it is not coming back this year. I&#8217;m not sure when RECOGNIZE is coming back. I do want it to come back, but it&#8217;s not coming back this year. As far as what happened to it, tail as old as time, we don&#8217;t have the money to put RECOGNIZE on. That&#8217;s kind of the biggest reason behind it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The first year that we did RECOGNIZE, we received a grant from InVision from their Design Forward Fund, and that allowed us, one, the opportunity to pay the illustrator and to pay the writers for their finished edited submissions. But then it also meant that it would have the audience of InVision on their blog, which I think is called Design Together, I believe is what it&#8217;s called. So we had that big kind of megaphone and platform for the first year of doing RECOGNIZE.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The second year, we started it in 2019. The theme in 2019 was Space. And then we started in 2020, and the year, the theme for 2020 was Fresh, I believe. The pandemic kind of put just a big rain cloud over the entire kind of, I don&#8217;t even want to call it a competition, because it&#8217;s not a competition, but it put big rain cloud over the entire process, because people aren&#8217;t thinking about trying to submit to a design anthology when they&#8217;re just learning about this virus and how it&#8217;s spreading and what they can do to try to protect themselves from it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We did receive a fair number of submissions, but what happened was we got, I think we got down to six, that were kind of good ones that I wanted to move forward with. And then four of them completely just dropped out of the process. They were like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time for this. I&#8217;m too stressed. I&#8217;m too this.&#8221; Which I completely understand. And we ended up just proceeding that year with two authors, Regine Gilbert and Kahlil Crawford, I believe is his last name. And we published those. Those two ended up also getting republished in A List Apart. Shout out to Aaron Gustafson, who&#8217;s the editor-in-chief over at A List Apart for helping to make that happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But the interest, because of the pandemic kind of died out. Plus I had just lost my job. I was paying for all of this out of pocket, like out of savings and everything. So it just got to the point where it&#8217;s like, oh, this is a lot. And even as I thought about the third year, I wanted the theme for 2021 to be Reboot. And we had made graphics for it and did a campaign. I think the open time was like three months, which is the largest submission period that RECOGNIZE has ever had, to give people enough time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And we got a number of submissions. And then after reading through all the submissions we got, I didn&#8217;t feel any of them were good enough to kind of move forward on. There were like three or four that I&#8217;m like, well, maybe if we shifted this and changed this. But then just kind of stepping back and looking at the entire process with how much it was going to cost and how much time it was going to take to work with these authors. And the fact that these submissions were just not really up to the quality that we used to get. The quality really decreased from year to year of the submissions.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I made the executive decision in 2021 to just put the hiatus on RECOGNIZE. One, because, like I said, the quality just wasn&#8217;t that great. I mean, it&#8217;s hard to put out a design anthology of essays when the essay prompts that you&#8217;re getting, or the essay submissions you&#8217;re getting have nothing to do with the theme that we put forward. Like the theme was reboot, and we were getting just basically things that people wrote about whatever they wanted to. They wrote about nothing that had to do with design. They just wrote stuff. Some people sent in designs, which&#8230; it&#8217;s a literary anthology, so you don&#8217;t need to send me something visual. So the quality just was really not that great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then looking at how much it was going to cost in terms of editing, paying the illustrator, paying the writers, I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I just don&#8217;t have the money for this.&#8221; So we didn&#8217;t have a sponsor or anything lined up for it. And so that&#8217;s why I ended up putting it kind of on hold. One of the things I would love to do in the future is bring it back, but bring it back in like an actual printed form. I&#8217;m working on a project right now, at the job where I&#8217;m at, where we&#8217;re making an actual magazine, like a print magazine. And so I&#8217;m able to work with printers and see how much it costs and all the kind of behind the scenes stuff that goes into making a print magazine.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m like, I think RECOGNIZE would be great as like an annual digest of some sort, but that would require, I think, many more submissions, many more quality submissions, in order to make that happen. Not to mention the price to print and ship, which was much less than I thought it would be once I really started doing research. That&#8217;s what happened with RECOGNIZE.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The quality of the submissions greatly decreased. The pandemic I think just took a lot of wind out of people&#8217;s sales for wanting to contribute to something like this. And I didn&#8217;t have the funds to really keep it going on my own. If we get a sponsor that&#8217;s able to make it happen, then maybe we&#8217;ll bring it back. To answer that second part of your question, again, it is the not coming back this year, and I don&#8217;t know when it will come back in the future, but it will come back. I do want to bring it back, I just don&#8217;t know when.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Medina D. asks, &#8220;I recommended a friend of mine to be a guest on the podcast. When are you going to interview them?&#8221; So this particular guest that Medina is talking about, I&#8217;m not going to say who the guest is, but I have already reached out to them, just waiting for them to hopefully respond, and we can make that happen. But I do want to sort of pull the curtain a little bit back on how we have guests on the show and how this process works. Because I would say within the past maybe year, maybe the past two years, I&#8217;ve gotten a lot of people who want to come on the show who it&#8217;s very clear they&#8217;ve never heard the show before at all. And the only reason that they want to be on the show is because it&#8217;s a black podcast.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I will get any number of people in a number of different fields. Many of them not even designers. I&#8217;ll get nonprofit CEOs. I&#8217;ll get marketing people. I&#8217;ll get authors of business books, all want to come on the show and talk about my book. Oh, I want to come on the show and talk about this project that I&#8217;m doing, and it doesn&#8217;t fit with the tenor of the show. They&#8217;ll say they&#8217;re a big fan. And I&#8217;m like, well, clearly you&#8217;re not a big fan because you would know that we don&#8217;t cover this sort of stuff on the show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d also say probably the interesting thing is that many of these people who do this are also not black. Is it a black show? Yes. Because I&#8217;m a black host and I talk to black guests, and that&#8217;s the thing about the show. Like I talk to black designers and black tech people too, but I try to be very deliberate in that, because what will happen sometimes is that I think, one, because Revision Path has been around a long time. And because we do kind of straddle between design and tech, Revision Path is often miscategorized as a show for people that it&#8217;s not even about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So like for example, people will say, oh, well, Revision Path is a show about black designers in Silicon Valley. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s not geographically specific in that way. Or people will say, well, Revision Path is a show that talks to BIPOC creatives. We don&#8217;t talk to BIPOC creatives. We talk to Black designers, creatives, artists, that sort of thing. So I have to be very deliberate in that, because oftentimes Revision Path just gets lumped into the overall &#8220;diversity in tech,&#8221; or, I guess diversity in design conversations too, but in a way that makes people think that they can just come on the show for whatever reason, even if they don&#8217;t fit sort of what the guest roster is, or what the theme of the show is about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When I do have guests on, I try to let them know that even if there is a particular project that they want to plug, the interview is not just about the thing you want to plug. Like we&#8217;re not that kind of show. First of all, because I record in advance, like up to a month in advance. Like by the time you hear the interview, it&#8217;s been at least a month or so since we&#8217;ve had that conversation. It&#8217;s hard for me to do really timely things. And I do that on purpose to keep our production schedule pretty lean in that respect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But secondly, if you just come on the show and it&#8217;s all about, here&#8217;s the one thing that I&#8217;ve done, that doesn&#8217;t make sense in the entire archive of the whole show, because it&#8217;s about people&#8217;s individual journeys as designers, as developers, et cetera, et cetera, not about this one thing they did this one time with this one company that they worked with. It doesn&#8217;t become this sort of evergreen sort of thing, if you just want to come on and talk about one particular thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I don&#8217;t know. I think Revision Path has ended up in some PR database, because I get all kinds of folks that are like, &#8220;Oh, I want this person to be on my show. And they&#8217;ve done this, this and this.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, this is a white man. Why would I have them on the show? You looked at the guests, do you see that I have white men on the show? What&#8217;s not clicking? I don&#8217;t know. They&#8217;re clearly not paying attention in that respect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But to put a finer point on Medina&#8217;s question about the friend that she had said wants to be on the show, oftentimes people will recommend like friends of theirs, colleagues of theirs, et cetera, to be on the show. And I like that. I love to get that sort of warm referral. What I will ask is that if you do that, please supply enough information to me, so I don&#8217;t have to hunt down who this person is. Like for example, someone will say, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve got a really good friend who should be a guest on the show. Respond back and I&#8217;ll tell you who it is.&#8221; I&#8217;m not going to do that. Why don&#8217;t you just tell me who it is instead of having to play this kind of back and forth game.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Or they&#8217;ll give very little information like, oh my friend Alan would be a great designer. Okay. Alan who? Does Alan have a last name? Do you have a link to Alan&#8217;s website or LinkedIn, so I can find out more information about this person whom you&#8217;re recommending? Make my job a little easier by giving me the information, especially if this is like a friend or a colleague of yours that you want on the show. Like, help them out. Like help me out, but help them out too, to make sure that that information is correct.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, when I do outreach, and I guess this is sort of branching out from your question a little bit, Medina, but when I do outreach, I try to make sure that I connect via email. One, because I just have my one inbox, and it&#8217;s just easier for me to manage it that way. If you&#8217;re a designer that&#8217;s got a contact form or something like that, just make sure that it works. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I go to a person that I would love to interview, and I go to their website, and there&#8217;s absolutely no way to contact them. There&#8217;s no social media links. The contact form doesn&#8217;t work. There&#8217;s no email address listed. It&#8217;s like, how am I supposed to reach out to you?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And maybe they don&#8217;t want to be reached out to, which is fine. That is totally something that you can do, that people can do. I don&#8217;t feel any sort of negative way about that, because for a while in my career I was very much the same way. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk to me, just let me do my work.&#8221; But it becomes harder when there&#8217;s not really an easy way to contact the person, or I don&#8217;t have enough information for me to do even preliminary research to see if this person would be a good fit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Also because I do record very far in advance. Just because you send me this person&#8217;s name, I may not get to them for months, because I already have other people whom I&#8217;ve reached out to, or there&#8217;s just other folks in the queue. So it may take me a while to finally get around to that person, but I&#8217;ll get onto them eventually. I have a long list of about, I think I mentioned this earlier, maybe about 2000 to 2,500 people, that I could reach out to. Like I go through that list pretty regularly when it comes to reaching out to folks because I&#8217;ve been keeping the list now for nine years, and I&#8217;m continually adding to it and such. And so I make sure that when people recommend folks, I do move them to the top of the list.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d also say, let that person know that you are recommending them. So that way if I reach out to them, it&#8217;s not this, well, who are you? And what is this show? And blah, blah, blah, that kind of thing, because then it&#8217;s weird. It&#8217;s like, okay, well your friend recommended me, or your colleague recommended you to come on the show, and they often don&#8217;t even know. So like, let your friend know, copy them on the email or something. Help them out as well. But yes, to Medina, I did reach out to your friend. If they happen to get back to me, I would love to have them on the show. Let them know that I reached out to them, and then they can respond, and we can make that happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. We&#8217;ve got time for one last question, and this comes from Maya W. who asks, &#8220;you always ask a guest where they see themselves in the next five years, where do you want Revision Path to be in the next five years?&#8221; My overall aspiration for Revision Path is to grow this into becoming a multimedia network. The biggest reason I think is to grow beyond being typecast. I mentioned before about how Revision Path is often kind of misnamed or mislabeled as all these other things that it&#8217;s not. Being able to grow Revision Path into a network allows or would allow me more places to really say, this is what this is about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What I&#8217;m envisioning with this kind of multimedia network is we still continue the podcast, because that&#8217;s the main keystone of all of this. I&#8217;d want to keep that. Maybe expand out to do other types of shows. There are other shows I would love to do. I would love to bring on other hosts on this platform. Maybe acquire some shows, have like a Revision Path network. That would be great. I would love to do something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I would want to have an editorial arm at Revision Path, where we bring back the blog and have a regular staff of writers. We bring back RECOGNIZE, and make that a printed annual design anthology. And I would even lump 28 Days of the Web into that as well. Like bring that under the whole editorial arm. And then branch out and do video as well. I sort of teased that a little bit, about the possibility of doing some sort of a weekly live show, maybe on Twitch or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I also want to do short documentaries or licensed short documentaries, licensed web series, things like that. Basically really build this out so Revision Path becomes kind of a staple in the Black community that deals with design. When I started Revision Path, I&#8217;d say probably one of the thing that I really wanted to do was make sure to inform people about who Black designers are. Like why are we doing this? What&#8217;s the reasoning behind all of this?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Part of this also even stems from research that Cheryl Miller, who, AIGA medalist. We&#8217;ve had her on the show before. Has talked about her 1985 thesis around basically why is it that there aren&#8217;t more Black designers in the industry? And part of that being that a lot of Black parents don&#8217;t really understand like what design is, or they think of it as a hobby and not an actual profession.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so one of my hopes with expanding Revision Path into being this multimedia network is to provide enough information so people know like what design is. Like the black community knows like this is what design is. These are all the different sorts of things that you can do. And it&#8217;s as viable of an option to go into as if you were to go into medicine or to go into sports or to go into engineering or whatever. You just have more information.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, granted there&#8217;s been a lot of talk and initiatives and things around STEM. Arts kind of gets lost in that. Sometimes it&#8217;s lumped in as STEAM as opposed to STEM, so the A gets thrown in there. But I want Revision Path to be this multimedia network that really lets people know that creativity in the Black design industry of course is something that we&#8217;re known for. These are the types of people that are doing it. These are the positions that are available. These are career paths that you can take. Basically just provide more information.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like I&#8217;ve been very fortunate that I know that the show is even taught in some schools. Current designers are learning about this show and learning about the people on this show to help inform them as designers when they get out there in the world and create new things. Imagine the kind of reach that Revision Path can have if we&#8217;re able to do that through more ways than just this podcast.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Podcasting is great, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but I also realize that the platform is the barrier to getting out to more people, because everyone&#8217;s not going to listen to a podcast. They may watch a YouTube video. They may read an article or something like that, and so to allow Revision Path the space to grow into those particular types of media would be great. Next five years I&#8217;d want to do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And of course be able to do Revision Path full time. Like right now Revision Path is very much still my nights and weekends project, because I work a nine-to-five job. I would love to do Revision Path full time, and have the sustainable revenue from patrons and from companies and from sponsorships to be able to really do this full time and really crank out a bunch of great stuff. It&#8217;s not still just me, because I do have a small team, but to even be able to expand that team out to do more would be great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Next five years, I hope to be there. I am putting things in place to make that happen. I just brought on a sponsorship director to help with getting more funds in for the show. And turn that revenue into these things that I want Revision Path to eventually become. I&#8217;ve got a plan for it, I just have to try to work the plan, and hopefully within the next five years we will be there, and you will be there too.</p>

<p>The introduction of the metaverse to the general public was one of the biggest topics in tech last year. As we all learn more about the metaverse and what it means for the future of the Internet, I thought it would be a fantastic idea this year to talk with some of the folks out there who are involved with the metaverse in some capacity. </p>
<p>Meet Charlene Atlas, an interaction designer for undoubtedly one of the biggest companies to stake their claim in the metaverse &#8212; Meta. We started off our conversation talking about her resolutions for this year, and she spoke about her work on the Reality Labs team. From there, we discussed the metaverse and some of Meta&#8217;s plans, and Charlene shared how she became interested in technology, gaming, and eventually got into the AR/VR space.</p>
<p>Charlene is just one of many people who are helping to create the future of the Internet, so I hope you get inspired by her work and discover a way to chart your own course!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
Hi, my name is Charlene Atlas and I am on a mission to break our content free from flat screens. As an interaction designer in Reality Labs research at Meta, formally Facebook, I work with scientists, researchers, and engineers to envision and create the far future of virtual and augmented reality.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Break our content free from flat screens, I like that. It&#8217;s funny, I&#8217;ve had some folks on the show before that have done AR and VR, mixed reality. And I always keep bringing this up about, I don&#8217;t know if you remember this television show in the &#8217;90s called VR Troopers.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
No, I&#8217;m not familiar.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, people that listen to the show are probably tired of me mentioning it. But there was this show called VR Troopers, very much in the same vein of a Power Rangers, it was very much like a Japanese like Sentai, Karate Kid show. And they were basically these kids that fought in virtual reality. It&#8217;s so interesting because I think about that time and then I think about the topics that are discussed now around virtual reality and the metaverse and how that was fiction when we were kids. And now it&#8217;s reality as adults, which is just wild to think of.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a lot of things that we thought in the past we couldn&#8217;t do you that we can do now. And so I&#8217;m hoping that in the future too we can achieve the impossible, what we think is impossible now, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So we&#8217;re recording this right before the new year, just so folks know. But I&#8217;m curious to know, how has 2021 been for you, any grand discoveries or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s been pretty interesting for me because in late 2020, I had my first child in September.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
Yes, thank you. So he&#8217;s about 14 months old now. So it&#8217;s been a pretty interesting year for my husband and I, having our first kid. And he&#8217;s just changing so much every day and it&#8217;s great to watch him grow. And doing that all during the pandemic has definitely been another layer of challenge and adventure. But we&#8217;re doing good. Yeah, thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice, nice. I guess going forward, thinking about 2022, do you have any particular plans or resolutions or anything?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
I think the main thing for 2022 is that we really want to see our families. So none of our family has actually met our son yet. So really want to figure out all of this pandemic stuff and be able to see our families back home.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can imagine that&#8217;s, oh, wow, with a new baby. I&#8217;m sure your parents and other family and stuff. And then his his dad&#8217;s parents also probably want to see him too because wow. Hopefully you all can make that happen.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
Thank you. With his age, he can&#8217;t get vaccinated, that kind of thing. And then you have older parents and so it&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s not the best combination for the current situation. But I feel hopeful that we&#8217;ll get to see each other next year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Fingers crossed, I hope that happens for you, I really do. So you work as an interaction designer at Meta, which, of course, most people know about as its former name, Facebook. What does interaction design mean at Meta in terms of the work that you do?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m particularly in Reality Labs, the organization that focuses on augmented and virtual reality. And within that, I&#8217;m in the research organization. So even though I&#8217;m called an interaction designer, it&#8217;s different from what you might assume of web design or 2D interface design. It&#8217;s more about how are we going to interact with this new medium of virtual and augment interfaces. And so that&#8217;s what I mean when I say interaction designer. My team that I work on with research design is a different field from product design, in that you&#8217;re not focusing on making a product that you&#8217;ll then release in a few years, it&#8217;s more that you are working directly with scientists and engineers who are making completely new technologies to look at what is the user value, potential user value in the future of these technologies, what are things we could change to have more impact in the future, and maybe even what are new technologies we should invent to really meet the needs of people in the five to 10 year timeframe.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can imagine it&#8217;s probably really interesting to think that far out as it relates to technology and what you want to accomplish and things of that nature. What does a typical day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
I&#8217;m involved in a lot of different projects. And so of course there&#8217;s meetings with the research teams, there&#8217;s doing the usual designer things of making specifications for how an experience should be built. So we build experiences that use some of these new technologies. We often also have to build what we call time machines, so this idea of creating an experience that&#8217;s simulating things that we expect will exist in the future so that we can better evaluate things that we want to create. So there&#8217;s a lot of prototyping and also a lot of writing. So at Meta in general, we value writing a lot. So there&#8217;s a lot of writing of what are people&#8217;s future visions, what are ways to approach work. Also if you have any new ideas, you usually have to write a one pager of some kind to start getting traction around it. So it&#8217;s mostly a lot of writing, making mock-ups, talking with researchers to understand what question we need to answer to really get the technology in the right direction to really make the impact we want to have in the world in the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me more about Reality Labs. You mentioned a bit about what the makeup of the team is and I guess the technology that it works on. But can you just go a little bit more in depth about that?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
So rally labs, so we have more of the product side that focuses on our current work. So things like the Meta Quest, Meta Quest 2, VR devices that we have out in the wild. But then the research side, we have a lot of different research teams inside that focus on a variety of topics like graphics. So cutting edge graphics research, optical research, display systems, perception science, like how do people perceive what they&#8217;re seeing. So we really have a team for each piece of what we think will be necessary to build the future for VR and AR that can really become the next wave of technology for the world.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
So if you think about that shift that happened from command line interfaces to the GUI, that&#8217;s the level of shift that we&#8217;re trying to make with AR/VR in the future. So basically we&#8217;re trying to cover all of the different senses that humans have, all the different things that people might need to be able to do. We have world class researchers in each of those areas that we can work directly with and see how we can put all that together into something that can hopefully be a transformational change in the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about the metaverse which Facebook debuted at Facebook Connects a few months back. On a high level, so our audience can understand it and also so I can understand it, what is the metaverse?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
The metaverse, as we&#8217;ve talked about in the public, is an embodied internet. So this idea of connecting with people that you care about and really feeling present with them is one of the key pieces of it. And this isn&#8217;t something that is limited just to my work in AR/VR, but it&#8217;s really something that exists and can be accessed by lots of different devices. Just like now, we are in a call or if we&#8217;re in a video call or if you&#8217;re on the internet, there&#8217;s lots of different ways to access the internet and lots of different ways to join a call or what have you. So it is really about putting the pieces in place so that we can move beyond where we are right now with just having these mediated surfaces right between us and instead feeling like we are together and can really engage as we would in real life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s really just like, and then correct me if I&#8217;m wrong here, it sounds just like a natural extension or progression of say the internet that we know now.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
If you think about the internet now even this isn&#8217;t real, what we&#8217;re doing now. It&#8217;s being replicated, there&#8217;s so many steps of audio being replicated and represented. So really we have our senses, we interpret what we receive and we feel or have a sense for what&#8217;s going on. And that&#8217;s the same thing with a metaverse, is just that it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s going to take years to build just because of the scale of what we&#8217;re trying to do. But you can think of it as that next step of how do we really feel like we&#8217;re together. This is a huge leap, what we&#8217;re doing right now of what it was like decades ago. So that&#8217;s the leap that we want to make into the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
As you said, that reminded me of the scene in the matrix where Neo goes to meet the Oracle for the first time. So Neo goes to meet the Oracle and before he meets her, he has to sit in this little waiting area. There&#8217;s this kid that&#8217;s bending these spoons. You know what I&#8217;m talking about, this part of the movie?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
Yes, I remember [inaudible 00:12:16].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And the kid picks up the spoon, he picks up the spoon and then he hands it. Well, he bends it then he hands it to Neo. The kid is like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t try to bend the spoon, instead try to bend yourself and then you&#8217;ll realize that there is no spoon.&#8221; So for me, I&#8217;m going a little esoteric here, so bear with me, to me, the way that I think about that with the metaverse is that just like how you&#8217;re saying this isn&#8217;t real because of the recreation of voice across electrons and distance. We&#8217;re not talking really in real time, it&#8217;s like a simulation of that. So when you think about the metaverse and that extension of that, it&#8217;s taking what we already know now with the internet and it&#8217;s ways and culture and stuff like that, I would imagine. And thinking about what that means on just a grander scale.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
It&#8217;s helpful to think about, what are the barriers that exist now? And going back to your question before for of, how do you project that into the future? That&#8217;s part of what we think about. Is like, what are the things that people have issues with now? What are the technologies that exist that are on track to land at certain points in the future? And so then now knowing those technologies are going to be in place, what can we enable for people? What are the experiences we can enable? And these are experiences that, as I said, it&#8217;s not going to be that you can only access it on a particular device. It&#8217;s going to be, anyone can access it on their own device, in their own way. And all of those different access points have to be available experience for people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m glad you mentioned that about the access. Because what I remember from Connect is that most people were using the Meta Quests 2, which people know also as the Oculus Quest 2, that was its old name. But people have seen that device in terms of, oh, this is how folks are accessing it. And like you said, there&#8217;s going to be different ways to do it in the future because the Meta Quests 2 is, of course, not the only device that you can use to access virtual reality and stuff. You can use a cell phone or you could use another device from another company or something like that. So it sounds like as this builds out into the future, there&#8217;ll hopefully be more of a, I don&#8217;t know, like democratization of technology to access it. But I don&#8217;t know if that necessarily all has to stem from Meta, it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
Yeah, right. And as we&#8217;ve said, in the different releases, we&#8217;re not trying to&#8230; It&#8217;s not that it&#8217;s like we are making the metaverse and nobody else is. We&#8217;re building for the metaverse, we&#8217;re getting ready, we&#8217;re getting ready for us all to be at that point. Just like the internet isn&#8217;t owned by any particular company.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s helpful to think about it that way, in that Meta is building for the metaverse and that Meta is not creating the metaverse. I&#8217;m trying to make sure I get that distinction down.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
This is like nobody is making the internet. Yeah, exactly. You&#8217;ve got it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I get it, I get it. I&#8217;ve been around on the web for a long time. And I remember even in the early days of the web going from web 1.0 to web 2.0, just the big shift, especially as it related to social media and how do we communicate with each other now in these new ways that we didn&#8217;t before. Because web 1.0, and I&#8217;m dating myself here, it was basically just research. All you did was just look up things and read them. Email existed back then, but it was in a very rudimentary state. And there certainly weren&#8217;t a lot of social spaces unless you thought about maybe a forum or Usenet or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then social media really started to take hold, let&#8217;s say what, maybe in the mid 2000s or so with Facebook being one of them, but Twitter and other things. And then as those platforms and experiences grew, this whole other culture arose with it as these things grew. So I see now, it sounds like we&#8217;re starting to transition from web 2.0 to web 3.0 or web 3 with the metaverse. There&#8217;s going to also be that same type of culture change in a way.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
And definitely similar to what you just described happening on the internet, is what I hope at least will happen, and what we talk about a lot at work will happen in the metaverse of creators having the chance to create new things. That&#8217;s one of the reasons even that I&#8217;m a designer, is that I just love that you can put something out there and people can find new ways to use it and find new ways to express themselves. So I think it&#8217;s going to be really great for giving creators that chance to find new ways to express themselves.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And even with that expansion and culture, there&#8217;s a lot to think about in terms of just like&#8230; It&#8217;s weird for me to think about it this way because I distinctly remember how the web really clicked over from one to two. And now how it&#8217;s about to click over from two to three. I even from one to two, there were so many new things that were created with the advent of social media and user generated content. The whole economy around online advertising, that&#8217;s a whole industry that did not really exist in 2000. And now you do Google ads or whatever. There are people that have made millions just off of advertising on the internet. Now you can think of, with the metaverse, there could be different economic opportunities like that, or how do brands get in on this? And what about intellectual property and all this stuff? Like how do you factor in all those considerations in your work?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
Some of the things we&#8217;re doing now that are a peek into the future is that Spark AR. So we do have AR that you can do face filters, that kind of thing on your phone. And we recently hit 700,000 creators on that platform. So people are already finding new ways to use these new mediums to create. As far as all these other things that we have to consider that you mentioned, something I&#8217;m really proud of that our group has done is release our responsible innovation principles that you can look up online. So we&#8217;re really laying out these are the principles we&#8217;re going to have as we build this new thing. Because we know that there&#8217;s going to be all of these questions and we want to build out in the open and we want to address things out in the open with everyone. So there&#8217;s definitely a lot to figure out and we&#8217;re doing our best to make sure we do it responsibly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s so exciting to really think about the path that you all are really forging with this and to take all these considerations and things in mind. It&#8217;s interesting you mentioned that about Spark AR because I just saw a tutorial on TikTok, of all places, on how someone can easily make like an AR drawing, a Spark AR drawing using Procreate. So this person had a Procreate drawing. And for people listen, Procreate is a drawing application on the iPad. Basically they took those layers and dragged them into a Spark AR thing and was able to&#8230; It looked really easy. It was a TikTok, so they illustrated it in like 60 seconds. I was like, &#8220;Oh wow, you can easily make AR things just like this?&#8221; Yeah, I can see how that economy or even that just opportunity for creators to make new things in this space will really unfold. Especially once more people start to understand the technology, are able to get their hands on it and really just understand the possibilities behind what can be done.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
You can download Spark right now and make stuff. I was making stuff the other week, just it&#8217;s pretty easy. So that&#8217;s really great, what you just mentioned because you never can fully imagine all the things that people might use it for. And it&#8217;s really great to watch people discover new ways, new mediums of art and expression.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So we&#8217;ve been talking about the metaverse, let&#8217;s bring it back to the real world. Let&#8217;s talk more about you because, of course, you&#8217;re the guest for this episode. So tell me more about where are you&#8217;re from, where did you grow up?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
So I am from Maryland over on the East Coast and my family is from Haiti. So my parents are from Haiti and they met in New York and moved to Maryland and had my brother and I.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Growing up, were you exposed to a lot of technology?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
I think my earliest memories are in school using a huge floppy disc to play games in the computer in the library, so there was that. My brother was really into video games and so I played a lot of games. It was through that playing games with my brother that really got me interested into technology. I really wanted to make games since I was pretty young because I just loved how much fun it was to play with him. I remember looking in the manuals back when there used to be manuals in the games, there&#8217;s a list of names there and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I could do this? I could do this, make games?&#8221; So I just started a journey of trying to figure out how I could do that. And I wrote a letter to Sega asking what classes I could take all of these things. So it started me off there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did they write back to you?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
They did. It was a really nice letter they sent. And they said take math and this and that. So when I went to high school, I actually did a science and technology magnet program that I got into for high school. So I did a lot of science and technology courses there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Very cool. And of course that interest and passion eventually ended up leading you to USC, where you double majored in computer science games and East Asian languages and cultures. That sounds like quite a course load. Tell me about your time there, what was that like?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
It was pretty interesting because&#8230; well first of all, I applied and accepted without ever visiting it. Because I was living in with Maryland and I was applying to schools. And this school, they had this computer science program that focused in games. And it wasn&#8217;t even that they had it yet, it was going to be ready in a year, and so I&#8217;d have to do the regular computer science and transfer into it. But I was just so excited to be able to go to a four year university where I could learn about other things, and East Asian languages as my other passion as well, and get to focus on making games. And it&#8217;s this great program, it&#8217;s a joint program between the cinema school and the computer science school. So I just was like, &#8220;I have to go there.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
Then I also was in marching band in high school and the USC Trojan Marching Band is one of the most famous bands around. I was like, &#8220;I got to be in this marching band.&#8221; So I convinced my parents like, &#8220;I got to go to this school.&#8221; And I went there. Something interesting is that I actually did get to go there before the school year started because I got into a program at USC for high school students for making games separately. So I went there over the summer, did the high school program, and then continued on to attend the school.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What was it like doing the marching band at USC? Because they&#8217;re a pretty well known band, the Trojans, right?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
Yes, Trojans. So yeah, it was definitely intense. It&#8217;s a full-time job almost, especially since I was in the drum line. I was in the drum line so there&#8217;s extra practices for drum line and then there&#8217;s practices for band. Then you&#8217;re getting up at 5:45 every Saturday before the games because you got to do practice in the morning, then you got to do the marching all the way to the stadium and doing performances on the way, then you got to do the pre-game, you got to do the halftime show, the post-game. So it was a lot of time and so it was tough doing the computer science major, the band, the East Asian languages with the focus in Japanese major. I did some part-time work to help pay for school. So it was pretty busy, but it was so fun being in the band. And I got to do all kinds of&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
In addition to doing the Rose Bowl, going to the Rose Bowl four times in the Rose Parade four times, I was able to also do various LA gigs, since we&#8217;re known as Hollywood&#8217;s band. So I&#8217;ve been on the Grammy&#8217;s, I&#8217;ve been on BET Awards, game shows, and stuff. So it was just a really interesting thing to be doing in college and just getting to have these experiences.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then on top of that, you also even got a chance to study abroad too.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
So I did take five years to finish because with the two majors plus I went to study abroad in Tokyo. So went to Jochi Daigaku, which in English they referred to it as Sophia University. And it was really fun. I stayed with the host family, I took my classes. The classes were pretty hard, maybe I shouldn&#8217;t have studied so much, I should have traveled around. But I was like, there was a lot of classes that I was taking in addition to Japanese language. So it was fun, a great learning experience. And I assumed that I would be back, I always thought I would live in Japan long term. But it was a lot of fun and it was great to reconnect to Japan because I had also gone there in high school as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, what brought you there in high school?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
So my school in Greenbelt, Maryland, I basically had a sister school relationship with a school in Japan. And it&#8217;s called Yokohama Suiryo High School. Basically there&#8217;s an exchange program. So we would have exchange students come in and stay with us and we would sometimes stay over there. So basically every summer, there would be a trip to Japan. So one of the years I went. And the years that I went, one of my friends actually convinced our Japanese teacher to take us on an extra part of the trip where we would bike across the country. So there&#8217;s this road called the Tokaido Road, and it&#8217;s an old route and has a lot of historical significance. There&#8217;s an art print series that&#8217;s based on it. In any case, my teacher had done that trip with someone before because it&#8217;s a trip that people just take either walking or biking. And my friend convinced him to take us on it. I don&#8217;t know how he got the approvals for it, but he basically took us, a bunch of 15 year olds, across the country for two weeks on bikes, 400 miles.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
That was really, I think, a turning point in my life because I had never biked more than a block before, then I had to bike 400 miles. So it was important for me and then also honestly to help my relationship with my father. Because my father was like, &#8220;You can&#8217;t do this.&#8221; After the first practice ride, I was collapsing into his car. He drove a cab at the time, so I get in the back of his cab and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;My legs.&#8221; And we&#8217;ve only gone like four miles and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;You can&#8217;t go to Japan, you&#8217;re going to hold people back.&#8221; All of this, he&#8217;s saying all this stuff.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
But then we came back and my teacher told them how well I did. We did tons of practice rides basically before we went. So I got so much better and my teacher was like, &#8220;Hey, she really can do this.&#8221; My teacher, Mr. Suison, I can&#8217;t thank him enough. He really convinced my dad and showed him she can do these things. And ever since then, he&#8217;s behind me 100% for anything that I do, including when I said I needed to go across the country to USC. So that was helpful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, that&#8217;s quite an experience. I&#8217;d imagine that really builds fortitude, especially in high school.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s pretty hilly at certain parts. Have you ever seen those Japanese prints with the huge mountain? It&#8217;s extreme in the picture, but we were on that thing. So it was pretty hard, but I really of tried to push through. Around that time, Eminem&#8217;s Lose Yourself song was popular. And so I was just repeating that in my head like, &#8220;This is your shot. Come on, this is your opportunity.&#8221; I&#8217;m just trying to get through.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds like a Gatorade commercial or something.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It&#8217;s really helped me, I always feel like I can do anything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And of course, as I did my research for the interview and saw you had a lot of great experiences in college. I can imagine even just doing the band is a lot, with all of the different appearances that you had to do. But studying abroad. One thing that I mentioned before we started recording is that you interned at NASA in college. I interned at two NASA facilities in college as well. What was your internship experience like there?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
Actually my internship was during high school. So my high school, that I mentioned Ellen Roosevelt, it had, as part of the science and tech magnet program that I was in, you had to do a senior project. And you could do it either as your own project or as an internship. And fortunately, right next to my school is NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. So I was able to do a computer science internship there, that was really cool. I&#8217;ve always loved space, and so it was great to work there. I worked in the cryogenics lab. And basically what they do is they reduce the temperature on sensors. It&#8217;s a technology for reducing temperature on sensors so that they can be sensitive enough to receive what the sensors need to receive from space. So the intention is that these things would be sent out into space and they need to be kept cold enough to do their job basically.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
So the project was to&#8230; They had this program running their machine, their cryo machine, and it was called a, what was it called? It&#8217;s a very long name, it was like adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators or something like that. They were running this program on it, but it was super slow. So my project was to rewrite it all in LabVIEW, which is this sciencey way of doing programming, a visual programming language. I think they were using, I forgot what they were using before, but&#8230; So I rewrote it and it worked a lot faster and they were so happy. It was supposed to actually get sent to space, but then all of the funding got pulled. I think something about George Bush happened and then all the funding was pulled for all of their stuff. But that almost got to go to space. But later on, a holo lens was sent into space with some of my work on it. So I feel like I&#8217;ve been vindicated there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, that&#8217;s so interesting. When I interned at NASA in college, I did two internships. I did one at AMS, which is out in Moffett Field near Mountain View. What was interesting is I interned there and it was around the&#8230; I think when I got there, first of all, it was my first time in California, but I got there and I remember people on the NASA campus where buzzing about this new search engine called Google, have you heard of it? I remember all of that because it was right around, it was summer in 2000. And people were really buzzing about this new, yes, this new thing it&#8217;s down in Mountain View called Google or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Then I did Marshall Space Flight Center in Normal, Alabama, my junior year. But then they also pulled the funding for our program because 911 happened. So they pulled it and then the funding went towards Homeland Security. So the goal initially was oh, you intern at these two places. And then when you graduate you&#8217;re set up to work for NASA, that was what I was going to do. But then they pulled the funding and it&#8217;s like, well, sorry, good luck. I&#8217;m trying to find something now. So that&#8217;s interesting that that ended up happening or a similar thing. I don&#8217;t know, maybe this might have coincided around the same time, I don&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s really interesting.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
Because I graduated around, let&#8217;s see, 2005 or something. So maybe, I don&#8217;t know. But I think probably it&#8217;s likely that projects funding gets pulled all the time maybe.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
[crosstalk 00:31:35].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s one thing that NASA is really known for, is not getting a lot of funding. So that makes sense actually. While you were in college, you got a chance to intern at a gaming company, Electronic Arts. Was that your first foray into really working on games in that way?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
Yeah, it was great. I went down to San Francisco area, worked at Electronic Arts. And yeah, it was my first gaming company job. So I was a software quality assurance test intern. So basically testing the game, creating automation, and doing programming for testing the game and improving the quality. It was really fun, I worked on, let&#8217;s see, I think I worked on SimAnimals on the Wii, and a little bit on Dante&#8217;s Inferno. It was a great experience to get that chance. I guess a similar situation what you just described, they were going to hire me full time. They were saying like, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll come back to you and hire full time.&#8221; But then they froze hiring. So it was another thing where I felt like, oh, maybe I&#8217;ll work here, this will be where I work, but then it didn&#8217;t work out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting how that stuff ends up happening in college. And then for me, I had to scramble and find oh, well what&#8217;s going to be the thing that I end up doing? Because I was in school on a certain path like, yeah, I&#8217;m going to go this way, and then you get this big curve ball thrown at you. In your case though, you ended up getting hired by a pretty big tech company right around the time you graduated is that right?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
Microsoft came to our campus, came to what we call the game pipe laboratory in the games major and talked with us and asked me if I would come interview. So I ended up working at Microsoft as a software development engineer in test or an STET, which is a role that they don&#8217;t have anymore. But basically the role, how they describe it, is that you are the last line of defense for the user in terms of the game. So working on Xbox, working on the Connect game. So connect is the first motion controller, if you remember it, of basically you could use your whole body to control the game. And so worked on the launch titles for that as my first work there.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
And then while I was there, we started working on HoloLens. So HoloLens started and it was a pretty nascent project when I got involved, to the point that the test team was basically the only people who could run the demos. So I was involved in a lot of high level demos, just making sure things would go right and all of that. The HoloLens is basically a headset mixed reality computer. So while I was working on HoloLens, I actually switched to design, and I can get into that story if you want. But yeah, Microsoft was my first corporate gig.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about that because you were there for a little over eight years. So you had a long time to really settle into the work that you were doing. But you started out, as you mentioned, in engineering, you started out in engineering and then you transitioned to design, what brought that shift about?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
So as I mentioned, the test role was advertised as you&#8217;re there to protect the consumer, you&#8217;re their advocate. Then while I was on HoloLens supporting HoloLens, my test team was assigned to the studio that had a really great design design team, and I started learning more about design. Also around this time, one of the creative directors in the org started posting pages from universal principles of design in the bathrooms for some reason, in the bathroom stalls. I was like, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; This is the most interesting thing I&#8217;ve ever read. Because if you know that book basically each page, you can learn this whole, a principle of design and how it&#8217;s shown in the real world. I was like, &#8220;This is amazing, what is it?&#8221; So a few things came together there.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
I had also been looking into, how long do I want to stay in test? I started literally going around interviewing people who had been in the test field for 20 years to see, what are you all working on? I want to be you someday. And then after talking to them, I was like, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want to do that.&#8221; That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing now, but just on a bigger scope project. So all of these things came together and I just talked to my manager and I was like, &#8220;I think I want to switch design.&#8221; I talked to the creative director for the studio we were supporting about and he started giving me some tasks to do and I did well with those. I had been helping one of the designers with user tests. So having people come in and try out the application. And we started this list of metrics for how much people were enjoying it. And I really loved seeing those metrics like go up.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
I was supposed to be in charge of putting in code into the build to collect data on how things were going, filing bugs, all of this. But I was like, &#8220;Who cares about the bugs if it&#8217;s not fun?&#8221; So I realized that I cared more about, and I always have cared about experience. But apparently at this moment I was like, &#8220;Oh, design is the one, this field design is the thing that I thought I was doing or that is accomplishing the goal that I actually have of making an experience for people that matters, that they feel, and that they have fun.&#8221; So they gave me a chance. And funnily enough, the creative director, he said part of the reason he gave me a chance was because I&#8217;m a musician. So he knew that I had at least some creativity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, interesting.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
So I was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m glad I did that.&#8221; I guess, do music my whole life. So I interviewed and then I haven&#8217;t looked back. So that was back in&#8230; Basically I&#8217;d been in test for about four years and then 2015 or so is when I switched to design. So I got to work on the launch experiences for HoloLens and then go on to work on incubation projects and windows before I came to Meta.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s interesting how something that you were doing as a, I don&#8217;t know if I would necessarily say it&#8217;s a hobby, but like another interest of yours, music, ended up being in a way this entry point for you into design. Which I think hopefully for people that are listening, illustrates how important it can be to be well rounded when it comes to the work that you do. It&#8217;s one thing, of course, to focus on what it is that you know, but then if you have these other interests, they can often guide you in many different ways. Like growing up, when you mentioned the science and tech stuff, I was captain of the maths leagues in high school, I majored in math in college, and I was also a musician. You mentioned musician, I was a session musician in my 20s and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting how eventually design ended up becoming my career, because I didn&#8217;t want to be a math teacher. I liked math, I didn&#8217;t like it that much to go and teach it. But I certainly liked it enough to get a degree in it, which that&#8217;s probably a whole other story. But it&#8217;s interesting how those other parts of yourself or those other interests and things that you have contributes or can contribute to other opportunities and things that you can pursue.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s actually what I&#8217;ve always loved about game development because games are something where it&#8217;s a mixture of art and science. So I&#8217;ve always wanted to make sure I had a lot of interest and things I could pull from to create in my game development. Then I also feel like both music and design are about making people feel something. My approach to design is that I think of this magic moment of, what is this feeling I want to have someone experience by using this prototype or using this thing someday when it&#8217;s a product? What is that feeling I want them to have either in what they&#8217;re trying to do or connecting with someone else in this? Music is like that too, where you can make someone feel something. So I think it&#8217;s a really interesting connection that they have.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, what are you excited about at the moment? This is probably a vague question considering what you&#8217;re doing with Meta and all of that. But what&#8217;s the thing that&#8217;s really exciting you right now?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
Like the group that I&#8217;m in at work, an interaction design group that I talked about earlier, I think we really have an opportunity. And I think we&#8217;re go going down some really interesting pathways as to, how do we actually move forward? Like I said at the beginning, how do we move away from how we do computing right now? So I&#8217;m really excited about some things that we&#8217;ve released publicly recently on our tech blog about our tenure vision for AR and about some of the things we were building such as a haptic glove for being able to actually feel virtual objects, to wrist based interfaces that can be controlled by EMG or electromyography in your wrists so that you can do very simple interactions. So I think it&#8217;s just a really big opportunity we have to finally, after decades of doing things one way with computing, of keyboard and mouse and standard way of doing things, we actually have an opportunity to really improve just how we do things in general. So I&#8217;m just really excited to be a part of that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, your career to date, just one, going through what we&#8217;ve discuss so far, has been super prolific working for Microsoft, working for Electronic Arts, and even all of your other activities with music and going to Japan and everything like that. As you look back at your career, who are some of the people that have like really stood out and have helped you as mentors?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
What&#8217;s interesting, I&#8217;ve touched on some of them in this talk, which I guess is saying something. My teacher back in high school, Mr. Suison, who took us on that trip. He didn&#8217;t have to&#8230;. I assume he took on a lot of risk taking a group of teenagers across a foreign land. But that really helped develop me as a person and define me for a long time, so I really appreciate that. I mentioned that person who took a chance on me, Cameron brown. So the first creative director I had who hired me as a designer, and he really took a chance. I think there&#8217;s a lot of times in our lives when people just&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
If you make the right connections, people will give you an opportunity that if you take that opportunity, it really can change the course of your life. I really appreciate being able to do this design work from that opportunity because it really is aligned with just how I think about how I want to make an impact in this world. So I really appreciate everyone who&#8217;s contributed to that. And really takes a lot of people over a long period of time to get us all to where we are right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If there&#8217;s someone that&#8217;s out there that&#8217;s listened to your story and they want to follow in your footsteps, what advice would you give them?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
Well, as far as following my footsteps, I think it&#8217;s really important to figure out what makes you excited and what makes you feel passion for what you&#8217;re doing. One of the things that got me the Microsoft job, I learned at some point, was that they really wanted me make sure I show the passion for what I&#8217;m doing. They gave me advice through the different rounds of like, &#8220;Make sure you show that your passionate for what you&#8217;re doing.&#8221; Because that really will drive everything you do after that, and so that&#8217;s what I focus on. I just focus on wanting to make&#8230; What is the impact I want to make? And how can I do that? And how can each day go towards that?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
As far as getting into this field, the AR/VR field it&#8217;s surprisingly easy these days to really jump in and learn things. There&#8217;s Unity game engine for building experiences. For example, we actually have a program called Oculus Launchpad. So promising VR creators from underrepresented backgrounds, we actually give support to them to build experiences, put their products out there. So there&#8217;s a lot of resources at Meta for people to get involved. But there&#8217;s also just a lot out online. Spark AR that I mentioned, build something. So like in general, I would say figure out what your passion is and then actually start just doing something, bias towards action. So if you have an idea, build that idea. If you don&#8217;t know how to do it, figure out how to do it. There&#8217;s just so much you learn from just trying to build something. Because if you just try to learn a topic without actually building something, you&#8217;re going to be missing out on a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you think you would have went into if you didn&#8217;t go into tech?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting. I feel like depending on which point of my life we&#8217;re talking about, I think it would&#8217;ve been different. So I&#8217;ve always loved space, so sometimes I think about maybe even someday in the future, working more in the space field. I just really love the idea of humans going to another planet and all that. I don&#8217;t know how I would contribute necessarily at this point. But I just love that idea. Also with the interest in Japan, which stemmed from my interest in video games initially, I sometimes think about, I could have gone into, of course, with the other major, I could have gone into translation or being maybe a Japanese teacher. But probably if I was going to go down that path, I&#8217;d probably go into translation because I really loved the idea of helping people connect.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
And that was one of the biggest things I learned from my exchange experience. Was when we would have students come visit us or we would visit them, we were all just high school students, we were all silly laughing high school students, even though we were from different countries and spoke different languages. That&#8217;s something I learned really early on about people, that we&#8217;re not as different as we think. So I love that idea of helping other people communicate between each other, even if they&#8217;re speaking a different language. So just in general, anything that involves connecting people is something that I would go into.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
And I&#8217;ll just also say AR, VR, augmented reality, one of the things that excites me so much about it is this idea of being able to be present with people, like I talked about earlier. Basically I feel like AR, VR is the next best thing to teleportation. So I wish I could teleport to go see my family or go to places I haven&#8217;t been in a long time. But I feel like I&#8217;m working on the next best thing. So I guess also if teleportation ever becomes a thing, I would definitely work on that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting you mentioned that about space because one, space is super, super interesting. But like right now, I feel like there&#8217;s this whole thing around governance of space. Because no one owns space, it&#8217;s space, nobody owns space. But you have the international space station, you have other countries that have launched satellites and things like that. And there&#8217;s tons of space junk just orbiting the planet or in the planet&#8217;s fairly low orbit or something like that. And it&#8217;s like there&#8217;s no real governance around space or cleaning up space, I mean space in terms of just what&#8217;s around the earth and stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Because there have been some times I think this year where a couple of people were talking about, &#8220;Well, how come we can&#8217;t just take all the planet&#8217;s garbage and launch it into space?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;That&#8217;s ridiculous.&#8221; If you think about it on a logistical level, humans create a lot of waste. Do you know how much time that&#8217;s going to take, how much fuel that&#8217;s going to take? And like just dumping it in space doesn&#8217;t solve the problem. Anyway, space is infinitely interesting. And I do feel there are a lot of opportunities there even with the whole new Space Force thing. But from research capability, certainly with other planets and things. But if earth is our home, which it is, then our yard is filthy, there&#8217;s toys and stuff, it&#8217;s a mess. So maybe, I don&#8217;t know, focus on that, I don&#8217;t know. But that&#8217;s a whole other thing.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
I think space exploration and the work that we do on augmented reality, virtual reality relate in that there&#8217;s a lot of uncharted territory. That&#8217;s one of the things that make it really exciting right about space, is like, who knows what&#8217;s out there? We got to get there, we got to see stuff. And that&#8217;s what my group does. Is we got to go out there and figure this out. Because basically every day there&#8217;s a long list of unknowns that we&#8217;re dealing with and it&#8217;s just a very high ambiguity space. So honestly, it can be frustrating sometimes. But it&#8217;s also exciting because the potential for what we can learn is just so huge. And that&#8217;s what I like about both of those areas.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
High ambiguity spaces are a lot of fun because you then really get to carve out what you want to do and figure things out. The fact that nothing is really concrete means that you can do what you want, but also establish rules and things. So I like working in those spaces, it&#8217;s really fun. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? I think just based on the work that you&#8217;re doing, of course, it&#8217;s going to be future focus. But if you really could look into 2026, I think two, five, six, what kind of work do you see yourself doing or what work do you want to do?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
Like I said, we work in the five to 10 year timeframe. And so I&#8217;m hoping that five years from now, we&#8217;ll be in a place where some of the things we&#8217;re working on have landed or we&#8217;ve figured out what we shouldn&#8217;t be doing. I just really want to be helping us get to that place where things are getting more defined and we&#8217;ve landed in a good place. So right now, I&#8230; So I&#8217;m an individual contributor, I don&#8217;t manage any people, but I do drive a lot of, what we call, cross group collaborations. Like you have an idea and you can drive it with a lot of different people.</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
So I would love to keep doing that work but at a greater scope. And just really helps carve out the strategy for how are we actually going to land this thing? Because even once we&#8217;ve figure out a lot of things like, &#8220;oh, we figured it out,&#8221; we have something in the lab that works, is great. But then it&#8217;s like, okay, now we really have the work do of how do we actually transfer it to something that people could actually use? So I think five years down the line, I&#8217;d love to be a leader in the organization that&#8217;s helping to find some major piece of this future we&#8217;re trying to create.</p>

Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work, all of that? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Charlene Atlas:</b><br>
You can go to charleneatlas.com and on there you can also find the link to my LinkedIn. Definitely hit me up if you&#8217;re interested in working in Reality Labs. Also the tech.fb.com, the Tech Facebook blog has a lot of our latest research information posts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Charlene Atlas, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. As I was doing my research for all this, and I mentioned to you before that I&#8217;m going to this metaverse conference thing tomorrow, that I&#8217;m super excited about. But as I was putting all this together and really just digging into your background, you have accomplished so much. It&#8217;s mind boggling to see the work that you&#8217;re doing now, and because it&#8217;s such an uncharted space. I hope that people will get a sense of your passion for this, as you&#8217;ve mentioned before, about people being passionate about this. I hope people get a sense of what your passion is for this. And hopefully that can fuel them to see what new possibilities might be out there for them, especially as we embark upon a new year. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>

Thank you so much, Maurice. It was great talking to you.</p>
