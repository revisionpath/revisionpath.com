Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>I&#8217;ve been getting into TikTok a lot lately &#8212; don&#8217;t judge! &#8212; and that&#8217;s where I stumbled across the work of this week&#8217;s guest: Gabe Gault! Gabe&#8217;s brilliant portraiture blends the work of the Renaissance masters with Black culture in a brilliant and beautiful way. Not only that, he painted the largest mural in the world &#8212; the <a href="https://www.glasscityriverwall.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Glass City River Wall</a> in Toledo, Ohio. I mean&#8230;talk about impressive!</p>
<p>Gabe talked about how he landed this massive project, and talked about growing up an artist in a big sports family. We also discussed Black fine artists being exhibited through this new wave of Black-created media, lessons he&#8217;s learned throughout his creative journeys, and even talk a bit about NFTs and the metaverse. If you&#8217;re looking for a creative pep talk, just follow Gabe&#8217;s advice: &#8220;Go out there and create on any scale!&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Hi, my name is Gabe Gault, and I&#8217;m an artist from Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So Gabe, what&#8217;s on your mind? How&#8217;s the year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Oh, man, it&#8217;s been an amazing year. It&#8217;s kind of been ups and downs. Obviously COVID has happened and is here still. But on the bright side of things, I&#8217;ve been working on a pretty big project myself that&#8217;s been kind of keeping my morale up. But there&#8217;s been other pretty cool projects going on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. What is kind of a typical day like for you as an artist in LA?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
So I wake up. I make sure I kind of get a good start in the morning if I&#8217;m heading to the studio. So I&#8217;ll wake up, I&#8217;ll make some breakfast. I&#8217;m trying to go on a smoothie kind of diet right now because I am getting married in about three weeks or so, four weeks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Congratulations. So by the time this comes out, you&#8217;ll be a married man.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
I will be a married man. That&#8217;s a new life journey for me. Yeah. So it&#8217;s pretty simple, I feel like, my mornings. I usually get to the studio when it feels right, but it&#8217;s usually around 11AM. And I&#8217;ll have everything kind of prepped out and ready to go. I&#8217;ll get there and I&#8217;ll just have a jam session for the rest of the day until I feel like it&#8217;s time to leave really. But it&#8217;s kind of all flow for me, I would say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you kind of just get in the zone once you get to your studio and then see where the day takes you pretty much.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Definitely. Besides that, I&#8217;m usually running errands about my manager. He lives on the west side of town. So sometimes we&#8217;ll drop off paintings or go to meetings and stuff. I try to keep it pretty relaxed. I don&#8217;t want to stress over my work anymore. That&#8217;s kind of been a big thing coming up as an artist, is there&#8217;s a lot of stress sometimes, only if you let it. But I feel like every day is a pretty good day because I get to wake up and do this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, we talked about this a little bit before we started recording, but you&#8217;re one of several black artists that I discovered via TikTok.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Dude, insane. It still blows my mind. When anybody tells me they found me through TikTok, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t imagine this a year ago.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How does social media help out with what you do?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Social media is a powerful tool for the better or for worse, and TikTok specifically is one of those things that really twisted my mind because it changed the way I thought about social media. I was on Instagram for a number of years. It took me a certain amount to get a certain amount of followers. Not that that&#8217;s like an end all be all. But that&#8217;s what I was kind of working up on there and getting a decent views on my work. And then I went to TikTok.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
And I think in the course of a couple months, I&#8217;m almost about to surpass my other social media platforms and all the hard work I put into those kind of seem irrelevant now compared to TikTok. It&#8217;s a great tool because you get to interact with people and you get to talk to people in a way you just couldn&#8217;t really do in real life. You get to show people a little bit of your life, or whatever you want to show them, really. It doesn&#8217;t have to be your real life, I guess, as most of you will know. Yeah, it&#8217;s an amazing, powerful tool. But it is, at the end of the day, just a tool you can use to better yourself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, the interesting thing about TikTok, and I&#8217;ve been on there now for, I don&#8217;t know, maybe a few weeks now, just kind of casually observing, is one, it really has the spirit to me of like the old way of&#8230; I&#8217;ve been around on the internet for a long time. I remember the early web and how really just sort of wide open it was. You really could just go down these deep rabbit holes of information and find all kinds of weird things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I think what&#8217;s interesting with TikTok that platforms like say maybe Instagram or twitter don&#8217;t do is how they take your one piece of content that you make and it almost like splinters it out into these different ways that people can discover you. Of course, say you do a video. There&#8217;s the video that people can see if you come up on your &#8216;for you&#8217; page. But the video also has audio. And the audio can be your own audio, or it can be like pre recorded audio that you select from their database or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then as you type up the description on the video, you can have hashtags. all of that stuff is also its own like search portal in a way. People searching for that sound can now come across your video or people searching for that hashtag now come across your video. And so you get people discovering your work in all these kind of weird and interesting ways that maybe they wouldn&#8217;t before on another platform because it&#8217;s only funneled into one mode of discovery.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Yeah. And I feel like it&#8217;s just so different from everybody else&#8217;s. You can have a completely different TikTok from the person sitting right next to you, just like the algorithm and what videos you see. I&#8217;ll be sitting next to my fiancee and she&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;How have you never seen this video?&#8221; Her videos are all pumpkin, spice lattes and witches and astrology. I&#8217;m on the completely other side with people dabbing and doing art and doing murals. Everything is just completely different. Mine is like video games. It really makes you see how big the internet is just only on TikTok, but it&#8217;s an insane space and platform.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, and the creativity is just out of this world. I mean, of course, the tool itself has all these different kind of features that you can edit video and change the duration and the speed and all that sort of stuff. The trend that I&#8217;ve been seeing recently that is really dope is&#8230; And I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve seen this. And it&#8217;s funny because by the time this comes out, it may have already passed.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But there is this trend now of like, you remember like fighting games like Tekken? There&#8217;s like the &#8216;you lose&#8217; screen where the opponent talks smack. And so you&#8217;ve got all these different people doing these different versions of what that looks like, but to the same sound. If you search that sound, there&#8217;s like hundreds of videos of people. You&#8217;re the like vaguely weird character with the random move set or you&#8217;re the sleepy character with all the power. It&#8217;s crazy. It&#8217;s so wild.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
I love those so much. I&#8217;ll be on there for hours on end. It&#8217;s just unhealthy. But at the same time, it gives me so much joy, so I think it is healthy. But yeah, it&#8217;s a crazy platform. I think the Glass City River Wall video I did of my Ohio project, it did like 1.3 million views. But I remember shooting it and I was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll just take a picture of this, just some random clips and put it together.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
And then that was the biggest view count I had on that page. But it&#8217;s just crazy. You never know what&#8217;s going to hit or what&#8217;s not going to hit. I feel like you put together just something random and somebody is going to appreciate it. It&#8217;s just like putting that stuff out there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, you mentioned this mural, the Glass City River Wall project. Talk to me about what it is and how you got involved with it.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a whole project that had a global call for artists. They had about 500 or so submissions. They narrowed it down and I was the artist chosen for it. It&#8217;s a giant grain silos in Toledo, Ohio. There&#8217;s about 28 silos in total and it&#8217;s about three football fields long and 134 feet high, I believe. So they&#8217;re pretty massive. By the end of the thing, it should be the largest mural in the nation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Please talk about it. What was that process even like?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
So it was a pretty lengthy process. This is where we had to put together all our resources we ever had and really figure out how to get this thing done. Because it&#8217;s one of those things where nobody has done anything on this scale. So you have to figure it out and get the right team. And luckily, what I love about Toledo, it&#8217;s this big, small city, and everybody&#8217;s just super hard working there.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
I had so many people reach out to me and offer their skill set for the project, whether it&#8217;s like donating coffee or juice or doing footage, drone footage. Actually, two of the guys who reached out, this guy, Nick, reached out, and he was a videographer. He shot documentaries and stuff. So he reached out. And another guy, we call him Dino, he also reached out, and he&#8217;s a local artist in Toledo.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s at the point where I couldn&#8217;t see this project going the way it&#8217;s going without those guys because they&#8217;re just such a huge asset to the project. So it&#8217;s like a little bit of knowing what to expect and then expecting the unexpected and taking whatever wins you can. But it&#8217;s a good project. I feel like we&#8217;ll be done by end of November, possibly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. What is your creative process like when it comes to starting a new project? I mean, I&#8217;d imagine something as big as the Glass City River Wall project, that happens on a massive scale. But say it&#8217;s just a regular painting or something, what does that creative process look like?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
I always try to put some kind of meaning. I like coming up with conceptual concepts. I sometimes do a lot of portraits, which are pretty straightforward, depending on the subject. But sometimes I get to mess around and paint people who are inspiring to me. So that&#8217;s usually the subjects that I choose, are people who inspire me and so shape our way. I want to talk about the background as well.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
I do a camouflage background, which represents blending in and standing out. People who blend into your everyday life and stand out by doing something that impacted you in a positive way. And that&#8217;s usually how I like to choose my subjects, is somebody who has changed me forever.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I&#8217;ve seen some of the ones that you have on your website, and they kind of range. You&#8217;ve got Nipsey Hussle, but then you&#8217;ve also got Yayoi Kusama. You have a big range of portraits that you&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Yeah. I feel like there&#8217;s been a kind of gradual change as well throughout my whole, I guess, timeline of painting. Because I started out painting a lot of pop figures I looked up to or I liked or somebody I knew loved them. And now they&#8217;re changing slowly into pop figures and they change to people I would interact with daily, every week and learn something from them or learn a lesson or love their story and want to paint them.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
And now I&#8217;m kind of leaning into a conceptual phase of painting different&#8230; I&#8217;m working on this project called Afro-Rama, which is like African Rome. The first piece I did is Romulus and Remus, which is like twists on the foundation of Rome. Then I&#8217;m working on like a Medussa kind of piece and so on and so forth. But more to come from that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, interesting. So kind of like a play on some Greek mythology kind of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Exactly. Yeah, a play on that and some Renaissance age. It&#8217;s kind of like rebirth of the black Renaissance, really. You have a lot of black artists doing some amazing traditional pieces.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I want to go kind of more into your background. Like you mentioned, of course, you&#8217;re now in Los Angeles. Is that where you grew up also?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Yeah. So I grew up in Venice Beach, California. And me and my family, we kind of migrated to the valley eventually. Now I&#8217;m in the valley. I&#8217;ve been here the past&#8230; Geez. I think I moved to the valley in 2006 or something like that. So it&#8217;s been a while. I mean, I love it here. It&#8217;s my home and it&#8217;s kind of like the central point for me to get anywhere to get downtown, to get to Los Angeles or Hollywood or the Palisades or Malibu.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s been a pretty nice run out here. It just gets like super hot. So that&#8217;s kind of a big problem. When it comes time to paint in the summertime, my studio is outdoor, so it kind of like limits me. But I can&#8217;t complain. It&#8217;s a great spot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Growing up, did you have a lot of exposure to art and everything?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
I would say I did in some senses. I was actually inspired by&#8230; I remember this very clearly. When I was about four years old, I think my parents turned on the TV and Dragon Ball Z was on. And then I was just inspired by anime and manga and all that kind of culture. I feel like a lot of creators actually kind of came from that era of like early days of Toonami and anime and stuff back in the day.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
And that was later in high school, like translated to me just kind of drawing that stuff and getting more acquainted with that. And drawing portraits of friends, whether they were good or bad. I was a pretty big sports player. I come from a pretty big sports family. My dad played pro ball for the Super Bowl Bears and the Los Angeles Raiders, hence why I moved out here or why I was born out here.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
So that was like a little bit of a conflict of interest, where it&#8217;s like, I was a artist, but my dad wanted me to play sports from time to time. Of course, at the moment, he&#8217;s super into me being an artist and he&#8217;s been one of my best supporters for the past years. And interesting journey, like going from high school, drawing, to getting more serious about it in college.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
And then I took SMC art course for about two years. I ended up dropping out. I did an internship with my mentor, Rob Pryor. We did that for about six or seven years. And from there, we were actually working on like a fully hand painted comic book. We did a bunch of cool jobs throughout those years of training. We did stuff for Heavy Metal magazine. He was like a part owner of that.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
So I did a lot of comic book stuff. I did a lot of concept art for video games and movies and all sorts of weird, odd jobs. And we were actually working out of this building in Burbank, where we ended up kind of getting laid off of the comic book job. I ended up pursuing &#8216;fine arts.&#8217; That&#8217;s where I wasn&#8217;t making any money. Then I was breaking even. Then I was like, okay, I can do this for a living.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How did you get connected with Rob?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
He was a friend of my dad&#8217;s, actually. I don&#8217;t know how they met exactly. I think they met through like a photoshoot or something. Rob is a pretty strict guy. He doesn&#8217;t take any bull. He&#8217;s like a pretty heavy metal dude as well. So you get in there, it&#8217;s pretty extreme. He&#8217;s blasting music. He&#8217;s a hooligan, for sure. But he&#8217;s my hooligan. He&#8217;s a super talented guy, Rob Pryor on platforms. But he does stuff for all kinds of different music groups. He does conventions. He&#8217;s an interesting dude.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Just to go back briefly to what you said about your dad kind of wanting you to go into sports, and then you were kind of more artistic, was there a point where he finally saw you as an artist?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Yeah. Actually, kind of leading into the internship, I think around the time I was doing that, that&#8217;s when he started to recognize that this is like a career choice and path. Maybe it wasn&#8217;t as smart as going into sports at the time, which they&#8217;re both kind of pipe dreams, to be honest. Yeah, I think that he got on board when he saw that I could make a living doing it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That seems to be the case for parents, I think especially for black parents. Your artistic and they see that you do this, but it doesn&#8217;t really click that like, oh, this can be a profession. It&#8217;s kind of always just like a hobby. And it seems like there&#8217;s always this point where hopefully they finally sort of see you as like, okay, you&#8217;re an artist. This is work that you can do. And it usually comes around money.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Yeah. I think money is the revolving factor right there. There&#8217;s a lot of different jobs that have happened in the past 20 years that just weren&#8217;t available to us, I think as well. So before, they had no idea. I was like, &#8220;Dad, check out these guys. They&#8217;re making millions of dollars playing Call of Duty or video games or whatever.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;What? Oh, my God. What is going on? What do you mean? You should have been playing that. What are you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Dad, I couldn&#8217;t. There was no option.&#8221; There&#8217;s just different avenues that have popped up that blow my mind. It&#8217;s like, if I knew you can make money doing videos and YouTube and stuff like that before, I mean, I just wouldn&#8217;t have been so worrisome of like, what am I going to do? There are so many options nowadays, in my opinion.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s so interesting. My best friend, Chris, who&#8217;s been on the show before, if people want to check him out. I think he&#8217;s episode 40, Dr. Chris Stewart. But he&#8217;s got two daughters, and his oldest daughter kind of wants to be a YouTuber. I think she&#8217;s probably, I don&#8217;t know, maybe about eight or nine years old. She wants to be a YouTuber. And he&#8217;s sort of like adamantly against it, like, &#8220;No. Go to school and learn STEM stuff and all that sort of stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I kind of had to tell him, you got to think about it. Back when we were kids, even working in computers and the internet was like an impossibility because it barely existed. What we do now back then made no sense. So if what she&#8217;s doing now doesn&#8217;t make sense, congratulations, you&#8217;re old. But also, this is where career trends are going. Things are going now towards doing things online and being a content creator.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Exactly. I would say, kids, just stick to TikTok. There&#8217;s going to be some probably big money in it too if you want to turn that into a career. I would also recommend to artists starting out that have some kind of money income. It doesn&#8217;t have to be glamorous or anything, but it would have helped me, for sure. Doing this full time without some kind of like financial stability was pretty rough.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
My dad was pretty rough on me already financially growing up, which was good. I&#8217;m glad he was. But yeah, it&#8217;s rougher to just not have any kind of money coming in, and you got to worry about making a painting or whatever to sell it or to get some kind of comic book job. That stuff is pretty hard to do as a creative. Whatever creative job you&#8217;re doing, I would always say, if you can, have some kind of like financial support from yourself, if possible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. You don&#8217;t want to fall into that like starving artists trope.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s the worst. I do not miss those days at all. That&#8217;s one thing that I would go back and change, is maybe I should just get a part time job or something right here and figure it out. But yeah, it&#8217;s all been good. Everything kind of works itself out at the end.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, back in 2017, you had your first solo exhibition. Take us back to that time. What was going on then?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Oh, man. That was a huge, huge year for me. A couple things happened within that year and a half lifespan or timeframe. That was my first big show in 2017 at MRG Gallery. There was a guy, Michael, I met, and we&#8217;re still pretty good friends. I actually saw him pretty recently, like about a week ago. But that was my first gallery and solo show that I ever had. I had maybe about 15 pieces in there that I worked on throughout that year.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
I think I finished seven of them in the last month of that. So yeah, that was like a big turning point of how I thought about creating art and selling art and how to get people there, how to get people engaged, what kind of steps you should make, what people were gravitating towards, as well, what they liked. I remember correctly, we didn&#8217;t sell any pieces at this show, but I think we sold some following the show, which was pretty good, I guess, for my first show. I had no exposure in that world at all. That was a fun experience. It&#8217;s just one of those things that twist your brand and changes your life forever.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can imagine it&#8217;s probably like the culmination of so many things. I mean, of course, you&#8217;re working to create this sort of singular body of work for this exhibition, but also it&#8217;s kind of like your aha moment in a way, like, &#8220;Oh, not only am I an artist, but I am in like capital A artists with like an exhibition and a gallery. I&#8217;m an artist.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Yeah. I think it was maybe the first time where I really had something centered around me. That was very important and that helped me move forward and get me used to people wanting to see my work and I&#8217;m an important person. I am who I make myself to be. And that kind of helped me move forward a little bit more in my career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I asked this question to Dawn Okoro, who I had on the show a couple weeks ago. She&#8217;s another artist actually, I mentioned to you I discovered her on TikTok. We&#8217;re starting to see a lot more black fine artists and their work being just exhibited in general to the mainstream over the past probably 10 years or so. I mentioned the Dawn Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald. I mentioned those two specifically because they did the Obama portraits, but also those portraits are now on tour in the country.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now they&#8217;re going around to different cities, so everyone that maybe couldn&#8217;t make it to the National Portrait Gallery in DC can now see it in their city. But also we&#8217;re starting to see more black artists and their work being exhibited through black media, movies, television shows, etc. And you had even mentioned before we started recording that some of your work has been included in some media like that. What are your thoughts about that kind of exposure? Does that really help you out as an artist?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
I think it does and it doesn&#8217;t. I think if you&#8217;re on some of those&#8230; I was in a show, I think Big Trouble. I think I was in like a documentary on Netflix, somewhere on there. I&#8217;m sure somebody can find me somewhere. I feel like exposure wise, it does help kind of build your credit and credentials. But I think more importantly, it&#8217;s great because black shows and black media can pay black artists. And I think that&#8217;s an important part to move forward for any black artist because that can fuel their next six months or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
That kind of bit of breaking point where after that six months, they had to stop producing work, and then it kind of slows down. But all those little things are wins, in my opinion. Because every time you&#8217;re hiring a black artist or you buy from a black artist, it helps that kind of community grow and it helps that black renaissance movement that&#8217;s kind of happening right now with Kehinde and everybody. It&#8217;s all upgrade.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And certainly now, what I would love to see, because through this show, I&#8217;ve been very fortunate to talk to a lot of people and now see their work out in the world, my hope is that the black artists kind of get that same level of recognition as say like, I don&#8217;t know, Jordan Peele or Issa Rae, just in terms of like you are also someone that is also creating these visual representations of the world and they&#8217;re out there for people to see. People need to know that black contemporary artists exists, period.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
I a hundred percent couldn&#8217;t agree more. For me, personally, I&#8217;m an artist, and I want to branch out. I want to do in a similar fashion what Jordan Peele or Issa Rae do. They&#8217;re kind of entrepreneurs in general. Black entrepreneurship is very fresh and it&#8217;s popping right now and I feel like it&#8217;s a good time to be one and express different avenues of creativity. If you&#8217;re an artist and you want to get into fashion, I think people are now supporting that more than ever.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
If you&#8217;re into fashion and you want to get into making movies, there&#8217;s no stopping you, really. I feel like there&#8217;s Donald Glover&#8217;s of the world who want to just be an actor, be a comedy writer, be whatever they want to be. You can kind of make it all come together. I feel like you don&#8217;t have to necessarily be one thing anymore. It&#8217;s just like, how hard do you want to work?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Being the kind of black creative, multihyphen it. I don&#8217;t want to say it seems like it&#8217;s necessarily the norm, but I think we&#8217;re certainly starting to see it, or rather, I think it&#8217;s starting to be normalized. We&#8217;re mentioning Issa and Jordan. Of course, there are several others that fall into this camp that do multiple kinds of creative work, or they do multiple modes of creative work within one thing. Like Jordan, I think we know from comedy first, but then also is clearly this horror buff also that can really flourish in that realm also.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Yeah. I just saw Candyman, not super recently, but whenever it came out. But that was an amazing movie where it kind of reminded me of a black Blade Runner, like the shots of it. And then it had its horror elements. I love his stuff because you always forget that you&#8217;re watching a horror movie till something pops off and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, this is Candyman. I forgot what I was watching for a second.&#8221; Honestly, I just get inspired all the time by people like that and Issa Rae and everybody who&#8217;s doing something remarkable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where else do you pull inspiration from?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Man, I pull inspiration from a little bit of&#8230; God, what do I pull inspiration from? I feel like I get inspiration from a little bit of everything. I&#8217;m into comic books, I&#8217;m into games, I&#8217;m into mythology. I feel like there&#8217;s bits and pieces that I&#8217;ll deep dive into and I&#8217;ll get on kicks of. I was kind of like going to Roman kick lately of the artwork over there and kind of wanting to replicate what was created back in those times of ancient Rome and what kind of stories were coming out of there.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Then I also remember old stories, African stories that my mom used to tell me back in the day, and I&#8217;m starting to kind of research those in the past week. So it&#8217;s a little bit of whatever I&#8217;m feeling in the moment and I think makes sense and is close to me, or makes sense for me, then I&#8217;ll kind of draw inspiration from that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are there any other artists out there that you admire?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
There are a ton of artists, I feel like. Actually, to get my art style, I think I took my five favorite artists. And this is something I tell younger artists as well. Take your five favorite artists who are still living or dead. Take one element from each artist, mix them together, but making your own. And then you kind of have your style right there. And that&#8217;s something that I used personally and it kind of made up to figure out what was me and what did I like and what did I enjoy that I won&#8217;t get burned out on?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
But yeah, some of those artists I grabbed from were Shepard Fairey, Kehinde Wiley, Retna. Andy Warhol, of course. I feel like you got to at least give him some credit on some aspects of your life. There&#8217;s a couple of them that are pretty mainstream that I draw from that I really liked growing up. I&#8217;ll usually draw from one piece of theirs and then be like, okay, why do I really like this piece? What makes me want to create more pieces similar to this? What&#8217;s the element that is affecting me like that?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is it that you kind of want people to see when they look at your work?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
I want them to like there&#8217;s a little bit of that person who I&#8217;m painting in them. There&#8217;s a piece I did, I think it was for We Rise show in downtown LA. They had those yearly. I think maybe the last one was Into Action. No, it was We Rise, and they do this other show, Into Action. But they do these amazing kind of museum pop ups that they were doing yearly. I think they took a break during COVID because of regulations and it&#8217;s pretty hard.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
But there is a couple pieces I did during that show. One was the first camouflage piece I did, which was a piece of Tupac and he was wearing a Kaepernick jersey. That was my first camo piece I did. That actually didn&#8217;t even make it on the wall. It was a funny story. That didn&#8217;t make it on the wall. That was put behind like a DJ booth almost. That was like a whole bummer. Everybody there is super cool.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
They really tried to make it work, but there were so many artists and very little space left on the walls. But that ended up being one of the biggest pieces of the show. Everybody kind of like went over there and they were like, &#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s that piece over there?&#8221; It kind of made it mysterious a little bit. I was just behind the DJ booth, which I thought was funny. But not on purpose or for any specific reason.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
But I think during that time, that was a big piece. I have people sending like paragraphs to me on Instagram how much that meant to them, how much they appreciated it. It was a big time because that was right after I think Kap took a knee for that. I think it was just impactful for a lot of people to see that. It almost meant, what would this person do today? Where would this person stand politically? So I had Tupac, I had MLK and Cesar Chavez all in Kaepernick jerseys.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s amazing. Let&#8217;s just kind of talk about Tupac for a minute. I mean, he was 25 when he died. He was a kid.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
He was a baby. 25 is like a decade now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s amazing because I would think of folks digging in Tupac and others, even MLK, as you mentioned. They were really young when they were killed. It is kind of part of just, I don&#8217;t know, creative imagination to think about, what would they have believed at this time? Who would they have been as artists or as activists or whomever?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Yeah, it is crazy. I just wonder sometimes how our history would have changed if it wasn&#8217;t&#8230; What if they didn&#8217;t die? Would it be better? Would&#8217;ve anything changed? Would it be worse? It&#8217;s a crazy concept to think about what happened. If MLK was still here, would we have gone further? Did that happen for a reason? I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s just nuts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, also, just what they managed to accomplish in just that short time. When I was 25, I didn&#8217;t know what the fuck I was doing. I was just trying to make it. At 25, I was four years out of college. I think I had just got fired from a job. I remember vividly now. I just got fired. I was working at Autotrader and I got fired. I was answering phones or whatever. I didn&#8217;t know what I was going to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
My mom was like, &#8220;You need to get it together. What are you going to do with your life.&#8221; I was always designing and doing websites and stuff on the side as like a hobby. Because this was like 2005, 2006. There wasn&#8217;t really a market for this really yet. And certainly it wasn&#8217;t something you could just like go to school and learn. And so I had just found a one ad in the back of our local weekly newspaper here in Atlanta and just applied on a whim. And that ended up being the start of my design career. But I can&#8217;t imagine like as a celebrity with that kind of cultural impact that you&#8217;ve had at that age. That&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
You have to be making some moves back then, for sure. That&#8217;s also insane to think about just how, nowadays, you can jump on social media and just become an internet superstar, whatever. But back then you had to really be, I feel like, pushed by everybody. Everybody had to really know who you are, know your name or know your craft. Not that they don&#8217;t nowadays, but you know what I mean.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a whole new ballgame.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
A whole new ball game.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And the internet has made it that way now, where you can really kind of make a name for yourself. And not to say you can make a name for yourself without any sort of discernible talent, although we have seen that. But the internet at least sort of I think in a way democratizes how people can become influencers because the barriers to get to that level of influence have kind of been flattened.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Yes. It&#8217;s definitely more open to the public, for sure, as like who can be seen and who can be heard the loudest, in a sense. I feel like you could be a kid from nothing. I think that&#8217;s like my favorite part of the internet, is when you get somebody who really had no opportunities or no kind of way of getting out of a bad situation. And then they started to put themselves out there on the internet.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
And now they&#8217;re just like mega successful in their own right. So I think that&#8217;s kind of a better version of the area that I like to see the most. Obviously, you have all sorts of variables of that. They could be super crappy people and get that same situation. But that&#8217;s kind of how the game works.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In recent years, what would you say is the biggest lesson that you&#8217;ve learned about yourself?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
I feel like I need to trust my intuition more. That&#8217;s been helpful, trusting that people will accept me for who I am and what I want to create and make and paint and will support me. I think that&#8217;s been a huge, huge influence throughout the past couple years and it has really changed my life and impacted me because I didn&#8217;t always have that. I didn&#8217;t really always believe in myself to get this far or get where I am or get in the position I want to be in. So I think if I knew that a little bit earlier, it would have saved a lot of stress.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who would you have been if you didn&#8217;t become an artist?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
I was never fit for like an office job. I would&#8217;ve either been a scientist or a bum. I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s either/or. It&#8217;s no middle ground. I feel like I always had to be an artist. I had no choice because I can&#8217;t really do anything else in whatever field I wanted to be in. I wasn&#8217;t too great at math growing up in high school and stuff. I was like, &#8220;Oh, I want to be a scientist.&#8221; But there&#8217;s all these equations and stuff. So screw that</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
But funny enough, I think the true answer to that probably would have been like sports probably in some shape or form. And it&#8217;s just funny because I don&#8217;t keep up with sports at all nowadays. And that&#8217;s like kind of what I grew up off of. That&#8217;s like my dad&#8217;s bread and butter. But it probably would have been sports are something in video games, some kind of analyst or something. I don&#8217;t know. I really couldn&#8217;t answer, but something along those lines that is just completely different, I think, in some way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you kind of mentioned video games. You&#8217;ve mentioned that as kind of a through line throughout this interview. Is that like a dream project that you&#8217;d love to do one day?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Yes, games will be a cool kind of way to be integrated into my current career. I&#8217;m actually creating NFT right now. I&#8217;m kind of getting into that whole space of digitally sold artwork. And I feel like it&#8217;s all kind of leading to that, in a sense, in some shape or form. If I never do that, that&#8217;s totally fine. And it&#8217;s not like a dream killer, because I feel like I&#8217;m living my dream right now just doing art and making a living off of that.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
But there are certain things that it&#8217;s kind of crazy when it happens and it comes full circle. I did a project for Madden, where I had to paint Aaron Donald for like the 99 club. And that was like weird and kind of full circle, because it&#8217;s like, with my pop&#8217;s background, it&#8217;s like, I never thought that it would kind of end up back at football in such a profound way. It&#8217;d be cool, I think, if that happened, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
There&#8217;s been a couple opportunities where I have gotten into like a video game world and worked with some pro gamers and stuff. But sometimes those are pretty weird deals to make happen with like fine art. I also have to stay on brand sometimes. I don&#8217;t want to do something completely out of pocket and go south of what&#8217;s me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I can see that. I mean, certainly when it comes to tips, and even that with video games, that&#8217;s another medium that has really grown and changed a lot, thanks to technology. I mean, the games back in the day really were pretty one node in terms of what they could be. And now, especially on the indie game kind of community, video games can look so many different ways, they can be so many different things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I do wonder if that does afford more opportunities for artists to get involved in that way. There&#8217;s this one person in particular who I really want to try to get her on the show, but her name, she goes by Momo Pixel. She made this game. Goodness, I think she was working at Wieden+Kennedy at the time, but made this game called&#8230; Actually, I forget what the name of the game was called.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But the premise of it was this black woman going about her day and people trying to touch her hair. And you as the black woman had to like swat all the hands away. She&#8217;s on the plane, she&#8217;s in a taxi, she&#8217;s on the bus and people are trying to touch her hair. And you just swat all the hands away to get to like the end goal or whatever. I played it at XOXO, which is just internet conference that takes place in Portland.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember playing it there back in 2018 And being like, &#8220;This is the coolest shit I&#8217;ve ever seen.&#8221; There&#8217;s no way I would be playing this on Nintendo. But she just made the game. And it&#8217;s like, yeah, this sort of stuff is wild. I can imagine there are so many opportunities like that.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s no joke. I feel like I have a couple friends who&#8217;ve been in the indie game space. It&#8217;s no easy feat to just make that stuff. It&#8217;s kind of like years of understanding how to code and make the art in game design. It&#8217;s always something I&#8217;ve just been interested in throughout my whole life. So if you find a game, you got to send that to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. I&#8217;m looking on that. It&#8217;s called Hair Nah, H-A-I-R N-A-H, and it&#8217;s at hairnah.com. She&#8217;s on Twitter at MomoUhOh. M-O-M-O U-H-O-H.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Shout out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
She&#8217;s an artist, indie game developer, creator of Hair Nah. Final NFT in Origin Story drops soon. She&#8217;s even on the NFT route too. Interesting.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s another another crazy space that&#8217;s kind of popped up in the past year and a half on a bigger scale. I know it&#8217;s been around for a couple years now, six or seven years really. But that&#8217;s also an element of being an artist, that you have to adapt. There&#8217;s a lot of different things that come up over the decades and I feel like always shoot for what&#8217;s next. Have that open as an option.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
Because if you kind of look at artists of the past or yesteryear, they&#8217;ve always kind of adapted to what&#8217;s the newest trend or what&#8217;s the newest adaptation. Not that you always have to make something that&#8217;s trendy or whatever, but it&#8217;s always cool to keep an eye out for something to help yourself and your work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Do you feel creatively satisfied?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
I feel like when there&#8217;s big projects like the Ohio project, yeah. There&#8217;s always, what&#8217;s the next big thing? Or, where do I go from here? And I think for me, there&#8217;s a couple of bucket list goals of art career choices that I want to kind of check off. So I feel like I&#8217;m never quite satisfied. I think the day that I am, I&#8217;ve hopefully kind of completed that bucket list.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So that ends. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work would you love to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
I mean, I guess a longer goal for me is hopefully in the next five years, my work is different. I wouldn&#8217;t say completely different. Hopefully, by the end of my career, it&#8217;s completely different. But hopefully, in five years, my work is different from it is now and there&#8217;s different platforms and different mediums that I&#8217;m working in.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
You can always kind of elevate yourself a little bit and I&#8217;m trying to branch out from just painting on canvas. I want to get into the sculptures. I want to get into painting cars, whatever it may be, doing more NFT stuff, doing some 3D work. So I think that&#8217;s where I see myself in five years is kind of completing all those goals and making a living doing it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like the big thing now that we&#8217;ve talked about NFT&#8217;s, but I&#8217;m starting to see platforms start to go towards the metaverse, which is&#8230; I mean, honestly, it sounds even weird for me to say it because that sounds like some shit that came on like a &#8217;90s Power Rangers, VR Troopers, we&#8217;re going to the metaverse kind of thing. I&#8217;m starting to see platforms think about what it is to be in the metaverse, Facebook most specifically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But there&#8217;s also artists that are starting to work in that medium or starting to do things in that whole medium. I know NFT&#8217;s are part of that like NFT&#8217;s, generative art, digital art, all that sort of plays into it. I mean, I think even Sotheby&#8217;s did like a virtual gallery in the metaverse.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
It&#8217;s insane. The metaverse is an interesting place where kind of anything goes. The whole crypto space is the wild west right now, and I think it&#8217;s going to be that way for a while. You can make anything, you can create anything you want to create. I wish I knew 3D better so I can kind of jump in there a little bit more. But there&#8217;s always opportunity, I think, for anybody.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
I have a friend who made like a metaverse thing, Frank Wilder. He&#8217;s on IG. But he did a whole metaverse kind of reality where he&#8217;s making cars and planes and get your NFT Lambo or Rolls Royce or whatever you want, making art and also in that space. So it&#8217;s a crazy thing that&#8217;s, I think, going to be pretty popping in the next 5 to 10 years. It&#8217;s going to be I think the future, really?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, just kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
You can find out more about me on TikTok, first and foremost, at Gabe Gault. I&#8217;m on Instagram at Gabe Gault and I also have gabegault.com. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m like on other platforms as well. I&#8217;m on Twitter and other things. But I think mostly you can get a good idea of my work on those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Gabe Gault, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. One, thank you for just sharing kind of the process about your work and really talking about some of the projects that you&#8217;ve done. But also I think it&#8217;s always great when you have an artist that&#8217;s really kind of doing these things that are, I don&#8217;t know, kind of a mix of classic imagery, like what you do with your portraits, but then also you&#8217;re putting your own kind of interesting twist on it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think the work that you&#8217;re doing is completely sublime. It&#8217;s really dope work. I can&#8217;t wait to see what stuff you&#8217;re doing the next few years, and hopefully more of the world will be able to see what you&#8217;ve done from this interview. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Gabe Gault:</b><br>
No, thank you so much. That keeps me going. So I appreciate being on here.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re back across the pond this week and having a good ol&#8217; chat and a spot of tea with one of London&#8217;s most brilliant artists &#8212; Azarra Amoy. It was a good time to catch up with her since she just got a new studio!</p>
<p>Azarra spoke on how art is like her diary, and she walked me through some of her inspirations and talked about growing up in London and even spending time in Bangkok before transitioning into her current artistic career. Azarra&#8217;s colorful, kinetic designs are a welcome sight during these times, and may also inspire you on your creative journey!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
My name is Azarra Amoy, and I am a multifaceted RS and designer, creative thinker and a student of this crazy world we call life. Or shall I say, yeah I work as an artist, and I&#8217;m also a part-time designer. So I work with presentations for a creative agency called Empire. So I do that three to four times a week. And then the rest of the days is all for art.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. What is the feeling in London like right now?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Quiet because we&#8217;re back in lockdown. So we&#8217;ve been in lockdown just before Christmas, which was a bit mental because it was literally a last minute thing. They were like, yeah, you can spend Christmas with your family. And then literally three days before they&#8217;re like, no, everyone&#8217;s on lockdown. Basically all the presents you bought, send them back.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh no.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
You aren&#8217;t seeing your family. So I don&#8217;t know how many people actually stuck to that. But right now, I feel like a lot of people are fed up because this is our third lockdown. And it&#8217;s just like in and out, in and out. But I&#8217;ve just been trying to keep myself busy personally. And check up on friends, family, and try and find some normality in this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How have you been doing just kind of overall this year so far?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So far this year it was quiet. I literally took time out for myself. I was like, before everything gets a bit crazy or if it does get a bit crazy, I just want time for myself because the end of 2020 was a bit nonstop crazy for me work-wise. So it&#8217;s just been nice just to just chill, let me think. Write down some goals that I want to achieve personally and professionally. And just take time, eat right, detox from all the drink and food that I ate over Christmas period and just yeah, just reboot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you I guess &#8230; Can you talk about just some of those goals you might have for this year?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So one of the goals was to sort out my studio. So I moved out of my last studio just before Christmas, and I needed to find &#8230; It was a bit last minute.com. And I&#8217;ve been trying to find places, but it&#8217;s really hard because we&#8217;re on lockdown. So it&#8217;s through video calls and just trying to work out through pictures if it looks okay. But luckily yesterday I got the keys to a new studio. So I&#8217;m really excited to get in there and just fix it up and make it my second home.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh nice.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s a bit hard sometimes working from home, separating from work and personal time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, congratulations on the new studio.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Thank you. I&#8217;m really excited.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s one thing that I&#8217;ve been thinking about over this whole pandemic quarantine thing, is I got to get my own space. I like my apartment where I&#8217;m at. And I&#8217;ve worked out of my apartment for a long time. I&#8217;ve been doing the working remote thing since 2009. So I&#8217;m not unfamiliar with it, but the difference is that I had the option to leave the house.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I could go and work from a coffee shop or work at a client location or travel or something like that. And granted, right now our restrictions aren&#8217;t super strict at all. I&#8217;m in Georgia, which honestly has been open since last May. There&#8217;s been &#8230; We had three weeks of lockdown in April. And then we&#8217;ve kind of been open. To that effect, our rates are super high because people have been traveling and just coming and going as you please. But as I&#8217;ve been working, I was out of work and then got a new job. And I&#8217;ve just been thinking, I really want my own space. Granted, my apartment&#8217;s nice, but I really want to have that separate workspace that&#8217;s just for creativity.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. It does make a difference. I miss having my studio space. I was like, I just need to get something.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
But luckily I found a place that&#8217;s really nice. It has a balcony and all sorts, so I&#8217;m just really happy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh nice. So what do your days look like now with lockdown and the new studio space and everything?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So I usually have a routine, I get up early, do a little meditation, work out. So I&#8217;m addicted to spin at the moment. And I login to work at 9:30, so I work three to four days a week depending on how busy they are. And yeah, I login and I usually have schedules set out for me already. So I just crack on with the work. And my team is really small, they&#8217;re really lovely. We all have game nights and stuff, and just try and make it as normal as possible. And yeah, I do that until 6:30, and then I usually eat and then spend time on personal projects, whether if that&#8217;s just me just trying to do a sketch or a digital collage, those are sort of my go-to things that I do.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
And I do them without even noticing that I do them, if that makes sense. Some people chill and watch Netflix and stuff. But for me, doing a little sketch, a little doodle on something is my chill time. And not everything that I create, I show. So basically I always say that my art is like my diary. It&#8217;s like what I feel in the day, or something that&#8217;s on my mind because I&#8217;m not really &#8230; I feel like I&#8217;m not a great communicator with words, but I communicate well when I draw. So that&#8217;s my output.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I got you. What are some of the projects that you&#8217;re working on right now?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Art-wise or work-wise as a designer?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;ll say art-wise. We&#8217;ll say art-wise.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So art-wise, I&#8217;m working with a publishing company. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m allowed to mention them yet, but looking to do some illustrations for a children&#8217;s book. So I had just recently done a mock-up of stuff. So I&#8217;m just waiting on feedback if they&#8217;re liking the direction that it&#8217;s going. I&#8217;m trying to do some personal paintings because fingers crossed with COVID, I will be able to have a solo exhibition, which has been on my list for forever. And last year was meant to be the year, but obviously with what happened, it was a no-go. So I&#8217;m hoping come October, that will happen. So I&#8217;m just slowly putting their stuff into motion.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m going to be on a panel for a studio space that&#8217;s in Brixton, London. And I&#8217;ll be on the panel for their residency. So I&#8217;ll be helping select who gets a year&#8217;s residency with them. So I&#8217;ve been working with that team just discussing a few things. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing art-wise.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, you&#8217;ve got your hands full with a lot.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah. I try to keep as busy as possible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you usually have sort of a limit of the number of projects that you try to take on?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
I listen to what my body tells me, if that makes sense. So if I feel like I&#8217;m really run down, then I have no problem just saying no to whatever project comes. It&#8217;s like, no, sorry, you need some you time just to just relax. So I just go off on how I feel, and that&#8217;s how I take on the work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So these are &#8230; Just the projects you mentioned between a book cover, personal paintings, doing this panel, talk to me about how you approach a new project. It can be any type of project. What&#8217;s sort of your thought process when it comes to that?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
I guess with a lot of projects that do come my way, they usually come to me because they know my style of artwork. So for example, I feature a lot of black &#8230; All the women I feature in my artwork are black women. Me myself, I&#8217;m a black woman. So yeah, I think it just comes from &#8230; I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to be able to navigate where the direction of the artwork goes because they know my style. So they know that&#8217;s the sort of direction, and what I&#8217;m trying to portray and uplift black women in the artwork that I do. So that sort of is usually the base. And then from there, I just then add on what the client wants, if that makes sense. And yeah, and then from there I usually do a mock-up. And then they give feedback.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve always really done it. So and usually I research into certain stuff. So right now, I&#8217;m really interested in the black Madonna, which is religious, the black Virgin Mary.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s put it that way. And I&#8217;ve been looking to the history of that, which is really interesting because these countries that are really popular with the black Madonna are not exactly the most black-friendly places. So it&#8217;s really interesting how they worship this idol of this black Virgin Mary. But in day-to-day sort of experiences, they&#8217;re not like that with people of color in real life. It&#8217;s just a weird, she&#8217;s allowed to be worshiped, but if you put a black woman in front of them, they&#8217;ll do anything to put them down, if that makes sense?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
I just go off of what surrounds me, what comes to mind, stuff that I see [inaudible 00:12:42], things that I see in movies, magazines, blogs that just trigger something, and I&#8217;ll just start researching.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;ve actually got a church here in my neighborhood here in Atlanta called Shrine of the Black Madonna. It&#8217;s a church, it&#8217;s a cultural center. They do events and stuff there. So I&#8217;m familiar with the concept that you&#8217;re talking about. Do you usually try to have some religious iconography in your work, or is this just a particular &#8230; Or is it a particular figure I guess you&#8217;re kind of obsessed with right now?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s just a particular figure that I&#8217;m obsessed with right now. So yeah, not all work features, but it just &#8230; I don&#8217;t think I have any religious features, no, in my work. So this is just something new that I&#8217;ve come across that I find really interesting, and we&#8217;ll see where it&#8217;ll take me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Is there anyone out there that you would love to collaborate with?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Oh. I guess right now it would be interesting to &#8230; I have no one in mind, but there are a lot of people that I have collaborated with have been London-based. So it would be nice to collaborate with people from different countries to gain their experience, to understand their experience and how it&#8217;s similar and how we can collab. Does that make sense?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
But I can&#8217;t think of no one from the top of my head right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
From looking at your style, your style actually reminds me a lot of another mixed media artist that I had on the show. God when was that? That might&#8217;ve been about two or three years ago. This guy in &#8230; He&#8217;s in New York. His name is Kendrick Daye, D-A-Y-E.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He does kind of this similar collage mixed media kind of work. So your art reminds me a lot of what he&#8217;s doing. You all have very sort of similar styles in terms of I think the color and the elements. I think your work at least from the work that I&#8217;ve seen, there&#8217;s a lot of play on symmetry.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
With portraiture and things. You try to have a lot of symmetry, which I think is really nice.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah. I like the whole kaleidoscope kind of effect in my work. So there&#8217;s always some sort of symmetry as much as possible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the hardest part about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Knowing when to stop. As an art issue, always something try to over-perfect. And I speak to my cousin every day, and there&#8217;s this painting that I&#8217;ve literally been working on for about two and a half years. And I just don&#8217;t know when to stop. I&#8217;m like, no, it&#8217;s not right. It&#8217;s not right. And he&#8217;s just like, it&#8217;s never going to be right. Just show the world. The art is amazing. I&#8217;m just like, no, it&#8217;s not ready. And just know when to say, okay, that&#8217;s enough. It&#8217;s never going to be right sort of thing. And you can always add &#8230; The beautiful thing about art, you can always add to it. Just because you start and you show the world, doesn&#8217;t mean that, that&#8217;s the end of it. You can add on to it. You can take away. You can make it into something completely different.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true. That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So kind of switching gears here a little bit, were you born and raised in London?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yes I was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, tell me about that. Did you kind of get exposed to a lot of art and design growing up?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Most definitely. My parents are both creatives in their own way. So my dad paints. And well, he enjoys painting. He&#8217;s a painter and decorator by trade. And my mom just dabbled in everything I guess. I guess that&#8217;s where I get a lot of my creative talent from. So she was a hairdresser. She was that crazy mom who had the bright hair, then green hair, and then orange hair. Every time she turned up to pick me up from school, her hair was always different colors. So she was the crazy, cool art mom. And she&#8217;d done fashion, yeah just around the house little DIY projects. Whenever she was sewing, she always used to set me little tasks to do. So I&#8217;ll make a pencil case from scratch. Make little bags for myself.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Just stuff like that. So and I think she got that from my grandma because my grandma&#8217;s like, &#8220;You must know how to sew. It&#8217;s a key thing because you don&#8217;t have any money or you don&#8217;t have anything, at least you can sew the clothes on your back.&#8221; You can make curtains, you can make a chair, you can do whatever. As long as you can sew.&#8221; So that&#8217;s one of the skills that was drummed into me from a very young age.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it sounds like being exposed to all this so young, did you have a feeling that this is what you wanted to do? Or was this just a part of your world?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
It was just a part of my world to be honest. I didn&#8217;t even think of it as a career choice or anything like that. It was just a way of life, and it only hit me that actually this is what I really want to do as my career choice was not until I moved to Bangkok and I went there to work in doing something completely random. I was working as a governess, which is like a nanny almost for a family out there. And I was just getting really down. I was like, no, this is not being homesick, this is something else. And it just wasn&#8217;t clicking to me. And then one day I was just sitting on the sofa and I was like, I know. I know why I&#8217;m so down. I know why I&#8217;m feeling a little depressed.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
And I was like, I haven&#8217;t picked up a pen, I haven&#8217;t drawn anything. I haven&#8217;t made anything. That&#8217;s what it is. So as soon as that popped into my head, I jumped in the bike taxis, I went to the nearest shopping center and bought up a whole load of art supplies. And it just that feeling of just being creative again, I was just like, yeah, I&#8217;m coming back home and this is what I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Were you studying abroad? How did you end up in Bangkok being a governess? That seems like such a random kind of departure from what you were doing.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So my friend was actually working as a governess out there. And she&#8217;s like, oh, there&#8217;s this family that&#8217;s looking for a governess. I&#8217;m going to put your forward, do you mind. And I was like, I have no experience in this. She&#8217;s like, it doesn&#8217;t matter. Go interview and if they like you, then come over. And I was like, well, this is a bit out of my comfort zone. I was tempted to say, no. But I felt like it was one of those things that in a few years time I&#8217;ll kick myself like, why didn&#8217;t you just take the opportunity. So I went with it, and I had about three interviews with this family. And they&#8217;re like, yeah, just we&#8217;ll pay for your ticket. Apartment&#8217;s paid for, just come over.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
And I was like, oh okay. And I stayed there for a year, and yeah, it got to the point where I was just like, this is not where I&#8217;m meant to be. But I absolutely love Bangkok. There&#8217;s a place in my heart for Bangkok.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You are the second person that I&#8217;ve interviewed recently that has had some tie or connection to Bangkok. That is so &#8230; Yeah I just interviewed an artist in Washington DC here named Reggie Black. And he spent four years in Bangkok as a designer and doing talks and stuff like that. You let me know because you were there, was Bangkok a really creative city?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah. There&#8217;s loads of stuff to do. It&#8217;s like the city that kind of, it doesn&#8217;t sleep. Which is not like London. London, people always think that London&#8217;s busy and stuff. But come a certain time, things just shut down. But Bangkok&#8217;s just, they have a night market. There&#8217;s just lights, there&#8217;s culture, there&#8217;s just artwork everywhere, music. It&#8217;s just a really nice atmosphere. So yeah, definitely I would love to go back to Bangkok under creative or creative reasons anyway.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now you went to the University of the Arts in London. Can you tell me what your time was like there?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Oh, I was there for a while because the University of the Arts, they have different campuses.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So, well different colleges under the University of the Arts. So the first one I went to was the Art College in Camberwell. Camberwell Art College it&#8217;s called. And I had done a foundation art course there. So that course is just to help you build your portfolio and understand which direction you want to go in creatively. So you do a bit of fashion, a bit of graphic design, a bit of sculpture, painting, et cetera. And then from there you branch off into which field you&#8217;re more comfortable with. So that was my first college, and I actually went into graphic design. And now looking back at it, I was like, why did I do that? Because I was really interested in sculpture, but I thought, oh, how can I make money as a sculpture?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
I&#8217;m just thinking, I think people are in your ear like, how can you make money from being a sculpture. Graphic design makes more sense. So I went down that route. And then I ended up in London College of Communication, which is where they do mostly sort of graphics, digital courses there. And I had actually done a foundation degree, which then turns into a full degree if you did the final year. So I had only done two years of that. So I have a foundation degree in graphic communication. And I was like, I actually absolutely hate this. So I was like, but I want a full degree. So I managed to sort of blag my way onto another degree course, which was something completely different, magazine publishing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So I spoke to the head of the course. I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m really interested in doing this course. I have experience.&#8221; which was not true. I was like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; She was like, &#8220;Oh okay.&#8221; She looked at my grades. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, you can join the course, but over the summer you have to do some coursework to make up.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s fine.&#8221; And she&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; And I made it happen thank God. And from there, I graduated in magazine publishing, which is a weird course because it&#8217;s a bit of design, a bit of PR, marketing, all of the stuff that you need to know basically of how to run a magazine.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So by the time I graduated, it was that weird shift between print into digital. So I was like, this course was mostly about print. And now I&#8217;m graduating and everyone&#8217;s transitioning to digital. I was like, what is going on? I was like, all the places where I had done work placements at, their print &#8230; All the prints of their magazines were being shut down the department, the print department of their team. So I was just like, everyone&#8217;s just shutting down. I don&#8217;t know anything about digital. So I think that kind of scared me and I just sort of was stuck for a while thinking, what am I going to do next? I don&#8217;t know anything about digital. Should I take a course or something?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
And I think I was stuck in a rut for a long time. And I just continued at my job that I was doing during uni, which was working in retail. And that, that&#8217;s when &#8230; After that, that&#8217;s when I went to Bangkok, and that just opened my eyes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Well, it sounds like that trip to Bangkok was what you needed, if you were at this point where you had went through all this school and you were feeling stuck.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
A change of scenery will do it.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah, because over here I saw they sort of sell you a dream. They&#8217;re like, yeah, once you leave uni you&#8217;ll be able to get a job. And that&#8217;s what I thought. I was like, yeah, as soon as I go through it, I&#8217;ll be able to get a job easy. No. Not like that at all. Everyone I speak to, they&#8217;re like, yeah, we saw the same dream. And then it hits you. Life hits you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I know that feeling all too well. I graduated &#8230; Well, I didn&#8217;t go to design school, but I graduated with a degree in math. And I really had no career prospects lined up after school. I was still working like you. I was working the job that I was working while I was at school, which was just selling tickets at the symphony. Just selling to old white patrons that wanted to hear Chopin or whatever. Telling them where to sit and stuff.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it wasn&#8217;t until a few years after that, that I sort of ended up falling into design. But yeah, sometimes that&#8217;s how it is. School&#8217;s &#8230; And that&#8217;s not really I guess the fault of &#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say it&#8217;s the fault of the schools. It&#8217;s really the fault of the market.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Just because you come out with a degree, doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that you&#8217;re ready to go right into working somewhere because maybe you need a portfolio or maybe the school that you have has a different reputation that this company doesn&#8217;t go for. So I don&#8217;t know, it can be tricky. I know it&#8217;s tricky here in the States. I can imagine it&#8217;s the same way overseas as well.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. It&#8217;s not easy. And as you said, it&#8217;s true, you can&#8217;t blame the institutions for the lack of opportunities once you leave. But I think with the course I was saying, the foundation degree course, that was meant to be heavily work experience-based. And when we joined, everyone was like, where&#8217;s this work experience? Because we were meant to have industry teachers come in every week.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
To teach us from different companies and stuff. And we literally had one the whole year. We&#8217;re like, this is not what we signed up for. And we were all meant to be allocated sort of a mentor from the industry, which they were going to provide. So there was meant to be a mentorship scheme and stuff. But yeah, it didn&#8217;t work out that way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
But here I am. I found my feet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So you went to Bangkok, you worked there as a governess. You didn&#8217;t like it. That sort of sparked you wanting to become a designer. And you came &#8230; Did you come right back to London after that?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah. Straight back to London.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So what was your plan once you got back?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
I had saved some money whilst doing this job because I didn&#8217;t have to pay rent or anything like that. So I had saved, and I was like, okay, I&#8217;m going to give myself a year to really try and get this running. And if there&#8217;s no progress, then I&#8217;m going to have to really rethink this. So when I came back, I was just applying for sort of any artist call-outs and stuff like that. And I was just &#8230; I just began painting. And luckily I had a friend who used to do an evening called Arts Meets Music. And he was like yeah, why don&#8217;t you display some of your artwork at one of these events? And I was like, amazing, jumped on it. And then from there, that&#8217;s how I met people. And someone told me about, oh &#8230; Some of my artwork [inaudible 00:27:32] murals.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Because my paintings are such large scale paintings. And they&#8217;re like, why don&#8217;t you do murals? So I was like, oh, I never thought of that. I just thought street art is murals. Spray paint, I&#8217;d never touched a spray can in my life. How can I do this? Well, let me just apply for a call-out that I saw, which was local to me. And I actually had a dream that told &#8230; People think I&#8217;m crazy when I say this. I actually had a dream about it. And I was like, I woke up from this dream and I was like, yes, let me do the application now. And I actually won. And I was like, oh, this was a sign. So I had done it, I was like, okay, I&#8217;m going to literally win this because I&#8217;ve never spray painted in my life.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
And the mural actually came out really nice. And it&#8217;s still there in Brixton until this day. And from there, people just started contacting me. &#8220;Oh yeah, do you want to do a mural here?&#8221; &#8220;Do you want to do a mural there?&#8221; And I was like, wow, I was really not expecting this. And I found a new passion for something else as well. That&#8217;s how I got into the murals.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And speaking of which, that&#8217;s the mural that&#8217;s &#8230; People can see that in the cover art for this episode. The one that you&#8217;re standing next to.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s quite a mural. So you worked on all of that by yourself? Or did you have a &#8230; Did you work with another artist or anything?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yes. So this, the mural that you&#8217;re talking about, I worked with another artist called Lynette [inaudible 00:28:49]. And I worked with her on two other projects as well. So the person who created the project, [inaudible 00:28:57], she knew both of us. So she knew that we worked together, and she wanted two artists who had a good relationship who can work well together. And she&#8217;s more of a calligraphy artist. And I&#8217;m more of a sort of paint now, visual graphics. So both of our styles just seemed to work together. So she commissioned both of us to do the project. And yeah, and it worked out amazing. I&#8217;m really happy with the outcome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s a beautiful mural. It&#8217;s a beautiful mural.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;ll make sure that I will link so people can see the full thing because with the cover art it&#8217;s just sort of cut off in that square. As I was looking through your website and looking at your projects, one project I saw that I really liked was the work that you did with MTV. How&#8217;d you end up working with them?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So they contacted me last year about the award. And they&#8217;re like, it&#8217;s a really short turnaround. But we really love your style, and really think that it will suite &#8230; My art style will suite the award winners. So all the award winners for the &#8230; It was &#8230; Let me get the name off the award. Generation Change Award. All the winners are black female women or women of color, sorry. And I was like, well, I paint women of color and I paint women. So I was like, yes. All these women who have won, so it&#8217;s Raquel and Willis, [inaudible 00:30:23], Louisa Brazil, Kathea &#8230; She&#8217;s going to kill me for pronouncing her name. [inaudible 00:30:32] and [inaudible 00:30:33]. Sorry, my pronunciation of the names are terrible. And yeah, these women are amazing. They&#8217;re doing so much for our generation, for the future generation, fighting. They&#8217;re all amazing activists within their field.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
I was just so excited just to be asked just to create something personal for them. So all of the awards &#8230; Each of their awards is hand-painted and customized to them. So it was a very special project. I was very happy to be selected and honored.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So these days when it comes to big, high profile projects like that, are the projects coming to you, or are you seeking them out?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Luckily they seem to be coming to me. I have no idea where MTV saw my stuff from because when they contacted me, they showed me some of the artwork that they liked. And I was like, this is so random. It&#8217;s literally just random artwork that I just posted on Instagram, not thinking anything of it. Just, oh, this is what I&#8217;ve been doing during lockdown. Here&#8217;s a painting sort of thing. Just didn&#8217;t think about it. And those are the ones that they selected. So it was interesting because I would&#8217;ve thought it would be something that &#8230; Like another big project that I&#8217;d done before or something like that. But no, they contacted me. I was very lucky.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of your influences? Like I mentioned, the work that you&#8217;re doing, this sort of collage work is very vibrant. And certainly very unique. Who influences you or what influences you I should say?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
As I said before, a lot of the collages and painting that I do are stuff that I do daily. So they just represent my mood. It could be influenced by a song that I&#8217;ve just had on repeat all day that makes me feel good. I&#8217;m like, oh, I&#8217;m going to do a collage on that. I know it sounds typical, but literally the women that I have around me are amazing from my sister, my mom. A lot of the other artists that I work with are mostly females. So yeah, they push me and inspire me constantly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
At this stage in your career, you are doing these large scale projects and things of that nature, what does black art mean to you?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Black art for me is a place to be free. It&#8217;s a way for me to share my experiences and also hopefully uplift other black women. I think that&#8217;s important because representation especially in the art world &#8230; I don&#8217;t know about in the States, but over here the art world is very white male-based. These institutions are very white man, paint a sculpture sort of thing. And that&#8217;s even projected in the education within the art education when I was at uni and school. So for me, it&#8217;s about representation, authenticity, and just uplifting. That&#8217;s what art means to me. It&#8217;s just being free.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is sort of the London design scene like for you right now? Being on lockdown, are there ways that you&#8217;re able to connect with creatives?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah. So I&#8217;m part of &#8230; What&#8217;s that group&#8217;s &#8230; I sign up to online courses. So one of the courses that I use is Black Blossoms. So it&#8217;s an online art school. And you sign up and there&#8217;s different art courses. So every week there&#8217;s a different course. And I&#8217;ve been literally killing those. I&#8217;m right now, the course that I&#8217;m on is the Art Revolution in China, which is really interesting. Just opening up my eyes to different genres of art that I just wasn&#8217;t exposed to. And having these other women in these blossom art groups, and all of us just sharing opportunities like oh, someone&#8217;s contacted me to do this, but I just don&#8217;t have time. Any of you sort of have any idea of someone or if you want to do it? And we&#8217;re just sharing contacts, sharing opportunities because everyone&#8217;s just trying to eat. Some people have been made redundant from jobs and stuff. So I think, I feel like there&#8217;s a real sense of everyone coming together and just trying to help each other out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s a good thing that you&#8217;re able to kind of use technology as a way to reach out to people and to sort of have that fellowship and that &#8230; Also the ability to kind of work together. I don&#8217;t know if you collaborated with anyone solely on a virtual level with any work?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
I worked with a team who I had done murals with in the past. And I was actually scheduled to do a mural with them summertime last year, but it didn&#8217;t work out. So in the end, it ended up being a digital project. So from there it&#8217;s just, it was all online-based having to work from that sort of platform, I wasn&#8217;t able to research how I usually research sometimes. So especially if I&#8217;m doing artwork in a certain location or reference if it&#8217;s referencing a certain location, I usually go out with my camera, take photos. I just spend the day there, really just take in the atmosphere, but being obviously locked in the house, I&#8217;ve just had to find other ways. So YouTube, and watching old documentaries on the area, just trying to gain as much information. Trying to put out contact people via Instagram, which is a bit wild. But just people who you see off on the area and you can try and, &#8220;Hey, this is a bit weird, but I just want to get an understanding what this location means to you.&#8221; Or get as much interviews and stuff like that, which I&#8217;ve never really worked that way.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So definitely even after we come out of lockdown, I think I&#8217;ll be using those forms definitely to my practice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Sounds like you picked up a new skill over the pandemic.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah. Which is cool because I&#8217;m literally &#8230; I&#8217;m a person who keeps themselves to themselves. So it&#8217;s definitely pushed me out of my comfort zone having to talk to people. And even doing interviews, I don&#8217;t like my first Instagram Live at the end of last year. And I was like, I&#8217;ve never done this before. I was so nervous. And just doing radio shows as well I&#8217;ve been doing. So it&#8217;s been practice. I&#8217;m not great at interviews, but I&#8217;m getting there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Practice makes perfect, let me tell you. Just the more that you&#8217;re able to do it, the more comfortable you&#8217;ll become. That&#8217;s really the best way to do it. You get more comfortable, you end up kind of being able to pull on &#8230; Particularly if you&#8217;re talking about different projects that you&#8217;ve done. You&#8217;re able to kind of pull those narratives out really easily. So if I could give any advice, I would say, take all the opportunities that come to you because each of them is just a way for you to get better at it.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah. Definitely. And it&#8217;s just fighting the inner demons as well because it&#8217;s so easy to sort of self-sabotage. Be like, oh, I don&#8217;t want to do this. It&#8217;s out of my comfort zone. But you just &#8230; I just push myself all the time, and just be like, come on Azarra. Come on. Do my little speech to try and motivate myself and be like, you&#8217;re going to look back at this and think, oh, what was I panicking about? It&#8217;s so simple.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Because the flip side to it especially I think with doing a podcast interview is that the audience is vast and varied and diverse. There may be someone that&#8217;s out there listening that is like you. And is like, oh, well if she&#8217;s doing it, then I can do it.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yeah. And I hope there is someone out there. You can do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you define success right now?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Success for me is doing what I love. Yeah. Doing what I love and getting paid for it, which is the dream. So I&#8217;m always selective as well on what I work on. If it doesn&#8217;t feel right, if it doesn&#8217;t sit right with my core, or if it doesn&#8217;t feel authentic to me and feels forced, then I try to avoid it in a sense, but not restrict myself at the same time. So for me, it&#8217;s just what brings me joy at the moment because especially in times like this, you have to be selective with your energy. Even though you&#8217;re not being around a lot of people, it&#8217;s draining. So just trying to find happiness in everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you think your life would have gone if you weren&#8217;t a working artist? What else do you think you would&#8217;ve been doing?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
I can&#8217;t even imagine that life. Something creative definitely. But maybe in a different field. For ages, I wanted to be an architect. Which is completely random. And I was actually so close, I applied for it at uni and everything. And I just last minute changed my mind and done the art foundation course because I was like, I haven&#8217;t explored all that&#8217;s out there creatively. So for me to just rush into being an architect doesn&#8217;t feel right at the moment. But yeah, probably an architect or maybe something with children. I love kids, so a teacher. There&#8217;s one. I probably would&#8217;ve been a teacher.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What sort of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So I would love to be working full-time as an artist, and hopefully have my own creative agency and be doing what I do full-time. Even though as much as I love being a presentation designer, I would like to have more time to do projects that I really well. Whereas, working as a presentation designer, you&#8217;re restricted by what the client wants, Gram brand guidelines and stuff like that. It&#8217;s very sort of corporate, I would say corporate design. Whereas, as a creative, if I had to &#8230; My agency, I would be able to be selective and really push the boundaries and collab more with other people. Which is definitely on my list of things to do. Just get myself out there and just learn and work with other people. That&#8217;s the big thing for me, learning new skills as well. And just bringing that all together.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find more about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
So you can check out my website, which is azarraamoy.com. And I&#8217;m also on Instagram @AzarraAmoy. And also on Twitter, which I don&#8217;t tweet that much, but just in case. It&#8217;s, ThisisAzarra. That&#8217;s my Twitter account.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Azarra Amoy, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you really for kind of sharing your creative journey and showing how you can really sort of find creativity in sort of the most seemingly unlikely of places. You were a governess like you said, in Bangkok. And you decided, oh, this is what I want to do. But no, the art that you&#8217;re creating is so vibrant and beautiful. And I&#8217;m just really excited to kind of see where you go from here. Hopefully one day we will be hearing about that exhibition that you&#8217;re planning.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Yes, definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, so thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Azarra Amoy:</b><br>
Thank you for having me. It&#8217;s been a pleasure.</p>
