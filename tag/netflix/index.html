Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>With over 220 million worldwide subscribers across over 190 countries, it&#8217;s hard to imagine pop culture without the media juggernaut that we know as Netflix. But how do they manage to distribute and create so much, while also maintaining a top-class user experience for so many people? It&#8217;s thanks to geniuses like this week&#8217;s guest &#8212; Husani Oakley. </p>
<p>Husani talked about stepping into his role as Director of Creative Practices during the pandemic, and shared how his team helps define the art and science of great creative work at a huge scale. He also spoke about how his previous stints as CTO of online investment platform Goldbean and CTO of advertising firm Deutsch NY helped prepare him for the biggest role of his career. It takes a lot of work and nuance to create experiences for global and local audiences, and Husani is the right person to make those experiences happen!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So, tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
My name is Husani Oakley. I am the Director of Creative Practices at Netflix.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a pretty big title. I was going to ask what all has changed since you were last on the show, which was in 2014, you were Episode 40. That&#8217;s a long time ago. Tell me more about this new role in Netflix. It sounds exciting.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
Well, it was a very long time ago. That&#8217;s a whole two jobs in a global panini ago. That&#8217;s quite crazy. I hadn&#8217;t realize it was that long. Yeah, so my role at Netflix is in a group called Product Creative Studio. It&#8217;s a new role, even though Product Creative Studio isn&#8217;t necessarily new. We&#8217;re part of a team of people that are responsible for launching titles on platforms, so all shows all movies, whether they are Netflix originals or our non-original content that ends up on the platform globally. Everything is related to how those titles appear on platform. Everything from the descriptions, the synopsis that appear when you&#8217;re looking for something to watch to the tagging that appears. But specifically the art and clips and trailers that appear in the rows when you&#8217;re on the Netflix home page and when you&#8217;re on one of our titled detail pages.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the sort of work that&#8217;s done on my side of the organization. And my department and thus, my role specifically is looking at that work from a creative perspective, less than an operational perspective. And trying to figure out ways to make that work the best possible work for our members. We really want that art and those trailers and those clips to stand out and give you enough information as a member to let you decide whether this is something for you when you&#8217;re going to hit play and watch. We present you that evidence.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I mean, it can be overstated just how big even Netflix has become in the past seven years. I mean, it really was something that was largely, I remember back then, I feel like it was mostly largely just for the United States or maybe for the Americas. But now, I mean, it truly is a global platform, not just in terms of reach of members, but also the content that it offers. I see trailers every week from content that&#8217;s in Spain, that&#8217;s in Italy, that&#8217;s in Nigeria, that&#8217;s in South Korea, everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
That&#8217;s what is both I think amazing to see from the inside. And then as a member to also experience from the outside that our content is we are a global company, our content is global. The way we create that content is global. But by global, I don&#8217;t mean from one location and spread throughout the world, it&#8217;s not one to many. It&#8217;s really many to many.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
Squid Game, I think is a great example that came out of South Korea for South Koreans. It was so great. Everyone on the planet ended up watching it. But the way we think about this global scale and reach, it&#8217;s almost like every area has its own Netflix. And the beauty of the platform is that content from those little Netflixes can be seen by members of Netflix as a whole.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you started this role last year. How was it to start something this big during the pandemic?</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve got to say I was really scared. I was really scared to start during the pandemic. The role I was coming out of, I&#8217;d been in for a couple of years, so I knew everyone I worked with. And then we went into the pandemic and so, you&#8217;re on calls all day, every day with people, but you know them because you&#8217;ve known them before everything changed. I was really scared about the ability to form relationships with my peers, with my bosses and certainly, with the team that I lead only over a screen. Without having any indication of when the relationships could be built outside of just from behind the screen. I was terrified. If I am, to be honest, I was excited and terrified really, really because of that. But I have to say, this is the largest company I&#8217;ve ever worked at.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
And from day zero, and the fact that I say day zero gives a hint as to my dev background. We started zero. From day zero, I was impressed by the level of craft and the level of thoughtfulness that went into, not just starting, but the interviewing experience. And then starting, and then the onboarding experience. All of this with me sitting in my home office, having stepped into an Netflix office once in my life for maybe 30 minutes. I was terrified, but after really getting into things with folks who were aiding me along that interviewing and onboarding journey, that fear really went away and I was just able to embrace it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does your team look like? Who are some of the people that you manage?</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
My team has, I was going to say some of the most brilliant people at Netflix, but that wouldn&#8217;t be fair because everyone in Netflix is sort of scary smart. And that&#8217;s I think a thing a lot of people say outside of Netflix like, &#8220;Oh, the folks in Netflix are really smart.&#8221; People in Netflix are really smart. I mean, back to this starting at day zero and how all of those interactions were clearly well-thought out and well-defined. The thoughtfulness is almost the hallmark of what it feels like to interact with these folks on the outside, I&#8217;m sorry, inside the company.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
My team is interesting because the team itself is new, but the people who are on the team are not. They&#8217;ve been in Netflix for an average of five years, four years and maybe. And so, they have such a deep understanding of not just the culture and sort of how we operate on a day-to-day basis. But the relationships with cross-functional partners across the globe. One of my amazing practices leads spent a lot of time and working with our APAC region. And has deep relationships with the folks there. So, they&#8217;re really able to bring to me the new person, this rich library of knowledge, which is incredibly helpful.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
Now, my folks come from varied creative focused backgrounds, creative strategy, art direction. Some from entertainment. Some from outside of entertainment. Some from marketing and advertising. But they all share a passion for TV and film and a passion for telling stories about TV and film. We tell stories about stories. I say that my team, with apologies to the late great Stephen Sondheim, I say that creative practices focuses on the art of making art. Inside of Netflix, I think that&#8217;s really important.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
We have these amazing editors and producers and strategists and designers spread across the planet, building out stories about stories, designing the art for our titles, cutting the trailers and clips for our titles. And because my team has experience doing that actual hands-on work, they are able to use that experience. And like I said earlier, use the rich knowledge of all of the cross-functional partnerships that they come to the team with. And elevate the work that our stunning colleagues do to represent titles on platform. I think I&#8217;m the luckiest person in Netflix with my team.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember from other people who I&#8217;ve had on the show before Netflix, they me that Netflix mostly hires mid to senior career people. You have to be at least kind of five years in to start at Netflix. There&#8217;s no &#8220;junior.&#8221; I&#8217;m using air quotes here, but there are no junior positions. Everyone kind of starts at a high level because you&#8217;re really in one way expected to kind of hit the ground running.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But to your point about how global and cross-functional, it is, I mean, you&#8217;re trying to deliver this consistent experience across hundreds of thousands of customers. And then Netflix is so unique because it&#8217;s a tech company, but it&#8217;s also media. And I just know from working with tech startups that try to do media, that&#8217;s often like mixing oil and water.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s hard and it&#8217;s also really worth putting the effort in. I think the space in between art and science is somewhere that I&#8217;ve spent my career and Netflix has spent its time existing like playing in the space between. I think if you are and I&#8217;m really talking about companies that I think I could argue this for really strong creatives as well.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
If you are solely focused on the art side, certainly in the medium that we&#8217;re talking about here, in digital. If you are focused on the art side, you&#8217;re missing out on the abilities and capabilities that are possible if you lean into the science side. But if you just lean into the science side and you don&#8217;t have the art, then you&#8217;ve got math. And I say, and then you&#8217;ve got math knowing, Maurice, what just like in college sounds silly. But I think you&#8217;re a great example of what I mean in this combination of art and science.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
There is such something that builds upon each other and allows things to build and move and merge. And I think that&#8217;s a fascinating place for a brand like Netflix to be, I think from a brand tone perspective, but from the day-to-day perspective of Netflix employees. And I hope that that experience for our members comes across. We talk a lot about our members all the time. We are member centric. We care so much about the member experience.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
Also, we are members too. I make this thing with my team in every other weekly status meeting, &#8220;What are you watching on Netflix right now? Let&#8217;s talk about it a bit.&#8221; Because at the end of the day, we&#8217;re focused on a lot of the science stuff, but it&#8217;s science for a reason. It&#8217;s science for the art and that&#8217;s just a fascinating space to play in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The interesting thing really also with Netflix is it&#8217;s become just so ubiquitous within culture, writ large. I mean, of course you can look at the idiom of Netflix and chill and stuff like that. But with Netflix being such an early player in streaming and the rights with so many other streaming services, Paramount Plus, HBO Max, et cetera. There&#8217;s all these sort of affordances and things that they&#8217;re inheriting from work that&#8217;s been done in Netflix around how do we structure the UI? How do we provide a good user experience?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s so interesting to watch conversation about streaming services on Twitter. Because one thing that I&#8217;ve found probably within the past couple of years, and I&#8217;ve noticed this, is that content, there are so many streaming services in places for content to land. And I mean, I&#8217;m using content in a broad sort of way to describe video. But I&#8217;ll watch 10 trailers and it&#8217;s almost negligible, which platform they&#8217;re on. It could be on IIB. It could be on Amazon Prime. It could be on Netflix. It could be on IMDB TV. It could be on a number of different platforms and stuff, but what sets it apart is that kind of experience of how do I use the app?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
People talk all the time about HBO Max&#8217;s, the app. People say they&#8217;ve never seen an app that hates their users like HBO Max or I use Paramount Plus. And actually, Paramount Plus is the one service I&#8217;ve stopped using because the interface I found lacks the features that I would see on a Netflix or a Disney Plus or something for basic things that Netflix kind of pioneered, like Watch List and favorite-ing and ratings and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
I&#8217;ll tell you the secret. The secret is this amazing collection of smart people that work for Netflix that are spread across the globe. Just a little while ago, you talked about the level that we hire and you said, I think, the common thought is that folks are expected to kind of hit the ground running. And I&#8217;d say yes and no to that. So, I&#8217;ve been at Netflix are about seven and a half months and I think it took me about seven months to even understand anything.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
And the ongoing internal joke is, &#8220;You should spend the first year just soaking up information, understanding things, but we hired you because you&#8217;re great.&#8221; But your greatness at what you do, you need the information, the context about how we think about problem solving. How we&#8217;ve solved problems in the past, who people are and what they do and what they&#8217;re good at. You need some time inside before you&#8217;re really able to use the skills that you&#8217;re walking in with and apply to these sorts of very difficult problems that we are spending 24/7, 365 across the globe attempting to solve for our members.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
I hope that that effort or it&#8217;s funny. I was going to say, I hope that effort is clear to members. What I actually hope is that it&#8217;s not clear to members. I actually hope that it&#8217;s a magical experience that you sit down, you grab your remote control. You go to Netflix and you look, there are things that you want to watch.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s effortless. The experience is so seamless across. And I have to say, across a number of different platforms. I mean, I probably think like my toaster probably has Netflix now. It&#8217;s on every game console. It&#8217;s with every smart television. It&#8217;s on every smartphone, like yeah.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
Yeah. We have an amazing partnerships team that works in a lot of those sorts of situations and they&#8217;re just great. You should be able to enjoy this content where you&#8217;re at. Whether you&#8217;re sitting on a flight and you&#8217;ve got your iPad with you or you&#8217;re on a train and you&#8217;ve got your phone with you. You&#8217;re sitting on your cell phone, it&#8217;s a television, you&#8217;re on a laptop or you&#8217;re in the kitchen making toast. We briefly want the ability for you to be entertained because that&#8217;s our job.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
And I think there&#8217;s a huge responsibility in entertainment brands and the folks who, who work at them, certainly at brands as large as Netflix, and with such a global footprint. There&#8217;s responsibility in the driving of global culture. And so, you see this a lot or you saw this a lot during the pandemic. I think even more so than pre-pandemic. Life is hard and you&#8217;ve had a really difficult day, a difficult week. There&#8217;s family stuff. There&#8217;s work stuff.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
There&#8217;s the state of the world, in general. And what we want you to do, what we want to be able to do, what we focus so much time on, on an effort on allowing you to do easily is to sit down on your sofa or in front of your laptop or in front of your toaster, grab a remote. And for 43 minutes, for 60 minutes, hopefully for longer, you are able to take the weight of the world off of your shoulders and immerse yourself in a story. And live in that story and watch all of that story if you want or stop and sort of reemerge back into your life and do some more things and then come back and reemerge yourself in that story.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
That is an awesome responsibility that we have. And my team, because we are supporting the folks who make and the processes by which we make this creative work that represents titles on platform, we&#8217;re the front door and the last door to those moments of joy. And that&#8217;s what I tell my folks to, that&#8217;s what they focus on, that&#8217;s what we focus on. That&#8217;s why we are here at this company to focus on giving members moments of joy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I have to say, the way that Netflix has sort of expanded in the early 20-teens with not just expanding globally, but then also expanding into original content. The development of original content sort of further kind of lets Netflix seep into the culture in that way, because as it expands out more, now we&#8217;re making your own shows. Because there&#8217;s a lot of, or I think it&#8217;s probably is still this way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You have all this platform hopping of old shows and movies and stuff. Particularly, I think with a lot of NBC properties and stuff like The Office, it was on Hulu. Now, it&#8217;s on Peacock. Now, it&#8217;s on this. And it&#8217;s amazing how people will follow a platform for a show that probably hasn&#8217;t been online or is still in syndication or something like that. But Netflix now moving forward with their own content as they also expand their global footprint, at the same time, huge. That&#8217;s huge.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
Yeah. There&#8217;s real power in that. And you only get to those sorts of insights and then execute on those insights and then continue to execute on those insights with more insights and do that at a global scale. The only way to do that is with stunning colleagues. It&#8217;s the only way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. To that end, what does a regular day look for you? Does that exist?</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
Nope. There is no regular day. Well, there are constants, let&#8217;s say. And maybe it&#8217;s almost like what does a week generally look like? And there&#8217;s things that happen in any given week are totally different. I said to someone, I said to a colleague the other day, &#8220;There&#8217;s never a boring day here is there?&#8221; They just sort of looked at me and they were sort of laughing of like, &#8220;Yep, no, no, no. That just does not exist here.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
In any given week, I think like many people, we live on video chat. So, I&#8217;m on video chat a lot, but the conversations are so different and so rich and meaningful. Remember the days before everyone worked at home? And you might have eight meetings a day, but only three of them were really important. And the other five, you could of phone it in sometimes. Apologies to my previous lawyers who may or may not be listening to this.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
You could be with your phone checking Twitter under the table, that kind of moment. Not that I ever did such things clearly. It&#8217;s sort of the opposite of that here. So, if I&#8217;m on 10 calls, each of those 10 calls, is the most important call that day. And there were pre-reads read for those calls. There was prep work done. There was active participation in those calls.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
So, I think in any given couple of days or a week period, I&#8217;m having, it&#8217;s a really a collaboration session meeting with my team. My team, we don&#8217;t call them status meetings because it&#8217;s a waste of everyone&#8217;s time for all of us to sit on a call and go round robin and people tell me the status of their projects and initiatives. That&#8217;s a waste of their time. I think it&#8217;s disrespectful to their time. They can send me an email. They can update Slack.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
They can also do what they do because I trust them to do it because they&#8217;re the best people in the world to do this job. I don&#8217;t need to hover over them. So, we take an hour every Monday and collaborate on things. We&#8217;ll take a moment to celebrate on the latest content that we&#8217;re all or some of us are into. And then we really get into sort of the nuts and bolts collaboration, because these folks do have different backgrounds and different perspectives, different experiences.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
And because we&#8217;re a little a bit spread out and it&#8217;s a new team. It&#8217;s not as though we have spent so much time physically together. So, this moment is where you can start learning about each other and what each person kind of bring to this collaboration moment. I do also have a weekly status, also it&#8217;s less of a status. It&#8217;s more of a big thing that&#8217;s going on with my peers and the person that we report to. And we&#8217;re thinking of sort of bigger picture, strategic vision and what are the priorities for this year and next and how our cross-functional partnerships are doing.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
But a lot of time for me is spent watching Netflix. And I&#8217;m just smiling ear-to-ear when I say that. I watch a lot of Netflix. I watch Netflix during the day. I said to my mom, when I started, &#8220;I get paid to watch a lot of Netflix and that&#8217;s pretty damn cool.&#8221; And I&#8217;m watching as a member, but I&#8217;m also, I&#8217;m watching to gauge where we&#8217;re at creatively with title representation on platform. Does that feel right? And if it does, how can we do that not once, but twice but 5000 times. And then next year, 10,000 times. And then the next year, 30,000 times. So, there&#8217;s a lot of focus on getting content in.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a lot of task forces that are, we&#8217;re really big on cross-functional partnerships and cross-functional relationships. So, I&#8217;m on a couple of handfuls worth of internal working groups and task forces focused on all sorts of issues and initiatives and challenges to solve. Maybe there&#8217;ll be a meeting in that. And one person from the taskforce is going to present a deck or a super long memo about the latest findings from a test. And we debate them and we dissent openly and give feedback about what we&#8217;re talking about in these conversations openly.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
This is kind of what my life is these days. I watch TV a lot and I talk a lot. Which is for a person who talks a lot and watches TV a lot when he is not working in Netflix, that&#8217;s kind of a dream.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the most challenging aspect of this new job?</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
I think maybe the most challenging and the most rewarding, the most rewarding is being able to work with colleagues across the world from completely different cultures and perspectives and backgrounds. And then I think one of the more challenging parts is coordination of the working with amazing colleagues from across the world.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
Time zones are a thing. It&#8217;s always going to be painful for someone. I mean, it&#8217;s either 8:00 AM for me or it&#8217;s 8:00 PM for me. It&#8217;s certainly when I&#8217;m working with colleagues on the literal other side of the planet. And trying to coordinate that with super busy schedules ends up being more challenging than you kind of think. &#8220;Oh, send a calendar, invite us all. Fine.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
But our days are so dynamic. They change all the time and these meetings run long and maybe they run short. And then there that&#8217;s a company town hall. Trying to keep schedules in that space when there are so many dependent time zone dependencies, it ends up being a significant challenge and maybe that&#8217;s a challenge for me. The old school Netflix folks do this with their eyes closed. I&#8217;m still catching up and trying to figure out kind of the best way to handle that.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
One thing about that, when we have sort of larger meetings, larger department meetings, or all hands in our part of the organization, we do those meetings twice because of time zones. So, if you&#8217;re presenting in a meeting and you&#8217;ve got a couple hundred people on a call, for me, I&#8217;m in those conversations all the time. I&#8217;m presenting in those quite often. I&#8217;ll have one at 7:00 PM on a Tuesday and then I&#8217;ll have the exact same meeting the next day at 10:00 AM, but just with different participants, but I&#8217;m saying the same thing twice.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
And there&#8217;s a challenge in that sort of human communication moment. Sometimes, I feel a little bit like I imagine a politician feels giving a stump speech. And they&#8217;re, &#8220;Okay, hello, Rapid City.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;You&#8217;re actually at Albuquerque.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, sorry. I was in Rapid City yesterday.&#8221; That sort of when you say the same thing a number of times it starts to become rote.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
And I think that would be unfair to our colleagues in our various locations across the world. So, trying to keep that stuff fresh to get their excited unique perspectives is also sort of challenging for me sometimes. But you work through it, you work through it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, when we had talked back in 2014, I know we&#8217;re talking now about Netflix, but I want to kind of go back to really track the progression to how you&#8217;ve gotten to where you are now. Back when we talked in 2014, you were fairly new, I think CTO at this FinTech startup called GoldBean. Tell me about that experience. How was it?</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
Oh, GoldBean. Oh, wow. It&#8217;s funny how the perception of time is so malleable and the past two years feel like 30 years. So, really thinking back to the GoldBean days, it&#8217;s amazing. I&#8217;m watching right now there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s like what? Three or four prestige TV series about well-known startups happening right now. I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re called, but there&#8217;s the Uber show. That&#8217;s what I call them at home. There&#8217;s the Uber show. There&#8217;s this there no show. There&#8217;s the Uber show.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
I&#8217;m watching all of them at the same time. And I just, I laugh a lot when there are moments that they are talked about in these shows that I remember. Like begging for funding, a launch day, getting your first non-direct connected customers and that sort of thing. GoldBean was a blast. It was a massive learning experience. You&#8217;d wake up on a Monday morning and you&#8217;d think I am right. Our product is right. Our brand is right. Everything, we&#8217;re making the right decisions. We are so smart.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
And then by lunchtime, you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Wait, no, actually we don&#8217;t know anything. What the hell have we done with our lives?&#8221; Then it might change. It might go up again by dinnertime. That sort of emotional rollercoaster. That I think is inherent in startups. I guess when I think back on the GoldBean era, that&#8217;s one of the things that&#8217;s top of mind to me, that riding that rollercoaster.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
So, GoldBean, I was so lucky to co-found GoldBean with a former colleague. She was actually a former boss, truth be told. And we were, you have colleagues, boss or not, you&#8217;re close in, and when you&#8217;re working together. And then time goes by, you both have different jobs, different parts of industries. You don&#8217;t talk again. You drop each other notes on Twitter or LinkedIn. One is a Merry Christmas and Happy Birthday kind of a thing.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
I was so lucky to reconnect with her and have the opportunity to build something from nothing. And to think about all aspects during that building of something from nothing. Where it&#8217;s not just the product, not just the tech of the product, but the design of the product, the brand, but the brand values. And how those brand values would be expressed through visual design, but also through our own behavior in the marketplace and how we raise the money.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
Really all of that coming from a core set of brand values, which is really about, could we have a financial brand that didn&#8217;t just focus on straight white dudes? How do you take that kind of a phrase and express it in design and express it in the tech and express it in product design? Solving those challenges was so much fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you were kind of going back into the startup world then, because prior to that, you were at Wieden and Kennedy before you were at GoldBean?</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s right. Yeah. My career has been startup, ad agency, startup, ad agency. At a certain point, it was like startup, startup, startup, startup. Oh, no. Ad agency. I&#8217;ve kind of, I&#8217;ve lived a lot in both of those worlds, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I guess, to follow that pattern after this startup, you were at an ad agency. Right after that you were at Deutsch New York. How did that opportunity come about? Because you were at GoldBean for a good minute.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s a funny story, and I think it was like four or five years at GoldBean. And we did the typical, it&#8217;s sort of like the typical startup life cycle. Even though there were all of the roller coaster at any given day if you kind of zoom out from that, there was the typical, &#8220;Have an idea. Ooh, that&#8217;s a good one. Let&#8217;s bootstrap it. Let&#8217;s make it. Let&#8217;s raise some money. Well, let&#8217;s raise some money. Oh, wait. We&#8217;re a woman and Black gay man as CTO-led financial technology brand.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
So, we&#8217;re raising money and raising money and raising money. I continued that for a very long time before going on to the next part of working on a startup. But we got to the point, I guess, near the end where we had a lovely relationship with a company that ended up buying the GoldBean.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
I was having drinks with an old colleague from my Wieden+Kennedy days who for maybe a year or so, she was at Deutsch New York. And she had been trying to for a year to get me to talk to folks at Deutsch. And I kept saying, &#8220;No, I have a job. It&#8217;s called a startup. Ever heard of it?&#8221; I was sort of getting snippy about it after a while. But she was a friend. We finally had a moment in a bar where I knew that, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re actually going to be wrapping GoldBean up soon. Fine. I will talk to your precious Deutsch New York people. Fine.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
And so, she did an email introduction to some folks there. And one conversation with a person who ended up becoming my Deutsch collaborator and then personal friend, one conversation, I was sold. I was excited to join Deutsch specifically because of the people. It&#8217;s always about people for me. The culture was much around, &#8220;Hey, here&#8217;s the thing. Let&#8217;s figure out how to do that better.&#8221; And that really, really kind of called to me.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny. Where did we, where you and I spoke at a conference together in Atlanta, what was that?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That was How to Design Live in 2016.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
Wow, 2016. I remember standing on a stage there and I know this happened. I hope there&#8217;s not a recording of it. I stood on a stage and I said something like, &#8220;I will never go back to advertising.&#8221; And the crowd sort of giggles. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m serious. I will never go back to advertising.&#8221; Fast forward two years, I&#8217;m [crosstalk 00:32:43]. So, never say never, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are some of the things you worked on?</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
Deutsch work was and is focused on helping brands through inflection points. There&#8217;s a product launching, there&#8217;s a major change in company leadership and now there&#8217;s a new brand tone or value or look and feel of something. But no, I think the specialty of Deutsch was finding those moments of change and developing coms around those moments of change and to support those moments of change in the eyes of a brand consumers.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
I think a good example, some work that we did for, for AB InBev. The world&#8217;s largest brewer. Speaking of global scale, AB InBev has got it. I was going to say we designed and built an app called Hoppy, but that doesn&#8217;t come close to kind of what the project was. That&#8217;s what I loved about the work at Deutsch. It wasn&#8217;t just the what is the tactic that we&#8217;re leaning in on. It&#8217;s why is this tactic important? What larger program in an inflection point for a brand is this tactic a part of?</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
For AB InBev specifically, it was around really wanting all of their employees to have a deep, deep, deep appreciation of, and understanding of beer. And I think that might sound a little silly sometimes, like &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a brewer, how do they not understand and love beer?&#8221; But at a brewer, there&#8217;s a lot of employees. That&#8217;s just the folks in the brewery. You got sales people, you got marketing people, you have operations people, you have number crunchers.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
And there was a real desire by the heads of AB InBev to internally have every single AB InBev employee be educated about beer. Be able to champion beer and what beer could do from a cultural perspective like throwing people together and having sort of moments of meaning in people&#8217;s lives, who work at AB InBev. And how could every employee of AB InBev share that passion for beer to their friends and family and so on and so on.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
So, one of the tactics that we came up with was called Hoppy and it was an app, internal only. It has since gone public on the web, I believe, but it was an iOS and Android app that essentially gamified education. And we took a lot of cues from how people use their phones when they&#8217;re not supposed to be at jobs. Really wanted a little bite size content. AB InBev has a super competitive internal culture and we leaned in on that in some of the gamification as well. So the idea was, if you log into Hoppy, you read some bite size content about beer, and it&#8217;s all different sorts of courses. And from beer history to beer science, to the making of beer.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
It was very specifically about beer, not so much a sales tool for AB InBev brands. No. It was about beer. You read this content, you interact with these little games then you would get quizzes. If you answer the quiz, you get a badge. Every badge comes along with beer coin. Yes, I know. Every time I would say it then and said it now is I cringe a little bit. I won&#8217;t take up too much time complaining about crypto and my thoughts on that. But the idea was giving the AB InBev employees again from the super competitive internal culture a thing to compete with. We built leaderboards, not just in the app, but around offices.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
We allowed managers to create what we called Beer Code, C-O-D like a QR code, QR code. You go into an admin system, you make a beer code and that beer code could be for an extracurricular meeting you were having with your team or a happy hour that you wanted your encouraged your team to show up to. You&#8217;d make it, you&#8217;d print it, you&#8217;d stick it on the wall. Every employee that walks in, they log into Hoppy as they&#8217;re walking in, they scan that code. They get some beer coin. They move up in the leaderboard.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
All the content could always be refreshed and it was all very beautiful. And there&#8217;s this amazing design that the super talented product design team at Deutsch New York created. That sort of deep, deep, deep brand integration coming through via a digital tactic for employees. That&#8217;s the sort of work that Deutsch did and does. And it&#8217;s work that I, years later, am still super proud of.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at both your time working at GoldBean, which was a startup and working at Deutsch New York, which is an agency. When you look at those two specific experiences, what unique skills do you think you&#8217;re able to bring now to your work at Netflix, which is in a totally different space?</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
The ability to tell a story succinctly, last answer to your question, notwithstanding. You know what I mean? Taking super, super complicated concepts and distilling them down to their essence, not 30 slides, but two. But when you are the digital per person in a non-only digital environment like a big ad agency. And anyone who is in that position sort of understands and I think even folks who are sort of new areas of larger older companies will understand this, you run out of time in a meeting.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
You run out of time in a pitch because your part of the pitch is like Slide 38 of 50. I&#8217;m sorry. Your part of the pitch is Slide 38 out of 40. And by the time you get to Slide 37, you look at the clock and it&#8217;s almost time and all your colleagues are looking at you like, &#8220;Okay, you had a whole lot to say when you practiced this pitch, but now you have seven seconds to say it because we took too long to say our part. You don&#8217;t have time anymore. Go.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
When you experience that over a career, my ad agency career of being the digital person in these sometimes, non-digital native environments, you get really good at taking 30 pages of really complicated stuff and distilling it down to three sentences. It&#8217;s a skill that has come in handy at a place like Netflix where things are so and so cross-functional, and cross-functionally complicated. Cutting down to the essence has really, really served me well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, from what you&#8217;re able to share, I mean, you&#8217;ve already shared so much about Netflix, what would you say is probably the most surprising thing that most people don&#8217;t know about Netflix?</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
Netflix employees pay for Netflix.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Really?</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
We pay a subscription, just like everybody else. And listen, I got to say when I got the message, when I logged in Netflix one day and I saw that my subscription price went up, I did have a second of a gasp. I did have a moment of like, &#8220;Hey, wait a second.&#8221; Then I remembered that I work there. Yes, we pay for Netflix. I think it&#8217;s actually really important that we pay for Netflix. We are members, too and when you pay for something, even if you work at the place that makes it, even if your work is available on it, come at it from a different perspective. It&#8217;s much more than empathy for members when you are a member.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
We, too, are sensitive to price changes and know that they are done with respect. We too are excited by content. We too are sad and disappointed when our favorite show isn&#8217;t renewed. And really being, having that perspective in the product, as expressed by, &#8220;I&#8217;m paying the same price everybody else is paying,&#8221; I think really gives us a strong, strong perspective when we are working on things that are potentially challenging or difficult.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That is wild. I didn&#8217;t know that you all were paying for Netflix. I mean, ooh, interesting. Okay. So, yeah, when those prices go up, you all feel it, too, so I guess that&#8217;s a little bit of empathy out there for folks who didn&#8217;t know that. How have you changed since we last spoke here on the show seven years ago?</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
I think I&#8217;ve realized what I&#8217;m good at. I don&#8217;t always know what I&#8217;m good at to be, to be fair. But I think I&#8217;ve kind of narrowed down what I&#8217;m good at and I&#8217;ve embraced what I&#8217;m good at. And that is living in the space between art and science and leading teams creatively in that space between art and science.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
And I think earlier parts of my career, I sort of fell into this in between space. It was never a conscious intentional choice to sort of be in the middle. But I started out way back in the day as a dev, but I was a creative. In my day job, I&#8217;m writing code and I just happen to be the one of all the devs in whatever place I was at, at that time, that could have a conversation with designers or creatives. And really understand their perspective and then translate that perspective.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
And in the startup world, that was a superpower. I didn&#8217;t realize that that was a superpower. And in the agency world, again, it was a superpower I didn&#8217;t quite realize was a superpower at that time. And I think as I&#8217;ve matured as a human, as I&#8217;ve grown as a leader, and I think as I&#8217;ve grown as a creative, I&#8217;ve understood that as being a major tool in my tool belt and I recognize that it&#8217;s a tool in my tool belt. I know how to wield it. And I knew how to wield it back when we first spoke. I think, I didn&#8217;t know how well I actually could wield it and I think I&#8217;m really doing that now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are you where you wanted to be at in this stage in your life?</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
Well, listen, having gotten started in my career in the dot-com boom, I thought by now, I&#8217;d be retired on a yacht. The yacht would be called the Husani. It would have my face on it, giving the middle finger to everybody as I go from port to port, island to island. Living my retired before mid-40s amazing life. That didn&#8217;t happen. It took me a little while to realize that wasn&#8217;t going to happen.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
But you know what? Yes, I am. I have always wanted to be in a place professionally and personally where my passions for storytelling can have an impact on more than a handful of people and a lasting impact on more than a handful of people. And it&#8217;s been a long road. I&#8217;ve been doing this for a long time, but I am certainly now in a place where my creative ideas, my creative leadership and the wielding of the in-between art and science tool can really have an impact on the lives of hundreds of millions of people. And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve really always wanted and that, I feel like I have that now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have a dream project that you would love to do someday? I mean, it honestly sounds like this work that you&#8217;re doing on Netflix is kind of, I mean, I&#8217;ve known you for 20 plus years. But this sounds like the pinnacle of where you are in your career, but is there more that you want to do like bigger dreams and aspirations?</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
I want to write a Broadway musical.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
All I get is a &#8220;Hmm?&#8221; Wow. Wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no. What would it be about?</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
You&#8217;re difficult. Oh, I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know, but I want one. Look, I discovered a love for musical theater when I was a super, super young kid and saw Sarafina! on Broadway. It&#8217;s up to Google what year that was because I really don&#8217;t remember. I was super young. And then my love for musical theater was cemented when I became obsessed with Little Shop of Horrors in the late &#8217;80s. And it&#8217;s just sort of grown and been there ever since on the wall that I sit in front of when I&#8217;m on video chat all day, every day.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
I mean, there are a bunch of pieces of art and some things that are meaningful to me. But on one side, there&#8217;s a Star Trek poster. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Best film ever. Then there&#8217;s also a stylized drawing of the logo of Miss Saigon because that show has had big impact and meaning on my taste in theater and understanding of the interplay between words and song.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
And I don&#8217;t know what my show would be about. But I would like to before I leave this planet to whatever comes next, write a show and hopefully have the same sort of impact emotionally on people that the work that I love so much has had on me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, you&#8217;re in New York. If there&#8217;s any place to write the next Broadway musical, that&#8217;s it. All you have to do is get Netflix to give, I don&#8217;t know, Lin-Manuel Miranda, a project or something. Find a way for you all to work together and make that happen. I mean, seriously, because I mean, Netflix has, I mean, we&#8217;re talking a lot about Netflix because you work there. But just to kind of talk about more with their expansion, they&#8217;ve gone into games, they have a book club.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m surprised that they haven&#8217;t went into theaters. I know Amazon did that with their Amazon Studios. They bought, I think it was Landmark. I think it was Landmark theaters they bought that chain or they wanted to buy it or something. But I&#8217;m surprised there&#8217;s not brick and mortar Netflix theaters. I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s probably somewhere down the pipeline.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
We do own one theater. Hey, here&#8217;s another maybe thing that people don&#8217;t know about Netflix. We own a theater in New York, a movie theater.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
Yeah, the Paris Theater. It&#8217;s a beautiful old landmark theater and there are screenings. It&#8217;s open. It&#8217;s a public, it&#8217;s a theater, it&#8217;s a movie theater. You can buy tickets and see a movie there. The Power of the Dog was there a couple of weeks ago. There&#8217;s something happening there tonight with Judd Apatow. That it&#8217;s open to the public as in you could buy tickets like everyone else, but yeah, we own that theater, which is a lot of fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Aside from the musical, what is it that you want your legacy to be?</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
One of my early pre-career claims to fame, such that it is I had a first amendment related lawsuit with my high school in the town I grew up in. And back then, I really wanted to leave behind a changed world. There are a million and one things wrong. If I could change four of them, no one ever needs to know my name. No one ever needs to know that I was the person who changed those four things as long with those four things got changed.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
And I guess I&#8217;ve gone from then, I&#8217;ve run startups, so I&#8217;ve been at companies big and small. I&#8217;ve done all of this stuff. I&#8217;ve spoken on stages. I&#8217;ve been around the world. All of this stuff. And I think all I still want to do is change for things on this planet for the better. And so, the people who come after me don&#8217;t experience those four things of the million things being wrong as wrong.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One thing I didn&#8217;t even touch on that we focused on your work at GoldBean and Deutsch, but you&#8217;ve also done a fair amount of civic tech work in these past seven years. I remember vividly you being invited to the White House, Obama, not Trump, invited to the White House. Can you talk about that a little bit?</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
Yeah. I was invited to the White House twice. Let&#8217;s just be clear.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
And so, the first invite was the Obama administration understood the importance of inclusion. And there was a group of LGBTQ senior technology executives invited to spend a day at the White House and put our heads together on the problems that plague our society and humanity. So, of those million and one problems that I acknowledge exists in the reality we live in, could we take 15 of those and solve them. What do we think would be great, great moves to protect against climate change? How can we think about employment and unemployment certainly, in the tech sector, since we were folks coming out of the tech sector.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
And that was just a fascinating moment, an amazing experience I&#8217;ve developed lifelong friends from that moment. Then it actually then led to the next moment later that year, and it was 2016, I believe. Yeah, it was 2016 because the last time was actually post-election, that election. It was around, &#8220;Okay. We made some really good strides in that first summit around digital and technology employment outside.&#8221; Thinking about it as not just being an issue in the major cities, but they&#8217;re really being huge opportunity outside of the coasts and the major cities.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
Now, there are smart key people outside of just New York and LA. Shocker, I know. How can we spread the unheard of in human civilization wealth that has been generated by the internet and digital to technology, IT in general, outside of just those centers from a jobs program and continuing educate perspective. We were worried that with the election having gone the way it did that any strides that we&#8217;d made. We had folks from the department of labor involved and a lot of the conversations we&#8217;ve had in that first summit, our assumption, a safe assumption, was that all of that was going to get thrown in the trash.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
And so the second time, a bunch of us got together at the White House was around, if we can&#8217;t ensure that it&#8217;s not going to get thrown in the trash, how can we on the outside of being in the executive branch continue kind of driving these initiatives? So, it turns out that continuing to drive those initiatives were one of a million problems caused by that guy. So, I think we all then found ourselves really busy from that date, I mean, through forever now, because the fight against fascist never actually ends.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
But yeah, I think when this technology was new, we didn&#8217;t know what it could do. A lot of us were naives in thinking that it was all a net good and connecting people was always in that good and base core infrastructure. Technology was always in that good because it didn&#8217;t have intention and then over time we learned that that&#8217;s not true. And now, we recognize that high AI biased, high moderation on social platforms a big issue, high identity on social platforms a big issue.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
I look back at those early times and think about how naive a lot of us were, myself included, about what these technologies would do. And so, now, I think those of us who remain in the space and certainly more so folks that are new to these spaces have a responsibility to use these tools for good and not for evil. An active good, not just being neutral. Technology is not neutral.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a responsibility we have as creatives, as technologists, as creative technologists, as humans, as Americans if that&#8217;s what we are. We have these things on our hand, we got to use them right. So, focusing on the betterment of society is it&#8217;s clearly, perhaps never far from top of mind for me. Now, actually, my little sister is running for Congress. I think we share a lot of similar perspectives on the need for being involved in the government of the world that we live in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, Husani, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
On Twitter, I am @Husani Oakley. On Instagram, I&#8217;m @Husani. And if you can&#8217;t remember any of that, I&#8217;m at husani.com on the web.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Husani Oakley, I want to thank you so much for coming on this show. I mean, as I sort of mentioned earlier in the interview, we&#8217;ve known each other for such a long time, so I already knew this was going to be a great interview. But really getting to hear you talk about the work that you&#8217;re doing with Netflix, the fact that you&#8217;re able to take the talent that you have and be able to apply that across a global scale with a company like Netflix, I feel like this is exactly where you need to be right now. And I&#8217;m excited to see what the next thing will be. I hope it&#8217;s the musical. I&#8217;ll be there. I&#8217;ll buy a ticket for the musical if it happens in the future, I&#8217;ll be there. So, thank you so much for coming on the show, man. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Husani Oakley:</b><br>
Thank you, Maurice. A blast as always.</p>

<p>Azeez Alli-Balogun came highly recommended by several former guests, so I knew that a great conversation was going to happen. Azeez currently works as a lead product designer on the globalization team at Netflix, and he&#8217;s also a co-founder of <a href="https://www.designtodivest.com/" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Design to Divest</a>. But if you think that&#8217;s all there is to Azeez&#8217;s story, then think again!</p>
<p>We started off with a quick 2022 check-in, and then he talked about his plan to work on more Black-focused design projects, and also gave a glimpse at what it&#8217;s like working at Netflix. From there, Azeez spoke about growing up in Louisiana, becoming a jewelry designer, and how he transitioned into product design. We also spent some time talking about Design to Divest and Azeez shared what he wants the organization to accomplish in the future. Everyone has the power to make change with design, and Azeez is a prime example of this!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
My name is Azeez Alli-Balogun. I am a product designer at Netflix, a product design lead at Netflix on the globalization team. What that really entails is that we&#8217;re looking at how do we enable Netflix products and the content that we create to live in local markets, but also experience global audiences.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So I work a lot on the enterprise tools or the tools that help us create the subtitling assets, the dubbing assets, and all of those things that actually help our content become very, very locally resonant in local markets and local geographies, but also accessible to global audiences.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2022 been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been going really great. It&#8217;s interesting. We&#8217;re in the end of January, and it&#8217;s been incredibly productive, quite a lot of work that I&#8217;ve been doing in the beginning of the year. I&#8217;ve been invited to do a couple of different types of projects that I feel were very, very impactful. I think it&#8217;s just there&#8217;s so many seeds and so many things that have been planted in 2020 and 2021 that are starting to kind of blossom a little bit, which is both good and, also, I&#8217;m getting to a point where I need to make sure I&#8217;m prioritizing myself and my rest. I want to make sure that 2020 doesn&#8217;t lead to burnout for me with opportunities coming my way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything special in particular that you want to achieve this year?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I mean the biggest thing that I think is really focusing on some of the work that I&#8217;m doing with Design to Divest, but really starting to produce more content or areas in where people from marginalized backgrounds, particularly the Black communities and African communities and indigenous communities, to be able to access design differently, access learning differently, and be able to participate in the creation of the world that we live in through their own cultural knowledge base.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So that type of work is something that I&#8217;m looking to start to really tangibilize in more meaningful ways. So I&#8217;m pretty hopeful that with all of the work that I&#8217;m doing and the projects and the communities that I&#8217;m a part of, that I&#8217;ll be able to create these platforms that allow or bring in more Black, African, and indigenous creatives to the forefront of creating some of the institutions that are going to shape the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, let&#8217;s talk about the work that you&#8217;re doing at Netflix. You&#8217;re the product design lead for the globalization team there. Now, you mentioned what you&#8217;re doing has to do with subtitles and dubbing. I can only imagine probably after the success of titles like Squid Game and Lupin and stuff that you probably have had a lot on your plate. But tell me more about the work that you do.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s a lot of stakeholder management. So it&#8217;s interesting in the sense that the team that I&#8217;m working on really crosses so much of what Netflix does. It&#8217;s an integral part to growth. As Netflix grows our global subscriber base and grows into global markets, it&#8217;s incredibly important that we&#8217;re effective in the way that we localize our content as we start to even increase the volume of content that we produce, the volume of film and the volume of movies, and really trying to create platforms for different geographical spaces outside of Hollywood to be able to share their stories.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So a lot of the work is when you go into Netflix and you&#8217;re able to see the option to choose 20 different subtitles or watch things in dubbing, all of that stuff is work that I&#8217;m directly impacting and the team that I work on directly impacts. We&#8217;re working with linguists. We&#8217;re working with project managers. We&#8217;re working across the board with so many different types of stakeholders to ensure that there is quality attached to the subtitles and the dubbing and that if a director in Nigeria creates a television show or a movie, that same movie can be enjoyed by somebody in Swedish and it doesn&#8217;t lose a lot of the cultural nuances that represent how that content or how that TV show or film was created.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s a heavy task because it&#8217;s very difficult to even measure things, like what is a good subtitle? What is a good dubbing or voiceover? Can we make sure that we are staying true to the content? Because when you think about different languages, it&#8217;s very, very &#8230; If you&#8217;re lucky enough to be able to speak multiple languages, then you know that there are certain nuances and certain kind of things that just don&#8217;t translate.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
You want to be able to translate those cultural nuances so people start to really understand what it actually means to experience the culture that that film or that television show or those characters are actually situated in. So there&#8217;s a lot of really trying to figure out how do we communicate, also creating a lot of the workflows that allow our stakeholders, the project managers internally at Netflix with the linguists and the other vendors that we use in order to create all of these assets, how do we allow them to do this work very, very effectively and at the volume and scale of the amount of content that we produce on a yearly basis?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So talk to me more about the team. What does the makeup look like?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a typical product team. I mean you have your designers. I lead a particular area of the globalization design side. I have two other design partners who are also design leads in other areas. I work with a product manager, and I&#8217;m in constant contact with the globalization project managers and program managers as well as vendors and linguists in order to really understand what is necessary and how to create the best conditions for their workflows to be successful in delivering on the subtitling and dubbing and other localization assets.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So the core team is I&#8217;ll have my UI front end team and backend team designer and me, as a designer, project manager. We&#8217;re the core product team building out all of the tools. And then we&#8217;re in constant communication with the project managers, the vendor managers, the linguists who are actually authoring and creating a lot of the subtitling and localization assets in order to ensure that we&#8217;re providing the tools that are really supporting their workflows in a positive way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So Netflix has linguists that are doing the translating, I mean as they&#8217;re listening through to the content and making sure that those subtitles, like you said, are kind of accurate to the plot, culturally accurate, et cetera.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean there&#8217;s a whole process there of subtitle authoring. I can&#8217;t get too deep into lots of that stuff because I think it&#8217;s one of the things that does set Netflix apart from some of the other services that you might encounter, the level of detail that we go into trying to create good subtitles. There&#8217;s a lot of experimentation and things that we&#8217;re doing right now in order to enable that process to be better for our members.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I remember when Squid Game had come out and there had been some kind of talk about like, &#8220;Oh, well, if you&#8217;re watching Squid Game, don&#8217;t watch it with subtitles because the subtitles aren&#8217;t right,&#8221; or something like that. Or no, it wasn&#8217;t the subtitles. It was the dubbing, I think, one of those two things. But I mean I can imagine even with a show like that, there&#8217;s still going to be some sort of cultural differences or things like that that get lost in translation.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean that&#8217;s exactly right. I mean there&#8217;s always going to be some dissonance. We&#8217;re always testing things out to try to get it right. I think the one thing that&#8217;s really great about the culture at Netflix and how we go about designing and building product is we experiment in order to figure out how we can learn and improve and constantly improve. So if we don&#8217;t get something right the first time, it&#8217;s a learning experience for us. We take all of that feedback and use it to ensure that we&#8217;re doing better as we move forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does an average day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Average day? I try to segment a little bit of my days or my week. Some days I load up with meetings, so I&#8217;m meeting with engineers and my product manager partner and other stakeholders. And then other days, I create that space for me to kind of just work and I&#8217;m designing and creating different concepts that are related to the conversations that I&#8217;ve been having, so kind of going through the whole design process, but in very, very short cycles.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It&#8217;s not spending three months or two weeks or just doing nothing but research, but do longer cycles of discovery research on a particular area that we&#8217;re trying to improve operational efficiency on and then take that, summarize that research into some opportunities, create some concepts behind that, and then start to socialize that with engineering and product in order to start to tweak and do more of &#8230; I try to do much more co-creation, co-designing with the stakeholders, the engineers, and product all together.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That way the decisions that are being made are made with the right amount of input from the different internal stakeholders that influence how the product actually tangibilizes itself. So my typical days typically would be I have some times where I&#8217;m dedicated. I need time to intake all the information that I&#8217;ve gotten and then start to visualize that into some sort of concept.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
And then a lot of the times, I am taking those concepts in meetings and doing a lot of co-design in order to fulfill requirements and understand what the needs are directly with both the users and then my product stakeholders as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the most challenging part about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Stakeholder management maybe. The reason that I would say that is when I think about the idea of complexity, what really makes anything complex is that you have a bunch of different competing priorities that happen at scale. So being able to really clearly align all the different priorities that are happening from different parts of the process and different stakeholders into something that works, I think, is the most difficult part because I&#8217;m also constantly listening and observing what people are saying, what people are doing, and then trying to translate that down into a language that can be understood by everyone who is involved.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
As you know, it&#8217;s interesting as we talk about language and linguistics, not only in different languages. There are different languages within different industries. There are different languages within different professions. So everyone might have a different way of communicating the same thing. Oftentimes, you can be in meetings where people are trying to communicate an idea or a concept with the language of their own profession.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So engineers might be communicating things in a certain way that&#8217;s different from product. That&#8217;s also slightly different from the way that the type of language that design would use to communicate something. And then our end users are using a different type of language and trying to wrangle all of those different concepts and in the way that people are trying to express what it is that they&#8217;re trying to think of in a way that everyone&#8217;s aligned on and everyone kind of understands.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That&#8217;s where I feel like a lot of the true power of design comes because once you start to take the language and start to visualize things, then people can have something to have an opinion about. They can have something to kind of analyze and say, &#8220;That&#8217;s not it,&#8221; or, &#8220;That is it,&#8221; or, &#8220;It&#8217;s this and this. Add this or that or the other.&#8221; But bringing life to the words that are being said by all of the people in the room and then allowing people to kind of mold what&#8217;s been created to make sure that everyone&#8217;s voices is really being heard.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I would imagine language and linguistics probably influence a lot of the design work in general, right?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean just really trying to understand the nuances of it and how those nuances can be misinterpreted because, as you know, a misinterpretation of even body language or a language or just a word or a concept can have dire consequences. So it&#8217;s important operationally as well as it is tangibly when we&#8217;re trying to create the product and making sure that the things that we create are very, very clear and transparent.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Netflix, it&#8217;s been an interesting place working. It&#8217;s been the most different place that I&#8217;ve worked at in my career because of the culture. The culture at Netflix is very unique. As I mentioned a little bit before about the experimentation culture of just trying to do things to learn, to get feedback, and then course correct. That also kind of goes into how we&#8217;re managed as employees. There&#8217;s a lot of the idea of freedom and responsibility and then the culture of feedback. All of those feed into the way that we&#8217;re able to work and the way that we&#8217;re able to kind of explore different areas of our profession in ways that we may have been restricted in other organizations.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So I think that that&#8217;s a huge part that I typically really enjoy at Netflix and enjoy working with a bunch of other people who have similar mindset of growth and discovery and learning. It really shows through whenever we&#8217;re able to create, learn from the products and the things that we create, and prove it for our members.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. That&#8217;s pretty cool. It sounds like Netflix does give you that freedom. I know there&#8217;s some companies of people whom I would love to interview, but they have a strict embargo on their employees cannot do podcasts or anything like that. So it&#8217;s good that at least they let you all be able to talk about your work and do other things freely.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean it&#8217;s definitely encouraged, but I mean there&#8217;s definitely tons of stuff that we can&#8217;t say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I walk a line a lot of times trying to make sure that &#8230; Because there&#8217;s so much transparency at Netflix and I think that that&#8217;s one of the really great parts of the culture at Netflix is that, as an employee there, the leadership from the top down is always going to be as transparent as possible. But with that comes responsibility of we&#8217;re letting you know all of this information. We don&#8217;t expect you to go out and tell the world all of the secrets and things. This is internal information that we are providing you context so you&#8217;re able to really do your job to the best of your ability. We don&#8217;t want to hide things from you.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
But it comes with a lot of responsibility, that level of transparency and that level of trust that our leaders kind of put in us as contributors to the mission that the company is trying to achieve.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Gotcha. I&#8217;m curious to learn more about you, your particular origin story. Tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Both of my parents are from Nigeria, and I was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. So I grew up in Louisiana. I spent most of my childhood in Louisiana and went there to high school. I went to Southern University when I graduated high school for a couple of semesters before switching over to design and going to University of Louisiana at Lafayette. But growing up, I wouldn&#8217;t have thought of myself as being a designer. I wasn&#8217;t exposed to it in that way. I mean my dad was in school for architecture, so I was exposed to that.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
But the ideas of industrial design or other aspects of design weren&#8217;t really things that came across. I played basketball, growing up. I was more interested in trying to go to the NBA than I was with anything else. But I was also an avid reader. I read quite a lot, and I did a lot of writing, drawing. So there was always that creative aspect, but I imagined myself going into medical school rather than design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So when you went to University of Louisiana at Lafayette though, you ended up majoring in industrial design. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean that was really the reason that I left Southern University because they didn&#8217;t have an industrial design program. So initially, whenever I was in school, my intention was to be a pediatric surgeon. Actually, I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to study biomedical engineering and then go to medical school to be a pediatric surgeon.&#8221; That was my intention. At the time, too, biomedical engineering was a fairly new field of study within the higher education to where if you really wanted to do that, you had to get a master&#8217;s degree.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So while I was at Southern University, I needed to kind of create a curriculum for myself, working with my engineering faculty. I was doing mechanical engineering and double majoring in cellular molecular biology. But after a while, I was just like, &#8220;Something about this is not really what I want to do. I would love to create the medical tools and the medical devices. I&#8217;d love to design those things.&#8221; But it was just something that just didn&#8217;t feel right in terms of the education for me while I was in engineering.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I started doing some research. Maybe I might like automotive design. Through that, I found what industrial design was, and I was like, &#8220;Whoa. With this field, I can actually design medical devices. I can actually go and design prosthetic legs and all of these different things that I was interested in kind of creating.&#8221; That&#8217;s how I found University of Louisiana at Lafayette because that was the only school in Louisiana, at the time, that had an industrial design program. So I ended up going there and studying industrial design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So you kind of, I guess, looked at another way to get into the medical field then by looking at industrial design.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So in your early post-grad career after you left school, you ended up going into jewelry design. I&#8217;m curious. What drew you to that?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It wasn&#8217;t anything that really drew me. It was literally I graduated shortly after a recession in Louisiana. There were no jobs, really. It was really difficult to get a design job, especially in the South, in Louisiana. So really, what happened was that my portfolio was a bunch of &#8230; It was pediatric medical tools and prosthetics and stuff like that. The jewelry company, which had a connection to some of our professors at University of Louisiana, looked at my work and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;We really like your aesthetic visually. You have a really good sense of style and taste,&#8221; even looking at the medical tools, the medical stuff that I designed.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That&#8217;s literally how I jumped into jewelry design. I was interested in fashion. I was interested in design in general, but I wasn&#8217;t intending to go be a jewelry designer. If anything, I would have wanted to go to do something in footwear design at Nike because that would have merged a lot of the biomechanics and technical medical things that I was thinking about in terms of design with human performance. So yeah. Jewelry design just kind of came about. It was an opportunity that kind of came about, but it really allowed me to start to understand what it meant to design for things that were going to be worn on people&#8217;s bodies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That makes sense. How long were you a jewelry designer?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I was there for about two to two and a half years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It was quite an interesting experience, but even though while I was there &#8230; This is also the field of user experience design or a lot of the digital product design, all of that stuff. That was still fairly in its infancy. So even while I was there, I participated in some things, some interface things that were very interesting. From there, after I left that company, I wanted to discover what is it that I really wanted to do, but I also needed to look at where the market was going.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Industrial design jobs weren&#8217;t en masse. A lot of these jobs that when you&#8217;re designing physical things, they don&#8217;t have incredibly large teams. Just seeing the digital world kind of pick up, I started to make some pivots over into really learning that particular skillset, branched off to try to do a little bit of my own freelance work, both as an industrial designer. But then what I found was that I was getting more clients, more people looking for branding and web development and more digital kind of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That&#8217;s kind of how I ended up pivoting or going to grad school to learn really more of a service design kind of method to incorporate both to be more agnostic about what my skillsets delivered and more focused on what the outcome needed to be of whatever it is that a client or somebody wanted to create.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good way to put it in terms of trying to be more agnostic because what I&#8217;m hearing, and you can please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong here, it sounds like you were just trying to find where you were going to fit in. You&#8217;ve graduated. You have these design skills. While there certainly were things that you wanted to do in terms of design, those opportunities just weren&#8217;t available. So you were trying to see what could maybe your skills transfer into.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean I think that that&#8217;s a good characterization. I&#8217;m a person who is always ready to adapt to a situation. I have my core values and principles that I&#8217;m going to stay in those, and I&#8217;m not going to allow my value set and my principles to be swayed. But those principles aren&#8217;t rigid outcomes. They just help guide me in terms of the decisions that I need to make in life. But at the same time, I don&#8217;t create a level of rigidity to what it is that I can be and what it is that I can do.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Because it in the same way of when you&#8217;re designing a product or a service for someone or for people or a community, you need to allow it to be what it needs to be rather than always trying to force it into being something that you envisioned from the beginning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, when did you decide to go to grad school? Was that during this time as well?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. That was during this time. I was looking at a handful of schools. I was looking at Pratt, RISD. I almost went to SCAD for the service design program because I had a friend who I was in undergrad with who was there, and he told me it was a great program. Service design&#8217;s still kind of a fairly newer field in design in the United States. It&#8217;s still catching on. You&#8217;re starting to see it more so now than it was years ago. I mean it&#8217;s definitely been something that&#8217;s far more developed in Europe than it has been in the United States. That&#8217;s just a reflection of the market and how we view the utility of design here at organizations.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Hearing the service design methods and methodologies, that was very interesting to me, and I was ready to go to SCAD. But also, another friend of mine who I was in undergrad with had mentioned ArtCenter to me before, and I really liked the rigor that ArtCenter placed on developing your technical skills and the level of polish that a lot of the portfolios and a lot of the students had the capacity for after graduating from ArtCenter. And then also, ArtCenter had this program with the Drucker School of Management where the graduate industrial design program also could be a dual MBA degree.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Once I got there, I didn&#8217;t see the usefulness not necessarily in an MBA because I did take MBA classes at UCLA. I do see a benefit in that, but I didn&#8217;t see the benefit for that particular school that ArtCenter was partnering with. So I didn&#8217;t actually go forward with that, though it was a decision that I made to go to ArtCenter in the first place because that option was available.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
While you were there, you also managed to work on an internship which let you transition into product design, right?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I did a couple of internships there. The education, too, in grad ID, the name can be misleading because it&#8217;s industrial design. But really a lot of the training was for us to be innovation leaders, to be able to come in and really understand what the business needs are for a company and help them pivot into creating products and services that now are able to accommodate the changing landscape. So we would routinely have different companies come in. This is part of the ArtCenter education where different companies come in and do these studio projects.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
We did one with Uber whenever I was in maybe my fourth semester or something like that, where Uber was creating their Uber Air platform. We worked in groups with other students from other departments. So we had transportation designers, automotive designers, as well as interaction designers, in addition to us in graduate industrial design and worked with some of the key executives for that particular unit doing the Uber Air. Our task was really to design what that whole experience would be if we were to create air taxis.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
If Uber were to go into this business, how do we start to visualize what that whole experience would be, all the way from understanding what the airport security type situation would be to what is the interior of the electric vertical landing takeoff vehicle going to be, all the way to really understanding the market. So if you create this type of service, well, who are going to be the people to use this service and who are going to be the early adopters all the way down to the late adopters in order to get this service off of the ground?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So it was a pretty involved project that took a whole semester where we built life-sized mock-ups to test out what the interior of the vehicle could be and could look like. We did a lot of architectural design and sketches to understand where would we create and put some of these what we call sky ports, which would be the airports for people to access these vehicles, designing also how would we implement or integrate this into the existing application, so if somebody wanted to catch an Uber Air vehicle. So it was a pretty involved project that spanned the scope of a bunch of different design skills from automotive design to interaction design to industrial design and whatnot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Kind of sounds like a air taxi, in a way.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Exactly. It was an air taxi. There&#8217;s so many different nuances in terms of what that whole experience could or would be. And also, there are limitations to the technology that existed at the time, still even to right now. A lot of that technology is still being developed in a way that could make it really feasible and economical to launch a service like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I would imagine also even just getting FAA certification because, unlike something like UberX where anyone that has a driver&#8217;s license can drive, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean anyone with a pilot&#8217;s license, I would imagine, would do Uber Air or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. There&#8217;s definitely some technical and some licensing, piloting things there, especially, also, I mean you&#8217;re thinking about just air traffic control as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, that&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I mean that&#8217;s been there for a while. There&#8217;d be some adjustments and things that would need to be made in order to allow for another set of vehicles to be in the air.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So after you graduated from ArtCenter College of Design for grad school, you ended up working at a couple of other places before Netflix. You worked at a biotech company called Script Health. So you, I guess, in a way managed to get around to doing some work in the medical field, even in this sort of roundabout way. But then you also worked at IBM working on products on their data, AI, and cloud integration teams. When you look back at those two experiences specifically, what do you remember the most?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It was interesting because with Script Health, one of my friends who&#8217;s a pharmacist, that was his startup that he was creating. I was actually working on that while I was in grad school and helping him really design and bring to life the vision of that product and that service that he was trying to create. So I won&#8217;t go too deep into it, but the gist of that really was building out a service to deal with the opioid epidemic and providing the right type of medication for overdoses, things like naloxone, to places in rural communities.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a huge lack of access to the right types of drugs and services in the most marginalized communities or the most affected communities. And then that learning, kind of taking a product from zero to one, the amount of work and effort that it takes to do the research and then finding a market fit, pivots and things that need to happen, partnerships that need to be made and created, and then visualizing the concept and telling the story and the narrative in a way that is going to inspire and communicate what it is about.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That was also a crash course for me, really working with engineers as well as working with outside agencies that were taking my design work and starting to code it into something and really understanding what are the specific things that I need to communicate in order to make sure that what I do design ends up being the thing that gets created and it not being some kind of mangled version of that because there are details that I left out or things that I didn&#8217;t communicate that they just had to make a decision on, and it may not be the right decision.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
When it comes to IBM, the thing that I learned at IBM really was a lot of stakeholder management and also a lot of leadership skills, what it means to manage up, as well as how to align people and influence people around a shared objective and a shared goal and then trying to get things done within a short period of time. I feel like those were some of the key things. I mean I can dive really deep into aspects of that, but I think those were the main things that I&#8217;ve learned.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Working with people, I think, is an incredibly important part of being a designer, and understanding how to do that effectively, I think, is something that it takes a lot of designers a lot of time to really understand what it actually means to do that beyond just your hard technical skills.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, another thing that you sort of created that came about while you were at ArtCenter was Critical Discourse in Design. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. That happened while I was at IBM. So this was after my graduate program. I still have a lot of really great connections with a lot of the faculty at ArtCenter. After the murder of George Floyd, there was just a lot of energy around something needs to be done. I&#8217;m in the design community. Think about racism. When we think about prejudice, when we think about all of the things, these institutions that are perpetuating these things, they are designed institutions. They&#8217;re created.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
For me, in addition to, okay, well, protesting is one thing. But based off of my own skillsets and my own proximity to the type of work and things that I do, how can I start to impact or influence the change that I want to see in the world? So I started these conversations with some of my friends who are still faculty at ArtCenter to try to uncover what is something that we can do. We didn&#8217;t really have an idea of what it was going to be.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
But through the conversations and through a lot of the things that I was talking about in terms of how &#8230; A quote that I constantly say is that, &#8220;Design is the invisible hand that shapes all lived experience.&#8221; So Critical Discourse in Design came about when we started really thinking about when you think about oppression, oppression needs physical tools and objects. It needs a physical space. It needs to be designed.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So when you think about you can go throughout history and you can look at what are the tools or the innovations of oppression? A noose, a prison cell, all of these different things. So if you can design for oppression, then you can design for liberation. Critical Discourse in Design came about like, &#8220;Well, what does that conversation of designing for liberation, what does that actually mean? How do we start to translate theory into action? And then who are the voices that we need to bring to the table in order to be able to have these conversations?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Because when you think about the design industry, also where the Black designers is calling out is the 3% or 4%, depending on who you ask, of the people who are designers are Black. So the voices that are the most impacted by the things that are being created in the world are not at the table to voice how they feel things should be. They&#8217;re not able to provide their cultural intelligence to the institutions and the systems and the tools and the things that get created in the world.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So Critical Discourse in Design really was a response to that. It was really a response to how do we start to now bring in these voices and also to leave people not with just new words and new theories, but a theory that can turn into practice and really starting to understand what the connection between pedagogy, what people are learning, is with practice, how people create, how people experience and actually deliver things into the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, let&#8217;s talk about Design to Divest, which it sounds like came out of Critical Discourse in Design. Tell me about that. I know you&#8217;re one of the founding members of this collective. We&#8217;ve also had another member of the collective on the show before, Michael Collett. But yeah. Talk to me about Design to Divest.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. While I was actually creating Critical Discourse in Design, one of my really close friends who was working with part of Design to Divest messaged me and said, &#8220;Hey, do you have some capacity to join the steering committee here? This is what we&#8217;re doing.&#8221; So I joined Design to Divest. At the time, it was really meant to mobilize design skills and different designers, to mobilize those design skills around social impact projects. It was very like graphic design-based.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So I think part of what I was doing whenever I joined the team was really thinking about what Design to Divest actually meant as a concept, and what are the most impactful ways that we can create positive change or the change that we want to see in the world? That started over the past two years that we&#8217;ve been just having these discussions and doing projects and working on things to manifest into a version of what it is today, where we have a lot of things that we&#8217;re going to be releasing this year, hopefully, and that really talks about what it means to divest the inequitable systems that have been designed and created in the world. How do we start to celebrate and design for the communities on the margins?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean I think that came about at such a monumental time, during the summer that you mentioned where, of course, there were people out in the streets that were protesting against police brutality. You talked about the murder of George Floyd. Again, it seems like this was a time when a lot of people were really looking for this kind of thing. They were looking to hear from Black voices, but also just looking for ways that they can, I guess, channel whatever frustrations they had into something more positive.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. Not to say that that time still isn&#8217;t happening now, but [crosstalk 00:45:33]-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah. We&#8217;re still in it very much. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
We&#8217;re very much in it, but it was reaching fever pitches. It wasn&#8217;t just in the United States, it was globally. Me being Nigerian and seeing with SARS and the protests that were happening in Nigeria, the protests that were happening in South America, things happening in Brazil, it was everywhere, where you started to see people were really fed up with the institutions and the things that were meant to serve them. But people were just like, &#8220;Nothing is actually serving any of us, and nothing is serving us in a way that&#8217;s going to provide any level of comfort or any level of support. It&#8217;s actually doing the opposite.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So I think Design to Divest became, especially for designers, because I think so many designers get into design feeling that they can change something or that there&#8217;s some sense of positivity that they can use design to affect, but no one ever tells them how. And then it typically falls flat with very altruistic ideas that really don&#8217;t connect back to impact. It just connects back to some sense of moral I don&#8217;t want to say superiority, but just a sense of moral reflection that you did a project that did something, but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily connect back to impact.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I think with the idea of Design to Divest, we really want to give people a path to connect the things that they do to the impact that they want to see in the world, the impact that they want to see in institutions, and the impact that they want to see in the different products and tools and experiences that we experience in the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, speaking of that impact, given now that the collective has gone on now, what? I guess this will be your second year of going into things?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you want to see Design to Divest accomplish?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Quite a lot over time. But I think about education is a really core thing in terms of &#8230; One of the things that we&#8217;ve identified, too, is that there&#8217;s so many designers on the margins, designers of color, but particularly Black and indigenous designers who don&#8217;t have access to any type of content or education that teaches design in a way that validates their culture, in a way that validates their identity, in a way that celebrates the cultural intelligence of their heritage towards the creation of the things that exist in the world.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
When you look at design, the canon of literature and text that&#8217;s being taught to designers all are from European white men, and so there&#8217;s always a cultural disconnect. Essentially, what it does is informs people getting into design that you need to either erase your culture and assimilate into this culture if you want to find success in this profession because your culture is devalued or isn&#8217;t valued as a producer of good design, if you call something good design.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So part of what my hopes for Design to Divest is to really provide that platform, on one hand, for Black and indigenous designers to be able to have content and community to engage with around design that validates their identity, that validates their cultural heritage, and then that brings them to the table of creation. I feel like the world is a group project and, typically, only a select group of communities and culture have gotten to participate in creating the institutions, organizations, and business that shape the lived experiences for all of us.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s time that we create this space of ownership. I think this is what equity means, ownership and creation, and stop blocking these communities that are on the margins, Black, indigenous communities from participating in the creation and the stewardship of the world. I think that I want Design to Divest to be that platform that allows Black and indigenous communities to harness their ability to design through their own cultural intelligence, to create and populate the institutions and things in the world that are going to serve our communities.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the people that inspire you?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a tough question because I&#8217;m typically just inspired by people, in general. I&#8217;m inspired by culture, in general. Obviously, I&#8217;m inspired by my family, by my parents, aunts, and uncles, especially coming from Nigeria, making a way for themselves as expats into the United States and balancing multiple cultures. I&#8217;m also inspired by other designers, other creators, but also other people in other professions. I constantly draw inspiration from economists, from lawyers, from doctors in the way that they approach the work that they do.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I can say, as of late, too, I&#8217;ve been inspired by people like Andr√© Leon Talley and Virgil, who both passed, but seeing the impact that they&#8217;ve had. You can see that by the outpouring of support and the outpouring of responses that people have to their passing. To have that level of impact on community, I think, is also something that&#8217;s incredibly inspiring to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to somebody that is looking to enter into the design field? Because it sounds like, with your career, you&#8217;ve managed to really take that and apply it across a number of different facets of design and, even now, you&#8217;re still kind of paying that forward with the work you&#8217;re doing in Netflix, but also with this community work through Design to Divest. So if someone&#8217;s listening to this and this is inspiring them to want to get into design in some sort of way, what would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I mean one of the most important things, as a designer, is to be curious. I think that one thing that I would tell people is you just kind of have to do it. There&#8217;s so many people who are going to have something to say about whatever it is that you do. It&#8217;s also kind of that&#8217;s the idea of design is that whenever you design, there&#8217;s a difference between art and design in a sense, whereas design is really not meant for yourself. Design is outward. It&#8217;s meant to be critiqued by the people that you&#8217;ve created it for. So you can&#8217;t wait for perfection.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I think I would tell people that they have to just go out and do it. But another one of the most important things, too, is that design is a very community-driven profession. I think that it&#8217;s not done in isolation. I think that that&#8217;s in contrast to the way that we were taught about design. We were always taught about these individual people who are design heroes, whether it&#8217;s Dieter Rams or Frank Gehry or whatever. They&#8217;re not doing these things alone as individual people. They have a network of people. They&#8217;re talking to people.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
They are influenced by people, and they are finding different people who is inspiring to them to communicate with and also build with. So one of the most important things is to constantly seek out the people who are doing things that you find interesting and try to have a conversation with them and try to build your own communities, because that&#8217;s going to be the path forward for you finding the opportunities to design the things that you want to design, to create the things that you want to create and with the people that you want to create.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
And then lastly, too, I would also say is that you really want to start from a place of purpose. So if you don&#8217;t really have a purpose yet or you haven&#8217;t identified what that is, definitely just take some time to think about it. As everything, it could be an iteration. Your purpose whenever you were 16 could be different when you&#8217;re 24 or 50. But having a sense of purpose and principles to back that purpose then allow you to make decisions a lot easier. It gives you something to filter the opportunities that come your way with something that means something more to you than just existing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work would you like to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I&#8217;m doing a lot of the work that I want to be doing in combination with Design to Divest and some of the freelance projects that I&#8217;ve been working on as well. But I think more of that work, more of the work that I&#8217;m doing with Design to Divest, more of the creating the platforms, creating archives and things who are Black and indigenous designers to be able to participate in the creation of the world. Also, I mean I do quite a lot of mentorship.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So I&#8217;d love to be able to build careers and create more pathways for designers from other marginalized communities, including Black communities and other marginalized communities to have a pathway to create. So I see within the next five years, continuing to grow and scale the impact that I&#8217;m able to have on the design community from both a pedagogical, educational standpoint as well as a practice and people standpoint.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So when I think about the practice, it&#8217;s really illustrating to both the business and design world that you want to be able to take &#8230; What it really means to be diverse and to harness diversity for innovation is being able to take the different cultural knowledge systems that exist, where there&#8217;s the aboriginal system of knowledge, the African system of knowledge, and being able to apply that to the problems that you&#8217;re facing as a society or in your particular company, reframing the problem underneath those systems of knowledge, and then allowing those systems of knowledge to be able to deliver on solutions for you.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So doing work that allows me to bring more of those different systems of knowledge and those different diverse perspectives into the creation of things, and then on the people side of just continuing to bring more of those people who are holders of that knowledge, the descendants of African people from different African cultures who hold that knowledge or indigenous people, Native people, and providing a platform for them to use that knowledge that&#8217;s been passed down to them to design and create things that make the world a better place.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and your work and all your projects and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I try to not be so visible online all the time. They can find me on my Instagram, Azeez_Alli. In the near future, we&#8217;ll be releasing a new website for Design to Divest where they can check out some of that work that I&#8217;m doing. If anyone wants to chat with me or anything like that, they can always shoot me a message on LinkedIn. I definitely try to respond to people who reach out to me and might not be immediate, but definitely something that I&#8217;m open to chatting more and more with people who resonate with some of the things that I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Azeez Alli, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show, one, of course, for telling your story about how you got into design. But I think it&#8217;s really important, especially now, as a lot of people are really looking at the work they do and try to figure out how it can make an impact in the world, I think the way that you&#8217;re taking your design knowledge and, one, how you&#8217;ve been able to apply it to different parts of design, but then, two, also using it in a way to pay it forward to the community is something that is super important.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hope that we get to see a lot more of that in the future. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. Thank you so much for having me.</p>

<p>Dantley Davis has been a mainstay in the Silicon Valley tech and design community for almost 20 years. His work at PayPal, SAP, Yahoo!, Netflix, and Facebook have all led him to his current role as VP of design and research for one of the most well-known websites in the world ‚Äî Twitter. So as you can imagine, I had <em>a lot</em> of questions to ask him, and Dantley was gracious enough to give some insight into what he does and on his perspective of the current tech and design industries.</p>
<p>Our wide-ranging conversation touched on a number of topics, but first, Dantley talked a bit about the behind-the-scenes work that goes on at Twitter, including the team he leads, diversity and inclusion efforts, how decisions are made at Twitter (such as their latest redesign), and yes&#8230;even Black Twitter. Dantley also shared his story of growing up as a military brat, learning to code and landing in San Francisco during the Browser Wars, and spoke on how he stays authentic to himself after being in Silicon Valley for decades. Dantley Davis is a true design leader, and even if you haven&#8217;t heard of him before this week&#8217;s interview, chances are that you have experienced his work in some small way. He is truly a pioneer in this digital age!</p>

<p>Netflix is a major player in the entertainment industry, and their streaming video service is available nearly worldwide on smart TVs, game consoles, mobile phones, and more. But how do they provide such a consistent visual experience to millions of customers? It&#8217;s thanks to people like Netflix&#8217;s senior UI engineer, Rich Smith. As a member of the marketing tech team, he focuses on the web app experience.</p>
<p>Rich explained his process behind designing at Netflix, and talked about what drew him to work there after moving out to the Bay Area. Rich also shared a tale about his journey from design to software engineering, mentioned what first got him interested in tech, and talked about his mentoring and volunteer work with¬†<a href="https://www.devcolor.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">/dev/color</a>. Rich&#8217;s story is proof that even when you&#8217;re stuck, something as simple as a change in perspective can help empower you to move forward.</p>
