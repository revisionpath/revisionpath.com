Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>I first learned about Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton way back in 2015 when I interviewed <a href="/silas-munro/" data-wpel-link="internal">Silas Munro</a>. Since then, Tasheka has gone on to become one of the leading voices behind discovering Black people omitted from the graphic design history canon. Even design legend <a href="/dr-cheryl-d-miller/" data-wpel-link="internal">Dr. Cheryl D. Miller</a> has sung her praises, so I knew I had to sit down with Tasheka and learn more about her remarkable journey.</p>
<p>Tasheka spoke to me about her experience as an educator and researcher, including an examination of her teaching philosophy. She also talked about growing up in New Orleans, her shift into design, working for the Navy Reservists, and even starting her own studio, <a href="https://blacvoicedesign.myportfolio.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Blacvoice Design</a>. Lastly, she discussed her upcoming book <em>Black Design in America</em>, and shared how the different aspects of her work keep her motivated and inspired. </p>
<p>If there&#8217;s any lesson you learn from Tasheka, it should be this one: you have control over your own path as a designer, so work hard and you can make your dreams come true!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Hi, and first, I want to say Maurice, thanks for having me here on Revision Path. I&#8217;ve been a listener for a long time now, so I feel really grateful and honored to be here. My name is Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton. I&#8217;m a designer, design educator. I run a design studio called Blacvoice. I also am a researcher, I guess, or design historian in regards to Black designers, as well as design writer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has this year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Very busy, but good for the most part. It&#8217;s been a really, really good year with lots of new projects on the horizon. Exciting and exhausting, all at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Any plans for the summer?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes, family vacation is one of the plans. I will be attending Typographics, and I&#8217;ll be a speaker there. So it&#8217;s exciting because I&#8217;ve never been to the conference before, and it&#8217;s kind of strange to have that my first attendance there would be me actually giving a talk, so I&#8217;m excited about that. I&#8217;m going to be teaching, I guess, this summer. I don&#8217;t normally teach in the summer, but I&#8217;m co-running a design residency program at the University of Texas, Austin where I teach. So I&#8217;m looking forward to that as well. And I have a couple of writing projects that I&#8217;ll be working on over the summer, and some design stuff as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Sounds like you&#8217;re going to have a busy summer ahead.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, speaking of teaching, you are teaching at two universities right now. You&#8217;re at Vermont College of Fine Arts, and you&#8217;re at the University of Texas at Austin, which is pretty new. You&#8217;ve been at VCFA what, for 10, 11 years now?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s been 10 years in April. 10 years. I started there in 2013.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
It&#8217;s kind of crazy to think that I&#8217;ve been there that long, actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What has the experience been like there?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Wow. The experience at VCFA has been truly amazing and transformative, and I think a lot of it has to do with the amazing faculty that&#8217;s there, that I teach with, who are not only colleagues but longtime friends now. It has to do with the sort of non-traditional structure of the program. We don&#8217;t have any classes or any courses. The program is, if you think about it as a two-year-long independent study, basically it&#8217;s a self-directed program where students decide on what they want to study and what they&#8217;re interested in. And the faculty is there basically, to sort of guide them and offer them resources, but it&#8217;s a self-directed program.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, that&#8217;s really interesting. No classes or courses?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you don&#8217;t have to put any curriculum together. That&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
No. So yeah, it&#8217;s definitely a different experience. So you do work with the students during the residency to come up with a semester plan on what they&#8217;re going to be working on throughout the semester. So as a faculty, you are there to help guide them and shape that semester plan. But again, it starts with what they&#8217;re interested in. We meet once a month. Students send their work via email, and then we have an hour conversation through, usually Zoom, and to talk about the work and sort of reflect on it, and kind of give feedback on how to move forward over the next month.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love how sort of open that is, especially I think during this time when I know we&#8217;re not out of the pandemic, but certainly, I think it&#8217;s still a time where some schools are trying hybrid models or things. That sounds like the way that it&#8217;s set up at VCFA, it allows you to really still be able to learn in that type of environment.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes. I think the one thing that at the core of the program is, first of all, it&#8217;s really tailored to, working professionals are people. You don&#8217;t have to quit your job for two years to get an MFA. You can still work or run your business, or whatever it is you&#8217;re doing and still go to school. And this is something that we&#8217;ve been doing prior to the pandemic.</p>
<p>So when the pandemic happened, not saying that it didn&#8217;t change the program and how we teach, but we were already sort of interfacing in that way. So the only thing it stopped was having the week long residencies that we would have twice a year in person. Then that programming got moved to Zoom. But as far as the interaction between the student and the teacher, or we say the student and the advisor, that was already happening.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now one of the professors that&#8217;s also there, we&#8217;ve had on the show. Oh God, that was a long time ago. We had Silas Munro on the show. This was I think, episode 85, 86, something like that. But he&#8217;s also a professor there, I believe.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah. So Silas, so you brought Silas up. Silas is one of the reasons, that&#8217;s how I ended up at VCFA actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
He&#8217;s one of the founding members of the program and Silas and I, we overlap by a year at CalArts. And so yeah, when the program was starting up, he sent me an email and asked me to join the faculty. And I wasn&#8217;t able to join at the time because of obligations with teaching. But then the following semester in April of 2013, I was able to come on board as a visiting, as a guest. Sort of a preliminary or, I wouldn&#8217;t say probationary period, but just to test to see if it would work out for me and if it would work out for the program.</p>
<p>So yeah, I credit Silas to bringing me in to a community in the program that&#8217;s, like I said, it&#8217;s been really transformative. Especially, the sort of approach to design pedagogy, this openness and not having this one idea of what design is. That sort of shift and change and marks according to the students, and the type of work that they&#8217;re interested in, and the type of diversity and the faculty and what we study and research, and type of work we&#8217;re engaged in. So that&#8217;s the thing that I really like, and it&#8217;s probably one of the few places that I&#8217;ve worked where I really felt a sense of family with my coworkers. Not that I didn&#8217;t have that relationship with other places, but there it&#8217;s really genuine. It&#8217;s not forced, it&#8217;s not fake. We actually truly do like and love each other.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, first of all, props to Silas for bringing you in, but it sounds like it is a great environment because you&#8217;ve been there for 10 years. Nobody&#8217;s going to stay there for 10 years if it&#8217;s not good.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, no, that&#8217;s true. Actually, you saying it, it&#8217;s technically the longest job I&#8217;ve ever had.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
When I think about it, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;re also teaching at University of Texas at Austin, which is fairly new. Tell me more about that. How&#8217;s that experience?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Wow, it&#8217;s been great, to be honest. I haven&#8217;t been there that long. I just moved to Austin, so I&#8217;m new to Austin and I&#8217;m new to UT. It&#8217;s been a really good experience as far as working in an environment with, I guess kind of similar to VCFA, where you don&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s this sort of one way that the faculty or the program is trying to teach design. It&#8217;s a little bit more flexible, it&#8217;s a little bit more nuanced where students get to dabble in a lot of different areas of design. Graphic design, industrial design, interactive design, design history, product design. So it&#8217;s really sort of flexible in that way and that&#8217;s one of the things that sort of drawed me in into UT.</p>
<p>The program itself was revamped around 2017, 2018. So the program as it is today, design, it&#8217;s the Department of Design and Creative Technology, is fairly new in a sense compared to a lot of other programs that are out there. So I think there&#8217;s something about that sort of newness. There&#8217;s a lot of vulnerability and a lot of questioning about the direction of the program. So it&#8217;s kind of exciting to be somewhere where we&#8217;re constantly thinking about ways to evolve and improve the experience for the students.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What is your teaching philosophy? I would imagine, between the work you&#8217;ve done at VCFA and are currently doing, and now with teaching at UT. And you&#8217;ve taught at some other places as well. What&#8217;s your overall teaching philosophy?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Well, one is, I try to approach teaching, one of the things that probably on the first day of class, I let my students know that, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m interested. I&#8217;m more interested in what you&#8217;re interested in learning, and what you&#8217;re interested in general out there in the world.&#8221; Not that I don&#8217;t have anything to impart or to give to them, but it&#8217;s less about me walking into the classroom saying, &#8220;Hey, listen up, I&#8217;m the expert here. You all need to learn what I have to offer.&#8221; Obviously, there is an important exchange that&#8217;s sort of happening, but I&#8217;m not interested in the hierarchies that traditionally plagues, I think, academia. So that&#8217;s the first thing is, to let my students know, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m curious about you, who you are as a person, and what you&#8217;re interested in.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other part of my teaching philosophy is, so how do I nurture that? How do I give them assignments, and give them projects and things to learn, to help nurture those interests? So often, I give projects and things that are about to help students investigate their community, and their environment and their identity. I think it&#8217;s really important for students to feel a connection to the project brief, to what they&#8217;re working on. And to figure out how to sort of channel their life&#8217;s experiences, as well as who they are into their projects. There are some practical exercises that are given to topography to talk about kerning and leading and that kind of stuff. But the start of bigger projects, I really try to figure out how to give assignments to help them sort of explore who they are in their environment and their community. Also, really, I think it&#8217;s important, one of my other goals is to make sure that I&#8217;m giving them projects or I&#8217;m giving them things to read and write about, and to consider about what&#8217;s going on in the world.</p>
<p>I like having discussions and I don&#8217;t shy away from, I won&#8217;t say controversial conversations, but I don&#8217;t like to shy away from, there&#8217;s always a group of students that have a certain perspective about another thing, and then you might have another group that have a different perspective. So I like having those type of conversations so we can learn from each other, because too many times that we all are always listening to and engaging in conversation with people who have the same perspective as we do. So, I always often give reading assignments, or articles or essays, or just come up with topics or things that might make some of them feel uncomfortable sometimes, where they have to talk about things that they don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;s going to be received by their classmates. And also, try to give them a sort of sense of agency and responsibility when it comes to their own learning, and not just take everything at face value to question, even question me, right? But obviously with the mutual respect, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d love to hear an example of something you would cover in class with your students.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Sometimes, it&#8217;s as simple as, I think this project isn&#8217;t something kind of, out of the park, but giving them &#8230; One time I had students design sort of protest signage. So they could approach it with whatever topic, anything that they felt really strongly about. Some people feels really strongly about, you should have solar panels on your house. Some people still feel really strongly about abortion, which sometimes for me, some of these topics that are still surfacing are kind of surprising. And some people feel strongly about police rights and things like that.</p>
<p>So any type of way I can give them some kind of assignment that addresses these issues, usually I try to get them to think about stuff that&#8217;s relevant in the media. Things that people are on opposite sides or sort of butting heads about, just to see, how do you handle that in the design context? Even, how do you handle as a designer having conversations about, &#8220;Well, if you have a very specific social or political agenda, what does it means to do design? Or could you do design for somebody to have a different perspective than you do?&#8221; So those type of conversations I think, are important to have.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I totally think that&#8217;s important because at any point throughout your design career, you&#8217;re going to encounter some conflict. I mean, I think we know the goal is to try to not have this sort of conflicts with clients or prospective clients or anything like that, but it&#8217;s going to happen. I mean sometimes you&#8217;ll have a client, you think they&#8217;re one way, and then you start working with them and it&#8217;s completely different. And even as you&#8217;ve said about personal views and such like that, it can get really tricky because the world is not just, I mean, not to use this as a racial thing, but it&#8217;s not a black and white place. There&#8217;s all sorts of ambiguity and things in there. So the fact that you&#8217;re able to work out those scenarios and issues with students in a learning environment is really important, because then they don&#8217;t get out there in the real world and have greater consequences for those sorts of scenarios.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah. So that&#8217;s one of the reasons why I do it, because I feel like if we can&#8217;t have these open discussions and conversation and academic space, then what&#8217;s the point of education or school in that environment? At least, that&#8217;s how I look at it.</p>
<p>Another project that I did when I was working at NC State last year was, I tasked my students with doing some design research in their hometown. So if they were from Charlotte, if they were from, I don&#8217;t know, somewhere in Germany, it didn&#8217;t really matter where they were from, but they had to do research about design in their particular community, where they were from. It was up to them if they wanted to pick where they live presently or somewhere where they were raised. And I gave them some sort of guidelines or places to start, I would say, because obviously if you said, &#8220;Okay, go research Charlotte, they may not know where to start.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I gave them four different areas to start. So I said, &#8220;Hey, why don&#8217;t you research the educational institutions, find out what schools offer design programs and research their faculty to see who&#8217;s working there? What type of design work or research that they do? Research the history publications in your particular area,&#8221; because I think newspapers and those type of print media is a good place to find the history of a place, sort of like the pulse, right? Design studios, talk to people there, make a list of all the ones that exist, maybe find out information about ones that used to exist. And I think the last place was printers. If they&#8217;re like print shops, go talk to those people. So those were the different areas as far as starting points that I gave them to start their research.</p>
<p>And then they had to interview people to help fill in the gaps of trying to create that sort of storyline. Because part of what they had to actually design was some kind of information design, but this wasn&#8217;t about charts and graphs. It was more like a storytelling or narrative sort of based research project, if you will. And then it was all the data, information was sort of collected in this zine that each student sort of designed together, and got it professionally printed at the end of the semester.</p>
<p>And I think it was a really good project. They learned a lot about design from where they were from, that they didn&#8217;t know, that they probably wouldn&#8217;t have even thought about if they didn&#8217;t have this project. And they learned something about themselves. I think for some of them, it was confidence boost. If you&#8217;re from somewhere or you come from an area where maybe design isn&#8217;t talked about or there are not a lot of people you see in design that look like you, and I think this project sort of helped them do some research and some discovery in those areas.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, what do you learn from your students? I mean, you mentioned earlier that you tell them at the beginning of the courses that you&#8217;re interested in learning from them. What kind of things do you learn?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I learn a lot from them. I think I can admit as a seasoned educator professional, but sometimes I go into the classroom with certain types of assumptions or misconceptions. So a lots of times, I might have assumptions what I think they might be interested in or what they should be. But then I learn actually, what they&#8217;re actually more interested in, and that sort of shifts and change sometimes. So for instance, a lot of students, now what I&#8217;m seeing, maybe something that&#8217;s trending because of technology is that, this sort of longing for tactile things, this longing to create and print things. Lots of times I think that students wouldn&#8217;t be interested in learning about letterpress, or screen printing or these sort of, or electroset. Electroset is something I love, doing electroset exercises with my students. And I really enjoy being able to talk to them about the history behind these all ways of printing.</p>
<p>But I find they&#8217;re really interested in these things. And I mean, you do have some that are like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m really more comfortable in a digital space, and that&#8217;s fine.&#8221; Again, I&#8217;m not there to try to not nurture what their interests are. But, I feel like I&#8217;m also there for to say, &#8220;Hey, look over here. There are these other ways of making and approaching design that sort of outside of maybe what you think you should be doing.&#8221; Or lots of times, I feel what I have learned is there are very specific things that sometimes students think, &#8220;Okay, design should be this way or look this way.&#8221; And a lot of it has to do with the tools that they&#8217;re using, because everybody&#8217;s using Adobe Sweden, everybody&#8217;s using Illustrator or whatever. And I try to tell them, &#8220;Well, if we&#8217;re all using the same tools, then everything starts to look the same. But why not take your ideas, and have your ideas and the content have to dictate what type of tool you use.&#8221;</p>
<p>So a lot of times I learn a lot that I shouldn&#8217;t make assumptions, about technology or different ways in which how they&#8217;re interested in making, or what they actually want to make. Sometimes I assume, &#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re probably interested in developing an app,&#8221; and they do have those type of interests, or they&#8217;re interested in AI. But then I find so many of them when it comes to technology, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t even want to touch that stuff over there. I want to get my hands dirty.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That is so fascinating to hear that students want to do kind of tactile things. I do a lot of different types of judging throughout the year. I&#8217;ll judge design competitions. I look at portfolios and things like that from students. And I have started to see more actual tactile work books, or pamphlets or zines or something like that. It&#8217;s such a stark contrast to 20 years ago. Now, I didn&#8217;t go to design school, but I knew people that were in design school at the time that I was also in school and everybody wanted a piece of digital. I guess it&#8217;s because it was just coming about at that time. I mean, when I went to college, there were computers. I remember vividly wanting to, I majored in computer science, computer engineering, and then switching my major over to math. Because I told my advisor I wanted to learn web design, and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s a fad. No one&#8217;s going to be into that sort of stuff.&#8221; And the school that I went to didn&#8217;t have an arts program, didn&#8217;t have a design program, so I just switched over to math.</p>
<p>But I knew people that were at the Atlanta College of Art, which existed back then, and the Art Institute of Atlanta. And everybody was just clamoring to try to do something with digital because they were tired of print. They were tired of, I guess, I don&#8217;t want to say they were doing maybe more traditional things like electroset or things like that. But everybody wanted to get in on the newness. And now, 20 years from then when technology is everywhere, now students want to get tactile, they want to make stuff. Yeah, I think that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>

Yeah, I think the thing that I have to keep in mind is that the way they&#8217;re growing up and how they&#8217;re entering these spaces in this world is very different from how I entered it, where I was there prior to computers and then post. Not that, to be honest, I don&#8217;t have the pay stop experience. I mean, I was in school at the advent of, Adobe was already there, Photoshop was already there. The Mac computer was already there in the early two thousands. So I was sort of a little bit post the desktop publishing area. But I think the thing that I forget is that, well, they&#8217;re so consumed, this is all they know. So for them they need a break. They are exhausted from the screen is what they tell me. So they&#8217;re kind of exhausted from it. And so when you show these other analog processes, they really light up. It&#8217;s really nice and encouraging to see that they still have these interests.</p>
<p>But again, there are some that are really interested in the technology. A lot of them are interested in the 3D sort of space and the digital space, but also the physical space. There are sort of a range. But I think that&#8217;s what I learn. The more I teach, the more I learn about what the sort of dynamics to what they&#8217;re interested in. And they have various interests and it&#8217;s not good to even put them into a box and assume what they&#8217;re interested in because, it&#8217;s a lot of different things that are out there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I love that. I love that. Students are tired of screens. I&#8217;m loving hearing that. Now, let&#8217;s learn more about you. Let&#8217;s hear your origin story. You&#8217;re originally from New Orleans. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me about what it was growing up there.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, I grew up in the inner city, not on the outskirts. I grew up in New Orleans, we sort of identified with the wards, which are actually voting wards. So I grew up in the seven ward, New Orleans, which the time that I grew up was predominantly Black or all Black maybe, don&#8217;t know the statistics on that, but a very urban inner city. Grew up poor, single mom, family. I&#8217;m the oldest of four siblings. Had a good childhood. I remember going outside and play, making games up as we go, just started using resources and things that we had around to play different sports, so to do different things. My mom was always really supportive in whatever it was I wanted to do. So when I was younger, I wanted to go to law school. Actually, I wanted to be an attorney. And so, I actually approached going to college, thinking that I was going to go to law school and practice law, actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow. What interested you about law?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
To be honest, Maurice, it was, the part of it that was probably really superficial, meaning I watched a lot of court shows growing up, and I got sucked into the drama of the investigations. And this aha moment when the real person, suspect was revealed. And the banter in the court and the back and forth between the attorneys, all the drama. So that seemed exciting because I always felt like, I&#8217;ve always had a strong voice, I guess, and a strong personality and perspective in that way. I can be very argumentative about things that I&#8217;m super passionate about. So I just thought I would be a good attorney. Why not? I was a good student, usually brought home good grades. So yeah, I could do this law school thing, and I can go to law school and do that.</p>
<p>The other side of it is, I also saw law as something that oppressed us as a people for a long time, and I wanted to understand it better to help us. So that was the sort of flip side of my interest in going to law school. But yeah, that faded when I actually, I mean I was really, up until my last year in college, I was still pursuing going to law school, to be honest.</p>
<p>Now, I was at Loyola, I was an English writing major. And the reason I picked that major was because I was told &#8230; I can&#8217;t remember if it was a job fair or a college fair when I was in high school and somebody said, &#8220;Oh, people who do really well in law school, they major in English because of all the writing and research you have to do,&#8221; whatever. So that&#8217;s really how that came about. And I did a lot of reading growing up. So the idea of having to read and write was kind of made sense, something I was sort of interested in. So yeah, that&#8217;s how that came about was because I wanted to be a good law student, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you had been on this path, I mean, to the point where you went to school, you were studying in it, you were getting all the way up to your senior year. Was there a deciding incident that kind of changed your trajectory?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
The incident was preparing to take the LSAT, I would say. So it was more like a process. So I want to say the first semester of my senior year, I was preparing to take the LSAT, researching what schools to go to. And all of that became extremely overwhelming and stressful, but it wasn&#8217;t exciting in a way, how things could be really overwhelming, but you&#8217;re still sort of excited about it, and if it&#8217;s you&#8217;re anxious. And so then I did some soul-searching and it was like, &#8220;Well, why do you want to do this Tasheka? Why do you want to go to law school?&#8221; And so, one of the things that is at the time it was really hard for me to admit, was that I honestly didn&#8217;t think I was good at anything, or I didn&#8217;t know what I was really good at. So because I was always sort of a good student, I just kind of looked at it as that way. I can go to law school, I&#8217;m going to be a good student, and then I&#8217;ll get a decent job.</p>
<p>I have always been a very goal driven oriented person. And so for me, it was always just sort of scratching things off the list. So go to school, major in English writing, do well, go to law school, take the LSAT, get a high grade, study. It&#8217;s just this constant thing. But when I actually really looked within, I realized that, well, I didn&#8217;t want to do it for the right reasons. You shouldn&#8217;t choose a career path just because it&#8217;s sort of checking off the list. I can accomplish this thing, but it&#8217;s not something that, I mean, I had a genuine interest in the law, but when I look back, yeah, it definitely wasn&#8217;t the right path for me.</p>
<p>So I just remember there was this one day, I used to do work study in the library. I just started going online and doing research about what do creative people do. So copywriter came about because I&#8217;m getting a degree in English, but at the time I didn&#8217;t feel too confident about my writing skills. So I was like, &#8220;Eh, I don&#8217;t really want to do that.&#8221; And then I remember, topography kept popping up, and this isn&#8217;t a time where in the early two thousands, when they had a lot of portfolio schools, like Miami AD and those type of schools.</p>
<p>So I was doing research and those type of schools kept popping up, and then I kept seeing topography and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What is topography? I don&#8217;t even know what that is.&#8221; So I looked in the school course catalog and I saw topography one and two, and then it was graphic design and I didn&#8217;t know what any of these, I wasn&#8217;t aware of any of this stuff, or what that meant as far as a career. And so the more I read and the more I did my research, I was like, &#8220;Oh, this design thing sounds really interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the next semester, I just went head first. I signed up to take a type one and a design one class, the year, the semester I was supposed to graduate. And then I fell in love with it. And then I pushed my graduation back about a year so I could get a minor in graphic design. And I didn&#8217;t get a true minor. I kind of had a relationship with the director of the art department at the time, because throughout my time in college, I took drawing and painting classes as my elective, because I&#8217;ve always had an affection for art and drawing. So I talked to her at the time and about getting a minor, and so they sort of told me that, just take the main classes. I didn&#8217;t have to take the foundations and stuff like that. So they sort of fast tracked me into design one and however many classes I could take within a year, because Loyola is a private Jesuit liberal university, just very expensive. And I was on a scholarship, so that extra year, I could only go to school those two extra semesters.</p>
<p>So I did that. After that year, it was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m a graphic designer now. That&#8217;s it. This is what I want to do.&#8221; Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a really interesting turn. I mean, you were already set to go along this way, and then you kind of just had another idea and there you go.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah. It wasn&#8217;t something that was obviously planned out in that way, but I&#8217;ve never looked back. I can&#8217;t honestly imagine being in any other field than design, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s really awesome that it sort of came about that way. I&#8217;m curious now on what Tasheka the lawyer would be like, if you would&#8217;ve went there.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I think about it, too. I don&#8217;t know, honestly. I mean, I think there&#8217;s a way that I would&#8217;ve found my niche. I would&#8217;ve found an area of law that would&#8217;ve been good for me. I don&#8217;t know how lucrative that would&#8217;ve been, especially if you think about going to a private undergraduate school, and then law school and then student &#8230; It&#8217;s just sort of the bills and student loans to pile up when you think about it. So yeah, I don&#8217;t know. I think I would&#8217;ve found my way, but I think that it definitely wasn&#8217;t the right path for me. And I think the sort of activist in me, I would&#8217;ve found whatever I guess sort of industry I would&#8217;ve ended up, I think I would&#8217;ve found that sort of angle.</p>
<p>But I do remember this one conversation I had with a lady at a job fair my senior year, and she said that her husband was an attorney and that he had a studio in their attic and he was a painter. And she said that, but once he started really getting into law, he stopped painting as much as he used to. And so I started thinking that I never wanted art to not be a part of my life. So that was sort of a reality check where I was, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want to go into law if this is going to prevent me from being creative or being a maker,&#8221; I guess.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So you graduated from Loyola, and I know later you went and got your MFA from CalArts. Between then, did you get out in the working world and experience a little bit of what it was like to not be a student for a while?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes. It was a very short time. It was exactly a year and four months to date. So yeah, after I graduated, I end up working as a designer at the Navy, which was such a strange thing for me personally, to end up working for the military. But yeah, I worked for the Navy Reservist Public Affairs Office, and they hired me because they saw my resume, that I took topography classes, which is kind of funny when I think about it. Because it&#8217;s like, well, when you go to, you study design, you take topography. It wasn&#8217;t nothing special. But anyway, but one of the other reasons they hired me was because they wanted somebody young with fresh ideas. And at the time, they were publishing and producing a tabloid newspaper. And so they wanted me on board to help transition that newspaper into a monthly magazine.<br>
I actually stayed there long enough just to do that, basically. We had a few firsts. I guess half the time I was there, we were publishing the newspaper. Then the second half, we transitioned over to a magazine, and that&#8217;s my first job. I will say that it was a really great learning experience in school, as far as print production and that kind of stuff. You don&#8217;t necessarily learn. So the Navy, I would drive to Panama City to go see the publication on press, that kind of stuff. So I learned all the production there. So yeah, it was a really good experience for me, as far as my first professional design job.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you were able to get that, I mean, one right out of school because you had this small amount of design experience just from studying, and they were like, &#8220;Yeah, we&#8217;ll go with that.&#8221; Nowadays, for entry level position, they already want you to have three years experience somewhere. So it&#8217;s good that they kind of took a chance and said, &#8220;Yeah, we&#8217;ll move forward and see what you have.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, I will say it was actually a head hunter that found me, or like a temp agency, I would say. And they put me in contact with the Navy. And I think that they were, because they were producing a publication, it was probably a time crunch. And so, I don&#8217;t know if I was the first person they referred them to. I don&#8217;t know if they had interviewed a bunch of other people. I have no idea. But I just knew that, oh, they were also impressed that I studied abroad. I&#8217;m trying to think of the things that they said to me during the interview or that made them sort of intrigued or want me to come in. They liked that I had spent some time abroad and that I took topography courses, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Where did you study abroad?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I studied abroad in Prague, in the Czech Republic. And it was mainly, it was more of a printmaking study abroad than graphic design. I mean, the graphic design aspect of it, was it that there was this workshop or this class that we took to set up design posters by hand. All analog, which was great, but it was really for printmaking, like lithography, learning to do aquatints and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And it was interesting, because it was actually with a program that was through NC State, and one of my professors at Loyola at the time was the person who was in charge. I had started that study abroad program. So it was kind of weird last year when I worked at NC State, it was like, &#8220;Oh, I did a study abroad program at this place and now I&#8217;m teaching here.&#8221; So I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s just kind of funny how things kind of happen that way in life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So tell me how your experience was getting your MFA at Cal Arts.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
That in of itself was an experience. CalArts was tough. I mean, I definitely went there knowing that it was going to be difficult, that it wasn&#8217;t going to be easy. Actually, I was there for three years. I got accepted for the three-year track. So a lot of schools now have a three year and a two-year track, and normally the three-year track is reserved for students who don&#8217;t have a traditional graphic design background. And so since my degree wasn&#8217;t in design, it was in English. And then, I had that limited experience, that year and a half working for the Navy. So I actually did three years instead of two. So the first year was, I guess an adjustment and challenging, in and of itself. For one, I was the only Black student there in the graduate and the undergraduate program, which for me was pretty shocking.</p>
<p>And the reason it was surprising is because I think, to be honest, at the time I was just starting, right before grad school and doing my first year of grad school. I was just starting to notice how there was a lack of visibility of Black people in design, or how the design profession didn&#8217;t seem to, or the lack of diversity that existed. Honestly, I don&#8217;t know why it took that long for me to actually realize that, but it wasn&#8217;t until, I think it was the 2004 AIGA conference that I realized that, where I saw maybe four or five other Black people at the conference. It was in Vancouver, I remember that. And then that&#8217;s when, that was not long before I actually started school at CalArts.</p>
<p>So that experience, and that was the thing that I think started me on this kind of trajectory, or the path into doing the research that I do, was looking around, not seeing anybody like me. Not learning anything about anybody who looked like me with the history class, or so, yeah, that&#8217;s sort of where I started. And me being at CalArts as a student, sort of asking the question, talking to faculty or just saying. Even sometimes it was in my work, I was questioning, where are the Black designers? When was the last time CalArts had a Black student in the MFA program? Nobody can answer that question. Or can you tell me something about Black people in design history? Nobody can answer that question.</p>
<p>So it became this thing where, and I know we&#8217;ve done similar sort of scavenger hunts. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Where the hell are all the Black people?&#8221; So anyway, that is where my research started. So because I couldn&#8217;t find anything out there that was tangible to hold onto, I just started doing my own research and investigation. Because I was like, &#8220;There&#8217;s nobody who&#8217;s here to tell me or give me that information. I have to discover it from myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I will say the faculty there was all, for the most part, it was, I felt supported. Although it was tough. It was like bootcamp, going to CalArts. It was a really, really tough, intense program. But I did feel encouraged most of the time for the type of projects that I had. And some of them was filled with a lot of emotion and anger, and aggression and frustration, and a lot of times that came out. But I will say that they sort of helped me nurture and cultivate my voice, and they also always encouraged me to be true, to keep that investigation and then that energy, and to being inquisitive about my design, Black design history, and culture and identity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s such a good thing now that it almost feels like, I&#8217;d say maybe within the past, I don&#8217;t know, 10, 15 years perhaps, we&#8217;ll say that. But we&#8217;ve started to see more Black design educators out there, and we&#8217;ve also started to see community efforts. I mean, Revision Path is one of them, but we&#8217;ve started to also see community efforts with making sure that Black people, and I would say Black and brown, I mean, I would kind of widen that lens a bit. But we&#8217;ve started to see now more people of color in general, being talked about, recognized, showcased, researched as it comes to design. I mean, I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;ll get to a point where there&#8217;s full equity with regards to that, but I think within the past 10 years, we&#8217;ve seen a lot of headway in that direction, where we&#8217;re starting to now see more Black students, or at least more talk about Black designers throughout history. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes, I would agree with that. There is definitely some sort of shift. I mean, if I&#8217;m honest, I&#8217;m not seeing it enough or as much as I would like to see it. But I&#8217;m also aware that things do take time, and especially when you have things that are so systemic and that&#8217;s a part of system that&#8217;s been there for so long that it&#8217;s not, it takes a long time to sort of dismantle it.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m honest, I do believe that it doesn&#8217;t have to, or it shouldn&#8217;t take it as long, but I understand it. I try to understand it. I do think that things can happen a lot quicker, but I do realize that there are still certain structures that are there, that&#8217;s way more difficult to dismantle to where it takes a lot longer. But I am happy to have colleagues. I didn&#8217;t think that I would see a day where I could name at least three other Black women that are doing similar type of work or things like that. So I am happy to see that there&#8217;s a change, and there&#8217;s a lot of work and way more work that needs to be done. But yeah, I agree. There are more efforts, I guess, and more initiatives that are happening at different places.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think with schools, it&#8217;s just always going to take longer because schools are just such, these large institutions. Of course, they get funds from different philanthropists and foundations and stuff like that. But I agree with you, in that I think the change could be happening a lot quicker. I a hundred percent agree with you there.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah. I just think that one of the things that I liked about UT was they started changing their admissions process. I think there are still more work to be done, but they have done away with the traditional portfolio. And so, their admission process is more a design prompt, so a student could &#8230; So the design program looks at just that one particular piece that they&#8217;re doing, and then they submit a 60-minute video that sort of talks about their process and their ideas, alongside the piece that they made for admissions.</p>
<p>So I think that, that takes a lot of pressure off because you still have so many students that, they don&#8217;t have the resources in their high schools to submit even a fine arts portfolio, let alone something that&#8217;s specific to design. Where you need all these different, you need a computer, you need the Adobe software, you need all these digital tools that a lot of high schools still don&#8217;t have those type of resources. So it&#8217;s nice to see that they&#8217;re at least trying to change that process a little bit, to make it more equitable for students of color to have access to the program.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, along with you being a design educator, and you mentioned this a bit earlier, you have your own design studio called Blacvoice Design. Tell me more about that. What are some of the projects or other work that you&#8217;ve done through your studio?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Well, a lot of projects I would say, first start off with the type of clients that I work with. So most of my clients are educational institutions like universities, colleges and things like that, nonprofit organizations, as well as kind of start up or small businesses. And I actually like the work that I do within those spaces. The type of projects that I do, format wise, most of them are books. I design a lot of books, but I don&#8217;t like to just consider myself a book designer because I do do identity projects and things like that. But a lot of the books that I do design, because a lot of my clients have modest budgets, usually I&#8217;m given texts and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>And so, I think that&#8217;s why I wear this hat of an image maker, because a lot of projects might call for me to take photos and I&#8217;ll take my own photographs for a particular project, or I do my own illustrations and create my own imagery for them. And so that I actually like. I like that whole process of generating the imagery, and doing the type setting, and doing the layout and the design. I really do enjoy being a part of that process from the beginning to the end. I thought at this point in my career that I would want to be in a more creative director sort of role, but I actually like and still enjoy being hands on.</p>
<p>So some projects that I&#8217;ve worked on in the past that are really kind of dear to my heart is, I used to do some work for a nonprofit organization. They&#8217;re now called 826 New Orleans, but they used to be called Big Class. And Big Class is a nonprofit organization. They started off basically sort of reaching out to the inner city public schools. And so, they would have writing prompts or writing projects for students to engage in after school. And so they would come up with themes, the students would come up with themes or topics that they wanted to write about. Usually it had to do with their feelings around their culture and their community.</p>
<p>And so, what I would do is basically, I would come in, talk to the student editorial board, find out what ideas they have about the design and the design process, and basically use that as information or inspiration and design a book for these individual projects. And so Big Class would take those books, they would have these readings, they would get people, they had their own press and their own imprint. And so they would publish and sell the books, and then they would just feed and go back into the sort of program. And I really like that program, because it not only gets students excited about writing, and writing is a form of expression, writing can be creative, right? Writing, I think gave them a sense of agency because they get to write, they get to publish, they get to put it out there, they get to have open mic and spoken words.</p>
<p>And so, I really love to see the sort of confidence that it gave these students, that maybe in their school, they may not ever have that type of experience. So for me to provide a platform for them to express themselves through words, through writing, I really did enjoy working with them. But now they&#8217;re part of this larger, more national collection of programs, that&#8217;s like 826 New Orleans, you have 826 Valencia. So 826 sort of exists in a lot of different cities. And my hope is to, there isn&#8217;t an 826 in Austin. Honestly, have no idea how to even start one. And it&#8217;s not that I even want to be in charge of one, but I would love to try to figure out how to create a rapport with some of the schools, some of the public schools here in Austin to try to get one started here. And then that way, it&#8217;s something that I would like my students at UT to be involved in that process, of helping those students design and get their work printed and published.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m a big advocate of designers needing to do more writing. A hundred percent. We had at one point in time, kind of design anthology called Recognize that we were doing through Revision Path, where we had designers just like, we would give a particular prompt or theme. I think the one we did before we shut it down was reset. I think reset was the theme. And so based off of that, we wanted people to submit essays up to 3000 words, centered around reset in whatever way that they wanted to. But it had to be design focused, like design writing. We didn&#8217;t get great ones. I&#8217;ll be completely honest. I think a lot of people rather wanted to design something than write something.</p>
<p>And even the first year that we did it, we would get some pushback from people, &#8220;Well, why do I have to write something?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;It&#8217;s a essay.&#8221; I mean, you have to write something because that&#8217;s the structure of it. I do want to bring it back one day if Revision Path can get the right funding and all of that. Because, I&#8217;m still a big proponent and believer of designers, I think, need to be, they need to know how to write because of course, it just helps you get your ideas out there. But it&#8217;s just so helpful for, and I think this probably ties into your research focus. It ties into your work being part of the cannon. If you can write down what you did, the work you did, case studies, et cetera, if it gets put out there in some way, if it gets preserved in some way, you&#8217;re now part of the cannon.</p>
<p>One thing with me, when I try to find guests for the show, it&#8217;s very hard for me to book a guest when I can&#8217;t find anything on them. I could maybe find-</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, you could maybe do some research.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, yeah, because I can maybe find a website or there&#8217;s maybe a blog post or something somewhere, but I need to be able to see what you&#8217;ve done so I can get a sense of who you are as a designer, if this is going to be a good fit, that sort of thing. But I say all of that to say that I&#8217;m a big, just huge fan of designers being writers, and write it down, write down your work, show your work.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I agree with that too, Maurice. And even as a person, I still think I have a very strange or uncomfortable, I think it&#8217;s a better word, relationship with writing. It&#8217;s something that with my teaching, I always make sure that there&#8217;s some writing component in a project for students, whether it&#8217;s a reflection to something they read or something they saw. I think it&#8217;s really important. I see a lot of similarities in the writing, in the design process. So for me, it&#8217;s been, although it&#8217;s still a place where I&#8217;m super uncomfortable in lots of times, a few years ago, to be honest, I think it was back in 2017 when I was teaching at Southeastern Louisiana University, and I had just gotten tenured there. And I didn&#8217;t realize at the time that until I was at NC State during that interview process, that up until that point, I had got tenured because of my creative work, because of doing exhibitions and things like that.</p>
<p>And at that point, I realized that with the research that I was doing, and then at that time, my research was startup, sporadic, how I was engaged with it. I started this research in graduate school, and then I would start to engage with it from time to time when somebody would ask me to give a lecture. And at some point, going back to what you were saying about the importance of the canon and sort of writing things down, that became a real turning point for me because at that point, I wanted to change my practice a little bit, and have it more focused on writing and publishing. Because in my mind, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, I can continue to do these lectures and talk about this stuff, but then what?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
What do you with it? And so I knew at some point I always wanted to write a book about Black design history. I knew, even from grad school back at CalArts, that&#8217;s something I wanted to do. I think, not until that point, I became more intentional about it. I was like, &#8220;Okay, if I want to shift,&#8221; not do away with making, not do away with freelance, not doing away with that work, but I wanted to be more intentional about the scholarly part of me, I guess, in that work. And sort of getting it out there and not have it just be through lectures. And I think, oral history and that stuff is valuable. I&#8217;m not trying to devalue that at all, but I do think there&#8217;s something about having something written and on a page, and printed and sort of documented. Right? I mean, I think it&#8217;s really important for our work and stuff to be documented, so it can be passed on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Exactly. I mean, the oral storytelling, and I realize we&#8217;re saying this on a podcast, but is mean that is important. But being able to write it down, pass it on, put it in a book, have it stored somewhere, that is what is really, that is the canon. That&#8217;s what you end up preserving. Speaking of books, I mean, we&#8217;re both working on books, but part of the research that I find is trying to find these writings and trying to find where people have talked about stuff. And you know what we&#8217;re doing now? Interviews. We&#8217;re having to talk to people because we can&#8217;t find where folks have written stuff down. So to that end, about books, as I mentioned that just now, you&#8217;re working on a book called Black Design in America. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, so I&#8217;m a co-author of Black Design America, African-Americans, and African Diaspora and Graphic Design, 19th to 21st Century. My co-authors are Silas Munro and Pierre Bowins. And how this book came about is not a linear kind of trajectory of story. So back in 2020, when George Floyd was murdered and you had the protests going on, and a lot of things were sort of happening online, VCFA had started this sort of virtual programming. I believe they contacted me and asked me if I was interested in doing a lecture or something about my research. And so at the time, I want to say around that time, I can&#8217;t remember exactly, but I know at some point, me, Pierre, and Silas had created a Google Doc, and we just started populating it with our research. And some of our focus on our research was slightly different. There was some overlap, but we started this Google Doc, and I think we started it with the intent of writing a book someday.</p>
<p>So the idea was that, &#8220;Okay, we want to have this document populated to start working on the outline.&#8221; So VCFA came to me. I decided that I didn&#8217;t want to just be the only voice talking about Black design history. So I invited Pierre and Silas to also give a lecture. So they call it these micro lectures. So still had the same amount of time that I had to give my lecture, but instead of me talking for an hour or 45 minutes, we each had 15 minutes to do a micro lecture, a mini presentation about our specific research.</p>
<p>So again, around that time, I met Dr. Cheryl Miller, and she was just starting, or had already started her archive for Stanford, a Black design history archive. And somebody gave her my name. And so, I met with her about sending my work there. And something that I still feel weird about saying was that was my first time hearing about her and her work, but I&#8217;m glad I did. I&#8217;m glad that we had that opportunity to talk and connect. And now she&#8217;s a huge mentor and influence, inspiration in my life. But that conversation with her sort of gave me a little focus. So I was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m really interested in the history of Black women in graphic design too.&#8221; So my portion of the lecture was about that.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re in the midst of the pandemic, and Silas had this idea. And so we all talked about how this information needs to get out there. I don&#8217;t know if we have time to go through the process of writing a book and getting published, and trying to do all the stuff that you have to go through, as you you&#8217;re working on one yourself. It&#8217;s a huge timeline. You don&#8217;t just do it overnight. It takes a lot of time. So Silas and his studio, that&#8217;s how they came up, and they put together the BIPOC Design History Classes, went live January of 2021. And so again, it wasn&#8217;t the intent to have the classes. And that sort of happened first. That idea, we thought, prior to the pandemic and whatnot, that we would be working on a book first. So that happened. That was the success. And so then after the chorus, then we felt like, &#8220;Okay, now we have to write this book now, because we kind of already have a structure. We have content.&#8221; But little did we know, Maurice, that it was not that easy.</p>
<p>These small classes. Okay. Yeah. There are chapters in the book, but I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s just, yeah, they&#8217;re still talking to people. There&#8217;s still more research to be done. There&#8217;s still more archives to visit. So it wasn&#8217;t just that simple to just make that transition from the series of classes, and then to make it into a book. So we&#8217;re still in the process of writing now. We have a hard, hard deadline coming up on June 1st, where we have to really turn over the manuscript. And we&#8217;re all also collaborating on the design of the book, too. So yeah, it&#8217;s been an interesting process.</p>
<p>And I think the thing that, I know for me, and I think from my co-authors as well, the thing that&#8217;s been most difficult is that it&#8217;s a design history book, but we&#8217;re not approaching it like a Meg&#8217;s book in a way, or this book came out a few years ago, it&#8217;s called Graphic Design Pioneers, or Pioneers in Design, where it&#8217;s focused on individuals. So we do talk about individual designers and sort of their impact, but it&#8217;s more about the diaspora, it&#8217;s more about Black experience in a way, and what we had to go through and deal with. It&#8217;s more about how we&#8217;ve been represented through visual culture, and who&#8217;s responsible for that and that kind of stuff. So it&#8217;s not necessarily about a clothesline of designers, although we do talk about individual people, because you can&#8217;t write a history book without acknowledging individuals. But, it&#8217;s not just about highlighting people, I guess in that way. It&#8217;s more about the different movements that happened, throughout time and throughout history.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, because I mean-</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
And we&#8217;ve been affected by it, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Because you&#8217;re, like you said, it&#8217;s set up with, it&#8217;s in the context of America during that time, and so there&#8217;s been wars, there&#8217;s been civil rights movements, there&#8217;s been other sorts of radical movements. And so, being able to talk about how Black design has been a through line with all of that in this country, we don&#8217;t learn it in school, in K through 12 schools. And based on what you&#8217;re saying, and probably from others, it&#8217;s probably not even something that&#8217;s really readily learned in colleges.</p>
<p>So having a book like this is super important, I think, not just to the design canon, but just like to American history in general. Because everything that we go through in this country has been designed in some capacity. That don&#8217;t necessarily mean that it&#8217;s been done with a pen and paper or in some visual aspect, but the systems of oppression that are in this country and many other things that sort of hold people back or push others forward, these are designed constructs. And so being able to talk about Black design in this country is super important to, I think, informing that for a lot of people. So, I&#8217;m excited to see the book when it comes out. Congratulations to you, because I know it&#8217;s a lot. I know all too well. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I mean, I think writing a book is a challenge, in and of itself, but I think history, and I think we have a special challenge in the type of history that we&#8217;re trying to bring to light, because it hasn&#8217;t been well documented or readily available. So it&#8217;s a lot of things you have to do to discover these stories. That&#8217;s definitely been a challenge. I think, one thing that I want to say I&#8217;m proud of about how we approach the writing in this book is that we sort of try to do away with &#8230; we&#8217;re being ourselves. We feel like using I, then we use I. If we want to throw in a little snarky, something that maybe a long time ago would be unorthodox for a history book, but we are just throwing it and putting it all out there. We&#8217;re not sort of concerned about our voices being the same, and we like that our voices are fluid and they&#8217;re sort of interchangeable.</p>
<p>We collaborated and wrote the introduction together, and there are parts of it, it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t even remember what I wrote. And we do have our chapters that the three of us have been responsible for, and we have contributors to certain chapters as well, but we&#8217;re not sort of concerned with the more traditional approach to this type of book. We don&#8217;t even call it a textbook. We&#8217;re not really approaching it in that same traditional way, I guess, if you will.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So you&#8217;re teaching, you&#8217;re running your own design studio, you are working on a book, you&#8217;re doing this research and your research focuses on, as we&#8217;ve talked about throughout this interview, Black people being omitted from the graphic design history canon. Given all the different spaces that you occupy, designer, educator, et cetera, what does the path forward look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I think about that a lot. I think it&#8217;s going to continue in this realm of writing and publishing, and designing. I think I like the idea of being a content generator and being the one to design that content. So I see more books around the same topic, but in different iterations. So for instance, I&#8217;m completely obsessed with Louise E. Jefferson. She is a Black woman who was one of the first art directors in the publishing industry at Friendship Press. She started working in the mid, late 1930s, and she was a designer, a calligrapher, a cartographer, an illustrator, a researcher. I mean, she was a real true renaissance woman, and she rubbed shoulders with all kinds of people during the Harlem Renaissance. But I&#8217;ve been doing research on her for a really long time. And so, I envision writing and designing a book about Louise E. Jefferson. And right now, I&#8217;ve been in touch with Friendship Press where she worked at as an art director for 20 years, and they&#8217;re interested in me writing a book about Louise and her work.</p>
<p>So those type of projects I see still continuing. The past few years have been great. The writing, the lecturing have been amazing, meeting amazing people, and have been great with giving me more opportunities to write into research. But I would like to hopefully, have more of a balance between that and my making, especially maybe even more so personal projects. I really enjoy doing small collaborations with other designers, whether it be zines or just random, creating compositions and giving files, going back and forth between digital files and things like that. Well, not really knowing what the outcome is. I think I just miss making and playing, and having fun.</p>
<p>Not that the design work that I do isn&#8217;t enjoyable, but it&#8217;s just a different type of making, I guess it&#8217;s different. You&#8217;re doing research and you&#8217;re writing. That&#8217;s a lot different than like, &#8220;Okay, I have this idea for making this thing using these materials, or even this tool or this technology. Am I making?&#8221; I&#8217;m really interested in this sort of synthesis, and analog and digital tools and how they sort of come together, and how to expand our uses in ways that they weren&#8217;t actually meant to be used. So I would like moving forward to be able to engage more, and just being a maker and not thinking about what I&#8217;m making so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, being a designer and an educator and all these things, you&#8217;ve talked now about how you want your path to go forward, but in your current work, how do you balance these different aspects? Do these different roles inform each other in some way?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, I definitely see there are so much overlap in &#8230; For a long time, I actually didn&#8217;t know how to bring all these things together, especially in the classroom because it took a while before I started teaching design history, and actually I&#8217;m not teaching it right now. I haven&#8217;t taught it in maybe three years. But I think, that doesn&#8217;t mean that I can&#8217;t still bring that into the classroom. So to me, it doesn&#8217;t matter. I don&#8217;t care that I&#8217;m not teaching design history. Whatever I&#8217;m teaching, you&#8217;re going to learn something about Black design. Some kind of way I&#8217;m going to insert my agenda, because I know that these are things that are, in part, it&#8217;s not just Black design history. I talk about queer history. I talk about other areas of design where people are marginalized or we don&#8217;t know a lot about, and I know a little something. I still try to impart that to my students, so I make sure that I&#8217;m trying to be equitable in that sense.</p>
<p>But yeah, I&#8217;m just starting to see where these roads and where these things are starting to overlap. So am I making? Now I think about, well, how could, besides designing books about Black design history or whatever, and the publishing aspect, but I start thinking about, well, what are other things that you can make that sort of has to do with your research? So I&#8217;m starting to think more about that, like timelines and things like that. So to me, the crossover is starting to happen. It&#8217;s slow and maybe not as fast as I would have liked them to be. And then I see them in the projects that I give to my students too. So it sort of reverts back to the classroom in that way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, I like that it all feeds into each other then. That&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Kind of makes less work for me in a way, as opposed to try to compartmentalize everything. So for a long time, everything used to be in these separate buckets. Black design studio, freelance here is writing and lecture. But now, they&#8217;re just starting to morph together, and that has been good, and that&#8217;s how I would like things to continue in the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hey, look, work smarter, not harder. I get it.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to someone out here that&#8217;s hearing your story, that&#8217;s hearing about all these different things that you&#8217;re interested in, and they want to follow in your footsteps? What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I would say, learn how to be comfortable in your voice, in your skin, and how to &#8230; I didn&#8217;t always feel comfortable being Tasheka, being authentically me, because sometimes I had moments where I didn&#8217;t want to step on people&#8217;s toes, but I noticed moments where I did do that, and I was just kind of myself and just kind of put it out there. Those have been the best experiences.</p>
<p>And I would say that we all have control. You have some kind of control over your path, and so if there&#8217;s a certain direction that you want your practice, or your craft, or your skill or whatever it is you are into to take, that you can kind of plan for. Talk to people who are doing the thing that you want to do, align yourself. Reach out to them. I know sometimes, we think and we look at people that we admire and we put them on this pedestal, but if they&#8217;re the right people, they&#8217;ll talk to you and they&#8217;re not full of themselves. And lots of times, people are more than happy to talk to you about your path, and this is especially to younger designers. Don&#8217;t be afraid to reach out to people who you admire, and have conversations with them about what they do and how they got to where they are. But yeah, I just say be bold.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Be bold.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Be bold and intentional about how you move through this world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love that. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want the next chapter of your story to be?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I do see myself still teaching. I do see myself still being at UT, and I&#8217;m hoping, my hope is that in five years, I have a couple of books under my belt by then. Maybe, I&#8217;m just going to throw it out there, Maurice. I would say at least three of them, because I have a list of projects that I&#8217;m really like. It&#8217;s kind of like these have to be done before I die. No, maybe they don&#8217;t have to be done in five years. That&#8217;s pretty ambitious of me, but I&#8217;m already working on one, so I can get the other two at least in the works by that time, that would be great.</p>
<p>I do have sort of a passion project that I&#8217;ve been sitting on on for a while. I have a collection of drawings, maybe it&#8217;s like 200 and something drawings, that I would like in five years to have their own sort of brand, where it&#8217;s a collection of, whether it&#8217;s greeting cards or home decor or apparel. Not or. I should say and. So I&#8217;ve been procrastinated on this project for a really long time, and I hope in five years that that project sort of sees the light of day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I&#8217;m probably most active on Instagram and Facebook. So Facebook is Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton. On Instagram, it&#8217;s Blacvoice. I am on Twitter under Blacvoice, but I&#8217;m not that engaged with that platform as much. But, I&#8217;m on there and I tweet every now and then. I&#8217;m on LinkedIn, which is, you can find me under Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton. Again, that&#8217;s not a platform that I&#8217;m super engaged in, but I&#8217;m there, and you&#8217;ll probably find me multiple times under LinkedIn, but I&#8217;m there. But Instagram, I would say, it&#8217;s probably the place to see me. I&#8217;m more active there. I would hate to throw out my crappy Adobe Portfolio website. That&#8217;s just a bunch of stuff that&#8217;s thrown on there right now. But hey, why not? Blacvoicedesign.portfolio.com. That&#8217;s just something that&#8217;s there right now, just to have an online presence, until I have time to do something else with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. You and your work have been on my radar for many years, I think probably, maybe since 2015? For a while now. And it wasn&#8217;t until recently, I had spoken with Cheryl, had Cheryl on the show for 500th episode, and she sung your praises to the high heavens. And I was like, &#8220;I feel like I reached out to her before. Let me reach out again just to see if she might be interested.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Actually, you did, Maurice. I thought about that. I was actually just telling my sister right before, and I was like, I feel weird because you did reach out to me a long time ago, and I think at the time I was just not ready, and something that had nothing to do with you or the show. I love the show and listen to it, and I think that was just like, &#8220;I&#8217;m still in my boldness. I&#8217;m kind of shy too, and more of an introvert.&#8221; So I think that, yeah, it just took a while, but you did. You did, but I&#8217;m glad you reached back out again.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, but I mean, I also just want to say from hearing your story and hearing about everything that you&#8217;re working on, I think it&#8217;s evident that you have a passion for design. You have a passion for honestly getting the story right, whether it&#8217;s through writing, through education, through your visual design work. I&#8217;m really excited to see and hear more from you in the future. I feel like you&#8217;re one of our bright shining stars that are really going to help represent us, as we move forward in this crazy world that we&#8217;re in right now. I feel like the work that you&#8217;re doing is really going to stand out and help showcase what Black designers are doing everywhere, so thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>

<p>I had to connect with Morgan Bissant after seeing a few of her images of 90s sitcoms make the rounds on Twitter. Her work definitely captures to the richness of the Black experience, and she&#8217;s done everything from editorial work for Comcast to children&#8217;s illustrations and book covers. But that&#8217;s not all!</p>
<p>Morgan and I talked about some of her big freelance projects, and she spoke on how Black pop culture, especially animation, is a big source of inspiration and her creative process. We also discussed how she stays up on trends in the industry, how she handles burnout, and she gave us a look into her current art journey and creative process. Morgan&#8217;s experiences and raw talent are a unique combination, and I think we&#8217;ll definitely see more of her amazing work in the future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
My name is Morgan Bissant. I am a graphic designer and illustrator. I do a lot of branding work. I do a lot of layout design, I do web design, but something that I&#8217;ve always been more passionate about is illustration and I&#8217;ve been doing illustration work since I was old enough to hold a pencil. Currently, I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of illustration work for different companies and publishers. I&#8217;ve been working on children&#8217;s books, I&#8217;ve been doing promotional material. That&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve really enjoyed doing. I enjoy being able to actually use my craft, I guess, in bigger spaces.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. It sounds like it keeps you pretty busy.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yes, it&#8217;s a lot. It definitely takes up a lot of time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has this year been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
So far it&#8217;s been going pretty good. I&#8217;ve actually started a new full-time job probably a couple months back, I want to say. I started a new full-time job doing graphic design work and I work at a marketing agency called OrthoSynetics. It&#8217;s been nice being able to do a lot of different things. In my previous job, we designed a lot of baby products, and in this job we do a lot of different marketing products. So, we&#8217;ll do flyers, we&#8217;ll do social posts, we&#8217;ll do websites. I was able to work on a major branding project for a new doctor that we picked up for our agency, and that&#8217;s all been pretty exciting. It&#8217;s really different from what I&#8217;m used to doing. It&#8217;s a much faster pace than some of my earlier jobs and projects, but it&#8217;s been a lot of fun. I like being able to do a lot of different things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Keeps me interested.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Congratulations on the new job.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have any plans for the summer? Anything coming up?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Not necessarily. I&#8217;m just seeing what may be over the horizon maybe. So, I&#8217;ve currently been working on doing some freelance projects and I&#8217;m just always trying to keep myself open to seeing if I could get some other things, follow up with those. I&#8217;m always trying to see what other opportunities that I may have and other work that I can take on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I saw back in September last year that you had did some work for Comcast for their Black History Month series, which ran this year. Can you tell me a little bit about that?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah, sure. So, actually it ran last year. I ended up reposting it because I&#8217;m pretty proud of it, so I&#8217;m going to keep sharing it. So, this was something that we worked on last year. It was a partnership that they reached out to me for. I had initially gotten their attention because I had seen one of their ads on Twitter and it was something for the Olympic Games, and I saw there was this little black girl and she was looking at the screen in awe and seeing the black athletes doing all kind of stuff, and she was just so amazed and everything. And I just thought she was just so cute and I was like, &#8220;I just have to draw this little girl because she&#8217;s adorable.&#8221; And so I went ahead and illustrated how she looked in the ad and I figured out I would just post it and tag them, because why not?</p>
<p>And they ended up seeing it and they really liked what they saw. And so I want to say a couple months down the line, they reached out to me and they said, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re doing this campaign for Black History Month, and we really loved the artwork that you tagged us in on Twitter. So, we wanted you to do something actually in partnership with us this time in celebration of Black History Month.&#8221; And that was pretty exciting. So, they asked me to do a couple of different illustrations. The first two that they asked for, they wanted some illustrations of Erin Jackson and Elana Meyers Taylor for the Winter games.</p>
<p>They followed up and they said that they wanted to do something else, something I guess a little bit more Black History Month specific. They wanted to do the McDonogh Three. I know a lot of people aren&#8217;t exactly aware of who those are, and that is three little girls that desegregated McDonogh 19 in New Orleans in the 1960s. And that was something I was really excited about doing, because being from New Orleans, that was something a bit more personal for me. Them doing that, desegregating schools is what gave me the opportunities that I had growing up, and that was something that I really was excited to do.</p>
<p>So, I was over the moon about that part of it, and I went through everything to put the illustrations together and they wanted two separate illustrations, so they wanted to show, I guess, a parallel of the past and show them as little girls, and one in the present. So, just showing them how they are now and I guess illustrating how far they&#8217;ve come over the years and what their sacrifices meant to people, and also to show that these women are still alive today. And a lot of people always think that, &#8220;Well that happened so long ago, and everybody that was involved in that is probably gone and all of that is over,&#8221; but they&#8217;re still here. They&#8217;re still here to tell the stories, and they&#8217;re still here to push a lot of the, I guess I want to say, push a lot of what was hidden, a lot of the things that were lost historically because a lot of people know about Ruby Bridges, but a lot of people also don&#8217;t know about them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean there&#8217;s a lot of layers to that, that I think is really cool. One that Comcast saw an illustration that you did and they were like, &#8220;Oh, this is great. Can you do some work for us?&#8221; I feel like you hear those sorts of things sometimes is being discovered out of nowhere things, but I think that&#8217;s really cool that they just picked up on some work that you put online and they really wanted to keep working with it. I think that was great, but also the levels of being able to do something that&#8217;s tied to history, especially civil rights history in this country as people from this podcast.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m from Selma, Alabama, so I grew up in that cradle of the civil rights movement, and there are so many stories about things that have happened that we knew about, the bigger things we knew about the March to Montgomery, as you mentioned, we know about Ruby Bridges, but we don&#8217;t know about some of these lesser known stories and struggles and triumphs that have happened.</p>
<p>And so I think it&#8217;s great that you were able to create some work that shone a light on that and to let people know that while this is &#8220;history,&#8221; it&#8217;s also the present. Like you said, these women are still alive, so the fact that they are still here and that they fought for these rights is something that we should all be aware of.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yes, it&#8217;s always good to make sure you&#8217;re informed. And it&#8217;s always good to be able to put more things out there and shine light on things that we don&#8217;t know about, because there&#8217;s just so much stuff that we didn&#8217;t learn in school and just so many things in general that just get overlooked in favor of just those little three big figures like Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King. I mean nothing&#8217;s wrong with learning about them obviously.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s sad that that&#8217;s all most people really know about and they barely know about them either.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I think it&#8217;s also telling that, in the past, media was really the thing that brought the whole civil rights movement to the nation. I mean because a lot of these things were happening in small southern towns, et cetera, and it wasn&#8217;t, I think until the incidents of, I think it was Bloody Sunday that happened in Selma. It wasn&#8217;t until those incidents where there were actually cameras and then that footage got broadcast across the nation that people saw about it. So, in a way, you can see how there&#8217;s a lot of stories and things that happen that we just don&#8217;t know about. Parts of history that get covered up.</p>
<p>I think people are just starting to really know about, for example, Bayard Rustin or Claudette Colvin, and people have mentioned Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, but not these other people that were behind the scenes maybe, or that did the work that they did before they did. So, a lot of those stories, it&#8217;s interesting, are now also being uncovered through media. I think within the past, I&#8217;d say at least in the past 10 years, I&#8217;ve seen so many black creators unearth a lot of these stories through animation, through illustration, et cetera. I think it&#8217;s really great. It&#8217;s really great.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s always something exciting to see.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s talk more about your work as a freelance illustrator. You mentioned that you&#8217;re also working full-time at this agency OrthoSynetics. What does a regular day look like for you right now?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
With working full-time, that gets a lot of my time. Basically what we do is we have a certain amount of projects that we have to get done throughout the day, and it&#8217;s generally a nine to five situation, and so we&#8217;ll have certain things that we&#8217;ll work on. We might have banners that we might have to do, we might have billboards, but it basically varies from day-to-day what we might have to work on. The things that we do are mainly for orthodontists and dentist, and that&#8217;s just a lot of what we see.</p>
<p>We might have flyers advertising different prices for dental work or different offers or things along those lines. So, that&#8217;s basically what we have our eyes on throughout the day. Now, as far as doing any freelance work, I have to put that, I guess, on the tail end of my day or reserve that for the weekends because we&#8217;re generally just so busy with doing graphic design work at the agency that sometimes it can be a little tough to juggle. But generally speaking, when I do get freelance projects, I&#8217;m given a sufficient amount of time to complete them. So, it&#8217;s not like I have to do everything at work and then come rush home and then just rush and get a book cover done in five minutes.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ll have months and months to work on things and get things done, and I&#8217;ll do that in my free time that I have. Sometimes I&#8217;ll work on things while I&#8217;m listening to music or while I&#8217;m watching a TV show that I enjoy to motivate me or I guess help me to get into a groove. It just helps to do it when I have, I guess, some breathing room to do so, which again, with the deadlines, it does help to give me some breathing room to actually get a lot of these projects done, and I try not to take on too much at a time so that I won&#8217;t be overbooked.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean that&#8217;s a good thing. I know that you&#8217;re represented by an agency, which we&#8217;ll talk about a little bit later. I imagine your agent knows that too. So, when you&#8217;re getting booked for things, you can&#8217;t do something last minute, there has to be some buffer time around it for you to be able to get it done.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah. They have different industry standards on what is appropriate for different projects. Now sometimes people will come and be like, &#8220;Hey, we need you to get this done in two days,&#8221; which I mean, it&#8217;s really ultimately up to you on whether or not you want to take it with not enough time to get it done. But generally speaking, for larger projects especially, you definitely need a sufficient amount of time to finish things. And especially in a creative space, you don&#8217;t want to be pushed to the limit and be getting yourself burnt out when you&#8217;re trying to come up with ideas that look good and are executed well. I always try to do things that are within my means. Now, if it&#8217;s something like maybe smaller and it might be a little bit of rush, I just feel like I have time and I feel like I might be able to do it, I might grab it. But usually if it&#8217;s a little too tight, I might ask for more time or I might have just have to pass on that one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Now, I&#8217;m looking through your website now. I see of course you&#8217;ve done illustration work, but there&#8217;s logo design work here. You&#8217;ve done book illustrations, character designs, all of it is really great, and I mentioned this to you right before we started recording that I saw your work on Twitter because you had done this character lineup of the main cast from Living Single. And I mean the style of it was so good. I was like, &#8220;I have to reach out to her to see if she can come on the podcast.&#8221; Are you influenced a lot by TV and pop culture in your work?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I am. That actually is what pushed me to start drawing, and that&#8217;s really what made me want to do it more seriously. Pop culture is a huge part of it, especially things that are immersed in black culture. Obviously me being black, that&#8217;s my own culture and it&#8217;s something that I can pull inspiration from my personal experiences. Things like anime and cartoons, they&#8217;ve always fueled my desire for illustration. I&#8217;ve always been influenced by things like Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball Z and things like that. Growing up, I was very small and watching a lot of these programs, and that&#8217;s what made me want to draw. I started copying things that I saw while I was watching TV. I would be watching Sailor Moon in the mornings and I&#8217;d said, &#8220;Well, I want to draw Sailor Moon.&#8221; And so I would be working until I got her to what I felt was right and was an accurate depiction of what she looked like on the screen.</p>
<p>And as I got older and I started cultivating my talents and working on my skills, started trying to branch off and do other things. And I&#8217;ve always tried to start creating my own concepts and characters, and nowadays I am still heavily influenced by anime and animation in general, but a lot of other things that I was exposed to like different black sitcoms and cartoons, that also had an impact on my overall style. Bruce W. Smith has always been one of my huge inspirations for illustration work. I&#8217;ve always liked his style since The Proud Family and B√©b√©&#8217;s Kids, Happily Ever After, Fairy Tales for Every Child.</p>
<p>That always was a draw to me. And I&#8217;ve mimicked some of my style and my character designs around some of the things that he&#8217;s done, and I mean he isn&#8217;t one of the only influences that I have, but that&#8217;s always something that I&#8217;ve seen growing up, and I&#8217;ve always liked his style and I&#8217;ve always wanted to, I guess, put a little bit of that into my style. And so nowadays I have this, I guess, combination of all of these different influences that have created what I have today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, talk to me about how you approach a new project. What does your creative process look like when a new project comes across your table?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
So, for basically any new project that I have, whether it just be freelance or something personal, I always try to brainstorm first. I might write down ideas or just sketch things down, and I just try to just do things and just get my brain going. I don&#8217;t always have something in mind before I start sketching, so I have this approach where I&#8217;ll just start doing anything. Well, not anything, but I&#8217;ll start trying to draw different things and just see where it takes me and then try to give myself a couple of different options and variations in what I might want to do with it, and then just see where it goes from there. This is especially true for larger projects, because I definitely have to see where I&#8217;m going before I start tackling something so huge.</p>
<p>So, I always have to sketch things out first. I always have to get ideas down first, and if I have any troubles or bumps in the road, I might go online. I have my Pinterest, I have all these bookmarks and stuff on Instagram. I have all these bookmarks on Twitter of different photographs or screenshots or fashion or just whatever, and I might use that as a way to, I guess, give myself a little bit of inspiration so I can push myself in the right direction. Because sometimes I can&#8217;t always come up with things just immediately from the top of my head.</p>
<p>So, it helps for me to look at some things. It helps for me to continuously draw things until I can get some ideas to come out that I like. I always try to keep things in my back pocket that I can always pull up later in terms of references and images that I might have saved that I think that I could probably use going forward for my creative process.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Was there ever a really particularly hard design or illustration that you had to create for a project?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I think that probably one of the hardest things that I have worked on in recent years would be probably the illustration that I did for the Crescent City Sneaker Ball. It was both illustration and it was a graphic designed invitation, and I&#8217;m really happy with how it came out, but there was a lot of thought that had to go into it, and there was a lot that I had to consider like, &#8220;Okay, how is this going to work? How can I fit this in here?&#8221; Because it was a little bit different from what I usually do. Everything was a collage and I had to make sure all the pieces fit together and flowed together and had to make sure things didn&#8217;t look too cluttered or too structured. So, it took a lot of working around with that one and playing around with it to make it work.</p>
<p>But I think ultimately all things considered, it came out pretty cute. It was a lot to think about. It was a lot to figure out how everything should go and everything should work together. I&#8217;m also really not too fantastic with buildings, or at least I personally don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m all that great with them. And that had a lot of structures in it. I like drawing people more. That&#8217;s always been my thing. I&#8217;ve always liked drawing characters, so structures and boats and street cars and stuff, I&#8217;ve never really done a lot of that. And that added to the challenge. So, executing that, it was a lot for me, but ultimately I&#8217;m glad I took that on. I thought it came out pretty nice, all things considered.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have any upcoming projects that you can talk about? Anything you&#8217;re excited about?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if this would be considered upcoming, but the book that I have recently illustrated for Lamar Giles that is going to be coming out next month, and I&#8217;m actually pretty excited about that one. So, I mean, I don&#8217;t know if I would call that an upcoming project because I&#8217;ve already finished it, but we haven&#8217;t gotten the printed books yet. And so I&#8217;m honestly very excited to see how it will come out on paper, because I&#8217;ve seen what it looks like on my computer, but I want to see it in book form. It&#8217;s just an entirely new feeling you get when you actually see your work just tangible and you can hold it in your hand and on a professional level, because you can print out your own stuff at Office Depot or something, but it&#8217;s not the same as this is a book that&#8217;s going to be in Barnes &#038; Noble.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost so weird because I never thought that I would ever get to this point in my life where I would actually be seeing my name on the cover of children&#8217;s books or seeing the book actually in store somewhere. So, that&#8217;s pretty cool and I&#8217;m excited to actually get some copies of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I mean I think it&#8217;s always an accomplishment when something you do makes it on a book or a magazine or something like that, because it&#8217;s so finite. Things that are on the web can get redesigned or deleted or moved or stuff like that. But a book or a magazine or something like that, that&#8217;s permanent.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
It&#8217;s exciting. Like he said, it&#8217;s not the same. I mean you can post all your stuff on Instagram and I mean nothing&#8217;s wrong with that or anything. It&#8217;s great to have your stuff out there, but it&#8217;s totally different to go outside and see your work there at the store and other people actually see it. And people that might not even have Instagram or Twitter, they can see your work, and people that are working in these industries, they can actually see your work. And that&#8217;s almost like an out of body experience sometimes thinking about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s a really big deal. It&#8217;s a big deal. I think it&#8217;s a big deal. I want to get more into your work and your career, but before that, I want to learn more just about you. As you mentioned earlier, you&#8217;re a New Orleans native. Tell me about growing up in New Orleans. Did you do a lot of creative stuff as a kid?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I did. I don&#8217;t know if that necessarily had to do a lot with me living in New Orleans, I did have a lot of opportunities to be creative growing up. We did have a lot of stuff at our schools where we could paint murals and things on the walls. I had this one art teacher in elementary school, Mr. Baldwin, and he had all of the art students paint this, I guess, prehistoric scene of all the dinosaurs on the cafeteria wall, and I thought that was so much fun. I wish I could do more things like that. I just always liked collaborative types of projects and things that were always, I guess, larger than life, at least to me. Because like I was saying before with the book, it&#8217;s different when everybody can see it like that. And I think as a child, that really pushed the importance of artwork to me because it didn&#8217;t just trivialize it as this little hobby that kindergartners do when they draw with crayon on paper and things like that.</p>
<p>It actually took our craft seriously and it encouraged us to pursue what we were doing. It gave a credence to art, and I think that that&#8217;s always important for little kids that enjoy that stuff. I think that it&#8217;s always important to encourage what they&#8217;re doing because that&#8217;s something that needs to be fostered, that&#8217;s something that needs to be developed. And if it&#8217;s something that they really enjoy and that they want to go forward with it, I don&#8217;t see why you shouldn&#8217;t encourage it and give them opportunities to push them and put their work out there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Was your family really supportive of you going in that route?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah, they always have been. So, like I was saying before, I&#8217;ve been drawing since I was able to pick up a pencil. I don&#8217;t remember this, but this is what my mom told me, so this is what I have to go off of. So, I have just always been drawing things and I guess the things that I was drawing were a little bit more developed than what the average toddler would do, and I guess I was showing that I was able to pick up different forms more than somebody that would have that natural inclination. As I got older, my drawings started getting a little bit more developed, and as I was watching cartoons, I was drawing the cartoons that I saw on TV, and they weren&#8217;t exactly stick figures. I always tried to get them as close as I possibly can with the skills that I had at three years old.</p>
<p>And as I got older, my parents, they noticed what I had and they put me in different programs. They tried to get me in talented art classes at school, and they always wanted to give me a chance to grow as an artist, and they always encouraged what I did. They always saw what I had, they saw the talent that I had, and they always wanted to encourage me to continue doing it and to pursue it. And eventually I ended up pursuing that as a full-time thing. Now, graphic design is different from a illustration, but it&#8217;s still a form of art, and that&#8217;s something that they never stopped me from doing it. They were like, &#8220;No, don&#8217;t do this. Be a lawyer.&#8221; They wanted me to do what I enjoyed doing, and I&#8217;m really grateful for that, that I always had a supportive family that always pushed me to do what would make me happy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I mean, graphic design is a gateway into I think a lot of different just visual designs. I mean back in the day I think it was all just called communication design, and then it splintered off into advertising. And then I think especially with the advent of the personal computer and Photoshop and stuff like that, it became desktop publishing and then it was graphic design. So, it&#8217;s a gateway into a lot of different things. I mean, as you mentioned, you really wanted to do it enough to the point where you ended up studying it. You went to Louisiana State University, majored in graphic design there. How was your time there at the school?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I really liked the time that I had, because they gave us a lot of time to explore a lot of different things. So, with the curriculum that we had, which it was basically called fine arts, the entire degree itself, they gave us opportunities to do a lot of different mediums of art. Your primary major would be graphic design, and that was what was ultimately the focus. But we had classes where we could illustrate, where we could paint. If we wanted to, we could explore photography, we could explore welding and print making.</p>
<p>So, they gave us a lot of different mediums and avenues that we can dip our feet in and see how we liked it, or we could even use those things to apply them to graphic design in a way. So, myself, I&#8217;ve always been interested in illustration. I always wanted to put illustration in my graphic design work, and so when we took a lot of illustration classes there, it also helped me to develop my style and pay attention to a lot of things that maybe I might have been overlooking.</p>
<p>So, it helped me to improve my craft overall when I took illustration classes. And I could always bring that back into graphic design where I could maybe draw characters and now my characters look more refined, or I could draw different symbols, and now everything looks a little better, it looks sharper and it looks more professional. And that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve always liked. So, I don&#8217;t know exactly how every other school tackles this degree, but I really did like that about it, because it gave us a lot of different options to go in. You weren&#8217;t exactly forced to do all of them. So, I was never really huge on photography. So, I didn&#8217;t do photography, but I had another option.</p>
<p>If instead I wanted to do painting, or I wanted to do sculpture making, I could do one of those. And that&#8217;s something that I really appreciated. It gave us a lot of different things that we could go into, and I felt like that helped me in the long run because while it gave me a graphic design degree, which helped me getting a full-time job, it also helped me in terms of art in general, because all of those illustration classes, they helped me in terms of anatomy and in terms of composition and things like that, that you can use that in graphic design, but ultimately you could use that in illustration too, because that&#8217;s a lot of what I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean it sounds like the program was really expansive to allow you to just try out a lot of different things and see what you liked the best.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah, they gave us a lot to work with, and that was just a lot of, I don&#8217;t know if you would call them collectives, but they weren&#8217;t exactly our core classes. They were just things that you can pick to add on to what you were doing. And even within graphic design, we still had a lot of things that they gave us that we could explore, like typography and making different graphic symbols and things like that. So, we always had a huge variety, which that was great, honestly, for all of us. Because a lot of people, they branched off and did other things and they found that taking this drawing class, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, now I want to do books.&#8221; Or &#8220;I took this photography class and now I want to do photography and I want to do events.&#8221; And that was always something that I felt was influenced by the fact that we had all of these options.</p>
<p>And I always thought it was really great, and it made the curriculum a lot more fun. I always liked drawing. I always had fun drawing. So, being able to take all these drawing classes, it was nice. And then it gave me a little bit more of an outlet, because graphic design isn&#8217;t always about drawing. Sometimes it&#8217;s about laying out things, and sometimes it can get a little bit monotonous, especially if it&#8217;s all for school projects and things. But if you have time to go on the side and go draw a polar bear or a bowl of fruit, and that&#8217;s something that you enjoy doing, it can make your time in school more enjoyable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So, when you graduated, did you have an idea lined up about what you wanted to do next?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I honestly was not exactly sure, but at the same time, I actually already had an opportunity lined up for me before I even graduated.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
So, a couple of months before I graduated, me and a few other students had gotten recruited by a local business called Impression Works, where we did photo books and greeting cards and things like that, and we could basically do whatever we felt like worked. So, it didn&#8217;t always have to be layout stuff. If we wanted to put illustrations in them, we could, and it gave us a little bit of creative freedom. And that was nice to be able to have during school, because it was a bit of a safety net in terms of having a job when I graduated. But then on top of that, I had a little bit of income coming in while I was in school, and it was flexible because we could do most of our work from home.</p>
<p>So, I was able to just work on projects for work in my free time, and we were still interns/part-time, so we weren&#8217;t totally overloaded with things where we couldn&#8217;t balance homework and senior projects and work work. And that ended up working out for a little while. And then it was a contract job, so once the contract was up after that, I had to try to turn around and try to find something else as soon as I could. And I wasn&#8217;t exactly sure how that was going to work out, because with me being pretty illustration oriented, I wasn&#8217;t sure how I would&#8217;ve liked something that didn&#8217;t really allow me to do that. And I know that a lot of graphic design jobs don&#8217;t really have a heavy focus on that. And so I was always wondering, &#8220;Well, will I be able to fit into another job somewhere or at a real firm?&#8221;</p>
<p>Because I really didn&#8217;t do a whole lot of layout at the time, and I didn&#8217;t have a whole lot of that in my portfolio outside of a couple of school projects. So, I was wondering how that was going to work out. And I ended up landing another full-time job at a company called Sassy Baby. That was a place where we got to design a lot of baby products. So, we would draw the little characters that were on bibs and bath products, and there were a couple little toys and stuff, we designed teethers and things like that. And that actually worked out in terms of capturing the, I guess, the niche that I am in, because being a graphic designer and an illustrator isn&#8217;t always&#8230; it is I guess. A lot of people who are graphic designers, they&#8217;re not illustrators, and a lot of illustrators are not graphic designers.</p>
<p>So, I guess I felt like I was different in that sense. But that job that I found, it ended up working out pretty well because I got to draw cute little characters. And we also had to do a lot of graphic design, we had to do a lot of layout things, we had to do a lot of presentation materials. So, graphic design of course helped me in those aspects. But being an illustrator helped me in terms of being able to capture different likenesses of little bears and bunnies and things like that. That was a pretty nice job, because we got a lot of tangible products out of it. You&#8217;d go in Walmart and you&#8217;d see the bibs that you designed. You&#8217;d see the little patterns of characters and things that you did, and you could go to Target or Meijer or wherever, and you could see the work that you&#8217;ve done, and you&#8217;d see it on full display for people to buy. And that was always cool. And it was always rewarding in a sense, to see your work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m so glad that you said that about a graphic designer&#8217;s not an illustrator. Illustrator&#8217;s not a graphic designer, because I feel like sometimes, and this is really from the company standpoint, they just think it&#8217;s all the same. They think as long as you can do something in design, that you can do everything in design. So, I&#8217;m glad you qualified that by saying that.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve seen a lot of mix ups with that. I will see a lot of illustrators that I follow get all of these requests for, &#8220;Hey, can you do logos?&#8221; And I&#8217;m just like that&#8217;s not the same thing. Just because they can draw Goku does not mean they can give you a professional looking logo for your law firm. This is two totally different forms of art. It&#8217;s an important distinction.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, it&#8217;s an important distinction. And I think it&#8217;s good to stick by that, because I think early in your career you want to be able to do any work that comes your way because you want to be able to prove yourself as a creative. So, even if you are, say for example, really good at illustration and someone says, &#8220;Well, can you do a logo?&#8221; You&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;Well, I mean it&#8217;s a drawing. I can do that.&#8221; But I think it&#8217;s good that you&#8217;re sticking by saying, &#8220;No, I only do illustration. This is what I do. I can&#8217;t do this other thing that you&#8217;re asking for.&#8221;</p>
<p>I mean you probably could technically do it because the skills are transferrable, but I think it&#8217;s good to stick by that because what it does is it strengthens your particular craft in that area. So, people eventually don&#8217;t get it confused. But I feel like that&#8217;s pretty common early on though. You try to do a little bit of everything, one, to see what you can do, and two, because the work just comes your way.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah. And I get that, especially if you&#8217;re just starting out and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any projects and this guy is asking me for a logo, so I&#8217;m just going to take it because I need the money.&#8221; But if that&#8217;s not what you do, you don&#8217;t want to end up getting saddled with that your whole life, trying to struggle to do something that you know you don&#8217;t enjoy doing and you don&#8217;t exactly, I guess, have the equipment for. Because you can definitely do a logo that&#8217;s a drawing. But I mean if this super corporate firm is asking you for a super corporate logo and you draw just characters or buildings and things like that, it&#8217;s not always going to transfer well.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t exactly have, I guess, that same know-how or that same eye to capture what they might want. So, I like to make sure people know that there&#8217;s a difference, because every illustrator that you try to ask for a work from is not going to be equipped to give you what you need, because illustration and graphic design aren&#8217;t the same thing. And I feel like a lot of people just think, &#8220;Oh, art is art,&#8221; but that&#8217;s just not how it is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Now you&#8217;re represented by Inkyverse, which is a agency. They rep a lot of animators, artists, authors. How did you go about getting representation? Did they come to you? Did you seek them out? How did that work?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
They actually came to me. I believe they found me on Instagram, I want to say. So, it was, I think not too long after I had posted this graphic that I did. It was the Salt Girl, the Salt of the Earth thing that I did. And that went viral, and I think that&#8217;s what got me noticed by the agency. They reached out to me, they actually sent me a text because I had my number on my resume and they were like, &#8220;Hey, this is Inkyverse and we are looking to see if you would be interested in commercial art representation.&#8221; And then I followed up with, &#8220;This is not a scam, this is real?&#8221; Like okay.</p>
<p>I was like, &#8220;Well, thank God for clarifying.&#8221; I sure was about to just block the number. They said that they would keep in touch with me, and we ended up having a conversation over the phone. The agent that I was speaking to, Katrina, she was going over everything that having an agent entailed and how having an agent can help you find high profile clients and they can help you to establish rates for yourself and they can basically just manage you. And I was like, &#8220;That sounds pretty good to me. So, I mean I don&#8217;t see why I would say no personally.&#8221; I mean I never was really good with managing everything that I had. I was always really bad with trying to figure out rates that I wanted to charge for myself. So, I mean I was like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll go for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I mean the worst that could happen is that I might not like it and I can just say I don&#8217;t want to do it anymore. So far it&#8217;s really been a blessing to have an agent and work with Inkyverse, because having a lot of these major companies reach out to me, not having an agent would have been terrifying because I would not know what to say. I would not know what money to ask for. I wouldn&#8217;t know how to fight back against that, because especially if you&#8217;re pretty green, it&#8217;s like you don&#8217;t want to say the wrong thing and be like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, I just ruined this entire opportunity because I have asked them for the wrong amount or I said the wrong thing, or whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, it really helped to have somebody, I guess, go back and forth on my behalf that actually knows the industry and actually knows the standards and actually knows what to ask for, what is fair. That&#8217;s been a huge help in getting me fair rates for projects, for getting the amount of time that I would get for things. I mean it&#8217;s been good to have somebody to look over contracts and things and make sure nothing weird is in them before I sign them. And that&#8217;s something that I really like having and I would definitely recommend other artists do so if it is at all possible to have somebody to, I guess, be your help where you need it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean I&#8217;ve had other illustrators on the show before that are also represented by agents and they&#8217;ve talked about how it just helps them to focus on the work. They don&#8217;t have to handle all the administrative emails and contracts and all this stuff. They can just focus on doing the work when it comes in, and it&#8217;s just such a big benefit for them. And it&#8217;s really cool that they reached out to you, they saw your work and wanted you to be a part of what they&#8217;re building.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Yeah, and I was honestly really blown away by that. I was, &#8220;Really? Me? How did you even get here?&#8221; It was really exciting. I was like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you would want me to do this.&#8221; And then even more so with the random text, I was like, &#8220;Are we sure this isn&#8217;t a scam and you&#8217;re not going to ask me for my credit card number next? I feel like this is too good to be true.&#8221; But it was really nice to be able to have somebody who works in that industry say, &#8220;Hey, we think your work is so good and that it can make a whole bunch of money, so we want you here.&#8221; Not to say that my representative is just like, &#8220;Hey, we just want you for the money,&#8221; because I didn&#8217;t want it to sound like that, but it&#8217;s nice to know that your artwork is appreciated in a professional sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. How do you stay up to date with the latest design and illustration trends? Like you mentioned pop culture being a big part of your work, pop culture and television. How do you stay up to date with trends in the industry?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I personally would say that I try to do somewhat of a research. I don&#8217;t know if I could 100% call it research. Well, I guess I could, yeah. I try to research some things when I have time to do so. At my previous job for graphic design, we always used different magazines and publications and even Pinterest to stay up to date with what was trending and what was up-to-date and designs that we can pull from that won&#8217;t look dated. And I do use that to a certain degree when it comes to illustration work, but I also do like to look into a lot of fashion.</p>
<p>I follow a lot of fashion bloggers and I&#8217;m always looking at things on TikTok and stuff like that, because that&#8217;s always been an influence on my style as well. I like drawing illustrations that incorporate a lot of fashion. I like looking at different, I guess, design when it comes to fashion on TV or in movies or things like that. I try to pay attention to those things and pay attention to, I guess, what is out now and what I could probably see in the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is one of the newer trends right now?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
You mean in terms of fashion?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I mean like, yeah, I guess in general, as you look at it as to how you might apply it to your work, do you see any trends that you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, I might want to try that out?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Honestly, I&#8217;ve been looking at a whole lot of fashion.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I mean fashion could be that inspiration, it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Sometimes I look at a lot of just things that I see just online, and it doesn&#8217;t have to be anything in particular, but if I feel like something is particularly striking, I might pull some inspiration from it, from what I see on there. I guess as of right now, I&#8217;ve been liking a lot of, I want to say suits and things in that general area. That&#8217;s always been something that&#8217;s been drawing my attention. I don&#8217;t know if that is exactly the trendiest thing overall now in terms of I guess business and things like that. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people doing those kinds of things on TikTok and whatever. That&#8217;s always something that I wanted to incorporate in some of my illustrations as well. Now, in terms of now, I wouldn&#8217;t say a pulling a whole lot of things from now in particular, or some things that are trendy now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you say that your style as an illustrator and a designer has evolved over the years?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I have definitely gained a better understanding of composition, and I want to say anatomy and layout. Basically everything that I worked on, I feel like it has elevated. I feel like I&#8217;ve really grown to have a better understanding of what works and how things should look, how I can utilize the different spaces of things and create, I guess, a better and more fluent composition. I also feel that I&#8217;ve grown in the sense where I&#8217;ve been able to refine how my characters look. I went really back and forth with a lot of different styles and trying to figure out what worked and trying to figure out how I should paint things and should I do things that are really stylistic? Should I do things that are realistic? It&#8217;s always been experimental and trying to figure out how I want things to look overall and what I felt worked for me.</p>
<p>And I think I&#8217;ve found, I guess, a good middle ground of how I want my illustrations and how I want my designs to look. But I think just having more of a knowledge of shapes and color and growing in those areas has really helped my design and illustration work to flourish. And I have also accepted the fact that everything is not always going to look the same. So, I know a lot of artists have a particular style. I know a lot of people, including myself, have always felt like you should just have one style and that should be it, and you shouldn&#8217;t really do anything else. As I&#8217;ve grown, I&#8217;ve learned that you could just do whatever you want. I mean if I want to do something realistic one day, I can do that. If I want to do something stylized another day, I can do that.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that I don&#8217;t have a style, and it doesn&#8217;t mean that I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing. It just happens. You might want to experiment, you might just want to do something different. I mean I think that that really just shows that you just have a lot to offer as an artist. I mean it just shows that you have the skill to be able to go back and forth and do a variety of things. And I don&#8217;t think anything&#8217;s wrong with that, which unfortunately a lot of people still feel that way. But I think that I would always encourage artists to just do what you enjoy doing. If you want to do a lot of different things, I say go for it, as long as you&#8217;re not burning yourself out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I guess speaking of that, how do you handle those periods when you might be burnt out or you might just have low motivation? How do you handle that?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
So, overall I try to just take breaks in between my work. I try not to rush things, and I always am pretty careful about not overbooking myself, especially keeping in mind that I do have a full-time job and I&#8217;m trying to juggle freelance and whatever else I have. I always want to make sure I&#8217;m trying to gauge my time properly and see what I actually have room to do, because I don&#8217;t want to get to that point where I&#8217;m just like I&#8217;m completely just worn out and I just can&#8217;t do anything. I think that it&#8217;s very important to take breaks when you can. I always try to set aside some time or a day or whatever to just do nothing or just have fun or maybe watch a movie or play a game or just something, something not work related. But there have been times where I just didn&#8217;t have a choice.</p>
<p>I just had to power through something. And I felt like what just motivated me to get it done is just to try to have as much fun with it as possible. There&#8217;s been projects that I&#8217;ve worked on and I just try to, I guess, put a little bit of myself into it and just use that as a way to express myself, which wasn&#8217;t exactly discouraged in the project. And that helped me to, I guess, think of the project that I had to work on or something that was just more fun, something that I could enjoy. Not thinking about it as, &#8220;I have to get this done right now because the deadline is tomorrow, and if I don&#8217;t, then the whole project is ruined.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought about it as this is something that I&#8217;m enjoying doing and I just want to do it. And in times where I am just getting a bit pushed, that&#8217;s what I try to think about. I try to think about it as something enjoyable. I try to just take my time with it as much as I can and have fun with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you hope people take away from your work when they look at it?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I would hope that they could see the beauty in a lot of these different characters. I like to do a lot of black girls and black women, and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen, because you have seen my portfolio, but little black kids. I like to draw a lot of that stuff. And growing up, I had issues where I want to say I had lower self-esteem than I should have had. I never really felt like I was cute. I didn&#8217;t think that I was pretty, because I would see a lot of the cartoons, like the heroes and the love interests on a lot of cartoons, and they wouldn&#8217;t look like me. And that is what made me want to put a lot of black features and characters into my artwork, because while we did see a lot of that growing up, I felt like we didn&#8217;t exactly see as much as we probably should have gotten.</p>
<p>Black characters were always like the sidekicks sometimes, and they didn&#8217;t always get time to shine. And that&#8217;s something that always impacted me growing up. And so I like to put that into my work. I like to show people, like anyone that we are beautiful and nothing is wrong with our features. Our features are beautiful. They make us unique, they make us who we are. And I think that that&#8217;s something that I wanted to put in my work, because I want everybody to be able to embrace that. So, I always hope that little kids and adults alike can take that away from what I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to someone, they&#8217;re out here listening to your story, they&#8217;re hearing about your work and everything. What advice would you give them if they want to follow in your footsteps?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
The advice that I would give to anybody that might want to pursue a career in art or graphic design, I would say that don&#8217;t be afraid to do what you know you want to do. Have fun doing it. I would say that if this is something that you really enjoy and you really see yourself doing this in the future, and you know you really want to go into these different arenas where you can use your art for animation or books. So, I mean I would encourage anybody that wants to pursue art to just go for it. I don&#8217;t think that you should let anything scare you from doing it. If it&#8217;s something that you enjoy doing I say, why not do it?</p>
<p>I mean it&#8217;s something that it&#8217;s always been fun to me. I could never really see myself doing anything else. And so I felt like this is what I had to pursue, this is what I was going to do. And I know that there&#8217;s other people that feel that way and I feel that they should go forward with it, because I mean why keep yourself from doing something that you enjoy doing and that you can make a living off of it. And I know a lot of people feel that it&#8217;s harder to actually make a living off your work than doing other things, but I believe that we have so many examples out that shows that that&#8217;s actually a possibility. You can work in animation, you can do books, you can even do things like ads and partnerships with brands.</p>
<p>You can do flyers, you can design things for brands, branding or whatever. There&#8217;s so many options that you can explore, things that you can put your talents toward. There&#8217;s so many options that you can look into that you can use your skills to make it tangible and make it real. So, I would say that you shouldn&#8217;t limit yourself and you shouldn&#8217;t hold yourself back if you&#8217;re afraid that you might not be able to get different opportunities, or you are afraid that you might not be able to get into this certain arena so there&#8217;s nothing you can do, because there&#8217;s a lot of things that we, as artists, we don&#8217;t really think about how many opportunities that they really have out there.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a lot. It&#8217;s just the possibilities are endless. And on top of that, I would encourage people to always have fun with what they&#8217;re doing. Never be afraid to experiment and do different things. Just have fun. Just enjoy it. Take time to perfect your craft. Take time to practice. You always want to take time to pour into it, because if this is something that you&#8217;ll enjoy doing and you want to put yourself out there and you want to continue to grow, I mean you always want to keep doing it. You always want to keep those, I guess, creative gears turning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
I&#8217;m honestly not 100% sure. I honestly never thought I would even see myself where I&#8217;m at now five years ago. It&#8217;s different for me. If there is something in particular that I could be doing down the line, I&#8217;ve always been interested in animation of course, because it&#8217;s always been a huge inspiration for me. And I&#8217;ve always wanted to work maybe in an animated series, maybe like creating some characters or concept work or visual development or something along those lines. So, here&#8217;s hoping that maybe at some point in my career the door may open for that. I&#8217;m just here to see where life takes me as of right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
So, I am on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok at morg_city. Also on Facebook at Morgan Bissant, all one word. I have a website, morganbissant.com, and you can basically see most of my portfolio on there, and you can find links to my social pages at the bottom.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Morgan Bissant, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you really for talking about I mean, one, your journey as an artist, as an illustrator, as a designer, and how it&#8217;s brought you to where you are now. But I really think it&#8217;s good that you talked about your process, you shared your inspirations, you shared your experiences. My hope is that when people listen back through this interview, and especially once they get a chance to really look at your work, they&#8217;ll be able to get a good overall view of who you are as an artist and the work that you&#8217;re bringing into the world. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Bissant:</b><br>
Well, thank you so much for having me. This is definitely a pleasure speaking with you.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t see it in the world, see that as an opportunity.&#8221; Wise words from this week&#8217;s guest, the one and only Joseph Cuillier. Joseph is perhaps most well known for <a href="https://theblack.school/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">The Black School</a>, an experimental art school teaching Black/PoC students and allies to become agents of change through art workshops on radical Black politics and public interventions that address local community needs.</p>
<p>I spoke to Joseph fresh from his move back to New Orleans, and he spoke on how the city feels now in the midst of gentrification and other new developments. We also spoke on his work with The Black School and the school&#8217;s principles, the unique studio model that helps fund the school, and how he works to center Black love in such a unique learning space. Joseph is truly building upon a family legacy to help educate the next generation and beyond!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
My name is Joseph Cuillier and I&#8217;m an artist, a designer, and the founder and co-director of The Black School.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How are you holding up these days?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Good. I am good. I just recently moved from New York City. I lived in Harlem for about five years, and Brooklyn before that for about five years. I just moved to new Orleans after 10 years in New York, and I think I&#8217;m much better because of it for a lot of reasons. There&#8217;s been a pandemic and people have been trapped in small apartments, in cold climates, and it&#8217;s good to get away from that. It&#8217;s good to be closer to family, I see my family a lot even though I lived in a different part of the country from them. I would come home holidays and summers, and that was difficult not being able to see my family. Being closer makes it so much easier. And trees and sunshine man, that&#8217;s a long way. That&#8217;s long way, and good food, and good people, and good music. Everything that makes New Orleans great is healing me at the moment, at this traumatic moment for all of us.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I want to go to new Orleans so bad.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Come through and let me know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I will as soon as all this pandemic mess is over, and I feel comfortable jumping on a plane I want to go to New Orleans.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Yeah. Hopefully sooner than later.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know you&#8217;ve been away for 10 years, but does the city feel different to you now?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
It is very different. To be clear, I moved to New York from Houston. I was living in Houston at the time, but both sides of my family are from new Orleans so I would always be here. Holidays, summers, things like that or whenever, a birthday party, it&#8217;s family reunion, just to come down and see family. I think new Orleans is going through a lot of the things a lot of black cities and black communities around the country are going through. There&#8217;s gentrification, there&#8217;s new things happening in this city for better or worse. And I think a lot of people feel frustrated because they&#8217;re not being included in the decision-making of the new thing.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Or the new thing is coming and that means you have to leave which is messed up. There&#8217;s a lot of displacement in New Orleans, and in a way it&#8217;s a little bit more kind of celebrated due to the aftermath of Katrina, and the displacement that man-made disaster created. It is very different but in a lot of ways it&#8217;s still the same. There the blackness, there&#8217;s deep love, there&#8217;s deep creativity that is just baked into the city that I don&#8217;t think gentrification is strong enough to ever change that. Natural disaster or anything I don&#8217;t think is strong enough to change that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has it been kind of working and moving through this pandemic? Was that a loaded question?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a layered question. A layered question. What does that mean to me as a husband and a father? What does that mean to me as a designer or an artist? What does that mean to me as a person that creates platforms? A person that brings people together to exchange knowledge? First it&#8217;s been difficult but not insurmountable. Our family, we found ways to make the best of it. We found ways to still have romance between me and my wife. We have our indoor dates or our out in the park dates. We found ways to meet with folks, meet up at the park, chill on the porch, chill at the patio, things like that. And as a kind of artists and designer it&#8217;s been a shift. For me it&#8217;s been less about making work and showing work and more about purpose, more about spirituality, more about laying foundations.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
And before the pandemic we were rolling, I talk in the we because I don&#8217;t do this work alone. My wife is my partner in life and in our endeavors, our ventures in the world. Shani Peters, she&#8217;s an artist very much in her own right doing really big things. And also just the work I do is very collective, I bring people together to work on issues and problems much larger than one person could address or transform. This slow down gave us the opportunity to refocus and think about the long-term vision for the work. The Black School was in New York, it was functioning as this kind of school that was mobile in architecture, so we would attach ourselves to host other schools, would be high schools, middle schools, youth organizations, art institutions, and we would do programming and collaboration.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
And now we couldn&#8217;t really do that, we couldn&#8217;t get people together. I mean we shifted some stuff to Zoom, but it&#8217;s only so much that could shift and keep going the way the world was turning. We shifted to thinking about where we wanted to take the organization. After all these years of programmatic success doing the art school, doing The Black Love Fest, doing the design apprenticeship, we felt like we really needed a space of our own. That meant sharing that idea with the people and be like, &#8220;What do you think? Is this something you would support?&#8221; The response we got was overwhelming yes. Folks came out of the woodwork, we ended up raising 300K to build the community center in my hometown of New Orleans. We&#8217;ve raised money for staffing the school, we&#8217;ve made all these connections of people who want to support in any way they can.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Long answer, the shift, the slowing down, the re-jiggering we had to do to work in this moment meant that we had to do some deep thinking, and some deep listening, and have some deep conversations to really think about, &#8220;We&#8217;re standing still, how do we see the future? How do we want to see the future?&#8221; Because we have a moment now to really think about the future. And for us that meant moving to New Orleans and trying to build a school, trying to build a radical black art school in the Seventh Ward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s jump more into The Black School, because I&#8217;ve been hearing about it for years now from different folks who I&#8217;ve had on the show. I was a mentor at&#8230; Well, I guess you could call it the mentor. I don&#8217;t know. I think they called it mentorship at NEW INC in New York City. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s where I first heard about it, but I definitely heard about it during my time kind of mentoring and helping advise folks there. I really want to learn more about in essence what this radical black art school is all about. For those who are listening who may not know, can you just talk a little bit about the school and its mission? And we can sort of dive in from there.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
The Black School is an experimental art school that teaches young folks and old folks black history, design, activism. And the idea is radicalizing our people to envision a future where we&#8217;re not just tolerated, but a future that we create, that we build with our own hands so it&#8217;s a radical black art school.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now there&#8217;s a lot of different principles that the school follows, among them self-love, prison abolition, environmental justice, LGBTQIA rights. How are these principles reflected to students?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Well, the principles were developed by students. The first workshop we did was we did this community engaged research. This high school in Brooklyn, we went around the surrounding area and within the school. And we asked folks what you love about your community? What you want to change about your community? And what The Black School should teach? And based off of that feedback we got from folks we did this principle, this platform creating exercise, where we just went through the things, the issues, the ideas that folks are raising. And then we distilled them down into these overarching principles. And we&#8217;ve continued to add as we go, especially looking back to ancestors, the history, the things that were laid down for us before we even got here. And we took those kind of principles and built this larger kind of I guess rubric to learn from.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
And that includes self-love, it includes black love more specifically, and includes all the guiding principles of many different black radical organizations. We took inspiration from all these different ways black radicalism has popped up through feminist initiatives, queer initiatives, art movements. And that&#8217;s kind of how we came up with the principles, and we share those back in our card deck, we share them back in our website, we share them back in the topics that we explore in the school. Maybe a workshop will be based on this one principle or these two principles. We are making sure our young people know what we stand for, know something that possibly they can stand for, and are aware of a political language to describe the experiences that are happening in the world.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
They may see white folks from out of town moving into their grandmother neighborhood, they may see the cost of living in their neighborhood going up, they may see the bodega start to sell different things, but they may not know what gentrification is. And they may not know the history or the tactics that folks have used in the past to fight those issues. It&#8217;s our idea that we create learning tools, and learning opportunities to share that back with folks so they can know what to do, so they can know that they don&#8217;t have to recreate the wheel every time they see a problem. They can just build on what&#8217;s already beneath them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now the interesting part about the school is that it also contains a design studio, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Yeah. The Black School studio is full service design firm. We do client work. I&#8217;m traditionally trained as a graphic designer. It was a matter of seeing the teaching that I&#8217;m doing. Since I graduated that&#8217;s not just something I do on the side, but at the center of my practice. And the studio allows me to do that to the greater extent. We do client services, we have experienced upper level designers, but we also have apprentice. And the design apprentice are young folks, high school age who have no experience in graphic design. We teach them the basics, the fundamentals of graphic design, typography, image making, grids, all of those fundamental things. And then we teach them Photoshop, Illustrator InDesign. And then once they know just those basics, then we put them on actual client projects so that they&#8217;re learning on the job from seasoned designers.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
And we&#8217;re collectively creating too, because I mean what company doesn&#8217;t buy and sale, or trade on black cool? What company doesn&#8217;t use black youth culture to move their message forward or sell their products? It&#8217;s our idea that instead of having all these people coming into our community take the things we create and sell them back to us, how about we talk to our community? How about we communicate with each other in the ways we know how? And how about we harness the power and energy of black youth culture, a culture that has made it all around the globe and back? And right now black youth culture is the culture, so how about we harness that power? And that&#8217;s the idea, that&#8217;s the vision behind the design school being rooted in a school&#8230; I mean, that&#8217;s the vision behind the design firm being rooted in a black school.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And how do the studio and the school work together? Does the studio help fund the school or what are some ways that they work together?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the vision. When you&#8217;re doing this type of work it becomes very easy to become very reliant on grants, donations. And that may be fine but what happens when funding trends change? Right now black people and black liberation is kind of a hot topic but 10 years ago it wasn&#8217;t, we were in a post-racial society. What if we go back to a post racial society quote unquote, and these foundations start funding other causes, other issues more aggressively. I mean is what we&#8217;re doing really self-determined? If that&#8217;s the case, in my opinion the answer is no. Not to say the money we get from foundations isn&#8217;t cool, that&#8217;s our money, that&#8217;s the money, the wealth our great grandparents have generated for this country. But being realistic we need our own.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
I believe in black nationalism. I think we need our own everything, but we definitely need our own sources of revenue if we&#8217;re going to run a sustainable organization. The idea from the design firm is the design firm can generate income, earn income and fund the school. Now it&#8217;s two years old so we&#8217;re not there yet. We&#8217;re still kind of trying to figure out how it works, how it functions but that&#8217;s the idea. But the school and the design firm they&#8217;re kind of tied together. And we have students from the art school that come through the design firm. Students that show a little bit more interest, students that maybe want to learn more about graphic design specifically, students that may need opportunity to make some money, need a job, or a seasonal job or something.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
This is our way of generating income for our community. Because it would be irresponsible to go to black youth and be like, &#8220;There&#8217;s economic future for you in art.&#8221; Because honestly I&#8217;m a professional artist, my wife&#8217;s a professional artist, and it&#8217;s hard to make money out of art. It&#8217;s hard for us. We do all these other things and generate income in all these other ways, so I wouldn&#8217;t feel comfortable setting some young people that come from disadvantaged backgrounds, that are economically oppressed. I would be irresponsible to tell them, &#8220;You know what, you can make a living in art.&#8221; I mean you can, but I need to give you the tools, I need to give you the map, and the pathways that I found to make a living in art. And design is one of those pathways.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. I mean, that makes sense, you want to definitely&#8230; Especially with kids at that age, they see a lot more than I think we think they do in terms of picking up on patterns and behaviors and stuff like that. And it is one thing to say, &#8220;We&#8217;re the black school and we want to do these things.&#8221; But then also&#8230; Or even as you&#8217;re saying, making money as an artist but then having to do these other things. You don&#8217;t want to lie to them essentially.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Yeah. I don&#8217;t want to send them out in the world unprepared like what we call real art schools do. Sending their students out in the world without necessarily the tools to do the most basic of things, sustain their lives. It wouldn&#8217;t be a radically black art school, it would be just an art school if we did that. We do pay our students. It&#8217;s a very different way of looking at schools. We pay our students to learn because we believe our students need it. If you&#8217;re not flipping burgers or stacking grocery sales, how are you going to generate income for yourself, for your household, if we&#8217;re asking you to come spend this time with us learn about black politics, learn about home design, learn about the nexus, where they meet. We have to be realistic about what the needs are of our young people while they are in our care.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then this might&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, this might be a silly question. I think basing some of this off of my personal experience, but as you&#8217;ve been doing this have you been getting a lot of black community support financially?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Yeah. We did a crowdfunding campaign to go fund me. I mean, everybody supported, black, white, Asian, Latinx. Everybody supported, saw the vision, but a lot of our support was from black folks. Monetarily, just connections we made. The black folks at Adobe reached out, folks that work there. We found ourselves in very different places, and we find ourselves with a lot of resources that the story being told about us is like we all come from a lack. But there is a lot of resources in our community. [inaudible 00:25:25] showed up with those resources, made what we do even possible. If it wasn&#8217;t for the black community there would be no Black School.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, as we&#8217;re recording this, and it&#8217;s interesting because we were supposed to do this a while back. And I know you were moving and everything, had a bunch of stuff kind of going on. But I had written back then&#8230; And just so people who are listening, this was&#8230; When was this? About the fall last year I think we were supposed to record initially?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I wrote down about how several major cities in the US have been protesting against the death of black people at the hands of police. Fast forward to now, same thing. And then you of course have all these companies that are committing themselves to at least saying black lives matter. Although it&#8217;s now been shortened out to BLM and I feel some kind of way about that, how quickly people just sort of roll it off the tongue. How are you talking about these things at the school?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
That&#8217;s funny that you say it because there is this linguistic activism, insane black lives matter. I never thought about that, shortening it to BLM defeats the point. But you&#8217;re right, you got something there. But I&#8217;m sorry I was distracted by what you just put on me there genuinely. Say again the end of your question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. How are you talking about what&#8217;s happening now? I guess I could say two black people, but there&#8217;s a lot of shit happening to black people right now. But I&#8217;m speaking specifically about people protesting against the death of black people at the hands of police, companies that are now kind of coming on and giving their support and saying that they support black lives even if it&#8217;s just for show. How are you talking about these sort of metacultural thing at the school?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
How are we talking about it? It&#8217;s hard for me to say specifically to this moment, but generally it&#8217;s been a while now that the light bulb came on for me. And I realized that history is a cycle, and you say from fall to now we&#8217;re in spring, this cycle has turned over once more. And our folks are in the street, and companies are pandering pretty much to the movement the same way it happened this past summer. This happened when I graduated from Pratt around the same time while I was at school. I was in graduate school for design and Trayvon happened and it was there&#8230; It wasn&#8217;t there that happened. Everything that&#8217;s happening now has happened to a lesser extent. It&#8217;s more intense now but it was happening. Then Eric Garner happened a couple of years later.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Well, I&#8217;m referencing George Zimmerman getting off, because that was a moment for me because I didn&#8217;t see him getting off. If I&#8217;d only looked at history, of course he was getting off. There was no way he was going to jail if I looked at history. But we get into these moments where we just forget about history, everything&#8217;s out of the window, we live in a new world. But history tells us this cycle of black people being brutalized comes to a boiling point and black folks said, &#8220;No more.&#8221; And white folks say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s figure this out, let&#8217;s make this right.&#8221; Then time passes, white folks stop caring, black folks continue to be brutalized, boom cycle continues. That&#8217;s why The Black School exists, to be 365 know.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Every day of the year to yell that we need our own. How many times are white folks going to have to tell us no before we realize the answer is no. You want your freedom, you want your justice, you want economic opportunities, the answer has always been no. We ask they say no, we ask they say no, we ask they say no. And the cycle happens where the no&#8217;s are replaced to, &#8220;Maybe.&#8221; The no&#8217;s are replaced with, &#8220;Okay. Give us some time.&#8221; The no&#8217;s are replaced to, &#8220;Later.&#8221; But always behind all of that facade it&#8217;s always no. This moment still weighs heavy on my shoulders, it&#8217;s not like it doesn&#8217;t affect me anymore. But I know that this is just a cycle, I know they&#8217;re not going to stop killing us.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
I just know it and it&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m a psychic, history tells me. 400 years in this country tell me, if I opened up the books they wrote it&#8217;s going to tell me. I just got to take that note and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to build with my people. And my vision and what I would love to see in the world is a black nation for Black Americans.&#8221; Of course there&#8217;s a lot of black nations in this world, but a nation for Black Americans, that&#8217;s my goal. And if that&#8217;s not the answer, cool, but that&#8217;s the direction I&#8217;m walking in. We need all of it, it needs to be ours. What that looks like I don&#8217;t know, but we need our own.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does it look like to center black love in a learning space?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
I think it looks like we all have seen it in our own experience. Maybe it&#8217;s learning from your mother over the kitchen table, or maybe it&#8217;s learning from a grandfather out in the garage and the driveway. There&#8217;s all these ways we learn in our community that are rooting in love, and rooting in care, and rotting in blackness. I think we can look to that, go back to history, we look at our personal histories and what kind of learning spaces felt loving, and felt effective? What kind of learning spaces worked for me? You&#8217;ll probably think of your living room, you&#8217;ll probably think of your kitchen, you&#8217;ll probably think of your backyard. That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re taking inspiration for the architecture of the school. Whether that be bricks or just how we&#8217;re structuring the curriculum, how we&#8217;re exchanging when we&#8217;re in this space, how we&#8217;re talking to each other, how we&#8217;re laying out the desks.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
We don&#8217;t even have desks, because when I think about the ways I like to learn it wasn&#8217;t in the desks. It was maybe over a work table, maybe it was an artist studio and it was over a work table, maybe it was in a circle on the floor. It&#8217;s all these other ways that are not being showed or even explored in the conventional school. One way is asking folks what they want to learn, not walking into a space with any assumptions. Before we start a workshop we ask our students what you love about your community? What you want to change about your community? And we may show up with screen printing supplies, or collage materials, we may show up with part of the workshop. But the rest of it, what we&#8217;re making, why we&#8217;re making it, who we&#8217;re making it for, that comes from the students.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
We are sharing the skills we have and the resources we&#8217;ve been able to generate and acquire, but it is an exchange. They are sharing their experiences, they&#8217;re sharing their needs, they&#8217;re sharing their passions, and that&#8217;s the learning community. It goes both ways, it&#8217;s not a teacher at the front, students lined up at the back. They are empty vessels, I have the knowledge, I put the knowledge into the empty vessels, they go out into the world [inaudible 00:34:30] repeat. It&#8217;s not like that. It&#8217;s really about you know about this very specific thing in the world, I know about this other very specific thing in the world, let&#8217;s put it together and what could we build?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now there&#8217;s a third part to The Black School. I know we talked about the actual school itself, we&#8217;ve also talked about the studio. There&#8217;s this sort of third component to the ecosystem which is events. How have you been able to keep that going even with this sort of pandemic that&#8217;s keeping people apart?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
We haven&#8217;t kept it going. We have done workshops which is events, but specifically Black Love Fest, our music festival we do, we just paused it. Right now it&#8217;s going on the second year. We do it every summer, so last summer we didn&#8217;t do, this summer we&#8217;re not doing it. When it comes back it will be in collaboration with the New Orleans African American museum so it will be in New Orleans. The past three years it was in New York city two years, and then Houston at Project Row Houses.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
If you&#8217;re into the black school and the work we do check out Project Row Houses if you haven&#8217;t already, because they are the precedence that we&#8217;re working off. They&#8217;re the antecedent, they are the ancestors when we&#8217;re talking about ancestors that have done it, are still doing it. We essentially paused it, which was needed, we were tired anyway before the pandemic even came. And there&#8217;s no sense in getting people together and potentially hurting the people that the whole intention of the festival is to care for our people. It would just be a contradiction. And honestly I&#8217;m Zoomed out. I&#8217;m Zoned out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hear you.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
No more Zoom so we&#8217;re not doing a Zoom festival. I don&#8217;t think the intention behind the festival would even translate to Zoom. The intention is a barbecue, a cookout with some guiding principles behind it that we&#8217;ve talked about already. We can&#8217;t recreate everything in the digital space, we can&#8217;t create the real barbecue that we&#8217;re trying to create in a virtual space. It just makes sense to pause it, again do some deep listening, some deep thinking, some deep compensation. And then bring it back when we&#8217;re ready, when the world is ready for it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, when we started doing&#8230; Or we were going to do a live tour in 2020 with Revision Path. I had been talking to a couple of AIGA chapters, and we had started the tour. I started in February in LA, did a show out there in Leimert Park with a local architect. It was great, standing room only. And when we&#8217;ve done past events&#8230; And I get what you&#8217;re saying, it&#8217;s the actual space itself that becomes this crucible for fellowship that you just can&#8217;t recreate over a Zoom call. Even when we&#8217;ve done events in New York, we&#8217;ve done events here in Atlanta. And for me the best thing about the event is when it ends, and people are still staying around talking for an hour, hour and a half, the venue-</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Stacking up their plate metaphorically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; Right. The venue&#8217;s kicked us out, we&#8217;re standing outside and folks are like, &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s go to a bar and keep talking, or let&#8217;s go to a restaurant or something.&#8221; That kind of fellowship you just can&#8217;t do the same thing over Zoom. When the lockdown sort of first started happening and the chapters were getting back to me like, &#8220;Oh, well we can do a Zoom call and we can do this.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do that. I&#8217;m already Zooming enough for work and I don&#8217;t want to have to try to do the same thing over Zoom.&#8221; One, because it&#8217;s just not the same. What I think the audience gets out of it aside from listening to the people, is to actually meet up with other black creatives in their city that they may not even know about. The fact that the event exists means that people are coming to it, and without that actual physical event then it&#8217;s just not the same.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Yeah. There&#8217;s a lot of things the internet can do, what you&#8217;re describing ain&#8217;t one of them. We haven&#8217;t figured that out yet with the internet. I think the intention is to love up on each other, the vision is to create this movement that will get us to where we need to go. When we&#8217;re doing the festival in Project Row Houses, Fox News actually came by. The local Fox chapter not the Fox News, but the local Fox station came by. And they asked me, &#8220;What is this about? What are you doing?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;This is a movement. The purpose of this is to start a movement for black love, and to center black love at the center of what this country is.&#8221; Don&#8217;t we deserve it? Don&#8217;t we deserve to not just be tolerated, but to be loved after all we&#8217;ve done to literally build this country, to expand the freedoms and the rights of this country, to fight for them, die for them.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
I mean I was a little more and more crass. I was like, &#8220;The intention is for America to pay reparation, and dissolve, and reconstitute under black love.&#8221; I told Fox News that, they did not air it but that&#8217;s at the heart of what we&#8217;re trying to do. And we&#8217;re using the vessel that is the cookout, that is the street art, the public art, that&#8217;s some part of our culture, that is the performative nature. You dress up, we sing, we dance, we do all of these things that is just natural to our way of being, our blackness. And I think that it&#8217;s worth the wait, if it takes two years for the pandemic to subside it&#8217;s worth the wait. So we&#8217;re just going to wait.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now kind of switching gears here a bit from the school which we&#8217;ve talked about for a good while now. You mentioned being in NYC, but you&#8217;re originally kind of between Louisiana and Texas. You kind of mentioned you kind of went back and forth a bit. Being in that sort of part of the South, I&#8217;m pretty sure art, music, and design were kind of a big part of your growing up, right?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Yeah, for sure. I mean, it didn&#8217;t look like graphic design or fine art, but it&#8217;s definitely been with me since day one. The story I tell growing up in Baton Rouge, where I went to elementary and middle school. And my family we would go to Southern University football games, and it&#8217;s a HBCU so we had tailgate. All day before the actual game in the evening, we would barbecue or have a seafood boil. And this was every weekend which is crazy. The amount of food that we would buy, cook, eat with people, it&#8217;s crazy that we did this every weekend. I&#8217;m realizing that as I&#8217;m been growing up, and I am doing seafood boils now, I&#8217;m hosting them or I&#8217;m hosting a barbecue. But the funny moment that I always remember is maybe the week before the season started, my mom came home with a handful of clothes like the Polo&#8217;s and the Tommy&#8217;s. The things we were wearing at the time. And the other brands like the Sean John, and all that, and the FUBU.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
And it was such a moment of joy. I can see now that I was being brought up and cultivated into fashion design. I was being made a connoisseur of design. That may have been the intention consciously, or maybe an intention subconsciously, to have just a big stack of fresh clothes just thrown on my bed like, &#8220;Here, now you&#8217;re set for the whole season.&#8221; And as long as I can remember I&#8217;ve loved fashion, I&#8217;ve loved clothes, and I think that kind of introduced me to design. But when it came time for me to figure out what do I want to make myself as opposed to not just being a connoisseur but a creator. And I tried fashion, I tried street art, I tried a lot of different things, but graphic design was the thing that I don&#8217;t know, just came the most natural to me. And learning about it, learning the history of it, it was fascinating to read about the Bauhaus, read about the International Style, read about the shifts that were happening in art and design in a world that was creating these new ways of thinking, and these new ways of making.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
And technology too, also being so [cordially 00:44:20] in term with it. And that kind of put me to graphic design to study that. But even with that, the medium, the form making was interesting to me, but I think of myself as the designer that doesn&#8217;t really care about design. I know about the Bauhaus, I&#8217;ve been to the Bauhaus, I&#8217;ve been invited to the Bauhaus but I don&#8217;t care anymore. At the time I did, but right now I&#8217;m way more interested in learning about Orishas. I&#8217;m way more interested in learning about my family history, and how that relates to New Orleans. I&#8217;m way more interested in learning about black radical politics. The work I do is me just taking those ways of making and those ways of seeing, and just imply my interest to it. And as a result I think I look a bit different than most designers. Like my career, the things that I make, the things I put out and produce with these skills, in a lot of cases may not even look like design, period.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
But I think that&#8217;s my approach and it comes from those early influences, those early cultivations that my family placed on me. I come from a line of educators. My grandfather Joseph Cuillier, Sr, has a school named after him in New Orleans on the West Bank. There&#8217;s reasons for me to approach art and design from the lens of a educator. And it was kind of put into me before I even realized it was there, it&#8217;s been there. Growing up in Houston, being around Project Row Houses at the time that I was discovering fine art, it kind of put in pressure in my head like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s fine art.&#8221; I learned about fine art in a city that took a very different approach to art. Thanks to the folks that Project Row, and Rick Lowe, and all the artists, and collectives that came together to create their vision. To be clear, Project Row Houses is a organization that started from this artists being challenged by young people in his community.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
They came to the studio, the folks from a local high school, and they saw what he was painting and they were like, &#8220;We don&#8217;t need you to paint about issues happening in our community. We know the issues. Who is this for because it&#8217;s not for us. You&#8217;re a creative person, how about you do something about it? How about you use your creativity and try to apply that to the issues and see if you could get some moving and shaking.&#8221; To have that down the street while I&#8217;m in college, and I&#8217;m just starting to go to galleries, and just starting to go to art spaces, it kind of made me think, &#8220;Oh, this is fine art.&#8221; When really it&#8217;s this ghetto eyes pushed it aside version of fine art that hasn&#8217;t really been supported in the same ways like an object maker is supported in the fine art world. Someone who makes paintings and sculptures. Long story long, the way I came up and where I came up has everything to do with the type of artist, the type of designer I am and I&#8217;m grateful for it. I couldn&#8217;t imagine doing it any other way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. There&#8217;s been this thing that&#8217;s been going around lately around this concept of decolonizing design, where I think the notion is that you&#8217;re sort of introducing different sort of design cultures or things. It&#8217;s a person&#8217;s teaching practice or design practice in order to break them out of particular I would say just Eurocentric design sort of standpoint. Would you say that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish with The Black School? Is something similar to that?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Yes. And I&#8217;m just trying to decolonize not even in a metaphorical sense. I&#8217;m literally trying not to be a colony anymore. My wife was talking on this call and she was talking, and it was a group of folks from around the world. I don&#8217;t remember the country. Or I would&#8217;ve know the callers to even know the country. But it was an African sister and she was saying that decolonization has nothing to do with America. Africa we were colonized, what y&#8217;all got over there is something different. But really the opposite is true. I mean, not the opposite but we are still a colony. The colony never ended, we never decolonized. I feel like design, the tools we have to transform are tools that we can use to just de-colonize, period.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
I do believe decolonizing design is a part of that. We got to learn about the contributions of black folks to the design discipline. But we also have to learn about the contributions of black folks, period. We got to learn about the contributions of black folks to revolutionary thought. We&#8217;ve got to learn about the contributions of black folks to cultivating land, to building economic engine systems. And I think that will help you as a designer of course, but I think it will help us to the eventual goal is liberation, freedom, justice, these bigger ideas. Because I think design has that power. I have a deep faith in art and design, not the art world or the design world, but the actual mechanisms, methodologies, the act of creation.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
I think we can not only make it look sexy as far as revolution. I think we can make it look good because we have the skills to do that, but I also think we can do it if we use design in ways that are decolonized. It doesn&#8217;t have to be all about client services, that can generate revenue, that can generate income, that could generate economics in a community, but it also can be about&#8230; There&#8217;s an issue of gun violence, maybe we can design our way out of that, and it&#8217;s not going to be about typography. But there&#8217;s this certain set of perspectives and approaches that we use in design that can translate to bigger problems we see in our communities.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is it that keeps you motivated and inspired these days? I mean, I feel like&#8230; And just for people that are listening to this, we&#8217;re recording this the week of April 19th, we don&#8217;t really know&#8230; Both Joseph and I don&#8217;t really know kind of what may transpire the next few days, that by the time you listened to this podcast might&#8217;ve already set some shit off. But it&#8217;s a rough time for black folks right now, which is an evergreen statement these days. But what keeps you motivated to keep going?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Family for sure. Baby got to eat so got to get up and do what you got to do to make sure that happens. I just got this book and I just came back from Jackson, Mississippi. Freedom, by Edward Onaci, I think he pronounced it. And it&#8217;s inspired by another book of the same name, Dr Imar Obadele. And Obadele was a part of this black radical organization called the Republic of New Africa. And their vision was to take the southern states of the United States, so from Louisiana to Georgia and build a independent black nation. Which is one of the most creative, imaginative visions I&#8217;ve had or I&#8217;ve witnessed for black liberation. I&#8217;m super inspired by the work of those folks. At the moment that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been reading about. I just came back from Jackson, Mississippi, where they tried to get it going. And we obviously don&#8217;t have a black nation in the borders of the United States, but they got&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Or folks inspired by that movement have bought all of these properties in West Jackson. We&#8217;re staying at this co-operative for New West Jackson that owns 67 properties in the hood. And they&#8217;re building farms, they&#8217;re building housing, they&#8217;re building economic engines in the space to employ people, to bring money to the space that has been all but abandoned. Isn&#8217;t crazy. Jackson is the capital of Mississippi, and if you drive around Jackson you come away with a clear idea that white folks in Mississippi don&#8217;t care. They do not care that it&#8217;s their capital, it&#8217;s like 90% black. And all you got to do is roll through West Jackson and you can see how much folks do not care. You would think, &#8220;Oh, this is a image of this state that we are projecting out to the world.&#8221; That does not matter, not to the white folks in Mississippi. And this cooperative has&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Like you turn the corner onto a block and it&#8217;s like just walking into a oasis after walking through hundreds of miles of desert. It&#8217;s beautiful, the houses are beautiful, the land is beautiful, the people what they&#8217;re doing, and their vision for the world is beautiful. That&#8217;s one of the things that is inspiring me. I&#8217;ve really been into kind of reconnecting Afro spirituality, Afro spiritual practices like the hoodoos, and the voodoos, and Orisha based Yoruba kind of religious concepts. That&#8217;s been super inspiring to me today, I mean for the last couple of years. But right now it&#8217;s something I wake up thinking about, going to sleep thinking about, and it&#8217;s a lot of different things. My mind goes and gets pulled in a lot of different directions. Like yesterday my tufting gun arrived in the mail. You know what a tufting gun is?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a rug creating machine and it looks kind of like a gun, but the gun shoots yarn through a back in fabric you would use to make a rug. That&#8217;s one thing that I&#8217;ve been super inspired by. In that instance, buying that comes from my still love and interest in fashion. And it&#8217;s showing up in my practice as like I&#8217;ve been making these textile art works lately for the last few years now. I&#8217;ll create a collage, and Photoshop, print it out on fabric. And then sew it together, or make some new kind of construction out of it, some new kind of architecture out of it. That&#8217;s super inspiring to me, riding my bike is super inspiring to me, my wife and daughter. I lack no shortage of inspiration which is a good thing and a bad thing, because it distracts me from finishing one thing. Get super excited about something, then move to the next thing, then move next, but I&#8217;ll always come back.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Has there been a piece of advice that has stuck with you over the years as you&#8217;ve gone through life, as you&#8217;ve built out the school and everything?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
It&#8217;s hard to call anything to mind specifically. I think there&#8217;s lessons learned that may not be succinctly wrapped up in statements of advice. With certain lessons you&#8217;re damned if you do, you&#8217;re damned if you don&#8217;t, which sound depressing. But it&#8217;s taught me that you might as well just do what you want to do, because either way you&#8217;re going to end up at the same place. You might as well just say F it and be who you want to be, do what you want to do. Because I mean you could fake it, and be unhappy, and still not reach where you&#8217;re meant to reach.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Or you could just live in that thing and deal with the initial discomfort of just being in your skin, and being who you are. But I think eventually you will end up where you need to be. I really believe in purpose right now more than ever, because I&#8217;ve been forced to sit down and think about that a lot. I believe what&#8217;s meant for you is meant for you, can&#8217;t nobody stop or take that. But it takes time for folks to really figure out their purpose, and it&#8217;s not just like a goal, it&#8217;s a moving target. I say figure out what that is for you, and live that unapologetically. Just go hard.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing? How do you want to&#8230; I imagine of course you&#8217;ll still be wanting to build out the school, but what does 2026 look like?</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
Whoa, I think I need to put some pen to paper about that very soon. But hopefully the school&#8230; Not hopefully. What it looks like is the school will be built, will be functioning, doing art and civic engagement initiatives with our local community. That may look like our design workshops, or apprenticeships, or a community garden where we&#8217;re feeding ourselves food from the land. Hopefully it looks like me still creating, making things. I think of myself as a person who does two sorts of things, or artist or designer who does two sorts of things. I make things, object making, and I make experiences, platforms, producing and sharing knowledge.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Cuillier:</b><br>
And I see those as two different kind of sides of a coin and hopefully I have a balance. Right now it&#8217;s real tilted towards the platforms, the community building, but I would love to spread it out a little bit more evenly. Hopefully The Black School is up and running to a degree where it&#8217;s second nature. We have our rhythm, we have our stride so it allows me, frees me up to do all the things, follow all those inspiration, and passions, and pursuits that kind of make me happy, and fill me with joy and fulfillment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>

<p>The COVID-19 public health crisis is affecting us all, taking us out of the lives we led before and forcing us to move forward through a fog of uncertainty as we try to find our way back to some semblance of normalcy. Such is the case with this week&#8217;s guest, Arielle Wiltz. While she is typically based in NYC, she was sheltered in place in New Orleans when we spoke. We started off discussing her work at frog design, including how she&#8217;s taking the current relocation in stride with everything else happening at the moment.</p>
<p>Arielle also shared how she transitioned from being a dancer to being a designer, talked about her volunteer work with ADCOLOR, and she shared some of the new things she&#8217;s learning to help keep her focused and motivated during this time of transition. Arielle may say she just fell into design, but it sounds to me like that&#8217;s just the kind of inspiration others need to hear in order to see themselves in this industry as well!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
My name is Arielle Wiltz and I am an interaction designer currently at frog Design. It&#8217;s a design consulting firm, one of the largest ones globally actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Now, what&#8217;s a regular day like for you there? And I know that this is probably a odd question to ask given what we&#8217;re going through right now with this pandemic, but talk to me kind of like what your regular day-to-day is like.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah. My regular day-to-day before the pandemic, well it&#8217;s usually, typically within frog, we&#8217;re in teams. So the teams are filled with like strategists, depending on a project, industrial designers, VD designers, interaction designers like myself.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
And we usually really coming together to brainstorm on whatever the project that we&#8217;re currently working on. So sometimes there&#8217;s a lot of white boarding the day and sometimes it&#8217;s a lot of heads down. It&#8217;s like executing the project. Other times you may be, for myself, especially being an interaction designer, we&#8217;re doing user testing, trying to understand how the users feel about the experience that we&#8217;re creating.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So it really varies every day how we work and function. But usually when you&#8217;re on a project at frog and you&#8217;re with your team, you&#8217;re with your team for months. So you&#8217;re with that team the whole entire time. So it&#8217;s usually like you in your little corner with your team working, brainstorming, ideating.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like there&#8217;s a lot of just heads down work that you get to do to focus on a project.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah, it is a lot of heads down. So one of the things I&#8217;ve found is like me working by myself, a lot of times frog is really big with collaboration. They believe in a lot of bringing ideas together especially from different disciplines. It&#8217;s rare that I&#8217;m just working with people who are interaction designers. I&#8217;m usually working with people who are in all different types of disciplines.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
I haven&#8217;t had the luxury to work with industrial designers but I have worked with strategists before and VD designers of course and design technologists. So a lot of times we&#8217;re really working together. And then once we come with an idea or concept, we&#8217;re go into like execution heads down.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
But I think it&#8217;s so beautiful. One thing I learned from frog that I absolutely love, it&#8217;s creative process. When I was in school studying, I used to feel like it just came from thin air. How do you go from A to B? What is happening?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
But with frog and working collaboratively and frog is really big on design research and pulling from all the research to really conceptualize and coming out with these amazing ideas. Because one thing about frog is we push for the next big thing. So I think that&#8217;s really phenomenal that I had the opportunity to learn this there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How did you get started at frog?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Actually it&#8217;s very interesting. I just really applied more so. So my journey to user experience interaction design is really a fluke. One thing about the career that I&#8217;m in or the discipline I&#8217;m in, people go to the top schools. Right. People go to School of Visual Arts, schools in Europe, school in Asia. They really work vigorously on their portfolio. They attend a lot of internships.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Me, I just studied graphic design at Loyola and I didn&#8217;t even want to do it anymore. So I was really big into art nonprofits, helping out my community, decided to move to New York because that&#8217;s what I always wanted to do. So I moved without a job or a place to live. And with my first job just doing digital project management, I just fell into it. So I fell into it and I just build my way into becoming a designer. A lot of ups, a lot of downs because I didn&#8217;t have a lot of the resources like people at those types of schools.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
But in 2016, when I found that I was able to build my foundation regularly at a full time job, I worked really hard at it. So when it came time for when I applied at frog and I learned how to present how to articulate my story, I think that&#8217;s what really won them over.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What kind of projects are you working on right now at frog? As much of that as you can mention.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So, I can&#8217;t mention much but frog&#8230; I could tell you about the type of projects. So a lot of projects within frog, which is different from other companies that I work with. Because, like I said, frog is not one of the largest but one of the top design consulting firms in the world.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
But what they do is people come to us and really want us to reinvent and reimagine. So think of any type of healthcare. How can we reimagine healthcare for the 21st century? Frog is known for building one of the first Macintosh and working with Steve Jobs. So that&#8217;s the history of frog really from industrial design to now into the digital age.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
And so a lot of projects when companies come to us and, whether it&#8217;s finance or entertainment or like I said, healthcare is really just reimagining the experience. Reimagining how it can be done, coming up with completely new concepts that hadn&#8217;t ever been done before. So that&#8217;s why I say the creative process is just so unique to me and so amazing on how do you actually get there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now you&#8217;re also the lead of frog&#8217;s Diversity and Inclusion group there in New York. As much of that as you can talk about, I&#8217;m really curious because I don&#8217;t hear about this a lot at design agencies. How did that group begin? And as you&#8217;re sort of leading it up, what sorts of things does the group do?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So frog initially did start having a D&#038;I, this amazing creative director in Austin, who I had the pleasure to work with, Alexa, she used to own it. But I feel like in New York we didn&#8217;t really have anything. So one day, again, one of my mentors at frog, John Wasserman, he was like, &#8220;Who wants to lead D&#038;I?&#8221; Because we had a Slack channel.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
And so at the time I was on a bench and I was like, &#8220;Sure, I&#8217;ll lead it.&#8221; And so we started to have just workshops with people there. Frog, they&#8217;re diverse in a sense but when it comes to the numbers, as far as blacks, Latinos, is very low. So we were just like, everyone in it, no matter if you&#8217;re a designer or not. We all came together and we were just discussing what does diversity mean to us and et cetera.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
And so from those conversations I started two programs. One was breaking barriers, which is just a talk series open to the public where we invited people, but we for sure had people speaking, people of color. Because one thing in design, I didn&#8217;t believe 20% of it is people of color. And as far as blacks, there&#8217;s only 5%.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So my goal was for us to actually see it because I think that&#8217;s the big thing a lot of times is I don&#8217;t see it so I don&#8217;t think I can do it. I really pushed for that to just have all different types of people of color to sit in those chairs and actually speak about their story.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So, that was very successful and my baby. My favorite thing is for our mentors where it was a selective program where we reached out to, again, like I said, when it comes to these companies, a lot of times they hire from the top schools and I was like, &#8220;You know what? Let&#8217;s look at the state schools. Let&#8217;s look at the local community college schools, because the truth of the matter is there&#8217;s talent and innovators everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So we found, I believe, 28 people apply and we narrowed down to two amazing mentors, shout out to Sarah and Lisa. And they worked vigorously with two creative directors and came up with amazing portfolios who are now working at amazing companies. So on Buzzfeed and I believe Grey Advertising.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh nice.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. And that was the first time doing it. It was really prototype. I just hit the ground running as we were going up, I created it and made it. I did have help for, like I said, the mentors, the mentorship program was a lot of work. And we all have design jobs as well. People have like departments just to do that.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
But we worked really hard at it and I&#8217;m just so proud of my mentees and the difference that they&#8217;re making. Just being their authentic selves in these spaces. And I think that&#8217;s brings me joy, honestly. Seeing other people coming through the doors who look like me or represent another culture. That&#8217;s what design needs because it could be very Eurocentric.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, it totally is Eurocentric, in the United States absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Totally, totally Eurocentric.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now these kinds of D&#038;I groups, I mean I feel like I hear about them a lot from tech companies. Tech companies will have some type of a group. Actually we had, back in December, Kendall Howse who works for Red Hat and he heads up their D&#038;I group. But there&#8217;s something that I kind of hear from tech companies. I don&#8217;t really hear it from like agencies or design consultancies like what frog is. Why do you think it&#8217;s important to have this kind of group at a company like frog?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Oh, it&#8217;s so important because us as designers, especially in today&#8217;s age, everything that you do, everything that you experience has been designed out for you. Where it&#8217;s like urban design, industrial design, the product that you&#8217;re using, the experience that you&#8217;re having.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
For example, tele-health that everyone&#8217;s using right now, especially with the pandemic. It&#8217;s like everything&#8217;s been designed for you. And if the majority of people who are designing are white male, consciously or unconsciously, you don&#8217;t know, it becomes bias. Correct.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So I think it&#8217;s so important to have a diverse representation, not only just of as race, as ability, is of anything just to diversify it so other people can feel included and an experience and don&#8217;t feel left out. And especially since technology has taken such a hold with our society, people are being left out, which is so unfortunate.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So I feel like one of my missions, especially as a designer is to make sure I do my part in bridging a gap. And so to me that was what the mentorship was as a part, to bridge the gap as far as what product design and brand design. Even with brand design and making sure that images of different types of people from different cultures are included.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So I definitely feel like it&#8217;s important. Especially when you&#8217;re working at a company, that whole goal is to innovate. One thing I love to say is diversity is innovation. Just imagine having a group of designers, engineers, industrial designers, strategists, all in a room from all different types of backgrounds, including economical backgrounds. Because that&#8217;s a issue too. Really thinking and brainstorming and strategizing a problem. Imagine the solutions that can come out of it. So that&#8217;s why I feel like it&#8217;s just extremely important, especially now to diversify the industry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s the best thing about what you do at frog?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
You know what? I have to say, I work with extremely, extremely amazing creative people. I have been blessed that I have worked with people who really&#8230; I had two for sure managers or creative directors that have really pushed me to think at levels that I couldn&#8217;t even imagine. Also just, like I said we worked collaboratively, working very closely with the visual designer-</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
&#8230; collaboratively working very closely with the visual designers, because that&#8217;s who I often work with. I learn so much from them. So I think that the thing that I really enjoy working with is, I feel like I&#8217;m blessed to have worked with, for example, I said Alexis from Austin, a creative director that&#8217;s no longer there, Jared, my manager, Henry. To work with people like that who really push me and just really, I feel like I&#8217;m being taken to another level from that. Then working with my coworkers, too. My VD coworkers for the most part.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the ones who I usually would work with. I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s really cool about it, because you&#8217;re working with the top people there, so&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So given that collaboration is such a big part of not just the work that you do at Frog, but also it sounds like just the culture of working at Frog, how have things been different now with this pandemic? Because now, I&#8217;m assuming, you&#8217;re working from home. Probably everyone is working from home, I&#8217;m assuming, right?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Right. Everyone&#8217;s working from home right now. Yes. Yes. Oh man, it&#8217;s been so different working from home. I feel like I&#8217;m working more working from home than&#8230; I&#8217;m not really having a lot of downtime. I&#8217;m on a screen the whole entire time, and we have a lot of meetings. This project I&#8217;m working on now, we have a lot of meetings just to make sure everyone&#8217;s in the loop, and like I said, with agencies it&#8217;s usually a lot of fast paced work as well.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So I won&#8217;t say difficult, I would say new, you know? It&#8217;s different. It&#8217;s different in a sense. I feel like say this pandemic lasts until June, July, people would get used to it, but it&#8217;s definitely new. I know the company did set up parameters of how to work from home and they leased out different softwares in order to do it, which is all cool, but just really adjusting yourself to do it.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
I usually would wake up early, have breakfast, do this, do that. Now I&#8217;m so tired because I feel like I go, go, go, go, go the whole entire time. It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m leaving work then coming home, my work is at home. So that&#8217;s been really new for me, but yeah. We still have meetings. Every [inaudible 00:17:17] is basically running the same way as it was running before, it&#8217;s just the adjustment of working from home that I feel like everybody at my company, or everybody everywhere if they don&#8217;t really work from home, is kind of struggling with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Does it feel like Frog is extending some kind of, I don&#8217;t know, grace during this time? Because this is a big shift for everyone, I&#8217;m assuming. It&#8217;s not just the change in working from in an office to working at home, but having the right set-up in terms of your desk or chair or laptop or monitor, or even now you live in New York but you&#8217;re currently in New Orleans. So now you&#8217;re not even at your place, you&#8217;re at a different place, trying to adjust to this. So hopefully Frog is extending some grace with how you all are working from home, and not expecting right away the same level of creative output, I guess. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah, well you know what? When you work at, like I said, a company like Frog, they&#8217;re always going to expect top notch creative output, you know? That&#8217;s just how it is. But I think what&#8217;s beautiful is my creative director right now, every single time we check in, she really does a check in. Like, &#8220;How are you?&#8221; It&#8217;s not just like a regular, &#8220;Oh, how are you doing today?&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Seriously, how are you?&#8221; If you&#8217;re feeling stressed or whatever, &#8220;Okay, maybe you need to take a walk. Maybe you need to step away.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So I think it&#8217;s really the creative directors who really taking in and up to account different things, like, &#8220;How are you doing right now? What&#8217;s going on with you?&#8221; If you don&#8217;t feel well&#8230; Really checking in. Checking in way more than before. That&#8217;s what I love about the creative director now. Every day she&#8217;s really just checking in and saying like, &#8220;How are you?&#8221; And really having a conversation about it.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So I feel like that&#8217;s really important right now because not only at Frog, I feel like any company or most companies, it&#8217;s still work. People are still going, people still trying to make deadlines, and it&#8217;s really hard right now because&#8230; I&#8217;m fortunate right now that I don&#8217;t know anyone who&#8217;s sick or anything like that, but for people who do, or people who are going through it, are sick themselves, or&#8230; Man, I can&#8217;t imagine. Even the health system, like we were saying earlier, being so overwhelmed right now. So I think everybody at some level is feeling it, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
But yeah, like I said, the creative directors, they&#8217;re aware of it and I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s good about it. We&#8217;re human-centered design. We&#8217;re making sure things are human-centered within the teams too, so that&#8217;s really needed right now, and it&#8217;s happening.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s what I was saying. I hope that companies are extending just that grace because it&#8217;s&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. We know who people are at work in an office, but people&#8217;s home lives and their work lives are completely different. Some people use work as, I won&#8217;t say as an escape but that kind of feels like the best way to put it. They may not have the best home life, and going to work is the thing that&#8217;s sort of their brief respite from whatever they might have to deal with. Whether that&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know, kids or a spouse or dealing with aging parents or anything like that. There&#8217;s a lot of things that can go into play, and working from home, it&#8217;s the option that we have to take right now-</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s a lot. And then on top of all of that, just the overall impending news of the pandemic and what&#8217;s happening.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It wears on you.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Oh, definitely. It definitely wears on you. I remember one day before I came to New Orleans I was in New York. It was right before I started on a project so I was reading through files and getting prepped for it, and I was watching MSNBC the whole entire day. It created so much anxiety for me. It was when people were still trying to figure everything out, and that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s a big concern. Like I said, I&#8217;m fortunate, but 100% there are mothers who are working from home now, dads, and people who have a ton of different businesses that they are running right now, and now to work from home and do everything plus manage your kids, managing like you say, your aging parents, or possibly even if someone is sick right now.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So that definitely goes into play with everything, but like I said, being the design nerd, I think it&#8217;s the time where people should, like I said, start mobilizing more. So utilize your skills to help others right now. There&#8217;s right now [inaudible 00:22:00] going on with UX for Change, and they&#8217;re working, partnering, with data center, I believe, that&#8217;s really heavy hands on what&#8217;s going on right now. And actually all these designers, data scientists, engineers are coming together to actually help solve a problem.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So I feel like this is the time, now, where people should start doing this. I know a ton of fashion designers right now within the health system that things are going on, just making face masks right now. So I feel like this is the time for us to really hone in and come together and help solve these issues, like you said, because I can&#8217;t even&#8230; Like I said, I&#8217;m not dealing with that but I can&#8217;t even imagine for someone who is dealing with something like that right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. The last time I went out was the 14th of March. I remember this because I was already a bit skeptical about going out because I had just come back from LA a few weeks before that and I was sick when I came back. Now, when I came back, the sickness that I had, I sort of chalked it up to allergies because we have terrible pollen in Atlanta. But I chalked it up to allergies, just the fact that I was in and out of planes, I had switched hotels during the trip, I was at a conference. I figured all of these things just came into play with, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m feeling kind of sick.&#8221; Not flu-like at all, but just more annoying than anything else, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I had been getting better leading up to the 14th, and I remember this because I was going to go vote. They had early voting then because our primary is on the&#8230; Or was, I should say, on the 24th. They&#8217;ve now pushed it back. So I went to go vote early in the morning. It took me, I don&#8217;t know, maybe five or 10 minutes, and I remember walking into the voting area in the library and the women there were like in hazmat suits.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
These are the poll workers. Gloves, huge jugs of hand sanitizer, masks, hazmat suits. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Is this ground zero?&#8221; It felt like I walked into an emergency room or something. But I remember going to vote, came home, and if I would have known that would have been the last time that I really could have left the house I would have, I don&#8217;t know, made a liquor store run or something, but I would have done something else.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s just that all the news about all this is happening so quickly with shelter in place and what&#8217;s going to happen in terms of financial stimulus. This has affected so many other businesses out there. I mean, I feel very fortunate in tech that the company I work for hasn&#8217;t been affected by it in terms of furloughing employees or anything like that, but depending on how long this goes on, there&#8217;s no telling what this looks like. There&#8217;s no end in sight.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now hopefully, knock on wood, by the time this podcast comes out we&#8217;ll be outside chilling. Hopefully.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But right now, I&#8217;m on day 17 and I&#8217;m just like, one day at a time, I&#8217;ll just see how it goes.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah, for sure. I spoke about how with design we could provide tools with healthcare workers or the government, but even just simple pleasures like&#8230; Not being able to have a human connection, you didn&#8217;t even realize how good it feels to go by your friend&#8217;s house and just chill, hang out, give them a hug. These little things you really miss doing. But one thing I love is how technology right now&#8230; With Instagram Live and D-Nice and the Quarantine Club, having a club at your house, feeling human, having some type of connection again with someone other than the same people you see all the time in your house. That feels warm to me. Really needed right now, you know? To still feel like you&#8217;re human, not just really just stuck in the house and I can&#8217;t go anywhere except just get groceries [crosstalk 00:25:57] if that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. If that, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, I haven&#8217;t been going out to the grocery store, only because I&#8217;ve been trying to heed the advice of stay in, order, because that&#8217;s the best way. They can drop it off. So, but even doing ordering through Instacart or something, they&#8217;re like &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing here. Half the stuff that you wanted to get is not here.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s just a lot going on right now that can make it tough to focus on work because there&#8217;s so much other stuff that&#8217;s happening and you&#8217;re just at home. It&#8217;s all like that&#8217;s the epicenter of everything, because you can&#8217;t really go out and do anything.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah. I think another thing that this hasn&#8217;t&#8230; When I speak with my friends right now it&#8217;s really helping us focus on self care tools and what to do right now to really just not increase your anxiety with everything. My theory, like I told you, I was fine until yesterday when I really started thinking, &#8220;How long is this going to last?&#8221; I started freaking out because I was like, &#8220;Wait, how long is this going to last and I&#8217;m going to have to be here and do this and that. What about my normal life? What about what I was doing all the goals that I had summer? What I&#8217;m trying to do?&#8221; So it&#8217;s a adjustment, but I feel like I am learning more self care tools that I probably needed while I was in New York, because New York itself can be hectic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well yeah, that&#8217;s true. That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So yeah, so really readjusting it and when we come out of this we&#8217;ll definitely continue doing those things because even, this is so basic but even like eating. I noticed that when I&#8217;m New York, waking up and then going on the subway, then work, then sometimes I&#8217;m working past normal hours depending on the project, I just forget to eat. That&#8217;s so crazy and insane, but it really does happen. So since I&#8217;ve been working from home I make sure to have my meals and do things [inaudible 00:27:58] and really just take care of myself, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
And I think that&#8217;s, no matter what we do or what you&#8217;re doing, make sure you take care of yourself. Especially in this because your immune system is what&#8217;s going to help you if you do get sick and you don&#8217;t want to, by any way, shape, or form, have it down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, and you&#8217;re in New Orleans, which as of the time that we&#8217;re recording this is one of the big hotspots for the virus now.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yes. Yes, New Orleans is because people are assuming, I don&#8217;t know for sure, but people are saying because of Mardi Gras with so many people here it was able to spread it rapidly. Yeah, so it is one of the hot spots. New Orleans, I think the difference is New Orleans is more spaced out. So for example, my mom, she works out every morning so she might do a little run, but no one&#8217;s outside. We live in little subdivision and it&#8217;s spaced out.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Unfortunately people are not staying at home like they should, but yeah, it&#8217;s pretty bad in New Orleans, actually. Really bad, actually. I know a couple of friends of mine who know someone who has it right now, or even died from it. My mom mentioned one or two people, so it&#8217;s really bad here now. Especially when you&#8217;re in a city. What I love about New Orleans, it&#8217;s so warm here, so hospitable, and for you not to be able to do something that&#8217;s so natural down here, it&#8217;s been very difficult and hard.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Or even for example, I know, which is so hard, but people can&#8217;t even see the grandparents right now. New Orleans is very family knit community, and so people can&#8217;t even see the grandparents or even take care of their grandparents. I know when my grandparents were alive my mom used to go and take care of my grandmother, so I couldn&#8217;t even imagine being in something like this and we can&#8217;t even take care of my grandmother who was differently able. She was in a wheelchair. So I can&#8217;t even imagine people who are dealing with that right now and how difficult it can be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you been able to at least keep in touch with her, like call or anything?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Oh no, she&#8217;s not here any more but I&#8217;m just saying.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, oh. I&#8217;m sorry. Oh.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, no-</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
More.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh. Oh, I&#8217;m sorry. Oh.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah. No, no, no. She lived a long, beautiful life though. But I&#8217;m just saying, I&#8217;m just thinking about the times when my mom did do that. That I know so many people are probably doing that now and can&#8217;t. That&#8217;s difficult because you don&#8217;t want to go there because you don&#8217;t want to get her sick sick in any way. But at the same time she needs to be able to do certain things because she&#8217;s differently able. She&#8217;s unable to move because of the wheelchair. I think that&#8217;s really difficult right now. Because not everybody can afford to put their loved ones in nursing homes or can do certain things or provide assistance. A lot of people are doing it themselves. To even be in a situation like this right now, it has to be very difficult.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. To kind of switch gears here a little bit, I know we really ended up talking about this for a good bit of time, but you mentioned New Orleans, you&#8217;re from New Orleans, you grew up there. What was it like growing up there as a kid interested in design?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Oh wow. Oh, so it wasn&#8217;t so much that I was interested in design. I was just a very creative kid. One thing I do is write. I write Medium articles. I used to write a lot of stories. I was in dance in school. I thought I wanted to become a professional dancer, even studying in college. I was a dancer. Also I was part of different activities within church. I feel like that all kind of brought in my skills to become a good designer. That&#8217;s one thing that I&#8217;m really big on is STEM to STEAM and including the arts because I feel like that all contributes to innovation. Even if the person decides to become a scientist or technologist or engineer, having the arts really help push your creativity. Because that definitely helped me because, oh man, I used to dance. There&#8217;s this program in New Orleans. New Orleans have a lot of free dance programs and it&#8217;s NOLA NOBA.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Man, I used to dance every single day. Go to dancing school, dance, dance. Very disciplined. Studied ballet, studied modern, studied jazz, and just that discipline, that creativity, I really felt brought into my skills as an interaction designer more so innovating different ideas within technology.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was just going to ask, how did you go from dancing to design?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Oh wow. When I was in college and I was studying dance, I became injured in one of the programs and so when I was injured they was saying, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re going to have to like&#8230;&#8221; How this program went was fall, you take this course. Spring, you take this course. Back and forth. They was like, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re going to have to sit out for a year.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;A year?&#8221; I was so focused on graduating on time, which still did not happen, but I was like, &#8220;A year? I don&#8217;t want to wait a year.&#8221; I was so upset and I was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m just going to change my major.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t even really know what I wanted to do but I knew I still wanted to be somewhat creative. So little that I knew because I didn&#8217;t know really much about all the different types of designs and I was like, &#8220;Oh I heard of graphic design before. I guess I&#8217;ll get into that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Again, like the story of how I got into anything was all a fluke really. I was like, &#8220;Okay I&#8217;m just going to get into this. I&#8217;m going to become a graphic designer I guess.&#8221; I wind up, because I transferred schools and I was at Loyola studying graphic design and I wound up not being so into it because I guess I didn&#8217;t get the full grasp of it at the time being so young. But once again I fell into interaction design. I was like, &#8220;Oh wow.&#8221; Using my analytical skills because I am quite a nerd when it comes to research and analyzing and then being creative and combining both together. I thought it was just like the perfect job for me. Like, &#8220;Oh my God, this is like everything that I&#8217;ve been wanting to do.&#8221; Because I&#8217;m very analytical and I like a process. It was like this is the process to get to point A to B. It doesn&#8217;t come from thin air. It&#8217;s very rigorous. But it&#8217;s some type of silver lining to it.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah, that was my experience more so. But yeah, New Orleans definitely helped me out, especially when we were speaking earlier about my involvement with diversity inclusion because I attended NOLA NOBA. Again, design is again very elite. I mean not design, dance. Dance is very elite. For NOLA NOBA to have programs in the inner city with top design dance teachers who taught in New York, Europe, et cetera, teaching us. That was just everything. It felt like things were possible that you probably thought you couldn&#8217;t even do. That&#8217;s one thing that I really admire and really grateful for having that background as being a dancer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What did your parents say when you kind of switched it up like that? I mean from dancing to design. Did they have anything to say?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Oh no. My dad wanted me to be a doctor. He had his heart set on it, so my parents, they weren&#8217;t into it. They weren&#8217;t into it at all. They weren&#8217;t into me studying dance. They weren&#8217;t into me&#8230; They really didn&#8217;t get into it until&#8230; They weren&#8217;t into me moving to New York at all. I think they really didn&#8217;t realize my journey, my path that I chosen until like I started becoming successful into it and now they go bragging. Like, &#8220;Arielle, what do you do again.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m a designer.&#8221; &#8220;What is that again?&#8221; I have to explain it over like, &#8220;I&#8217;m an interaction designer.&#8221; &#8220;What does that do?&#8221; &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s computers.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;It&#8217;s more than computers.&#8221; &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll just say computers.&#8221; They&#8217;re very proud but my parents have been supportive. But I feel like most parents of people of color, especially like black parents, they want you to be a doctor, engineer, think that they know you should do. When I was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to become a designer,&#8221; it was like, &#8220;What is that? We don&#8217;t get that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think also part of it probably is them just&#8230; I think it might be less about wanting to be a doctor or engineer and more about being in a successful role where you can take care of yourself and hopefully them too.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s more about the possibility or the probability of that because I mean we know that there are working artists and designers out there, but when we think about jobs that have some level of respect or prestige or make money, it does end up being those kinds of doctor, lawyer, engineer kind of things. It&#8217;s less about being a designer or an artist or an illustrator or a musician or anything like that, you know?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah, 100%. But that&#8217;s the thing that I love about what I do is because yes, I am a designer. I&#8217;m an interaction designer. But the reason why I truly decided to go this path and with my career is because I always loved helping people. That was one of my passions because in the beginning I was working at art nonprofit and making sure I was bringing the arts into the cities where people weren&#8217;t exposed to or kids aren&#8217;t exposed to it more so. So I was thinking about going&#8230; I was working at campus at the time, a digital project manager. I already started assisting the UX design, so I already was kind of doing it. So I just wanted to learn more about it. Like I said, I&#8217;m a researcher so I was on a computer. I found this company and they created this really, really amazing technology that allow patients with, I believe ALS, be able to communicate their needs in control. Things like for example, turning the lights on or off or turn on the TV or not using technology.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
When I saw that I was like, &#8220;Oh my God, I&#8217;m still contributing in some way.&#8221; I may not be the doctor in the hospital, but I&#8217;m creating the technology for the doctor in the hospital. That&#8217;s when I was like, &#8220;This is what I need to do. This is what I want to do in my life.&#8221; That&#8217;s when I rigorously pursued it. I feel like really letting people know the different opportunities in me in choosing to become a designer is one of the big things. Or even being in the creative field because I feel like sometimes people just think we just color and draw all day, but that is not the case at all. Like no. No, I definitely do not do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When did you decide to make the move to New York? Because it sounds like you kind of had your roots there in New Orleans with your family and going to school there. Why the move to New York?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Again, like I said, this has been my journey. This is probably the beam of my journey. A fluke. I was just like, you know what? I was working at amazing nonprofit called Young Audience of Louisiana, amazing nonprofits. I was working there and I was making decent amount of money to be in New Orleans. Moved from office manager to marketing associate. Because one thing you realize is when you have any type of degree in design, the first thing they make you do, no matter what you want to do, you could definitely step out of design, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, you studied graphic design? We need help with this.&#8221; They pull you back in. It was just like I was working one day and I always wanted to move to New York since I was a child. I just went to my mom because I was still at home. I believe I was 24, 25 and I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m moving to New York.&#8221; My mom was like, &#8220;With what money?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m just going to start saving and I&#8217;m going to move.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Then I went and I picked the day in the calendar I was like September 6. That&#8217;s when I&#8217;m moving. My mom was like, &#8220;Why is it set for 6th?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. This is just the plan.&#8221; I did it. It was just so crazy. I tell my friends, I can imagine now my best friend Tracy, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Where are you going to live?&#8221; It was just, I didn&#8217;t have a place to live. I didn&#8217;t have a job at the time. Everything kind of fell into place because of course I wasn&#8217;t homeless. But yeah, I was working in restaurants for a good time when I first moved to New York. Shout out to the restaurant industry. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
What I did know is I did know that I wanted to be in digital so I did have some type of plan. I was like, I want to work in digital, but I didn&#8217;t know about all the different types of disciplines. All I knew was I studied graphic design. I don&#8217;t like graphic design. So those were the two things I knew. I knew I wanted to work in digital and knew I didn&#8217;t want to be a graphic designer anymore. From my research I was like, &#8220;Oh, I want to become a project manager.&#8221; But I thought that was being a product manager. I didn&#8217;t know the difference. So I just started applying for those jobs.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
That&#8217;s really how it all happened. Basically just fluked. It was just like something in my spirit. I&#8217;m very intuitive so I try to listen to my spirit and just go forward with that. But go forward with a plan though. I do have plans in place when I do things. When I decide I&#8217;m going to do something, I go forward with a plan and make a schedule and really sketch it out moving forward. But yeah, that&#8217;s really how it happened.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I saw from looking at your LinkedIn, you worked at a company called Tigerspike for over two years as a UX designer. What did you take away from that experience?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Oh wow. Tigerspike really gave me my foundation because when I was a canvas at the other companies too, it was really me just trying to find myself. Like how do I fit in in this world? I was studying at general assembly part-time because I couldn&#8217;t afford the full time program. Working full time. Trying to become a UX designer at the time. Then finally doing just some freelance gigs or contract gigs. But once I got to Tigerspike, that really set my whole foundation of being a designer. One thing I had to say about Tigerspike. Tigerspike, it&#8217;s now smaller in the US, but it was the first time I met another black designer. I know that may sound crazy but that was&#8230; I remember it like yesterday.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was going to say, not for this show that doesn&#8217;t sound crazy.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah. I know. No, no. It was definitely not. I remember I was&#8230; So the recruiter at Tigerspike, She helped me get a contract job and so my contract was ending. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh Tigerspike&#8230;&#8221; She now worked at Tigerspike and she was like, &#8220;Oh now we&#8217;re hiring for this project. It&#8217;s going to be contract to full time. I&#8217;ll let you know if you qualify.&#8221; So we were talking back and forth because they needed someone more senior. I knew I did not have anything for a portfolio. I had one general assembly project and I made up projects.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
She told me, say it was Monday, she told me Monday I had an interview. Then so on Tuesday, I stayed up all day and night creating a project because I know I didn&#8217;t have a portfolio and I know I didn&#8217;t have anything. I just stayed up all day night working on it. Right. No sleep. I go in the next day delirious but determined to do well. I was so shaky and nervous because when you go into the space, it&#8217;s predominantly [inaudible 00:13:21]. It&#8217;s not me. I don&#8217;t see myself. I walked in and I see this black woman, her name Rachel Robbins, automatically just like relief came through me. It was my first time seeing a black designer and she was high up too as well.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
I presented her my work, her and two other designers my work, and it was just such a calming relief to see someone so familiar in that space that I think that&#8217;s one of the reasons why I did so well because I was no longer nervous and scared. I felt like, &#8220;Okay, she&#8217;s there. I don&#8217;t know how her experience, I don&#8217;t know her background, but this woman looks like me, so if I don&#8217;t get in here, I could make it within this industry.&#8221; I think that really helped me get my foot in the door. Like I said, it was like the foundation of design for me. Very rigorous but amazing team, amazing company. I was even able to travel to London. It was my first time in Europe and I worked there for three months. So just the opportunities were endless working there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Sounds like you came out of that with a lot then.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
A lot. Yeah. I was, like I said again, just very blessed on his journey. The journey has up and downs, but the highs be really high sometimes. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;Wow, I can&#8217;t believe I just moved here when I didn&#8217;t have a place to live and now I&#8217;m in London.&#8221; That was just really amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny you mentioned that. The place where I work at now, Glitch, the first week was split between me being in New York and being in London. The first day at work was they flew me up there, did paperwork and everything in New York that Monday. Flew overnight to London, was in London. That was my first time in London. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And that was my first time in London, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. That Wednesday actually was a conference that my CEO was at and my boss was attending. So it&#8217;s my first time meeting these people and it&#8217;s at a conference where I&#8217;m expected to represent the company on day three of working at the place. And then flew back on the Thursday, Thursday afternoon/evening. And then, was in New York on Friday. And then back in Atlanta on Saturday. I was like, &#8220;This is wild.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Wow, I know. And for you, you hear about&#8230; I know being from the South and being from New Orleans, you hear about people who live like that, traveling all the time for work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
And going to big cities, but actually for you to experience that, it&#8217;s like wow. Especially how old was I? Probably 27, 28 experienced, something like that first time. And no one in my family ever did anything like that. So for me to do it, it was just a surreal experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I also saw that you do some work with ADCOLOR, you&#8217;re on their advisory board. Can you talk a little bit about that?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Sure, yeah. So on the ADCOLOR advisory board, what we focus on is the Futures. So Futures are junior level people who are in their careers and we focus more so on building skills for them to develop so they could carry on throughout their professional career. Especially, another big thing is diversifying the industry, not just what people call it, but also different genders as well as different abilities. And the list can go on and on. And so what we do is, our goal is to create these programs for them. So when the conference come in, we have the Futures come a little early and create these programs to help them develop these skills, as well as we help out really voicing and speaking out for ADCOLOR and what it&#8217;s about. Isn&#8217;t it amazing? I&#8217;ve only been in it one year so far. This is my second year.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s been a really amazing experience because we&#8217;re working with people in all different industry because you&#8217;re also&#8230; It&#8217;s primarily ad, but now especially technology people in tech companies like Google and Facebook on the board, as well as people in different marketing industries as well, people with different backgrounds. But we all have the same mission and goal and that&#8217;s just to diversify an industry and the importance of diversifying industry. So I think it&#8217;s an amazing experience because it&#8217;s again, holds on to what I really believe in. What we say in ADCOLOR is rise up and reach back. And that&#8217;s one thing that I feel like I just been doing before ADCOLOR. Now and probably after ADCOLOR, I&#8217;ve been doing that with my life, just really trying to rise up to the best that I can, but always trying to reach back to others to make sure they can come on as well and try to really narrow the gap. So that&#8217;s what ADCOLOR is about and it&#8217;s been a dope, dope experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you kind of look back over your career, I know you&#8217;ve been mentioning getting into design and the opportunities that you&#8217;ve had as a fluke, but when you look back over your career, what are some of the biggest lessons that you&#8217;ve learned about yourself?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Biggest lessons I learned about myself, resiliency for sure. Because as I&#8217;m telling a story, there were a lot of lows. There was a lot of times, especially when I first moved to New York, I was really struggling financially and trying to make it. And there were times where I just really thought maybe I need to go back home, maybe I can&#8217;t do it. But I&#8217;m telling you hard times really help you. You know how they say hard times help build character and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, whatever.&#8221; Because you&#8217;re going through the hard time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
But when you look back you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, I know.&#8221; It really did help me built my resiliency. I feel like everything that I went through, no matter it was like the harshest of making it into New York or it was very heartbreaking for me because I did wanted to go to one of the top design schools. And when I was speaking with my mom at the time, it was like, &#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t afford it right now.&#8221; You can&#8217;t really afford it yourself, with how you&#8217;re trying to pay for things. So how it&#8217;s going to happen? So really me trying to strategize and figure out ways on, okay, I want to become this use experiences. I want become this interaction designer. I want to work at these companies. How do I get there?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So really building that skill of becoming strategic. And I feel like also the skill of being a fighter, man. Really being a fighter in a sense of standing on what I believe in. As far as, like I said, diversifying the industry, making sure more of us are in a space and not just talking about it but actually being about it. Actually trying to create these programs. Like I said, the mentorship program for our mentors was very prototype. It was not a refined program by any means, but I just created it. And now we have one Latina and one Middle Eastern, amazing women working in the industry now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
So you got to start somewhere. So one thing I will say is you learn to just go for it. This is what I want, okay, kind of like about to get into design thinking. But this blue sky, this is I want. Now okay, how do you get from point A to point B? How are we going to get there? Kind of like the creative process that I&#8217;ve been speaking about. How are we going to get there? What are you going to do? And those are the things that I really learned from my experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What keeps you motivated and inspired these days?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Especially these days, oh man, man, man. Yeah, you&#8217;re able to think a lot now. So now I feel I&#8217;m really honing on what&#8217;s my Northern star and that is diversity and inclusion. And how do I do that? Kind of like go to parks, that&#8217;s my choice of weapon. My choice of weapon is design and innovation and technology. So how I&#8217;m utilizing it is, I&#8217;m trying to focus on product inclusion now. That&#8217;s one of my main goals. I&#8217;m actually now that I have so much free time, I&#8217;m starting to take courses in algorithm design, AI, and machine learning because that&#8217;s the latest revolution that&#8217;s happening right now for us.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
And again, we as a people are being left out in a lot of things. There&#8217;s a lot of biasness happening when things are being built. So I&#8217;m trying or not trying, I am learning these skills and learning how to apply them as a designer and how I can utilize my human centered thinking into it. So that&#8217;s what keeps me motivated right now. And I now know what I love to do. I now know who I am and how can I play a part of it. So now it&#8217;s just honing in all these different skills to make things happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? It&#8217;s 2025 hopefully, we are well past this pandemic by then. Where do you see yourself? What do you want to be doing in 2025?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Ooh, I would love to become a director at some level. That would be a big goal of mine. I also would definitely want to start probably creating a more formal program with the mentorship program. Whereas kind of like, you could say a school, but more on the free end for us and really provide all the professional resources that the top schools will have.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
That would be something that I want to do. And also like I said, I have all these amazing skills that I have learned from Tigerspike and from frog of how to innovate and come up with ideas and concepts. And there are so many amazing people who come up with these dope, dope, dope ideas in tech or just services. But then they need help with the creative process of how to go about really executing it or how to really solve this problem like what products need it.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
And so I want to start offering a service to more so focusing on us and focusing on us as black people, focus on us as brown people as well, and really providing those services because we need all of us in those entrepreneurial spaces as well. So providing those types of services. I&#8217;m actually kind of starting on that with a friend of mine. She&#8217;s investment banking, so she&#8217;s more so knowing how investor relations and how that work and I&#8217;m more on the creative side. So hopefully by 2025 we are fully established and functioning and really one of the top companies doing it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, look at that.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Sure, so I&#8217;m on LinkedIn, my name is Arielle Wiltz. Also Medium have me writing articles. And right now they&#8217;re in pandemic, but I&#8217;m definitely going to start back up writing more articles on diversity inclusion within design and the workspace and now product inclusion. So on Medium, my name is Arielle Wiltz. And as well as I&#8217;m finalizing my website, it will be www.ariellewiltz.com</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Arielle Wiltz, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I know that we&#8217;re recording this during a very tumultuous time right now just in terms of our society and everything. But I mean, I have to say talking to you has been so refreshing today. Your enthusiasm and your drive for really just kind of carving your own path to becoming a designer is something that I think I needed to hear today. And hopefully for people that are listening, they can hear that too. Hopefully, they can pick up on just how excited you are about the work that you&#8217;re doing and I really think that you&#8217;re going to go far if you keep that attitude, that positive attitude, it&#8217;ll take you far. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Arielle Wiltz:</b><br>
Thank you so much, Maurice. This was a pleasure.</p>

<p><em>Fruitvale Station. Miles Ahead. Creed. Moonlight.</em>¬†If you&#8217;ve seen any of these films over the past few years, then you&#8217;re familiar with the work of Hannah Beachler. You may also know her for her Afrofuturist design direction on¬†<em>Black Panther</em>, becoming not just the first Black person to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Production Design, but also being the first one to win it as well. She&#8217;s even worked with Beyonc√© on¬†<em>Lemonade</em>, as well as the On The Run II tour with Beyonc√© and Jay Z! In short, Hannah Beachler is definitely #goals when it comes to Black design.</p>
<p>While we did discuss Hannah&#8217;s career highlights, we also talked about her life growing up in Ohio, her early work in production design, and how she first met Ryan Coogler. Hannah also shared how she prepares for working on films, what life is like after winning an Oscar, and how she stays inspired. Hannah is definitely proof that if you do your best, it is definitely good enough!</p>
