Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>Vasheena Brisbane&#8217;s star is on the rise! New Yorkers are no doubt familiar with her work as the associate director of visual design and communications at one of the city&#8217;s most prominent places of worship &#8212; Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. And now, Vasheena&#8217;s just been honored with a coveted spot on <a href="https://gdusa.com/peopletowatch2023/vasheena-brisbane" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><em>GDUSA Magazine</em>&#8216;s &#8220;People to Watch&#8221; list for 2023</a>. I had to reach out and have her on the podcast so I could learn more about her story!</p>
<p>Our conversation began with a glimpse into the intricacies of Vasheena&#8217;s work, and she spoke about the fulfillment she&#8217;s gained because of the variety of designs she gets to touch. We also talked about the obstacles of gaining legitimacy for doing faith-based work while also shining a light on the importance of visibility and representation as Black designers.</p>
<p>Vasheena&#8217;s story is both inspiring and thought-provoking, reminding us all of the power of design to connect communities and create meaningful impact! </p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>My name is Vasheena Brisbane. I am currently the associate director of visual design and communications at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. That means I do all things visual and design for the church. People usually ask me, &#8220;well, how much could there be for a church?&#8221; And typically, a typical church, there&#8217;s not as much, I think, as there is for this specific church. Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church is like the cathedral church of Presbyterianism. So like, St. Patrick&#8217;s is for Catholicism. So it&#8217;s a big historical church in midtown Manhattan, and we do church like everyone else &#8212; Sunday services. But we also have a large outreach ministry and we do a lot of work within the community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>And so, yeah, the church basically runs in seasons, right? So this is our off season. Summer is the off season and fall is homecoming. That&#8217;s when our senior pastor returns and we start a sermon series and there&#8217;s a magazine and there&#8217;s the season of Advent, which is from just after Thanksgiving until just after Christmas. And then there&#8217;s sort of a quiet season and then there&#8217;s Lent up until Easter, and then there&#8217;s a season of Pentecost. So we run in like a season, so it&#8217;s like a loop every year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, nice. I think for people that are, you know, for folks that are listening that even have some experience with Christianity &#8212; or just, I would say, Judeo-Christian religions, there is that kind of cyclical nature to the year that sort of revolves around that, right?</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Those specific events, sure. And we advertise for every single one of them. And so we advertise&#8230;I mean, advertise feels crass for religion, I think, but we do get the word out there, right? And so we do for the fall season, it&#8217;s a sermon series and it&#8217;s just like the topic that the preacher is preaching on for the season. And he&#8217;ll pick a subject and we&#8217;ll provide visuals for it. And so we do banners. We do a spread in the magazine that comes up for the fall, which has the fall events. Any happenings. We have a robust music program that has five or six concerts throughout the year &#8212; some free, some paid &#8212; so that needs advertising and visuals. We do banners on the facade of the church on Fifth Avenue. We do posters to talk about any programming that we have going on throughout the year. And to advertise the season, we also do brochures. And then there&#8217;s just all the regular stuff. Like every Sunday, we print a bulletin. That&#8217;s some of the more day to day stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So there&#8217;s a lot, I mean, there&#8217;s a lot that goes into, I think especially of a church of that size. It&#8217;s not just regular Sunday service. There&#8217;s a lot of media, there&#8217;s prints. I mean, there&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot. And we have an arts in our faith group. They do gallery exhibits &#8212; big ones &#8212; probably twice a year, maybe three times a year. We sometimes partner with artists and sometimes it&#8217;s something that the committee comes up with. The committee is made up of congregation members and they come up with it. And sometimes, it&#8217;s a collaboration. Sometimes I&#8217;m brought in to sort of make the vision that they&#8217;re thinking of come to life. And sometimes we collaborate on a vision. So it really just depends on the season and what people are thinking and what ideas they have. And sometimes they don&#8217;t have any ideas! And so we know we have a little small gallery that we do our exhibits in. Sometimes they have to do with the sermon; like this past season, we did&#8230;our senior pastor did a series called Tattoo, and so it was about the words of Christianity that are tattooed on your heart. And so we did an exhibit based on that where I made some temporary tattoos, tattooed them on the staff on various body parts, and photographed them, and we made that into an exhibit. And so it really just depends. So when people say, what is there to do? And I&#8217;m like&#8230;you have no idea. There&#8217;s a lot of things you can do in a church, especially a church of this size, I think.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, I think it&#8217;s fascinating that&#8230;it sounds like there&#8217;s probably, even with the regular cyclical nature, like you said, of different holidays and different things in the church, there&#8217;s just so much to do. And I would imagine you&#8217;re kind of, in a way, working, I guess, against stereotype, I think, because you want the messaging, of course, to appeal to the congregation. But you also want it to appeal to other members or even nonmembers. But there&#8217;s probably a way that you have to do it so it doesn&#8217;t seem so&#8230;I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s a good way to sort of describe this. I want to say cheesy, for lack of a better word. I feel like sometimes Christian marketing can be really wholesome, like, very white bread and 1% milk, kind of. Like, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Right. You do struggle with that a lot as a designer. I struggle with that because you want to be seen as, like, a legitimate designer, right? I went to school for this. I didn&#8217;t stumble into it, right? I might have stumbled into this specific job, but I didn&#8217;t stumble into the career of design. So I&#8217;ve attended conferences, like I&#8217;m sure you have. We could be having an amazing design conversation. And then when they&#8217;re like, &#8220;oh, so where do you work?&#8221; And then I&#8217;m like, &#8220;oh, I work at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church.&#8221; And then the conversation sort of just dies. Like, &#8220;ohhh&#8230;okay.&#8221; It&#8217;s not seen as valid to maybe designers that are working in a design firm or maybe in-house, a big in- house shop. So that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve struggled with, I think. And I think what I&#8217;ve learned is that I can&#8217;t focus on what you think about what I&#8217;m doing. I have to focus on why I do what I do and then just let my work speak for itself. That&#8217;s all I can do. And so when those things happen, I don&#8217;t take it personal so much. I just move on to the next.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I can see that. I mean, we talked about this a little bit before I started recording, but when I first started out as a designer, and I think probably as others have as well, you&#8217;re trying to find clients. And sometimes some of those first clients that you end up finding are churches because they don&#8217;t necessarily have design talent in-house or something. But someone&#8217;s got to design the regular Sunday service programs or they need to design funeral announcements or things like that. And often what I&#8217;ve heard, and even have experienced to some degree, is that they&#8217;ve largely kind of been negative experiences because the church doesn&#8217;t want to pay. And then when the church doesn&#8217;t want to pay, they try to make it seem like you should just be doing it out of the good of your heart for God. And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;well, I can&#8217;t pay my bills with that.&#8221; There&#8217;s this sort of negative stigma around it.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s like a stigma. Yeah. So I have not had that experience at this church, but I have heard that from other designers. And so for smaller churches, there is no budget for design, which I get. Everyone doesn&#8217;t have a budget for design. And so if you&#8217;re going to do those jobs, I think what you&#8217;re doing it for is the love of the work and the practice of it, right? Because these are not easy pieces to design. Like a Sunday bulletin is like a master class in hierarchy. So if you&#8217;re going to do this, you have to come to it, especially if you&#8217;re going to do it and be underpaid or not paid at all, you have to come to it thinking that you&#8217;re going to get something else in pay, right? So your pay is your practice. Your pay is the refinement of your type skills. Because if you want to learn type skills, do a Sunday bulletin every week and make it readable and make it pleasant and make it great, right? And so one of the things that was my first project, really to do with the church, I was hired freelance, and I was just looking for a bridge job, sort of between&#8230;I had finished up an internship at a design firm, and then I was like, &#8220;well, what am I going to do?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;okay, well, I&#8217;ll go on this interview as a church,&#8221; and I was just like everyone else. Like, it&#8217;s a church. It&#8217;ll just be something until I get a real job. And so I found this church and they came in. It was a good positive vibe. And they were like, &#8220;okay, you&#8217;re going to do Sunday bulletins.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;all right, fine, I&#8217;ll do that.&#8221; And so that&#8217;s how my work with them started. It started on a freelance basis. I was only doing bulletins. Then the person that hired me ended up leaving, and they hired a new director of communications, and he asked me to do something else. He was like, &#8220;oh, can you do this brochure?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;sure.&#8221; And then that worked out. And so it sort of just grew into something. It was not something that I had intended on. I didn&#8217;t intend on staying, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And now you&#8217;ve been there now for almost a little over 13 years now.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>I feel like&#8230;yeah, I think I started in 2012, to be honest. I have to check the dates, but it&#8217;s been a long time and it&#8217;s been a progression, right? So I started off freelance, project-based, 1099. Then I worked really well with the director of communications. Actually, he just retired. And so we worked really well together. And as each project came up, we just worked well together and the projects kept getting better and they were more interesting. And so I was like, &#8220;okay, well, I&#8217;ll do this project.&#8221; And then it was like, &#8220;we do this newsletter.&#8221; It was a newsletter &#8212; like an eight page, eight and a half by eleven [inches] newsletter. That wasn&#8217;t my favorite thing to do. But then we decided, &#8220;okay, let&#8217;s own it. We&#8217;re going to change it.&#8221; We turned it into a magazine. We turned it into a small eight and a half by five and a half [inches] pocket sort of magazine. Sort of like JET size. I mean, I think JET might be a little bit bigger, like that&#8217;s JET&#8217;s size, I think. Yeah. If any of your listeners know JET Magazine&#8230;.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, they know. They know what JET is.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>JET is dating me a little bit! Yeah. And so we sort of just evolved the communications of the church to the point where people call and ask us, like, &#8220;where do you get your Sunday bulletin done?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;well, it&#8217;s in-house. We do it all in-house.&#8221; So I think all the way back to the beginning of the question, which is, have I had that experience? The answer is yes. But if you come to the table from a place of, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get this experience and I&#8217;m going to better my craft through it,&#8221; then you don&#8217;t lose. Yes. You have to find other things to pay the bills. But if you can perfect something while also getting some experience, even if the experience doesn&#8217;t come with pay, I think you still win.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Right, I get that.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. I don&#8217;t think you have to stay there forever. But if you prove yourself and you&#8217;ve perfected it and they still don&#8217;t want to pay you, then you can politely decline.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Makes sense. Yeah. And look, being somewhere for as long as you have, like I said, a little over 13 years, that is impressive for any designer to be somewhere, especially in this modern age of design. If you&#8217;re somewhere for, like, five years, that&#8217;s great. But 13 years, that is amazing. Which to me is no surprise because you were named one of GDUSA&#8217;s 2023 People to Watch.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Thank you. That was surprising to me, so I&#8217;m still shocked that it happened. So to be honest, I&#8217;ve kind of just been, like, putting my head down, feet to the pavement, moving from project to project, trying to do my best work. In, I think, 2016, 2017, we got this magazine, and my boss, my old boss, he said he was pointing out all these different winners in the GDUSA magazine. And he was like&#8230;he said &#8220;you should enter this.&#8221; He said &#8220;you could win these.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;yeah.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;okay.&#8221; And so he was like, &#8220;let&#8217;s just do it.&#8221; And so we entered some pieces, and I ended up, the first year I think it was 2017, I ended up winning three awards. And so I was like, oh, I think that after about five years of you sort of just head down doing good work, in my opinion, not getting it judged anywhere, but I&#8217;m proud of what I&#8217;ve done here. And so it&#8217;s just like, it&#8217;s been like, five years of that. And then to see someone say, &#8220;hey, this is exceptional,&#8221; that was really heartening. And I feel like that&#8217;s when I said, &#8220;okay, this is like a career.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think in the beginning of people&#8217;s career, at least not for me, you don&#8217;t feel like, &#8220;oh, this is it. This is my career.&#8221; Some people are polished right out of college. That was not me. And so I didn&#8217;t feel as if I had a career. I feel like until that happened, I knew I was working. I knew that I could get a job somewhere. I knew I could design, but I didn&#8217;t feel like I had a career, I don&#8217;t think, until that happened. And I don&#8217;t think it was the acknowledgment. I just think not that was the wrong thing to say. I don&#8217;t think it was the fact that I won something, but it was the fact that people agreed that I was doing good work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that kind of validation is incredibly important. I mean, honestly, it&#8217;s one of the core tenets behind why I do Revision Path is to validate the fact that there are Black designers out there doing great work and that people actually want to talk with them about it and about their career. And it&#8217;s not in the context of a job interview. It&#8217;s like, no, we see you. We see the work that you&#8217;re doing, and we think that other people should see it too. Just getting that kind of validation is &#8212; and this is going to sound corny &#8212; but I learned that from Oprah.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anything Oprah says is corny!</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>But like, as I asked you before the interview &#8212; and people who have been on the show know this too &#8212; like, I always ask something that I call my &#8220;Oprah question,&#8221; and I got that from her, because she has said before, the thing that has made people want to sort of come to her show and come to the mic and everything is the fact that she validates wherever they&#8217;re at right now. Oprah doesn&#8217;t really do&#8230;well maybe now, since she doesn&#8217;t have the show&#8230;but Oprah&#8217;s not really doing shock journalism, you know what mean? Like, she&#8217;s not bringing people on to necessarily expose them. She&#8217;s like, just giving you the mic and giving you a platform to it. That&#8217;s it, you know?</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>And just be you. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>But that kind of validation in your professional career is super important, especially when, you know, you&#8217;ve put in the work to know that other people see that too, and they see you, and they see the fact that you&#8217;re putting out this kind of great work? I think that&#8217;s what we all want, especially as creative people.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And I don&#8217;t think I even knew how important it was until it happened. Yeah, and sometimes you don&#8217;t, because sometimes you&#8217;ve just got your head down. You&#8217;re just working, right? You&#8217;re just getting up every day, going to work, working, going home. It becomes a real practice. And sometimes in that practice, you can get real, just&#8230;yeah, you do. Because once you do something, it&#8217;s so repetitive. I mean, the work changes, but the process is still the same, right? You get up, you do it, you do your best, you go to bed, and so you can become numb. And so when you step outside that and then for me, especially to be like&#8230;it&#8217;s hard for me to say, &#8220;hey, I think this is great work to people.&#8221; You know what I mean? It&#8217;s hard for me to pat myself on my back. For some people, it comes easy. Like for my daughter, it comes easy for her. She thinks she&#8217;s great at everything, and I love that about her. We just don&#8217;t come from the same&#8230;we&#8217;re not cut from the same cloth. To even do that felt weird. And so I would encourage people to one, enter a contest just so that you can get a little bit of validation, because you don&#8217;t have to win to get validation. But I just think the simple process of editing your work and figuring out what you love and telling people, I did this and I love it, is a great practice for people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, what&#8217;s been the reception for you since the list came out and people have seen you on that?</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>The reception has been good. Like, the congregation? They congratulate me. They&#8217;re some of my biggest supporters, which I really appreciate. I&#8217;ve gotten, you know, friends and family. I thanked GDUSA online and on their social via social media. And so I&#8217;ve gotten a lot of follows, mainly, I think, on LinkedIn for that, and that&#8217;s about it. I don&#8217;t think anything major has come about because of it, but you never know. Your email came from it! I never would have thought that here I am listening to great designers on Revision Path, and Maurice Cherry is emailing me. Like, I never would have thought that that would happen. That was&#8230;it was so wild when it happened. I couldn&#8217;t even believe it. I was just like, &#8220;what? This has got to be a joke.&#8221; I could not believe it. It was shocking. I even sent it to my boss. I was like, &#8220;is this real?&#8221; He was like, &#8220;I think it is.&#8221; I said, &#8220;are you sure?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;are you sure?&#8221; I could not believe it. So the biggest thing to happen to me since then is you. You&#8217;re at the top of the list.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh! Well, I&#8217;m pretty sure that there are going to be bigger and better things after that. I think, one, winning awards, but then two, also being on lists like this, it just puts you in the view of other people to see the work that you&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Right. And, you know, it&#8217;s important to be in the view. But how do you get there? I feel like we go to school to learn our craft and to do our thing, but we don&#8217;t learn how to navigate a career. And that&#8217;s different. That&#8217;s different than just doing good work. You have to really know, like you said, who to get in front of and how do you get there. And I think that a lot of, like you were saying, what Revision Path does is put you in front of the people that need to see, I think. And I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s amazing about this platform is that you can get some visibility and whereas you might not be able to be on the other design podcasts. Yeah, because usually it&#8217;s like real rock stars. Not that people on here are not rock stars. Please don&#8217;t think that. But there is a specific lane that is hard to get in as a Black designer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Look, I can tell you from ten years of doing this show&#8230;. One, I&#8217;ve had a lot of people on who they&#8217;ve said, &#8220;yeah, this is the first time anyone has ever talked to me about my work outside of maybe like a job interview.&#8221; Their family doesn&#8217;t even ask them about what they do and how they get inspired. So I&#8217;m glad to be able to have the platform for that. And this is not to put down any other show in particular, but even when I was starting out doing the show and trying to network in the sort of, I guess you could say, &#8220;design podcast community&#8221; &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if it really existed like ten years ago &#8212; but there were other design podcasts out there. And even with me networking with them to let them know about the show and maybe give some ideas for guests, I was met either with complete silence or absolute hatred. </p>
<p>There was only one platform, one podcast that really was like, at that time that was like, &#8220;oh, we like what you&#8217;re doing. We&#8217;d love to have you on our show.&#8221; And that was this show called On The Grid. That was with this podcast network called 5by5. And there were three guys that did the show &#8212; it was Dan Auer, Matt McInerney, and Andy Mangold. And I was on their show twice. It was like a panel kind of interview thing. And that ended up sort of getting me into the view of other people because they were like, &#8220;oh, we didn&#8217;t know that Black people did design, let alone talked about it.&#8221; Like we haven&#8217;t already been in this industry for decades doing this work. But even just that one sort of opportunity to do that put me in the vein where I could be seen by all these other people. But even now, honestly, ten years out, and there&#8217;s of course other podcasts out there, and there&#8217;s even other Black design podcasts out there, it&#8217;s still kind of rare even from some of the larger shows to really hear or see from Black creative voices. And I&#8217;m saying this for design media, but Black media does that too. Black media is not really big on showcasing design outside of fashion. I would say, like, you may hear about a fine artist every now and then, but it often has to be in conjunction with something larger. Like, for example, Luna Iris Viktor. I think I&#8217;m getting her name right. I think it&#8217;s either Luna Iris Viktor or Luna Viktor Iris. But she did a lot of great work in conjunction with Marvel for the first Black Panther movie. But she had been an artist of her own acclaim well before then. It didn&#8217;t really start to get out into the community, the Black community, at least until that movie happened. So it&#8217;s something where, even now, Black media doesn&#8217;t necessarily look at us and the work that we do and sort of give any sort of celebration in that respect. So I think Revision Path kind of occupies an interesting sort of Venn diagram intersection between design media and Black media in that way to at least showcase, like, hey, this is work that we&#8217;re doing. Here are our stories in our own words. Here you go. This is what we have to go through. This is what we deal with. And I try to get a good cross section from like across the world.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>You&#8217;ve done a great job doing that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing the amount of artists I feel like, like you said, are people looking? You have to look, and you have to talk to people. And it&#8217;s like when your head&#8217;s down and your pounding on the ground and you&#8217;re getting your work done, it&#8217;s like you look up and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;where are all my people?&#8221; It&#8217;s like, well, I don&#8217;t even know where to start.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>And you&#8217;ve given us an amazing, valid place to start. So if you&#8217;re looking, look no further. Or look no further and then look further. Right? Because then at least you can tap into it. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, I like that. </p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. You can tap into it. Because even attending&#8230;because I&#8217;m constantly trying and failing to expand my network, because, one, I&#8217;m not a good networker. I don&#8217;t have the gift of gab. My husband has that, though. He definitely has the gift of gab, can make friends anywhere. And I am more reserved in that I&#8217;m not a wallflower because I can engage in any event, right? But also, I&#8217;m a little bit of an extroverted introvert, I think is what they call me. Okay. It&#8217;s like I am extroverted when called upon, but I do need that introverted time to recharge and become an extrovert. And so it&#8217;s been challenging to expand my network, especially going to conferences. And in the conferences, it&#8217;s often a sea of white &#8212; which is fine &#8212; but I also want to connect with other people, and it&#8217;s often hard to find. Or when you find them &#8212; I don&#8217;t know how to say this diplomatically; I&#8217;m going to try to say this as diplomatically as possible &#8212; but usually people are concerned with their status in that circle, and that status is often tokenism. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. </p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Which is not&#8230;I get it. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I get it. I just am resolved not to subscribe. And so, you know, a lot of times, people feel like we can&#8217;t talk because you might become the one, but they don&#8217;t know that. I don&#8217;t even want to be the one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>I just want to talk to you and learn. Yeah. That&#8217;s where I come from. I am a lover of knowledge and a sharer of knowledge. Ask me anything you want. I will tell you exactly what my experience is. That&#8217;s all I can give. This is my experience, and this is where I come from.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Look, in the early days of doing this show, when I tell you it was like pulling teeth to get guests, because when we first started, it was just an online magazine. I would interview people. I wasn&#8217;t recording anything. And I started recording in June of 2013 when Raquel Rodriguez, who was episode one, when she was visiting from Chicago and was like, &#8220;yeah, I want to be on the show.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;what show? It&#8217;s just a magazine.&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;oh, no, we could record it.&#8221; And I didn&#8217;t have any recording equipment. All I had was my phone, which is what we recorded it on. And it wasn&#8217;t until, like, almost a full year later in March of 2014, when I then sort of took the few recorded interviews I had done and said, &#8220;oh, let me just make this a podcast,&#8221; because it was just easier to sort of get out week by week. But there were a lot of people in those early days that were like &#8220;absolutely not. I don&#8217;t want to be on this. Why do you want to talk to me? This is like BET,&#8221; which kind of felt a bit like a slap in the face. Like, I understood what they were saying, but it was in such a derogatory way where it&#8217;s like, well, I&#8217;m not denigrating anyone by having you come on and talk. Why do you think it&#8217;s a bad thing that me as a Black media outlet wants to talk to you as a Black person? I think part of that might also just be behind some other Black media outlets that don&#8217;t make us look great. I&#8217;m not naming any names in particular.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>But some of them kind of peddle in&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>They pedal in some, you know&#8230;mess, and that unfortunately, gets unfairly sort of branded for the rest of us that aren&#8217;t doing that kind of stuff. And yeah, in those early days, it was like a lot of people have said no, which have then come back later and been like, &#8220;oh, can I come on the show?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;absolutely not. No.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>No, really? Did you not let them wanna&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>No, I reserve the right to not have you on the show. If you felt like for some reason this was negative against you, then, yeah, we&#8217;re not going to do it. There&#8217;s one&#8230;I&#8217;m not going to name this person. But there was one designer in particular. Let&#8217;s just say that when I reached out to them, this was a mixed race designer. When I reached out to them, they very much were like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do this. I don&#8217;t really consider myself, like, culturally Black. I don&#8217;t want to do it.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;okay, fine.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Fast forward to, I want to say, like, the summer of 2020.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>When, you know&#8230;murder of George Floyd, protests around this stuff&#8230;this same designer was very much like pro-Black Lives Matter. And I&#8217;m like&#8230;look, I&#8217;m not saying that events can&#8217;t happen in people&#8217;s lives that change them. I get that. I just thought it was really weird that this particular designer was very much like, &#8220;yeah, I&#8217;m not really Black.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, you have a very Black name, and you present phenotypically as a Black person. But now that this sort of thing has happened, that sort of, I guess, shifted you into your own sense of Blackness.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Right. It was very odd.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And then they asked to come on the show, and I said no. I was like, &#8220;no, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to be a good look for me at this point. It&#8217;s not you, I don&#8217;t think, for the show, this is going to work.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Our props to them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>But it was very weird.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>I would think it would feel less than genuine.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, yeah, it absolutely did.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I get it. I agree. And I get that stigma. Right? It&#8217;s like, okay, is this a Black thing? Am I only going to be able to do Black things? The people that say that are not realizing that, okay, that may happen. I doubt it. It may happen. But also, are you not pigeonholing yourself into something else that is not genuine?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>And if you are going to be stereotyped, shouldn&#8217;t it be as Black? I just feel like it&#8217;s a hard road we walk sometimes with trying to balance being legit with being culturally legit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s complicated. I will 100%.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s complicated. And so sometimes when people feel complicated, they just go to what&#8217;s easiest. Let me just go with the flow. Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>We are not afforded sometimes a lot of times, the opportunity to just go with the flow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>No, that&#8217;s true. That&#8217;s very true. I want to bring it back to your work at the church because there&#8217;s just some things that I&#8217;m really interested in. So you mentioned that a lot of the work is pretty much all the work done that you do with the church in house, or do you work with an agency or with freelance? Because you said you started out freelance.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, no, it&#8217;s all in-house. It&#8217;s all in-house. It&#8217;s just me and my direct report, which is the director of communications. He does the writing and editing and sort of like this tells the story and I&#8217;m involved with the visuals.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>So I&#8217;m producing everything, I&#8217;m sending everything to print. I&#8217;m sort of crafting the visual of everything. And so that&#8217;s sort of how we work. We are the communications department and we&#8217;re a two person team, and I handle all design and production and he handles all story editing, press and stuff like that. And we come together when it&#8217;s time to like, okay, we have this story we need to tell and we need visuals for it, we need materials for it, we need digital stuff for it, digital assets. And so we do work with web developers that we contract with, but that&#8217;s really the extent of our outside work and print houses. But there&#8217;s no I am the designer, it&#8217;s just me. It&#8217;s a one woman show and we try to make it work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, I mean, you&#8217;re definitely making it work again, you&#8217;ve been there for as long as you have, and just the breadth of work that you described earlier I think definitely speaks to your prowess as a designer to be able to navigate between the different types of design that you have to kind of work on.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, and so a lot of our work is for the senior pastor and he&#8217;s shaping the vision of the church. And so a lot of the stuff we do is specifically from him. And sometimes he comes with like, okay, I saw this. One of my favorite projects is he saw this illuminated manuscript letter and was like, &#8220;yeah, I&#8217;m thinking of the sermon series and I saw this.&#8221; It&#8217;s like an O. It was like a golden O with like a lot of flowery elements around it. And he was like, &#8220;what can you do with it?&#8221; That turned into a brochure and banners and posters and we actually won an award for that. And so sometimes he comes with something little, sometimes it&#8217;s nothing. Like, this is the theme. We come back, workshop it, and then come back to him and present him with a draft. And it&#8217;s a yay or nay. Usually it&#8217;s a nay. I mean, usually it&#8217;s a yay! Once in a blue, it&#8217;s a nay. That&#8217;s sort of how we work. We are the team. It&#8217;s just us too. </p>
<p>Some of the projects are self-driven. We&#8217;ve done history exhibits because we have a pretty robust archive from the church. And so we&#8217;ve done a history exhibit where we&#8217;ve done a timeline of the church from 1808 up until the present. And so that was more something that I drove because I was interested in it. We have an archivist, and so it seemed ashamed that this stuff wasn&#8217;t accessible or visible to the church. I was like, we should do a history exhibit. So we did one, and currently we&#8217;re working on doing transforming a larger space in the church into sort of a permanent historical exhibit. So we&#8217;re visiting other churches that have archives as well and seeing what they&#8217;re doing to exhibit their historical stuff and if they&#8217;re doing anything. So I&#8217;m not sure if that answered your question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>No, you did. And we&#8217;ll link to your website in the show notes because I really want people to see the breadth of the work that you&#8217;ve done and the references, even, that you&#8217;re bringing into it. Like, I&#8217;m looking at this one campaign not a campaign, but it&#8217;s for a sermon series called This Is War, and you&#8217;re like, you&#8217;re pulling details from, like, Picasso to put all this together so it&#8217;s not just put a cross here, put a dove there, and it&#8217;s done. It&#8217;s real design work going into it.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And so our pastor, he loves fine art, and so a lot of times he comes to us with pieces and he&#8217;s like,&#8221;oh, I just love this piece.&#8221; And he just gives him me a JPEG and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;okay, well, I love this piece.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;okay, well, how can we make this interesting? How can we make this a thing?&#8221; All he really wanted was a postcard. And I was like, &#8220;no, we need to do&#8221;&#8230;it&#8217;s such a beautiful piece, and it&#8217;s very long. And I was like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t pick one section of this to do one little postcard.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;we have to do three postcards with different parts of the image on each,&#8221; and so that&#8217;s what we did. And each postcard had a different part of the image with a different color, with the words This is War. I guess you&#8217;re looking at it right now. And on the back, I think the messages were slightly different. </p>
<p>I feel like working in a church is &#8212; and working specifically in this environment &#8212; is like there are a lot of restrictions, right? You have budgetary restrictions. We don&#8217;t have a lot of money to spend on this because this is not a firm, right? We&#8217;re not spending all the money on design, right? So we have to make whatever we do impactful. But it also has to be cheap because we&#8217;re spending our money outreaching to the community. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing. We&#8217;re spending our money furthering the word of the church and of Presbyterianism and of God. So, yes, the design has to be good, right? But it also has to make sense to the congregation. You can&#8217;t come in with this shiny new thing that costs so much money, so many dollars, because people are donating this money. This is money that people have said we&#8217;re going to give to you to further the Kingdom of God, right? Not to make shiny things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>And so doing it in that way when we did this sermon, because this sermon series, I think it was only three weeks, if I&#8217;m not mistaken. And so it&#8217;s like he wanted something to be impactful, but also, how do we do it on a budget? And also we have our Lent season coming up right after this, where we do spend a little bit more money. And so those usually are the more fun project, the smaller projects. Like, how can we make this small thing impactful and exciting and interesting and make people that are walking on the streets because it&#8217;s a tourist church, too. Like, people are in the city visiting. Across the street is The Peninsula and The St. Regis. You know, major hotels. And so if people are here on a Sunday, you want to make it impactful for them to maybe want to come to service, maybe they want to stop in. So those are the things I think that they&#8217;re most exciting to do. Yeah, the small little one off things in addition to the regularly scheduled seasonal stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, I would imagine, even with what you just mentioned around financial considerations, because people are donating to the church to keep it as a community institution, right? But I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s other considerations that you have to keep in mind, like, of course, theological and cultural sensitivity, inclusivity, tone and voice. There are a lot of things that you have to put into the design that a designer, say, maybe for a software company or an advertising agency, don&#8217;t have to consider.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s true. And I&#8217;m always thinking, like, &#8220;how can I make this a Pepsi thing but keep it church?&#8221; Right? I&#8217;m always trying to figure out, like, okay, yes, this is church, but how can we make it exciting? So that, one, it&#8217;s interesting for me to do. Like, I want to make my work exciting. And two, it gives people pause. Like, oh, I might walk in there because I see this that&#8217;s a cool this, or that&#8217;s a cool that. My goal is always to generate interest in church by making church things not so churchy, so that it appeals to the audience that we have, but also people that might be walking by that are not necessarily religious or not looking to attend on Sunday, but because maybe because they saw this poster or these banners, maybe they will. Maybe because they saw this magazine, they will.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it draws you in. And I think with designers being problem solvers, this is such a really unique problem to try to solve. Like, with every design that you have to do, it has to appeal to the congregation. But then also, how do you make it, quote unquote, design, right?</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Yes. Because you can&#8217;t just appeal to the congregation. Also it won&#8217;t grow right. You have to appeal to people outside to bring them inside. Sometimes that&#8217;s a hard sort of walk, a hard tightrope to walk because you don&#8217;t want to go too far where you get to where it&#8217;s not respectful of the institution. But also you want to make it so bland that no one is interested. So you have to sort of walk that tightrope. But I like to err on the side of go wild and then let them rein me back in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>And so we can sort of pick and choose elements that are exciting and figure out how to strike the right balance.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Now, we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time talking about your work, and I want to kind of pivot this conversation to learn more about you as a person. You&#8217;re originally from New York. You grew up in New York City. Tell me about, like, were you exposed to a lot of art and design growing up?</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Not particularly. I&#8217;m from Staten Island, New York. I grew up in the neighborhood of Mariners Harbor on Staten Island. And my mom, she worked for the department. &#8212; she works, still works, for the Department of Transportation &#8212; and she was a single mom. And we went to school. We came home. I didn&#8217;t have any emphasis on the arts. I just was always interested in it. I was always interested in architecture and fashion as well. And when I had planned to be an architect, to be honest. </p>
<p>So I started my time at the City University of New York, CUNY I started my time in the architecture program. And that year was transformative for me because I figured out that when I had to take a photography class as part of you have to take electives. And so I said, all right, I&#8217;m doing all this technical work. Let me do something that&#8217;s less technical. And so I&#8217;ll take a photography class as one of my electives. And I took it, and I just fell in love with it. I was just like, I need to be doing design. And so I switched my major. My mom was not happy I did it. And honestly, I was failing physics anyway. I was not a good physics student. And so I switched to design, and I never looked back. That&#8217;s it. I was born in San Diego. My mom was in the Navy, and so was my dad. And so they were in San Diego when I was born. And then eventually they split, and then my mom came back to New York because she&#8217;s from originally Staten Island as well. So, yeah, I&#8217;ve been here my whole life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, while you were at City College in New York, you had started something there called the Electronic Design and Media Club.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Electronic Design and Multimedia Club.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Multimedia Club. Did that come about, sort of after you switched over from architecture?</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, so after I switched from architecture, I believe it was Ina Saltz or Annette Winetraub, which I&#8217;m not sure if you know those names or not, but they&#8217;re pretty big in design. They asked me to start the club, and I did. And we ran it while I was there. And it was just, you know, we&#8217;d meet, we talk about, you know, critique our work. And it was just a way for us to network. Because when you go to a&#8230;because CUNY is like a commuter school, no one lives there. So it&#8217;s hard to generate community because you&#8217;re not sort of forced in a space together all the time. You sort of come, you do your classes, and then you go home. And so it was a way for us to foster community there, and I enjoyed it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So it sounds like even with just that little &#8212; I mean, not that little &#8212; but even starting that club, that kind of was your budding interest in sort of design and how that could possibly be something more than just like a hobby.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, for sure. When I started doing it, I was just like the first year, I loved the idea of design, but I had no idea I wasn&#8217;t one of these kids who went to school for I didn&#8217;t apply to be a designer, right? Or I didn&#8217;t submit a portfolio or anything like that. And so I sort of transferred over into it. So I had to learn the basics in college, whereas some of these kids knew they wanted to do it from the beginning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>And so that was hard for me because I&#8217;d never been like, an average student. I&#8217;d always been an above average student. So for me, it was struggling with not having a formula to be good. So I just had to really learn the ropes and just be like, okay, I&#8217;m just going to have to be comfortable with being uncomfortable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Got you.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>And it was&#8230;it was uncomfortable for a while. And then I began to&#8230;I don&#8217;t want to say I got good because I don&#8217;t think I was good when I was in college, but I did some internships. I interned with InStyle Magazine, which was huge for me. I interned at Smart Money magazine when that was a thing. It was years ago. That was a big deal. And it also helped me decide how I wanted to work in design, because once I worked at InStyle Magazine, I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do magazines.&#8221; Because the experience was just so micro. Everyone has their small little part to play in the magazine. It felt like in order to have any creative sort of agency, you would have to rise so far and be so far in your career. I just couldn&#8217;t understand how you could be happy until you got to be the design director and you could do the main spreads of the layout. Interesting, because that&#8217;s the only person that was doing those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>That helped me understand, like, okay, magazine is probably not going to be your way. Then. I worked at Smart Money magazine, and it was a lot smaller, and they let me dig into their files, redo some of their layouts. It was just a different experience. So those two opposite experiences helped me decide to go small. I never wanted to go big after that because I was like, big is too restricting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>And you don&#8217;t get a lot of freedom once things are established. And I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s exciting about doing nonprofit work in general and church work, is that you&#8217;re sort of writing the rules as you go. Like, yes, there are some guidelines. Obviously, you have to work within some things, but whatever it turns out to be is up to you. And so I didn&#8217;t know that then. Looking back now, I can say that, but I knew I didn&#8217;t want to go big when I was younger. I didn&#8217;t know exactly what I wanted, but I knew it couldn&#8217;t be big or else I wouldn&#8217;t be satisfied.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, one of your early career experiences, after you graduated, you worked for the Anthology of Recorded Music. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>New World Records. It&#8217;s a non-profit record company. Oh, my gosh, so many years ago. Yeah. And so I got that job, I think, right out of college. And what I did was, if I&#8217;m remembering correctly, I scanned album covers, helped make little press releases for their work, and there was newer records where they would showcase sort of electronic and I&#8217;m having a hard time describing the music because it&#8217;s not your typical recordings. But they also had a nonprofit branch that they distributed this music to music schools, music programs across the country, like at colleges.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>And that was called DRAM. And&#8230;please don&#8217;t ask me what DRAM stands for now, because I can&#8217;t remember, but I sort of made the look and feel for that website and for their website and just, like, getting all their content up and online. And so that was like, my first job outside of college. It was very production heavy. There was not a ton of design there&#8217;s. A little bit, a little bit of design, but mostly production. And so that&#8217;s what I did there. </p>
<p>And so that&#8230;I think I don&#8217;t remember when I left that, but after I left there, I freelanced for a while, and then I did an internship with a design firm. I don&#8217;t remember the name of the firm. Now that I think about it, that was my early career. It was my first job, and I learned how to work in an office in that job, which they don&#8217;t teach you that in school, you know how to design. But how do you design in an office when you have all this other stuff to do all day and so that was my first experience of designing for work and learning that you&#8217;re not going to be doing design all day long. You have many other things that you have to do in addition to your design, especially when you&#8217;re the only one. And I feel like in every single job that I&#8217;ve had, it&#8217;s been just me, right? The lone sort of designer or production artist or I think my title was officially production artist at that job. And so it was eye opening and it was nonprofit and it was small. And I enjoyed parts of it, the parts that had to do with design and sort of production and figuring out the back end of websites, because websites were not new, but they weren&#8217;t as advanced as they are now. Right. But there was still a lot to learn, especially right out of school. So I enjoyed that. I enjoyed that process.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So you were working for this nonprofit, then later you ended up working for the church. I&#8217;m curious prior to that, and I think we might have touched on this a little bit earlier, but did you have any skepticism about doing work for a church?</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Yes. So this specific job came up on, believe it or not, monster.com. I had a resume on monster.com, which I don&#8217;t even know if that still exists &#8212;  have no idea. But yeah, they just called me off&#8230;the current director of communications called me and was like, &#8220;hey, we&#8217;d like you to come in for an interview.&#8221; I went in with the idea like, &#8220;oh, this is great. I&#8217;ll have something to do. I&#8217;ll be able to make some money until I get a real job.&#8221; That was my exact words. And so I went in, the interview was fine. They said, &#8220;okay, well, we&#8217;re going to contract you on a freelance basis.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;great.&#8221; I was doing bulletins. My work was do the weekly bulletin, and that was it at first. </p>
<p>So I would go on site one day a week, I think maybe we&#8217;d sort the bulletin out, get it done, I&#8217;d send it in, and that&#8217;d be it. And then probably two or three months after I started, the director of communications left. So they had an interim and they needed help doing the magazine. So I said, well, magazine, they needed help doing the newsletter. It was an eight and a half by eleven, eight pager, I think, so two sheets. We started doing that. It looked awful, but I was just there to maintain until the new director of communications.</p>
<p>So they hired the new director of communications, Tim Palmer. He just recently retired. My favorite boss ever, I&#8217;ll say. And he asked me, &#8220;oh, the senior pastor wants to do this brochure. He said, &#8216;do a brochure for his fall sermon series.'&#8221; I said, &#8220;sure, I&#8217;ll try i&#8221;t. So we did that. He loved it. And then it was like, &#8220;okay, well, do you want to work on the newsletter?&#8221; I said, &#8220;all right, let&#8217;s do the newsletter.&#8221; </p>
<p>And so it sort of just snowballed from there. Went from just doing the bulletins to bulletins and brochures, then the newsletter. Then the newsletter turned into a magazine. The first one we did was a 32-pager written by him, designed by me. And then we moved from there and projects just sort of kept coming up. And so I was skeptical, like, &#8220;okay, I&#8217;m only going to be here for a little while.&#8221; But things just kept happening and the project was like, &#8220;oh, I&#8217;ll take that project. Oh, that sounds interesting.&#8221; And I just kept taking projects. And eventually, like three years later, I&#8217;m still here and I freelanced with them for three years and I was freelancing with other people. </p>
<p>Like during that time, I freelanced with a private equity firm called PrivCat, and they were doing sort of private equity reports. And so a designer had already designed the magazine and so I was tasked with producing that. But then they would do these sort of digital, I don&#8217;t know, two, four or five page reports. And so I designed those. And so during the church work, I was also doing private equity work, which was a little bit dry, but the designs were a little bit more exciting because they had to make the design exciting so that the content didn&#8217;t feel so dry. Yeah, I never intended for this to be a long term job. It was supposed to tie me over to my wonderful design firm job that was going to come along, I&#8217;d be working at an amazing design firm. But it just kept growing and the opportunities just kept coming. </p>
<p>And then eventually they asked me to come on full time. And I was like, &#8220;well, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; I was still skeptical. Like, I don&#8217;t know if I want to work for a church full time. Maybe I&#8217;ll just come three quarter time so I&#8217;ll give you all a set, couple of days, we&#8217;ll do that. And so I did that for a year and then eventually the job just became so big we started doing banners and we&#8217;re doing exhibits. It just became so big they sort of made a position. There was no position in place for a designer. And so the position that they made was called a communications associate. And so that&#8217;s what I was when I finally came on full time. But technically I was a designer. </p>
<p>And so eventually we started doing more work and more exciting work, different things, starting to get a little bit more creative freedom. Because once you build sort of trust with people, I was able to do more. I was able to able to be more creative and suggest more. And when you get that trust, people trust you to take them further than maybe their mind can take them creatively. So that&#8217;s how it grew. And so, yeah, the answer to that is yes, I was very skeptical and no, I did not want to work for a church. I will just say that outright because it&#8217;s not something that has cachet when you say it in a space. Right. I work at a church, so that was hard for a while. For me, I don&#8217;t want to believe that it&#8217;s ego, but it probably was ego.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ve talked about on this show before as well. I&#8217;ve talked to designers maybe that don&#8217;t live in a big city, or that do work for an insurance company or something like that. The work that they do is not the flashy stuff that you&#8217;ll see in design media or that might win big awards or stuff like that. But when you think about the fact that everything that we interact with as humans has been through some lens of design, that means that you&#8217;re still designing for experiences that everyone needs. Everyone can&#8217;t work at a software company. Everyone can&#8217;t work at Apple or wherever and do kind of mind-blowing design work. Some people have to work at an insurance place or a healthcare brand or something like that. That may not be, quote unquote, sexy work, but the thing is that&#8217;s stuff that people still use all the time, and those need to be thoughtfully designed experiences as well.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Right? You have to design for the people. You have to design for someone other than yourself. And I think that makes you a better designer, because your focus can&#8217;t be just making it sexy, which is fun. Right. But it has to be like people have to be able to engage with whatever you make and be comfortable doing it. I wouldn&#8217;t want to say I guess it&#8217;s more of, like, legibility and readability, right? So they have to be able to read the content because it&#8217;s content. They need to consume something sexy. You can just enjoy it for the sexiness. Even if you don&#8217;t get it at all, you can just enjoy it. And those are fun projects to do, don&#8217;t get me wrong. But when you have to design with that sort of thoughtfulness, it brings a certain level of compassion to your work that I think you can miss when it&#8217;s just all about the sexy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, you&#8217;ve been, like I said, working at the church now for almost 14 years. When you look back over the span of your career from when you started to now, how would you say that you&#8217;ve evolved as a creative?</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>I feel like my evolution has been yes, technical. Because I think when you do anything for a long period of time, you should get better, right? I don&#8217;t want to say you obviously get better, because some people don&#8217;t, but you should get better. And I feel like I&#8217;ve gotten better, I&#8217;ve gotten faster, and I&#8217;ve become a much more, I feel like, compassionate designer, and not in the sort of sappy way, but just, like, understanding that people are coming here for a reason. And that reason is not always the reason you set out to design. Sometimes it&#8217;s just like they just need this content for whatever they need it for for their lives, right? Like, yes, you want to do your best work, but your best work can&#8217;t be the best work unless you have that person in mind from beginning to end. And I don&#8217;t think in the beginning, I didn&#8217;t know anything about that. I didn&#8217;t approach my work thinking about how a person would feel when they opened it. Like, on a more high level, like, yes, will they like it? Will they think it&#8217;s pretty fine, but is it thoughtfully done so that they don&#8217;t have to work harder to get what they need? I think that evolution for me has been the biggest and it has been the most rewarding thing to do. Like, how do I think about these projects through the lens of who&#8217;s going to consume it at the end and how they&#8217;re going to consume it? </p>
<p>That&#8217;s one thing about working with one community for such a long time is that you can really get to know the people and know what it is they&#8217;re looking for when they&#8217;re picking up a material, or when they&#8217;re picking up a magazine when they&#8217;re picking up. Because we also do the pledge campaign brochure, which is every year, the church has a pledge drive to fund the church. And so it&#8217;s an ask. It&#8217;s basically an ask for money to help us to continue to move forward the vision of the church. And so presenting those materials in a way that is sort of respectfully and thoughtfully done so that people feel connected to the institution, but also are able to get from the piece the value that they bring by giving their money, I think is hard to do. It&#8217;s a tricky ask. And when you&#8217;re designing materials for that, you really have to be careful about how you&#8217;re asking, why you&#8217;re asking. And that has a lot to do with the content and the words, but also what images we&#8217;re going to show. How are we going to connect the feeling of church to this ask for money? That&#8217;s a hard thing to do.</p>
<p>And so I think my favorite piece that we did was it was a few years back now, maybe 2018, 2019. I did some hand sketches of all the favorite things that people always mention about the church. And then some not so, some not so not favorite, but some sort of mundane things that people it&#8217;s like your money doesn&#8217;t just pay for, like this beautiful I did a sketch of the organ and of the rose window, which is part of the architecture of the church. It&#8217;s like, yes, we pay to maintain this, but also we pay for hymnals. We pay for palms on Sunday so that you can wave them for Palm Sunday. And so just connecting those sort of cherished things with the more nuts and bolts of the church is hard to do. And I think if you approach it through a lens of compassion, you can get it done. But I don&#8217;t think you can make those connections if you don&#8217;t know a community and approach that community and your work with them through compassion and really understand what it is that they love and how you can present it in a way that makes sense to them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What are some pieces of advice that you&#8217;ve gotten throughout your career, throughout your life that you find yourself coming back to?</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;ve gotten advice on my career, but I feel like I&#8217;ve gotten advice on life, and it works for your career. And that is just like, go where they love you. And I don&#8217;t want that to come off, like, go where you don&#8217;t get any pushback or any flak or anything like that, but just, like, go where you are valued and they see your value and they believe in your value, and then you can, in turn, produce things that are valuable for that community. I think it&#8217;s a give and take. You can&#8217;t just go somewhere because of the money or because it looks good or for the cachet or because it looks good on your resume. I think that the most valuable advice I&#8217;ve been given is, like, go where you&#8217;re treated well and you can do work that&#8217;s meaningful and to you and hopefully to others.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What&#8217;s something that you kind of are still working on unlearning?</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>I feel like I&#8217;m working on unlearning this idea of a charted path. I feel like everyone wants the charted path. Like everyone wants that &#8220;I go to school, I get the beginner job, then I get this rock star job, and then I make a lot of money, and then I retire.&#8221; Right? I feel like that&#8217;s the path. Whatever. Your thing is fine. But what I&#8217;m still trying to unlearn I&#8217;m still trying to unlearn that. Right? I&#8217;m still trying to be okay with my career path, which is not a sexy career path, but has been really rewarding. And so I&#8217;m trying to unlearn thinking of my career in terms of what other people think is valid and trying to think of it more along the lines of what do I think is valid and what can I do to grow myself, regardless of where that may be, because I think you can grow anywhere. It&#8217;s just up to you. I don&#8217;t think the space determines if you grow or not. I think you and what you bring to it determine what you grow or not, and I&#8217;m still learning that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Where do you see yourself in the next five years to that point? Where do you see yourself growing into?</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>I feel like nonprofit is just my calling, even though I didn&#8217;t ask for it. When I say nonprofit, it doesn&#8217;t have to be like a small nonprofit. I feel like maybe museum work or work where I&#8217;m helping to broaden the minds of people. I don&#8217;t see myself going in a commercial direction. And maybe that&#8217;s how I can speak about this better, is that I know where I don&#8217;t see myself. I don&#8217;t see myself, like, going to work for Pepsi at Coca-Cola or a big commercial brand. I don&#8217;t see that for myself. But I do see more of a sort of philanthropical or sort of path for me because I just feel like it&#8217;s been rewarding up until this point. And so at this point in the game, I&#8217;m looking for rewarding work. And I feel like that has been very rewarding for me and it&#8217;s also been very freeing. I don&#8217;t feel like you can get me, I can be wrong. I don&#8217;t feel like you can get as much freedom working for those big organizations as you can with small nonprofits or even a little bit larger of a nonprofit. I just feel like they&#8217;re more willing to take a chance on your creativity than global established brands are.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>That is very much true. That&#8217;s very much true because oftentimes, especially with these larger companies, they don&#8217;t value. What I would consider what you&#8217;re doing is like you&#8217;re kind of a generalist. Like, yes, you work as a designer, but you&#8217;re not just doing one specific type of design. Like your work is spanning print and media and visual, et cetera. Whereas if you&#8217;re in a larger company, you&#8217;re kind of just slotted into doing one thing and you have to do that one thing. You can&#8217;t really branch out if you want to. Even if you have those skills. You&#8217;re not allowed to kind of do that within that one position.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Right there&#8217;s a designer who does this. They do this thing and that&#8217;s all they do. I would die slowly if I had to do that every day. And the exciting thing about working for a church is that I can go in one day, I&#8217;ll be working on banners the next day. Like right now we are working on that exhibit project that I mentioned earlier and we&#8217;re visiting other congregations and figuring out how they do stuff. And so we&#8217;re doing field trips and so every day is sort of different. And I didn&#8217;t know that I wanted that until I did it. And I was like, this is amazing. Every day is something different. Like, today we work on this, tomorrow we&#8217;ll be working on that. The summer is pretty busy for us. We&#8217;ll be working on a bunch of fall projects and it&#8217;s all different. And some people work in these amazing design firms and they&#8217;re doing one thing every day it&#8217;s the same. And I can&#8217;t. My soul won&#8217;t my soul won&#8217;t allow it. I would be restless and miserable, I think.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work? Where can they find that information online?</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>My website vasheena.com. I&#8217;m on LinkedIn. I am on social media at @sheenzfix on Instagram. I&#8217;m on Facebook for Vasheena Brisbane. But Instagram and Facebook, I&#8217;m not a big social media, so if you&#8217;re looking for me there, you&#8217;re not going to see much. But my website has some work that I&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, we had this big conversation for people that are listening. We had this big conversation earlier about kind of social media and being on which that&#8217;s a whole other thing, but I completely understand that. But Vasheena Brisbane, thank you so much for coming on the show. One just thank you for the breadth of work that you&#8217;re doing through the church. I think it is amazing and powerful and impactful to see someone doing this work, particularly a black woman, doing this work. It really means a lot. I mean, to me, it means a lot, but I think it means a lot, of course, to the community that you&#8217;re doing this type of work. And to be a creative problem solver and to do this kind of thing in a space that perhaps design is not necessarily looked at or considered or valued in a really impactful way, I think it really means a lot. And I&#8217;m super excited to see where you go from here. You&#8217;ve been doing great work. You&#8217;ve been recognized, you&#8217;ve been awarded. So clearly other people see that too. And my hope is that through this show, many others can kind of see the work that you&#8217;ve done thus far.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Vasheena Brisbane:</b></p>
<p>Thank you for having me. And thank you for doing what you&#8217;re doing here for the community and for our community specifically. It&#8217;s needed. And when I found the podcast, I was so excited that it even existed because I had been asking myself, like, where are all the black designers? And now I can connect with people and you can meet them and you can hear from them and hear their stories and to make for a more well rounded experience. And it&#8217;s invaluable. So please keep doing it.</p>

<p>It takes a lot of hard work, dedication, and sacrifice to make it on your own as an artist, and Akeem Roberts knows this well. This illustrator and animator juggles being an associate director at Holler Studios with freelancing for <em>The New Yorker</em>. Even though Akeem&#8217;s been in the game for nearly a decade, I have a feeling that we&#8217;ll be seeing his work for many years to come.</p>
<p>We talked about Akeem&#8217;s new gig at Holler, and from there he went into sharing his unique approach to storytelling. Akeem also spoke about attending the University of South Carolina, went into some of his influences for his artistic style, and gave some great advice for handling operational tasks as a freelancer. Akeem knows that success doesn&#8217;t happen overnight, and he&#8217;s put in the time and effort to come out on top!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
My name is Akeem S. Roberts. I&#8217;m a cartoonist for The New Yorker. illustrator for J.D. the Kid Barber series, and a book designer by day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2023 been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
2023 has been pretty crazy so far. I started off the year unemployed, just doing freelance stuff, and as of like three weeks ago, I just got a brand new job and sort of getting the reins on that and everything&#8217;s been going pretty good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. Congratulations on the new job.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have any plans for the summer? Anything you want to do?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
For the summer, right now I don&#8217;t have anything planned. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll just try to go to a beach or a lake or something and just relax for a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious, from last year to this year, aside from the employment change that you mentioned about, have there been any other kind of changes for you? Anything else going on?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I&#8217;d say from last year to this year, I&#8217;ve more committed to being in publishing versus animation, which was kind of the main thing that I did at the start of my career was mostly animation. After I started doing stuff at The New Yorker and stuff with Kokila, I slowly started making the transition into publishing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What brought that transition on aside from just more work? Was it a feeling or anything?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I felt like for animation mostly it was things move a little bit slower and it feels like the artists&#8230; I guess I was a cog in the machine animation-wise, while publishing, even though I am still just in the machine, I have a little more of a voice and a little more of a say, and I guess it just feels more freeing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds like there&#8217;s just more, I guess, agency, I guess, in publishing.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yes, exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Let&#8217;s talk about some of your work that you&#8217;re doing as a freelance illustrator. I&#8217;m curious, what does a regular day look like for you these days?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
If I&#8217;m doing dailies for The New Yorker, I&#8217;ll try to get up around like 7:00 and then hit Twitter or some kind of news source and just go through trending and try to see what&#8217;s going on, what happened in the past 24 hours. Then, I&#8217;m seeing if I can find a joke and connect that into a bit for The New Yorker for their daily cartoons.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;re creating new pieces every day, so you have to check the news, be like, &#8220;Oh, this is funny,&#8221; draw something, and-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; then it&#8217;s just done? That&#8217;s it?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
It depends on the process. Sometimes, for instance, I got one in for a daily after the trailer of the Barbie movie dropped. For that, I had an idea of doing something of scientists trying to get to the Barbie because there was all of those memes about people saying three, how many or whatever for Barbie movie tickets. I wanted to like have that idea of getting to the Barbie movie first and having it happen immediately, so I was first thinking like scientists creating a time machine to get there on the day that it&#8217;s released. Then, for The New Yorker, I thought of that idea, but I put a little bit of &#8217;80s nostalgia in it, so then I changed it to kind of like Back to the Future where they&#8217;re trying to go to the future to see the Barbie movie.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like Marty and Doc Brown and the DeLorean?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, so they&#8217;re all sitting in the JCPenney parking lot trying to get to the Barbie movie.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s funny. It&#8217;s interesting, though, that you have to, I guess, get them in by a certain time, but it&#8217;s every day, so that makes sense, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. For the dailies, it&#8217;s you have to get the sketches to them before 9:00, and then they&#8217;ll let you know if they like it or not by 10:00, and then you have that done by noon. The one that I did for the Barbie was like a bonus for the daily, so I didn&#8217;t have to get that done till 2:00.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. No, that&#8217;s just interesting that it&#8217;s so fast. I don&#8217;t know why I thought maybe you would have done it the day before or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I think some people do. I&#8217;m reckless.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I see you do a little bit of everything, book illustrations, you do comics, you do animation, you do editorial work. Is there a particular one of these that you prefer to do?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I think I prefer to do comics and publishing chapter book stuff. I feel like that gives me the most control, but also the most freedom. I feel like when you&#8217;re usually doing a comic book, you got to do like 30-something pages and the deadline&#8217;s pretty tight, but when it comes to chapter books or whatever, it&#8217;s a little bit&#8230; It&#8217;s still tight, but it&#8217;s not as, I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s not as hard just because you&#8217;re just doing one panel kind of basically, versus doing nine panels, trying to semi-tell a story, designing multiple backgrounds. It&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. I can see how doing it in that sort of controlled format also, it&#8217;s just easier on you probably just on your workload, you know?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me about how you approach a new project. What does your process look like?? Does it vary per type?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, it definitely varies per type, per project. For anything that&#8217;s like New Yorker, that&#8217;s just I&#8217;m just on the subway jotting down ideas. I send my notes app and I&#8217;ll just like think of jokes, try to connect them, and then from there I&#8217;ll draw a little small thumbnail and then sketch a bigger illustration for that and then send that to the New Yorker. Then, my process for when I&#8217;m doing my web comics also starts on my phone. I just write a joke, describe what&#8217;s happening in the panels. Then, from there I do a thumbnail and then I finalize it and then add all the texts and stuff.</p>
<p>Then, for animation, usually with this, there&#8217;s only a couple of those that I started from scratch where I had a original character and original plot. Those started off more&#8230; I was in Word and Google Docs instead because it was longer format and I had to share it with other people to read, look over, see if they had any notes on the script. For those, it&#8217;s like script first, and then you start the thumbnails and animating each thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What if you&#8217;re doing, say, editorial work or something for the book? Is that process kind of the same?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, editorial is like you&#8217;ll&#8230; Most of the stuff that I did editorial for was like for Men&#8217;s Health. They have this section called Cool Dads-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; so for that, I would like&#8230; They would give me the article that a celeb wrote, and then I would read it. Then, from there, I would like think about an illustration that kind of hit the vibe of what the celeb wrote. The latest one I did was for like LeVar Burton. His whole thing was talking about reading books to his daughter and giving her the freedom to read and how he wants to be there for her. Then, he also makes a reference basically to Harry Potter.</p>
<p>For that, I just drew him in like the garbs with a wand fighting off the Dementors because in the article he talks about how his daughter stopped reading because she didn&#8217;t like the Dementors. He was like, &#8220;Maybe I should have not introduced her to Harry Potter.&#8221; I just took that vibe and added it to the illustration. I would send like three sketches and then the art director over there would pick which one they think is the best. Then, from there I would finish and color it and everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You kin of have to read a little bit of what it is that you&#8217;re going, then, to make sure that the illustration kind of matches that in some way.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. With every editorial or even like the children&#8217;s book, you have to read the manuscript and everything first before you can fully get the gist of it to kind of sum it up in whatever illustration, whether it&#8217;s for a chapter or for an article.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Last year, I was Editor-in-Chief of a print magazine. This was part of the job that I was doing at the time, and our in-house creative director had decided for our first issue that he wanted to also do all the editorial illustrations. I was like, &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; &#8220;a lot, but if you want to do it.&#8221; He also did the cover and everything. I was like, &#8220;Look, more power to you.&#8221; It was so funny because the way he approached it was like, &#8220;Well, I have an idea of a theme for the whole magazine,&#8221; and so he just did illustrations based on whatever, and none of them matched the article in any sort of real way. I&#8217;m telling him like, &#8220;You should probably try to make sure that the images match what the article is about. You drew a polar bear. This article has nothing to do with polar bears. What&#8217;s the connection for the reader to look at this?&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, well, the connection is winter because we&#8217;re publishing the magazine in the winter.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Huh. No, no.&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t make any-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s sounds like a little bit of a stretch, but you know, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, that&#8217;s one of us that feels it. I mean, eventually we ended up sort of just going with the concept because we didn&#8217;t have enough time, but for the second issue, the pieces fit the article more and I told him like, &#8220;Look, read the article and then get started with designing.&#8221; He would just start designing and be like, &#8220;Oh, I have to read the article?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yes, it would help. It would be helpful so at least what you&#8217;re designing matches that in some capacity.&#8221; So&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah yeah. You got to read the article.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
You got to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, how do you approach storytelling through your art? I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s more than just like in, say, the book illustration example, it&#8217;s more than just reading. How do you really approach telling a story through your art?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I would read it and then I would like try to imagine it in my head and say, for instance, for the J.D.the Kid Barber series that I did, for that it was reading it, and then the art director would kind of tell me what they imagined in it. They were like, &#8220;Oh, this character is in their room,&#8221; but it&#8217;s up to me to add anything else that I wanted to add into it, so I would just try and look up Google images basically to find what I imagined this school look like because references, it&#8217;s always great to have. I know sometimes it&#8217;s like, especially when you&#8217;re starting out, you want to not use any references. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;I can do this from my head.&#8221; You can&#8217;t. I mean, you can, but you&#8217;ll miss the small details that you want to have caught if you weren&#8217;t looking at a reference. I would look at reference, kind of imagine the area, and then just try to imagine the characters just living and breathing.</p>
<p>For some of them I would add even like small jokes. One of the illustrations, the art director was, &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s losing this battle, but everyone has numbers up saying 10 for this guy who&#8217;s winning.&#8221; Then, for one of those, I drew his friend in there giving him a thumbs up with like a two, so everyone has a good rating except he has a bad rating for the guy, and he&#8217;s got a thumbs up giving it to the guy being like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I got your back.&#8221; I try to put in little jokes like that inside the book so kids will see it and notice it. I&#8217;m trying to always make an illustration for, I guess, like the younger me if I was reading it as a kid.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. Do you try to add a little something that&#8217;s just unique to you in each image that you do?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
If I do try to add anything, I try to add humor. I feel like that&#8217;s my go-to form of communicating is trying to add a joke if I can.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, we&#8217;ve had a few New Yorker illustrators on the show before, most recently, Liz Montague. I&#8217;m curious, how did you get started with doing illustrations for The New Yorker?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I feel like my story is very unique. I have yet to hear anyone else who&#8217;s had this experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Basically I was like tabling at this convention in New York called Mocha Fest, which is like an art festival, and I had a bunch of comics that I had done online and this little short story that I did that was in black and white. After that weekend, I got a message from Emma who&#8217;s like the Editor at New Yorker. She was, &#8220;Oh, do you want to do a daily shouts?&#8221; Basically like, &#8220;I like your work, and I was wondering if you want to try to submit some jokes or a daily shout or anything like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was like, &#8220;All right,&#8221; and then I sent my first batch, and then after that Friday after I sent it they were like, &#8220;Oh yeah, this one is in.&#8221; I sold one the very first time I tried, which was crazy good. I don&#8217;t know anyone else who&#8217;s done that. Maybe other people have, but I had sold it first immediately. Then, the next week, I also submitted some batches and I also sold another one, so I was feeling really good. I was like, &#8220;All right, I can do this,&#8221; and then after that, it was 40 weeks of like not selling anything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is that usually like the&#8230; You said that was sort of unique to you. I&#8217;m just curious, what would a cartoonist normally do if they&#8217;re trying to get into like The New Yorker? Is there a more-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; typical process?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s like submissions that you can do on the website, and you can send them batches that way. Then, they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;You&#8217;ve made it,&#8221; and then you&#8217;ll get Emma&#8217;s email, so you can start sending batches to her directly. Sort of like a filtering process before you get her email, but I just got it immediately and then got one in immediately, which felt good. Then after that, it slowed down a bit, obviously.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, you&#8217;re still doing it now, so, I mean, it obviously worked out in your favor.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there a particular style that you think, I guess&#8230; I guess it probably varies per publication, but for The New Yorker, and not to harp on them specifically, but is there a particular style that you think they&#8217;re looking for?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
For The New Yorker, I think they&#8217;re looking kind of for something that is sketchy and has detail, but not too much. Nothing that will distract from the joke.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Basically just like if you had to jot down a joke with stick figures in five minutes, that&#8217;s kind of the ideal I think like they want in terms of detail is just not enough stuff that will distract from it. Then, they definitely don&#8217;t want it too cartoony, which is like I always put my stuff, and maybe sometimes it&#8217;s too cartoony, but there&#8217;s a line where you&#8217;re trying to hit where it&#8217;s not cartoony in the sense that it feels like on a Saturday morning cartoon, but also not cartoony in the way that it feels like it&#8217;s Family Guy. You got to hit a perfect, unique just like sketch style that takes a lot of work, but looks simple.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm. I get what you&#8217;re saying. I get what you&#8217;re saying. Certainly, nothing that&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t know, Marvel style, like not a comic kind of thing, but you also-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; want it to have some level of expression and polish, as you would say, that doesn&#8217;t detract from the joke.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve worked with some other big clients as well, Boom! Studios. You mentioned Men&#8217;s Health earlier, Conde Nast, which is over a bunch of different magazines and such. Is it easier working with bigger clients like those than, say, smaller clients?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
For sure. I feel like bigger clients, they kind of have an idea and they kind of let you be free, especially if they know your work. They&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;All right, I saw your work. I kind of imagine what you can do. If you&#8217;ll do that, we&#8217;ll be great.&#8221; I feel like when it comes to mom and pop type of clients, it&#8217;s a little less freeing for the artists in a sense because I guess the dollar value that they&#8217;re spending is&#8230; it&#8217;s precious, their $500 or whatever.</p>
<p>This thing that you&#8217;re doing for them, especially if it&#8217;s like a logo or anything that they&#8217;re going to use over again for t-shirts, it&#8217;s very important. Because of that and because of how important it is to them, they&#8217;re sometimes a little overbearing. They&#8217;ll overwork in illustration because of having multiple revisions that kind of the artist loses&#8230; The more revisions that&#8217;s happening, the artist kind of loses the spirit sometimes. If it&#8217;s 20 revisions to get this logo done, the artist each time is less and less into it-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; and that doesn&#8217;t mean that there will be a point where they don&#8217;t care. The artist is always going to care because it&#8217;s for their portfolio and their job. They want it to be good. It&#8217;s kind of like a way of the artist helping&#8230; not helping themselves, but guarding themselves from being like&#8230; If you&#8217;re too personally attached, you&#8217;ll get upset about the notes-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; so you have to be removed. The more and more you get notes, the more and more you&#8217;re like, &#8220;All right, this is getting away from my vision and I&#8217;m trying to see if I can get exactly what they&#8217;re seeing in their head,&#8221; which is not normally something an artist can reproduce is what another person is envisioning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like if I had to do 20 revisions on a design, I would want to fire the client. To me, that feels like the client really doesn&#8217;t know what they want, and they feel like you&#8217;re just going to keep iterating on it until it magically appears to them. I mean, I know that&#8217;s how we&#8217;re sort of just pulling that number out of anywhere, but I get what you&#8217;re saying about the dollar value, which I think is something that&#8217;s really important. A lot of these bigger companies just have the budget to be able to do bigger type projects, more audacious ideas, et cetera, but then smaller clients, that money has to really go far. That&#8217;s not to say that larger clients aren&#8217;t as invested in the end project, but it just takes on&#8230; There&#8217;s an added gravity to it when it&#8217;s from a smaller client or for a smaller client, I should say.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Can you discuss any upcoming projects or collabs that you&#8217;re excited about?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Right now, I don&#8217;t really have anything coming up. I guess the only thing I have is I&#8217;m working on a graphic novel and I&#8217;m trying to pitch to HarperCollins or Kokila to just get the story that I have in my head off the ground.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I&#8217;ve always wanted to do a graphic novel. I cannot draw, but I have had ideas for characters in my head since I was a teenager to put into a graphic novel. I&#8217;ve talked about it here on the show before. People probably already know this, but one day I&#8217;m going to have the time and the funds to make it happen, so I hope it works out for you.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m hoping it works out, too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I want to get more into your work and your career, but let&#8217;s learn more about Akeem. Let&#8217;s learn more about you. Are you originally from New York?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
No, I am kind of like from everywhere is what I tell everyone. I was born in North Dakota and my Mom was in the military, so I moved around a lot from North Dakota to Alabama, to Germany, to South Carolina, to Texas, to Maryland, to New York. A lot of places, but most of my time was in the South, so I guess I could just say I&#8217;m from the South.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Did you do a lot of drawing growing up?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yes. I would just say that I started drawing&#8230; There&#8217;s two big reasons I started drawing, so first I was just doodling, and then in third grade, I won an award for the state in South Carolina, third place for this painting I did-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; and that was a good boost. I was like, &#8220;Oh, wow, this is cool. I can draw.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t really think of anything of it. I was just like, &#8220;All right, I can doodle.&#8221; Then, in fifth grade, there was this girl that could draw way better than me. I was crushing, so then I would try to get better to impress her, and I think that&#8217;s kind of my origin story is trying to get better to impress a girl. Then, I just kept drawing on my own.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did it work?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
It did not work, you know? So-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; ultimately it was for me, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I had someone on the show a couple episodes ago, Kendell Burton, and he was telling me how he first&#8230; He&#8217;s an art director now, but he was like, &#8220;Oh yeah, I first got into design in the web because I was making a blog on Zynga to try to meet girls.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Does that work?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Never does.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You were doing a lot of drawing and stuff growing up, and I see you went to the University of South Carolina and majored in Media Arts. Tell me about that time. What was that like?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Media Arts, basically, I ended up there because I was very late at applying for colleges, and my family had just moved back to South Carolina, so then I just applied there. This guy that I met with was like, &#8220;Oh, tell me what you want to do.: I was telling him that I probably would want to do some animation, like comics and stuff, and so he was&#8230; The Media Arts Program, which is basically teaching you how to use the Adobe Suite while learning about film, photography, script writing, and so it was like mostly on the film and photography side. Then, I minored in Illustration, so I did like one figure drawing class on my senior year and one illustration class on my senior year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you feel like they really kind of prepared you as an artist?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I feel like not in a sense of what I ideally wanted to do, which was basically do animation and stuff like that. I didn&#8217;t have a student film. I didn&#8217;t even take the animation course because I never signed up in time, but I guess overall, it kind of helped me be a jack-of-all-trade because certain things with film and photography and script writing can transfer into illustration. Having that does help me visualize ideas, but not necessarily in the sense of, &#8220;Okay, you do this something. You&#8217;ll have a job immediately after.&#8221; You know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think school is interesting in that way. I mean, I majored in Math, so I didn&#8217;t think-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Oh no.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; when I was graduating I was going to have&#8230; Actually, no. I mean, I did major in Math, that&#8217;s true, but I had like a scholarship thing lined up with the program that I was in that I was going to work for the government after I graduated. Then, that fell through like junior year because of 9/11. It fell through. I was like, &#8220;Oh, I have no plans for what I&#8217;m going to do when I graduate.&#8221; I was working part time at the Symphony here in Atlanta selling tickets, and I did that, I think&#8230; I did that up till I graduated, and I remember when I graduated they took the calculator away from my kiosk because they were like, &#8220;Well, you have a math degree now. You don&#8217;t need this.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Is that supposed to be funny?&#8221;</p>
<p>I mean, I didn&#8217;t need it, but I didn&#8217;t have any sort of career plans lined up after graduation because I thought I was set. I really didn&#8217;t even pursue other companies. I snuck my resume into other departments&#8217; resume books so I could get interviews at places. I was wholly unprepared going into senior year for any kind of actual career goals. I was in college just because I was a nerd that liked math.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah. That actually sounds very familiar to my story. That&#8217;s basically kind of like how I ended up in New York was my friend got me an internship in New York, and then I did that internship for the summer, but it kind of fell through near the end. Then, I was working at Starbucks in South Carolina. I was making $9 an hour, but the rent was just so much. Most of my money was going towards the rent-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; and then it was like&#8230; I think the rent was&#8230; I want to say almost like 600, almost 800, which is a lot. Then, they were like, &#8220;Oh, you could transfer to the Starbucks in New York,&#8221; which I transferred and I was making like 13. Then, the apartment I had up here was 584 with everything included, so I was way better off staying in New York, and that&#8217;s just like how I got here was not planning on staying. I came up for an internship and I was like, &#8220;All right, I&#8217;m just going to go back,&#8221; but then it just seemed to work out better for me to just live here than be in South Carolina barely making it-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; that makes sense, and I would say also probably as an artist, I mean, you kind of want to be in the cultural capital of the country when it comes to experiences and stuff. I would imagine you probably wouldn&#8217;t have access to the same level of experiences in South Carolina that you would in New York City, you know?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I mean, I feel like&#8230; Okay, so when I was going to college, there was this rumor that actually a bunch of comic artists actually lives in South Carolina, which might be true, but I just never met anyone.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If I recall, and this was years ago when I interviewed him, Sanford Greene, who&#8217;s like, I know he&#8217;s done stuff for Marvel, for DC, pretty prolific visual artist, lives in South Carolina. He lives in South Carolina.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Oh really?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, he went to Benedict&#8217;s.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yep.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, so like yeah, I guess&#8230; Look, I guess South Carolina is the home for the comic artist, but I just could not find that community at all, but comic artists tend to be homebodies, so you would never really see them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I&#8217;d imagine, yeah, it&#8217;s probably not&#8230; There&#8217;s no collective or something like that. I would say it&#8217;s probably just easier in New York because of availability and just the cultural atmosphere of the city. I came from a small town in Alabama, and if I would&#8217;ve stayed there after I graduated high school, I&#8217;d know I wouldn&#8217;t be doing what I&#8217;m doing now because there was no kind of technology or design or anything. You either got married, got into the church, or maybe worked a factory job. Not a lot of options.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s not endemic of the South, but just in particular, like-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah [inaudible 00:30:14].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; your environment can help out, you know?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
No, no, I hear you. I have a bunch of family from Alabama.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. One of your early career gigs, you were at this place called ideaMACHINE Studio where you worked as an animator. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
All right, so crazy with that was one of my friends came up and he was doing photography. I was still working at Starbucks at this time, and he was like, &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s an animation studio just like here. Do you want to apply?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;All right, cool.&#8221; We possibly could work in the same building, whatever, so I applied. Then, I got the job, and then that same day my friend got fired from whatever company he was working at in the building, so it&#8217;s like we didn&#8217;t get to work together, but he did help me get this job by seeing it. Then, at that same time, I was still working at Starbucks, which I worked that job while also doing Starbucks for like a year and a half just doing both of them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, and at Starbucks, I had just became a shift manager. I would only work two or three days a week, but it was weird because I&#8217;d be in charge then, so it&#8217;s like&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You were able to kind of juggle it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I was able to juggle it, but it was surreal once I think about it, just like how many hours I was working. It was a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How was ideaMACHINE Studio? Was that kind of your first studio experience?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, that was my first studio experience. That one, it was a little more&#8230; I guess in a sense it kind of trained me, kind of gave me the animation class kind of a sense because I went in there knowing some stuff, but not really knowing the 12 principles of animation or anything like that, just what I saw online. Most of the stuff that I did for them was kind of like whiteboard explainer videos.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
It was like for pharmaceutical companies that had this idea, but wanted it to be explained in a simply way. That&#8217;s what we did for them. There was tiny stuff that you can animate, and then I would push it every once in a while to try and get better at my animation chops and my graphic design skills. I guess in a sense that job kind of trained me, but it was very reluctantly because the guy who runs the company was&#8230; I was trying to get better at art, and he was like, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to get better at drawing.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yes, I do.&#8221; Then, I just kept pushing and doing my web comic on the side was also something I did. Just work on my skills and progress my abilities to draw and stuff like that. Was just doing that weekly in order to force myself to put something out consistently and have a foundation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, so you were doing this kind of freelance work or doing your own work at least as well as doing this nine-to-five. How did you balance that?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I did not sleep a lot is how I balanced that. Basically, I would work during the day. If I had a Starbucks shift, maybe it was two or three hours, so I&#8217;d work nine to five, and then I would walk over to the Starbucks. I just happened to be super close to this company and then work four hours there and then come back home, which the commute was good. It was like 30 minutes, not that bad, especially for New York, and then work on my freelance stuff. Then that started again in the morning. It was a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s amazing the stuff that we pull off when we&#8217;re younger just to try to get that&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, I guess you just have all that youthful energy. You can get it done. Nowadays, absolutely not. I&#8217;m in bed-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; at a certain hour. I not staying up pulling all-nighters anymore. No, I get what you&#8217;re saying. It takes a lot to try to make sure you&#8217;re doing all of these things because, of course, you&#8217;re doing what you have to do to pay your bills and whatever, but you&#8217;re also establishing yourself during this time doing your own thing, which I think is super important. It&#8217;s something I tell a lot of designers that come on the show, especially ones that just start off, like have something on the side that&#8217;s just your own thing, you know?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You can still do what you have to do to get involved with your career at your workplace, but have something that&#8217;s just yours.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, after you worked at ideaMACHINE, you ended up at another studio called Holler where you were their Associate Animation Director. Was that a big shift from your work at ideaMACHINE?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, that was a big shift. One of the main things that like&#8230; The reason I left ideaMACHINE was first I wanted to grow as an artist, and then the second thing was that they were in Brooklyn, and then they were moving the company to New Jersey. I was&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to step foot in New Jersey, no offense to New Jersey, but I was just like, &#8220;I live in Brooklyn. The commute is crazy. Getting on the path just to get there, I absolutely can&#8217;t do it.&#8221; This is around the same time that The New Yorker reached out to me, and then this company reached out to me and they were like, &#8220;Hey, do you want to do a test for us?&#8221; I did a test for them. I had my Cintiq and everything all set up, and then my Cintiq broke that weekend-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; and I had to use the Bamboo, which is kind of like is still a drawing tablet, but just doesn&#8217;t have a screen. I had to use my Bamboo tablet and finish that animation for them, which is a quick reaction GIF that was like three seconds long. I did that over the weekend and they liked it.</p>
<p>Then, I started working there and the culture was very different. ideaMACHINE&#8217;s culture was kind of like you were doing like a student project. You would have art director&#8230; They would like help you, but not with any direction. The art direction was purely up to the animator. The way that it looked was purely up to the animator. The client would give notes, but it wasn&#8217;t like I had to follow a guide. I was the guide. It was like everything I did at ideaMACHINE from like the music to audio, sound effects and all of that compositing, there we did&#8230; It was a one-shop stop for one artist on each video. It wasn&#8217;t like working as a team really. It was kind of one guy is doing this, and if they need help with the animation, they&#8217;ll ask you, but it wasn&#8217;t anything that was ever felt like a cohesive team effort where everyone is trying to draw in the same style or anything like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm, so it seems like it was definitely just a ramp-up in terms of responsibility, though, right?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, so for Holler, when I first started, I was just doing little three-second GIFs and there&#8217;ll be client stuff, and then we&#8217;ll work on those. Then, later on, I started directing some shorts that they did right before I left. There was one called Akemi-chan: Is It Magical?, which is an idea that I had which was like a play on Magical School Girls trying to do a bunch of anime inside jokes kind of stuff like that. I was writing the script for that and then guiding the people that was working with me of how I wanted it to look and fleshing out storyboards and having more of a commanding role, which felt good, which kind of led to my newest role is sort of still doing that. It was kind of a stepping stone of becoming in charge, taking a step back and letting people do their things, but also helping them grow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. I would imagine even with that, it&#8217;s sort of helping you out in your freelance because you were still freelancing also during this time with Holler?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. With Holler, I was still freelancing. Like the beginning of 2020, like in January 2020, I got a call from Kokila being like, &#8220;Hey, do you want to work on this book?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;This name looks familiar.&#8221; I was looking at the art director&#8217;s name, and then I looked it up and it was the same art director for Hair Love, which I loved Hair Love. It was great. They&#8217;d just had that short come out. It was beautiful with Matthew A. Cherry. I was, &#8220;Wow, I would love to work with them.&#8221; I reached out to them and I was getting started. I was like, &#8220;Man, I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m going to do this with the commute, but I&#8217;m going to try and make it happen.&#8221; Then, of course, the pandemic happened, so it made it a little easier for me to finish my day job and then jump straight to my freelance. From there, every day I was doing illustrations from like 9:30 at night to like 2:00 in the morning-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; just to get those things done, and it was a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, but I mean, I would imagine it changed the way you work freelance, right?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, definitely. Freelance before I felt was more if I felt like I had the energy to do it, I&#8217;d do it-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; but with the book, it was like, &#8220;All right, you got to get these pages done. You got to get these multiple books done. You kind of have to treat this now like a full-time job where you clock in.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;All right, my clock-in time is 9:30 at night to 2:00 in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, that&#8217;s good. You get into doing it, you kind of time box your schedule, it sort of helps out, especially if you&#8217;re doing it on a regular basis.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, something that I&#8217;ve seen at least over the past decade that I&#8217;ve done this show, but I&#8217;d say probably prior to that as well, you started to see a really big increase of Black artistic talent, visual artistic talent specifically. Cartoons, animations, fine art, like you mentioned Hair Love from Matthew A. Cherry. No relation, I think, I think. Any genealogists out there want to dive into that, I&#8217;m more than welcome.</p>
<p>When I see all of this, I also end up seeing this question about representation, like that always seems to come up, which I think is kind unfair that if you are a Black artist that you have to represent your community through your work. I think it&#8217;s up to the individual artist what they choose to do. Is that something that you feel like you have to do through your work? Have you gotten that kind of, I don&#8217;t know, sense of&#8230; I don&#8217;t even want to say responsibility, but have you gotten that, say, from other people, from clients, et cetera?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, I would say there&#8217;s a little bit of that, and there&#8217;s like, for instance, when I first started at Holler, I was one of the only two black people there that was the artist and black people in general. One of the things I did when I started there was like I didn&#8217;t want to get pigeonholed as the guy who you only come to for Black stuff, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
That I immediately just did not draw. I drew like animal characters that I knew were Black or like Mother Earth was a character that had an Afro, but I knew she was Black, but it was like I didn&#8217;t do anything that was explicitly Black because I didn&#8217;t want to get pigeonholed. With my comic stuff, it&#8217;s slice of life, but there are times that I do stuff that is political, but those are very few and far between. Then, my main stance on that is just I want my web comic to&#8230; There&#8217;s a bunch of web comics out there where it&#8217;s just nothing really happens. It&#8217;s just like couples chilling and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>I was like, &#8220;This web comic, I&#8217;m doing it to show that Black people are normal. This is my every day. This is slice of life. There&#8217;s like nothing big going on. No overarching villain. This is just a Black guy chilling. Here&#8217;s a look into this. It&#8217;s not what you normally expect.&#8221; I feel like there&#8217;s that, and then sometimes if there&#8217;s bigger issues, I&#8217;ll just bleed over. Then, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;I have to address this.&#8221; I will-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; but most of it I&#8217;m just the way that I&#8217;m thinking of representation is just like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m just a normal guy on the internet. This is what a normal Black dude is doing-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; you know? Chilling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I like that, and I&#8217;m glad you sort of framed it in that way. You know, it&#8217;s interesting, even after doing this show for as long as I&#8217;ve done it, people will only think Black designers come in one specific type. I mean, that can be whatever that type is what that type is, but I say that to say that there&#8217;s a lot of variety in what people might think might just be a monolithic set. One thing I&#8217;ve tried to do with the show is like, yeah, I have designers, but I&#8217;ve got cartoons and illustrators. I&#8217;ve had footwear designers on the show. I&#8217;ve had software developers on the show. I try to make it pretty diverse in general just to give a sense of what we&#8217;re doing out here in terms of creativity in this kind of digital age. I&#8217;m glad that you framed it in that way. I think that&#8217;s a really good way to look at it.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, that was also one of the things when I did the J.D. the Kid Barber books was the reason I worked so many hours on it was because I really wanted the illustrations to have like an angelic feel or like magical feeling, and to have there be depth in the Black character&#8217;s skin, so it wasn&#8217;t just a gray tone because it was on black and white, but it wasn&#8217;t just a gray tone for the skin and no light. I made sure that there was an airbrush. I showed the details of Black skin so when a Black kid opens it up, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, my skin is beautiful.&#8221; I made sure the skin popped, and that&#8217;s what I was like&#8230; That was another way of what I was thinking of representation, but not in the sense of, &#8220;Oh, this stands for something,&#8221; but just in a subtle way of like a kid opening a book and seeing that Black is beautiful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Who are some artists or illustrators that have influenced your work?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I got the classic Calvin and Hobbes. Loved the Garfield. Loved Boondocks. Maybe it wasn&#8217;t age-appropriate for me to be watching it when I was, but I did love The Boondocks. Strong anime influence. Just a bunch of stuff. Even speaking of The Boondocks, when I was in college, I think this guy is named Carl Jones. He worked on The Boondocks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah. He was in Columbia, South Carolina, for something. I don&#8217;t know what he was there for, and he saw my sketchbook. He was like, &#8220;Oh, let me look at this.&#8221; Then, he looked at it and he was like, &#8220;You got some good ideas here, but you really need to work on your fundamentals.&#8221; From there, I just started working on my fundamentals like crazy, which I reached out to him and I told him that and he was like, &#8220;Wow.&#8221; Then, that was it, That was the last we talked, but he was like, &#8220;Wow, thanks.&#8221; Then, he started following me on Instagram and I as like, &#8220;All right, cool.&#8221;</p>

No, that&#8217;s so interesting. Early&#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t even say&#8230; This wasn&#8217;t even in my career, and I keep sort of making these parallels because you&#8217;re saying some things that line up directly with some experiences that I&#8217;ve had. This was the year, God, I sound so old. This was like 2000 I want to say, &#8217;99, 2000 maybe, but I was palling around on the internet. This was back when Yahoo used to be a big destination on the web for a lot of people.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It had chat, it had games. I mean, ask any elder Millennial about Yahoo Spades, and they will spin you a tale, okay. Yahoo had a lot of these user groups that you could just join or whatever. Very similar to like, I guess, a forum or something like that. They had one around Black comic books that was just called like Black Comics. When I tell you the cr√®me de la cr√®me of Black artists at the time were in there, I&#8217;m talking Denys Cowan, I&#8217;m talking Dwayne McDuffie. Dwayne McDuffie-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; actually gave me a critique on a comic book idea that I had. I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I want to make this comic book about these like&#8230; They&#8217;re ninjas, but they&#8217;re Black, and I&#8217;m going to call it Black Ninjas.&#8221; I mean, I can laugh about it now. This is terrible. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;This is just-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Oh no.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; &#8220;you&#8217;ve just taken Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,&#8221; which I love, &#8220;you&#8217;ve just taken Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and mapped their direct characteristics onto Black people.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;If you want to make something that&#8217;s your own, you really have to make it your own. You can&#8217;t just copy from what someone else has done.&#8221;</p>
<p>That has stuck with me. I mean, I&#8217;ve certainly taken that advice with other projects and things that I&#8217;ve done, but this was way back in the day. It&#8217;s amazing how even just like those kind of little comments that you get from someone that has been where you&#8217;re trying to go can help just set you in the right direction, that kind of indirect mentorship in a way.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to any aspiring artists out there that are just starting out in the industry? What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Work on your fundamentals, but also when you&#8217;re doing contracts, there&#8217;s a couple of things you need to make sure you have, which is a kill fee. If you finish an illustration, no matter how much percentage of it, they&#8217;ll still pay you what they said they&#8217;ll pay you. That way, even if they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, you finished this illustration,&#8221; and then they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Actually, we don&#8217;t want to do the project anymore,&#8221; if you have a kill fee, that would be like, &#8220;Hey, I finished a hundred percent of this project. Pay me a hundred percent of the project.&#8221; No matter what, they still have to pay, which is important.</p>
<p>Then, make sure you have a limited number of revisions. I like to do three revisions, and then if a client goes over that, they pay for that, so like you get these three revisions, then anything else they pay for it. That allows the client to think about it because I feel like if it&#8217;s unlimited revisions, the client is just going to keep being like, &#8220;Oh, what if this was pink? What if this was blue? What is this was orange?&#8221; If you&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Hey, you have three revisions,&#8221; that kind of nit-picky stuff with the client they&#8217;re not going to do because they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, these are important. Let me actually think about it.&#8221; Like, &#8220;Oh, can I just imagine that color in blue or whatever versus asking the illustrator or artist to do it for them.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Then, after that, I would say also save 30% of whatever you get for freelance for taxes because you do not want to get caught with your pants down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are you speaking from personal experience there?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
No, I was able to catch it. I didn&#8217;t let that happen to me, but I&#8217;m always worried. I&#8217;m always trying to save just in case. I don&#8217;t want to end up having to pay too much in taxes and don&#8217;t have any money in my account.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good idea. That&#8217;s a good idea. How do you stay inspired and motivated in what you do? I&#8217;m curious. How do you handle burnout or any sort of periods of low motivation? How do you get through that?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
That, I feel like whenever I&#8217;m in a funk, especially when I&#8217;m drawing stuff, I kind of just doodle a comfort character, which for me is like I love Sonic the Hedgehog. Sonic 1 was like one of the first games I ever played. I always draw Sonic, and it helps me get out of the funk because I feel like the funk you&#8217;re usually in is just because you&#8217;re progressing in your mind, but you haven&#8217;t kind of caught up to your hand yet. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, this is looking bad,&#8221; because I know my taste is a lot better in my head and I can visualize it, but I&#8217;m like my mind, my body hasn&#8217;t quite gotten there yet. I feel like if you have a comfort character that kind of helps you put things in perspective, I guess.</p>
<p>For me, it&#8217;s Sonic, which whenever I&#8217;m feeling out of it, I&#8217;ll just doodle a little Sonic and I&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Hey, this was better than what I did before. That keeps me motivated, and I always try to measure myself only to myself. Yeah, there&#8217;s going to be artists and stuff that you look up to, but make sure you just look at how you are progressing so that way you don&#8217;t lose motivation and drawing. If you&#8217;re drawing and then you see another person who just draws something straight out of the air and it&#8217;s perfect and beautiful and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Man, I can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; you just got to like slowly keep working. Just look at yourself and be like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m slightly better than what I was the other day,&#8221; and just keep going.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I&#8217;d love to have this graphic novel come out and then continue doing stuff in publishing, because right now my job is designing book covers-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; so I don&#8217;t do the illustration or anything in that. I just do the layout, the fonts and everything-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; and I feel like that has been a little freeing in order to look at the process, but also pick other artists that will be good for a work or a job or something like that. I guess I give them the opportunity to show themselves.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I think designing book cover certainly is a&#8230;that seems pretty cool. I&#8217;ve seen awards go to just book covers in terms of design and everything, so that&#8217;s a pretty cool gig to have.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m liking it so far. Only three weeks in, though, but it&#8217;s good right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
You can find out more about at akeemteam.com and everything pretty much at Akeem Team, which ironically, that is just like an AIM username I made back up in middle school and I just kept it,</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, it&#8217;s yours. It&#8217;s yours forever.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good, man. Akeem Roberts, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. Thank you for, I think, demystifying a little bit about what it&#8217;s like to be a working freelance artist. I think what&#8217;s probably the most important thing that I gathered just from this conversation and from your story is that this wasn&#8217;t an overnight success. You always sort of had this gift for drawing, and then you cultivated that through college and then through your additional work experiences. Then, you were also freelancing and now you&#8217;re doing cartoons in The New Yorker and you&#8217;re designing book covers and stuff like that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all a process, like you&#8217;ve managed to continue to build your skills up at every step of the way, and I think that&#8217;s something that for most people, particularly for most people I think that are listening, it&#8217;s just an important thing to know that success doesn&#8217;t come overnight. You&#8217;ve really kind of worked hard to make a name for yourself. I&#8217;m excited to see what else comes out from you in the future, so thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Hey, thank you so much for having me, man.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed my conversation with this week&#8217;s guest &#8212; the one and only Keith Henry Brown. This prolific artist has a catalog that few can touch, with work appearing in <em>The New York Times</em>, Carnegie Hall, Blue Note Records, and the Brooklyn Academy of Music, just to name a few. But Keith is so much more than just an artist, as you&#8217;ll come to find out!</p>
<p>We started off talking about his current and upcoming book projects, and he shared how he balances his day job with his other career passions while giving a peek into his creative process. From there, he spoke about growing up in Staten Island, getting a shot to draw for Marvel Comics, and getting handpicked by Wynton Marsalis to be creative director at Jazz at Lincoln Center. We even spent some time geeking out about jazz, and he shared one of his dream projects that he&#8217;d love to accomplish one day. Keith&#8217;s journey as a creative is all about not being afraid to do what <em>you</em> want to do &#8212; very inspiring!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Hi, I&#8217;m Keith Henry Brown. And I am an illustrator, graphic designer and a writer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2022 been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
It&#8217;s hot. I could tell you that. Other than that, I stay busy. In a lot of ways, I&#8217;m juggling two different careers, a career where I am a, I guess, full-time illustrator, but then I&#8217;m also a full-time art director, graphic designer for an advertising firm. I try to find some way to do both of those. I&#8217;m also a dad. Both my kids though are men now, but you got to deal with the craziness. Just juggling. But I like being busy. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about. The minute I slow down, then I start feeling complacent.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. You mentioned being an author. I wanted to congratulate you on your book that just came out a couple of months ago, Because of You, John Lewis. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, I didn&#8217;t write that one. It&#8217;s Andrea Davis Pinkney wrote this beautiful script about a story about this young man named Tybre Faw, who was I think 11 or 12 at the time, who was obsessed with civil rights leaders, which I think is pretty extraordinary in itself, from Tennessee. And he asked his two grandmothers to drive him to meet John Lewis. He met John Lewis, came in the back door, All these reporters came up to him and said, &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;<br>
&#8220;I want to say hello to my hero.&#8221; They opened the back door. Mr. Lewis came out. Never saw the kid before in his life. The kid started crying. He held up a sign telling him about what he thought about him, which was basically saying, &#8220;You&#8217;re a hero of mine.&#8221; Lewis gave him a big hug. He later invited him to march with him on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, and then they became friends. When Mr. Lewis died, he did his eulogy at his funeral. They became friends for a short time while John Lewis was alive.<br>
So the book is about their relationship, but the book is really about how leaders inspire each other, like Martin Luther King was John Lewis&#8217; mentor; not at first, but his person that he fancied and that he was interested in and wanted to be like. And then he finally got to meet him and work with King, Mr. King, which you probably know. And then the same thing happened again with Tybre and John Lewis. So it&#8217;s sort of a succession of future and past civil rights leaders.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Sounds like a great book. I&#8217;ll definitely put a link to it in the show notes so people can check it out.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
I give most of the credit to Andrea. They found me. Scholastic Books is the publisher. And I hadn&#8217;t done anything like it yet in my career. And it was just a huge honor that they thought that I could do it. And I was intimidated because of all these amazing people that were involved. And it was a learning experience. But the book is out, and people seem to like it. We&#8217;ve gotten starred reviews from Kirkus and Library Journal. And people seem to like it. I&#8217;m excited that people know the story now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything you want to try and accomplish before the end of the year?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I have a lot of projects coming up. So I&#8217;m a job-oriented person. So in my mind, my whole life is a series of tasks that I have to achieve. And I break it down from year, and I break it down to week, and I break it down to month. And I know what I got to do the rest of this year. And there&#8217;s a lot of stuff I got to do.<br>
So it just was just announced that I&#8217;m doing a book about &#8230; there&#8217;s a story of Raymond Santana, who is one of the Central Park five, the exonerated Central Park Five, if I may add. You may know the story about these five African American young men who were wrongly accused of raping a white woman in Central Park in the &#8217;80s. They all went to jail for this crime that they did not do. They were all eventually exonerated, but they all suffered horribly. In the early 2000s, they were awarded an apology and some money from it, but the story itself is scarring. Ava DuVernay did a really beautiful film about it that I think is still on TV, on-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
On Netflix, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, on Netflix. And also, there&#8217;s a beautiful documentary by Ken Burns and his daughter about it. It&#8217;s an extraordinary and heartbreaking story about not just these specific young men&#8217;s lives, but also how Black men are treated. Matter of fact, I love the title of DuVernay&#8217;s film, which is When They See Us. If you&#8217;re a Black man living in America, you know exactly what that means. Anyway, I&#8217;m doing a graphic novel based on his memoirs. That is something I have to start working on this year.<br>
I have a book that I&#8217;ve already written and finished, and it&#8217;s coming out next May, that I wrote. This is the first book that I&#8217;ve written, so that&#8217;s why &#8230; I&#8217;ve written a lot of articles about music and things like that, but this is my first book that I&#8217;ve ever written. And that one is about &#8230; it&#8217;s called My Dad&#8217;s a DJ. It&#8217;s about my relationship with my kids. And after I divorced my ex-wife &#8230; Well, she divorced me [inaudible 00:08:55] put it, we went on and had this relationship through music. And you know how the music that I like, old school, &#8217;70s, Prince and Stevie Wonder and all that, and they liked the hip-hop cats &#8230; And then we used to have these sorts of agreements and disagreements about music. And then we finally connected. So the book is really about staying together with your kids after a divorce. And that book is coming out in May next year.<br>
So all these things are going on. I also have another book that I&#8217;m working on. I could keep going on about it. So I guess to answer your question more succinctly, I have a lot of assignments. I&#8217;m going to try to get as much of them done as I can. And I&#8217;m going to try to get some rest too, because I don&#8217;t want to lose my mind.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. I mean, it sounds like you&#8217;re working on a lot of stuff. And I want to dig more into your illustration work, but let&#8217;s talk a little bit about your day job. We don&#8217;t have to spend a whole lot of time on it, but you mentioned working at an ad agency. Can you tell me a little bit about that?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m pharmaceutical advertising designer. That means that I&#8217;m designing ads and product packaging for different brands. One of the last ones that I did that had a pretty big campaign that went on to get well known was called Taltz, which is a type of drug that helps with people who have eczema. And I first came to the agency to work on testosterone trucks, which was interesting, but then it was changed to work on this. So it&#8217;s been something I&#8217;ve been doing now for a number of years because, as I said, I have children. I was married at the time. And I was trying to make a living doing that, even though my main goal all my life was to be an illustrator and to be an artist and to draw. But then you have to do what you have to do to take care of your family.<br>
So I had a friend who was into advertising and said, &#8220;You should try this. This would be something you should do.&#8221; And I had dabbled in advertising because I had worked on some small magazines, so I taught myself things like Quark and Photoshop and a lot of Adobe Creative Suite. So I knew how to do those things. And I just figured it just takes a little creativity to lay out an advertising. And then I started out small, working for a small African American agency, when I was living in Louisville, Kentucky for a few years. And when I was there, I got a job working at Churchill Downs. And then after Churchill Downs, I decided that I was an art director and I was a graphic designer. And I decided to put aside illustration for a while, although I was still doing it on the side for myself and for small publications.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you balance your illustration projects with your day job projects? I mean, doing work for big pharma, I mean, given the current climate that we&#8217;re in, pretty stable. I mean people are always going to get sick. But how do you balance that with your outside illustration work?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
I think I&#8217;m in a fairly unique situation in that I&#8217;ve been doing it so long that I&#8217;ve reached sort of a senior position where I don&#8217;t do as much of the nuts and bolts designing as much as I do in leading teams. And so that means that I don&#8217;t have to necessarily be there in the office, be part of the day-to-day, because I&#8217;ve just been doing it, when you have a certain amount of knowledge of the business and understanding what is expected of you. I work with younger designers, so I don&#8217;t put as many man hours as maybe somebody who&#8217;s just getting into the business. And so then I just schedule and balance my hours with book projects, magazine projects, album cover projects.<br>
And also, I&#8217;m pretty fast with my illustration. I work very quickly. So if I get an assignment, I can turn it around relatively quickly so that I have time to stay with my day job, which I&#8217;ll probably stick with for a little while longer. But eventually I want to, and I&#8217;ve told my employer this, so I&#8217;m not saying anything I don&#8217;t want anyone to know, phase it out so that I can focus entirely on the illustration work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like you&#8217;ve, I guess, found a pretty happy medium, then?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, because you want to have that security. You&#8217;ve got to be able to take care of your mortgage, and all that stuff. But at the same time you have to have that happiness. One of the things I&#8217;ve learned from being around a lot of jazz musicians is they&#8217;re the happiest people I know, and they never die. They live forever. And I think it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re doing exactly what they want to do. I know jazz musicians that are pretty well-known and really talented, who struggle financially, especially when the pandemic was going on. They didn&#8217;t have anywhere to play. And there are some that are so well established, they&#8217;re okay. I don&#8217;t know, Ron Carter, the great bass player, I don&#8217;t think he worries about that. But there was a lot of young musicians who are quite brilliant, who weren&#8217;t working.<br>
I see it the same way. It&#8217;s like I have to eventually take that chance that working in the corporate world and stepping away from it so that I can do the thing that I really love, because I want to be happy. And not saying that doing design just makes me unhappy. And I&#8217;m happy this skill gave me and it got my kids through school and it bought me a house and all that stuff. But it just doesn&#8217;t fulfill me in a way that illustration does.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I think that&#8217;s fair. As a creative, I mean, the things that sort give you that inspiration may not necessarily be the job I think that you work at. But I would also say, and this is for anyone, I think, that just does other projects on the side, sometimes you have to do the thing you don&#8217;t want to do in order to do the thing that you want to do. I feel like that&#8217;s sometimes career advice that people don&#8217;t really get told a whole lot. But no, I mean it sounds like you found that balance, though.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
I totally agree with what you just said. I sometimes teach classes at schools, about art design, or I come in or do workshops or stuff like that occasionally. And a lot of kids, they go to where I went, like Parsons, or SVA, School Visual Design, or FIT. And they come out and they think, &#8220;Okay, now I&#8217;m going to be this amazing designer, and I&#8217;m going to do fashion magazines, and I&#8217;m going to do all this super slick stuff. And I&#8217;m going to design for Beyonce and I&#8217;m going to design for&#8221; &#8230; whatever it is they think they&#8217;re going to do. And they think it&#8217;s all going to be glamorous.<br>
But sometimes you got to do stuff that&#8217;s not so exciting, because there&#8217;s all kinds of design out there. There&#8217;s everything from &#8230; I started off, at one point, I was doing catalogs, which I wouldn&#8217;t wish on my worst enemy. And not to criticize anyone who&#8217;s doing it, but I found it very difficult. And certain types of design is not as glamorous, or even you find out it&#8217;s not as glamorous as you thought, which is what my experience was with doing comic books.<br>
All my young life, I always thought, &#8220;Oh my God, I want to draw Marvel comics.&#8221; I mean, that&#8217;s all I wanted to do. And I drew comics by myself in my room when I was eight years old or seven years old. And I drew comics with my friends. And I went to the school I went to, thinking I&#8217;d get to do it, and I got to do it. And when I was actually there doing it, I realized, &#8220;Wow, this is a job. This is work. I have to be adult, because I have to meet deadlines, and they have to put out a certain amount of pages, and they have to be a certain level of quality. And I have people looking over my shoulder telling me what&#8217;s good and what&#8217;s not good.&#8221; So a lot of things are like that, right? It&#8217;s like you got to put the work in, you got to put the time in. And you have to figure out, &#8220;Do I want to break through to do this thing?&#8221; I think I heard an interview you did with Ray Billingsley?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
The great cartoonist. And he was saying something similar where he was saying that he&#8217;s one of those guys who really learned his craft. I mean, we know him from his cartoon strip, his comic strip, but actually, he could draw all kinds of things. And he tried everything, and he worked on it, and then he honed it down to this project that he has now been doing for a lot of years. But it was a lot of work and thought behind it. It wasn&#8217;t something he decided one day, &#8220;I could draw pretty good. I think I&#8217;ll draw a comic strip.&#8221;<br>
I do think we all have to pay our dues, in a certain form. And my paying my dues for a long time was doing graphic design. Now having said that, I know a lot of people, that&#8217;s all they do, and they do it way better than me, and they&#8217;re beautiful. And they&#8217;re excited about it every day and they love doing design. And I still love graphic design, to a certain amount, but it doesn&#8217;t give me the same high that drawing does, because I think I started off wanting to draw, more than anything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. For folks who haven&#8217;t heard that Ray Billingsley interview, it&#8217;s episode 370. Go check it out. It&#8217;s a really good interview. When you have a new illustration project that comes in, whether that&#8217;s a book or whatever else you might be working on, what does your creative process look like? Take me into that process.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
I could talk about a book or I could talk about an album cover or I could talk about a magazine, because some of them are different lengths of time that you immerse yourself in it. But I&#8217;ll just mention the one I just did for a magazine called Rethinking Schools, which is a wonderful magazine that is for teaching teachers how to teach children. Teachers write articles in the magazine, and they explain the techniques they used that were effective, so other teachers could use it. It&#8217;s a great magazine. And they used a lot of illustration. I did a full-page illustration a couple of months ago for them. And the process was the art director came to me and said, &#8220;This is an article. I&#8217;m sending it to you. See if you want to do this, see if this is something you think you would be interested in. This is how much we pay.&#8221; And basically, the article was about how this one teacher wanted to teach children about Black Lives Matter through dance. She was a dancing teacher, and she wanted to teach choreography to these kids in a private school.<br>
And so, I came up with these drawings of the kids dancing to this sort of music that they sort of describe in the BLM article. And I just came up with sketches first. They approve them, and then you start to paint them in. And then they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Well, this figure, we like better than that figure.&#8221; And you take them out and you put them in. So my thing is I do a mixture between digital and traditional, with the accent on the traditional. I draw everything out by hand, on paper usually. And then I scan it in and either I paint on it or I use digital colors, like out of Photoshop, or something like that, or sometimes it&#8217;s a combination of both things.<br>
As we go to the final art, I do watercolor because I like the spontaneity of it and I like the fact that I can&#8217;t really control it 100%, and that it can just some suddenly do something that I didn&#8217;t expect it to do. And that could be scary because it might not be something I wanted to do, but it also means that something exciting can happen. And whenever I do something and it feels static to me or it doesn&#8217;t look interesting or it&#8217;s not moving, I always miss the watercolor element, which is the thing that makes it to me feel spontaneous and alive, which is also connected to why I like jazz so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
See, I was just about to ask, because I noticed that theme of a lot of your work being done in watercolors. But it sounds like you like to have a little bit of that unknown element in the work?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I appreciate a lot of illustrators&#8217; work where they spend a lot of time planning every single illustration out to an nth degree, and the colors, and they have palettes, and they do hundreds of preliminary drawings and sketches, and things like that. And I do do some of that. But I like the idea of, I don&#8217;t know, just kind of going with the feeling. I mean, I&#8217;ve even had times where I&#8217;ve done a book, where I didn&#8217;t even finish reading the book, the whole script or the manuscript of the book, and was doing the illustrations without even having read it all. I probably shouldn&#8217;t say that out loud, so if anyone who wants to hire me. But if I like the basic idea, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay&#8221; &#8230; Like the first book I got published was in 2019. It was called Birth of the Cool: How Miles Davis Found His Sound, which could not have been a more perfect first book for me, because I love Miles.<br>
And I just thought the idea of doing a children&#8217;s book about Miles was kind of brilliant, even though I couldn&#8217;t figure exactly how they were going to do it, because Miles was not always kid-friendly. But I read two or three pages of the script and I said, &#8220;Ah, I see what she&#8217;s doing.&#8221; So I just started doing it. And I actually read the book as I was doing the illustrations, which anyone would tell you is insane, because you should plan the whole thing out. I just read the descriptions of what the action was, and not the actual dialogue, or even all the text. But I wanted it to feel like jazz and I wanted it to feel as spontaneous as he is, and how he takes a moment. I mean, that&#8217;s why jazz is so important to see live, or live recordings are the best, in my opinion, because everybody is not actually sure of what they&#8217;re going to be doing that day in that performance. And it could be brilliant and it could be not the best thing they ever did.<br>
I&#8217;m lucky enough to be in a position where it&#8217;s just the way I do things. I don&#8217;t really know any other way of doing it. And I think that if I drew the whole thing out and knew exactly what I was going to do, it would feel too much like work. So this way, it feels like I&#8217;m just doing art. It just happens to be following a specific storyline, because I also like storytelling, which is why I wanted to get into comics in the first place. But in comics, it&#8217;s way more structured.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the most challenging part about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
I think just finishing, for me. It always seems incredibly like, &#8220;How can I ever finish this? This is huge. There&#8217;s so much to do.&#8221; And there&#8217;s that famous quote someone said, where, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like writing, but I like having written.&#8221; I do feel that way. It&#8217;s like I could see the book in my head completed, but I don&#8217;t particularly like the process, in the sense that I can&#8217;t wait for it to be done. I want to see the book in my hands. I want to see it all drawn, but I know that that means many hours of work.<br>
I just got a project recently that I&#8217;m very excited about. It hasn&#8217;t been announced officially yet, but we&#8217;ve already kind of signed everything. So it&#8217;s a book about this relationship between Malcolm X and this Japanese woman who was also an activist, and their friendship. And it&#8217;s very unusual, it&#8217;s a true story, in the fact that most people don&#8217;t know about this. Also, the fact that the famous picture of when he was shot in the ballroom, there&#8217;s a woman holding, cradling his head. It was this Japanese woman. And so the writer saw this picture and decided to find out who this woman was. And she ended up writing this kid&#8217;s book about their relationship. Some of her activism comes out of the horrible story of the internment camps during World War II, they put Japanese in after Pearl Harbor. And she started off with that kind of activism, and then she folded into other kinds of activism. And they became friends, mostly correspondence, with Malcolm X.<br>
Anyway, I&#8217;m working on this book now. We were having a story conference with the publishers the other day, with my agent. And we were talking about what the book was going to look like and what it was going to sound like, and what kind of tone. And I could see the whole book in my head in five minutes. And I was like, &#8220;I just wish I could just snap my fingers and it was done,&#8221; because I want to see the book more than I want to make it, because it really comes down to work.<br>
I think Alfred Hitchcock said once that when he came with a story like, I don&#8217;t know, Psycho, or something, or The Birds, once he had the storyboards and he had the script done, to him, that thing was done. He said all the work of having to get the actors and go on set and shoot everything was the least interesting part to him. And I really relate to that because that&#8217;s the mechanics of it. It&#8217;s the conception of it that I think is the most exciting. But I do have a lot of fun in the midst of painting, when I&#8217;m actually doing it, too. So I always say that I don&#8217;t want to do the work, but when I&#8217;m really in it, I kind of forget I&#8217;m working. So it works both ways. But I do want to see the thing done, but usually before I can finish it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m interested to see that too. Yuri Kochiyama is the activist that you&#8217;re talking about?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d be excited to see that book when it&#8217;s done.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Oh yeah, I&#8217;m going to put 1,000% in that one. I think it&#8217;s a beautiful, beautiful story. And I think it&#8217;s a story that should be told. I love the idea of people of different cultures, races coming together in a cause. I mean, I don&#8217;t want to exaggerate their relationship, it was a short one, but it was significant to Malcolm. It was significant to her, and their families. And then I think we don&#8217;t do enough of that. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever read anything like that, or any story about an Asian person and a Black person together on a common cause, in a huge sort of undertaking like human rights or activism. So I want people to see this book so bad. I want it out there. I want it in stores now. I just got to get it there. I felt the same way about Miles. I felt the same way about John Lewis. I felt the same way, My Dad&#8217;s a DJ. I want people to see it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit and learn more about you, about your origin story. You live in Brooklyn right now, but you&#8217;re originally from Staten Island, is that correct?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, it was an interesting place to grow up in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you remember growing up there?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Actually, I lived in a pretty diverse neighborhood. My best friend who lived next door to me was Jewish, and we had Filipinos living a couple of doors away, and we had Irish and Polish, and we had Latinos, Puerto Rican and Dominicans, all in the neighborhood. So the attitude, I think a lot of people think of Staten Island now, especially from recent events, that it&#8217;s like this totally red part of New York, full of Joe Plumbers, and stuff like that. But it wasn&#8217;t like that when I grew up, although there was also a really strong Sicilian community of Italians that we didn&#8217;t really connect with as much. But we had this one little thing, it was called Stapleton, Staten Island. Also, this is the same area where Wutang started their thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, that&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Their projects was probably about a quarter mile from the little neighborhood I grew up in. I grew up in a house, and my dad was a physician, my mom was a bank teller. So I guess you&#8217;d call it near middle class, because I had my own room, and I had a house, and I had everything I needed. But we weren&#8217;t rich or anything, because my dad was still a student when I was growing up, and my mom worked full time at a bank.<br>
But it was a pretty nice upbringing in terms of how I saw the world. It until I get older that I realized that there was things like severe racism and things like that. So I was able to fantasize and not worry about my place in the world as much, and dealing with things like that. So I plunged into the world of Marvel comics and fantasy books and science fiction, like Isaac Asimov, and people like that. So that was the thing that I was into when I was a kid, and also music, The Beatles. And I liked The Beatles the same way that I liked Stevie Wonder. I didn&#8217;t have any boundaries in how I saw music and art.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it sounds like you grew up around a lot of music, but you also kind of grew up around a lot of art, too?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
No, that&#8217;s the interesting thing. My mom was a singer, but she sang in the choir, and she had a beautiful voice. She even got accepted to Juilliard at one point and couldn&#8217;t go, because my grandfather couldn&#8217;t afford to send her there. So we always had a lot of records in the house, so I was always listening to music. I would read every word in the liner notes and read everything on the back 15,000 times. And I was a fanatic about LPs and music.<br>
Art really wasn&#8217;t there. I think I came by art almost completely through comic books and wanting to draw comic books of my own. And I didn&#8217;t really know anything about art history or anything like that until I got to high school. I went to a high school of art design, which was in Manhattan. And it still exists, obviously. It was a great school. I started to learn about painting and drawing. Then I got interested in things beyond comics at that point. But before that, I don&#8217;t know if anybody else in my family even drew.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think comics was probably a good gateway for a lot of people. I mean, especially if I&#8217;m thinking about the time that you grew up, and especially with starting to see more Black people in comics too, I would imagine that probably was really inspiring to see back then.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. It was huge, huge, huge. Trevor Von Eeden, who created Black Lightning, who&#8217;s a little bit about the same age as me, there&#8217;s a legendary story about how he sent his drawings to DC Comics on loose leaf paper, because he didn&#8217;t have any other kind of paper.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
And they sat down with him, and started giving him gigs. But the big one for me was a guy named Billy Graham. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re familiar with him. He did a lot of the early Black Panther comics. He basically was the writer that created Killmonger, the characters in the movies. He did these magnificent stories, one particular one called Panther&#8217;s Rage. The same story that&#8217;s basically in the movie is in that story, which is that Killmonger, the character [inaudible 00:29:45] played by Michael Jordan in the film, kind of takes him down as being prince, and challenges his leadership of Wakanda.<br>
That was a Billy Graham thing. He was one of the very few Blacks that were in the business. Brilliant guy. He was also a playwright, a painter. He was just this amazing guy. I only met him once for a few minutes, but I was in awe of him. But most of the people that I liked, if I&#8217;m being completely honest, were like Jack Kirby and Neil Adams and Stan Lee, and those guys. I mean, they were all like gods me. I mean, if I had a choice between meeting Paul Newman or Tom Cruise or Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, I probably would&#8217;ve done the latter. I mean, those were the guys who were the big heroes to me when I was a kid, that were the comic book artists.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you were inspired by comic books. You went to this art high school. And then after you graduated, you attended Parsons. What was your time like there?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
It was good, but it was less about comics. By then, I had done a little time working in comics, and decided it wasn&#8217;t for me. So I wanted to learn to paint in a different way or draw in a different way, and not be just in comics. I mean, the comic influence is there. It will be there till the day I die. And I still draw comics sometimes, or cartoons, but I don&#8217;t draw superheroes or things anymore; not that I have anything against them. But my thing when I was at Marvel and also in general about superhero stuff is that a lot of times these things are &#8230; even then, before the movies came out and became this massive thing, a billion dollar company, is that they&#8217;re all copyrighted characters owned by somebody else. So there&#8217;s not much you can do with them. You have to stay with the continuity that you&#8217;re given. You have to be explained what you can do, what you can&#8217;t do. Even you and a writer have to follow a larger storyline that maybe is being planned throughout the company.<br>
And I always had this itching feeling to want to have my own characters and have my own thing. So I wanted to learn illustration because I wanted to express myself more as an individual and less as just a sort of a cog in this massive machine. I mean, every month, on the dot, you had to have a new Marvel comic. And I think only the very, very best guys got recognition for what they did. But I don&#8217;t think I was the best at that. I was okay.<br>
So I really wanted to express myself in a different way. I still love comics, especially independent comics. I&#8217;m more interested now in people like the Hernandez Brothers, Love and Rockets. I love it. It&#8217;s probably my favorite cartoon, is Jaime Hernandez &#8230; than now, than superhero stuff, because these guys are independent. And they own their own characters and they create their own worlds that are basically coming from them. And they&#8217;re not in it for the money. They&#8217;re in it because they just had to do it. And I admire that more than being just another person drawing Spider-Man, out of the thousands that have done it over the years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So Parsons, it sounds like, opened your eyes a little bit to the reality of what the industry was like?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Precisely. Exactly. I started getting interested in modern artists. I started getting interested in abstract artists. I love Rothko. The Expressionists is my favorite type of painting, so de Gaulle&#8217;s my favorite painter. I began to appreciate art for what it is and the endless limitations that art can provide, and not these sort of commercial concerns of just trying to sell something or sell a character.<br>
Now, I don&#8217;t have anything against people who do that. There are some brilliant kids and artists doing this stuff now. I love them. I love looking at the drawings. I love looking at Greg Capullo or Jim Lee or Frank Miller, when he was doing it, and David Mazzucchelli. These were all comic book artists. These guys are freaking awesome. I just don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m built to do this stuff, myself. But I love to look at their work.<br>
There&#8217;s a guy named Bill Sienkiewicz who does comics, but he also is a great, great illustrator. And guy like him, he&#8217;s like a god to me. So all these guys are great. I just know that I can&#8217;t do comics, because it&#8217;s just not, unless I do a personal comic, like doing this graphic novel about the Central Park Five. I&#8217;m working on now one about a jazz musician. So if I can find my way in, then it&#8217;s absolutely the greatest, but if I have to just &#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I couldn&#8217;t be one of those people who&#8217;s doing, I don&#8217;t know, SpongeBob comics, or something. I got to do something that I got some kind of skin in the game.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, yeah, I mean, it sounds like you&#8217;re in it for the storytelling medium. It&#8217;s not just so much like a way of telling a story in terms of, &#8220;Oh, here&#8217;s SpongeBob. And we&#8217;re going to do it via animation.&#8221; It&#8217;s more like, &#8220;What&#8217;s the story we can tell that animation can provide sort of,&#8221; I don&#8217;t know, &#8220;that bit of oomph to it,&#8221; I guess. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly. Somebody was telling me the other day that they had a gig at some Pixar. And they said, &#8220;Dude, they&#8217;re looking for artists, illustrators to maybe come in and work with Pixar movies.&#8221;<br>
And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I mean, that sounds great in terms of financially and also prestige and stuff, but I don&#8217;t really want to get bogged down working on some massive project where a hundred other artists are working on it.&#8221; Even if it&#8217;s good, like I thought &#8230; What was that one about the jazz position that came out?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Soul.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
I thought it was real good, but I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d want to have worked on it, because it requires years of work, hundreds of people. And I&#8217;d rather work on my little book, where it&#8217;s just me alone in a room and a writer writing a script, and then five, six months later, it&#8217;s in a bookstore, and it&#8217;s got our names on it.<br>
To me, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;d rather do that, even if it means I&#8217;m making less money or not part of a huge, famous organization, that I could tell everybody, &#8220;I work at Pixar, or I work at so-and-so.&#8221; Even when I worked at Marvel, I mean, people would be impressed when I said I worked at Marvel. But I didn&#8217;t care about that part because I knew that I was doing stuff I wasn&#8217;t even really that inspired by. So it doesn&#8217;t matter that people were enamored by it. It was more about the fact that I had to still sit down by myself at some point and try to meet a deadline for something that I didn&#8217;t love. But having said that, there are people I know who do love it. And God bless them, because they do some beautiful work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you did eventually, I don&#8217;t know, I guess maybe fulfill that childhood dream. You did do some work for Marvel.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. And then I saw what it was. Everybody finds out what the reality of things is and what things really are; like a lot of people think they want to be movie stars. A lot of people think they want to be pop stars. And then they find out what it&#8217;s really like. And sometimes the stress is so much they can&#8217;t handle it at all.<br>
My son is an independent musician. He has a band, and he has albums out, and he goes on tour. And one of the things we often talk about is if it ever happens that he blows up, get ready, because it might not be what you want. And even in the little bit of brushes of stuff that he&#8217;s seen, by just opening for bigger acts and things like that and seeing how these guys live, they say a lot of it is really difficult, because once you&#8217;re famous and people know who you are, or even if you&#8217;re just known by people to be successful, it gets to be more about that than about the music, which is what you came in there to do in the first place.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I relate to that so hard, I mean, for two reasons. I mean, I think, one, from the musician standpoint. So I might have said this on the show before, but before I got into anything, design, whatever, I was a musician. I grew up playing trombone. I played it all through middle school, through high school. I played it in college. I played it a few years after college as a session musician. But I loved it. I still love music. I was a jazz trombonist. But it&#8217;s not making any money. You&#8217;re not making any real money. And the hours are wild and crazy. You have to do it because you love it. You&#8217;re certainly not doing it to get rich or to get any sort of financial stability, unless you really get a deal with a label, and then you record an EP or an LP or something, and you blow up that way.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. And I&#8217;m going to be honest, I mean in jazz, I don&#8217;t see anybody getting rich. I actually [inaudible 00:37:46]-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Not in this country. Absolutely not.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
I work for one of the most successful jazz musicians there is. And he does well. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s hurting, but he ain&#8217;t rich.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He ain&#8217;t rich, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
He ain&#8217;t no multimillionaire. I do all of his covers, and he and I are friends. But I know he&#8217;s very well known in the jazz world, but outside of the jazz world, the guy&#8217;s won like six Grammys. I mean, he&#8217;s a genius. But it doesn&#8217;t matter, because there&#8217;s a limited audience for that type of music, unless you&#8217;re somebody like Herbie Hancock who&#8217;s become a legendary figure. And not only is he legendary figure, but he&#8217;s also even done pop hits, like Rocket, and everything. So he&#8217;s a guy who&#8217;s transcended jazz in order to have the success that he has. But also, he&#8217;s a legendary iconic figure, so he&#8217;s almost beyond human. I mean, he&#8217;s like this person who&#8217;s been doing it so long and has become so famous that people just give him money just for existing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;re talking about Wynton Marsalis, right?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Well, I was actually just talking about Herbie Hancock.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, okay. But I mean, when you mentioned this artist that you&#8217;ve done covers for, though.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Oh no, that&#8217;s Christian McBride. Christian McBride. Do you know Christian McBride, Maurice?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I do. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve done his last eight covers. He&#8217;s a friend of mine. One of my best friends was his manager. Some years ago, he started a new band called Inside Straight. And instead of getting a photo shoot done, my friend, knowing that I was an illustrator, asked me to do the cover. And then he and I began a creative sort of partnership [inaudible 00:39:19] the visualization of his music.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
So a lot of his album that I&#8217;ve done covers for, also LPs, vinyl LPs, he has won Grammys for. And I never know if I&#8217;m going to get to do it next year, because that&#8217;s one of those things that I wait for him and I hear Christian&#8217;s voice say, &#8220;Hey, Brother Brown, I got another cover for you.&#8221; But I never know if he&#8217;s going to call me. But I&#8217;ve done eight so far.<br>
So people who don&#8217;t know Christian is he, he&#8217;s a bass player, composer, band leader. When Sting started his first band, Sting the pop singer from The Police, he was his bass player. Sting&#8217;s a bass player, so that tells you something about the greatness of him. But he&#8217;s also played with everybody who means anything. He&#8217;s played with every single musician there is. He&#8217;s a genius player. So I consider that to be one of the proudest things that I&#8217;ve ever done as an illustrator, is do his artwork. He also heads the Newport Jazz Festival. He has a radio show on NPR, called Jazz Tonight. He&#8217;s just an incredible human being, and one most talented people I&#8217;ve ever met.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I think it sort of speaks to sort what you said earlier about jazz not being super popular. You kind of end up having to do a lot of different things just within your musicianship in order to make that happen; like with Christian, you said he&#8217;s heading up this jazz festival and he does a radio show. You almost have to have your hand in a bunch of different pots, instead of just focusing on maybe performing or touring or something.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, if you want to make money.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Look. Yeah. Hey, that is the truth.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:40:48] And as you know, the only way to make money nowadays is no longer in recording. It&#8217;s in &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Merch.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
&#8230; merch and touring. And so, going back to what I was saying earlier, when the pandemic went down, I mean, a lot of these guys weren&#8217;t making any money. If you&#8217;re in jazz, it&#8217;s particularly painful because that&#8217;s the only way you make money, going on jazz tours to other countries, because jazz obviously is appreciated in Asia and Europe. So, that&#8217;s where they make their money. If you can&#8217;t go anywhere, then you can&#8217;t depend on the recordings. Even in the best days of jazz, they never sell anything like the way pop music does. So I mean, a flop record by Ed Sheeran still sells 100 times more than [inaudible 00:41:32]-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Than a jazz record. No, that&#8217;s the truth.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
&#8230; and that&#8217;s just the way it is. But I like being connected with someone with so much integrity. And he also gives me an incredible amount of freedom in what I get to do on his covers. That&#8217;s why it works for me, because even though I&#8217;m illustrating, in the true sense of the word, which is that I&#8217;m doing a drawing based on a previous idea and telling a story, he&#8217;s not looking over my shoulder and saying, &#8220;Do it like this.&#8221; I mean, sometimes he&#8217;ll have notes or something, but he trusts me to know what I&#8217;m doing.<br>
That&#8217;s a lot different than doing other kinds of commercial illustration, where you have to do everything precisely the way you&#8217;re being told, and if you don&#8217;t do it that way &#8230; And also, for me, in children&#8217;s books, I&#8217;ve had the same experience. I mean, I interpret the words that are in the script of the books that I do. And I may get feedback and editors talking to me about it, but we can usually discuss it. It&#8217;s not something where somebody says, &#8220;You have to do it this way, or you&#8217;re fired.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t work that way. And that&#8217;s a little different than the real world is, including in advertising.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, you just touched on so many points that just hit me just personally in terms of-</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Go for it, brother.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; musicians and design, and all that sort of stuff. I mean, yeah, yeah, wow. Wow. I want to talk about your work with Churchill Downs, your work with Jazz at Lincoln Center. I know I mentioned Marsalis earlier, but you got to work at some pretty prestigious institutions, early in your career.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, I consider myself incredibly fortunate. The reason I was in Louisville, Kentucky was because my former wife was a professor at the University of Louisville. So I showed up there with no real skills, and didn&#8217;t know what I was going to do. And I had to get a job. I got a job at a small African American-owned advertising agency. And I was still learning my craft at that point. And an African American woman named Cindy Cook, who was a supervisor at Churchill Downs, asked me if I&#8217;d be interested, because she said, &#8220;We want to start a graphics department in Churchill Downs. And there&#8217;s no Black people working there at all, doing anything, except me. I wanted to bring somebody else Black in there. And we don&#8217;t even know how to use computers or know how to do anything. So you&#8217;re going to have to order the computers and find the programs.&#8221;<br>
Basically, it was to do the marketing for the park, and the programs and the posters, and everything like that. It was challenging because I was just new to it myself. And this goes so far back, I don&#8217;t even think there was InDesign yet. I think it was Quark or something, if anybody&#8217;s old enough to remember that, listening to this. I did it. And then while I was doing it, I made friends with a gentleman named Andre Guess, who was a really good friend of mine when I was living in Louisville. And he got a job at Jazz at Lincoln Center, because Wynton would come to Louisville and do concerts. And we were such big jazz fans, after the show, Wynton Marsalis is the type of a guy, he would sit around after every concert &#8230; I don&#8217;t care if it was a four-hour concert, he would stand around and meet everybody and sign every autograph.<br>
So we&#8217;d go talk to him. And after a few years of doing that, he got to know who we were. And he would have dinner at Andre&#8217;s house, at one point. We became friends with him. He said, &#8220;Well, listen. I&#8217;m building this thing. It&#8217;s never been done before. It&#8217;s a whole venue just for jazz. It&#8217;s going to be called Jazz at Lincoln Center, and I&#8217;m going to run it.&#8221; And so he hired my friend to be an administrator. I think it was a financial officer, or something like that. And then my friend told me, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to go up there. And I&#8217;m not going to leave you behind, though. In a year, I&#8217;m going to bring you there.&#8221; Almost a year to the day, he calls me and says, &#8220;Come to New York. You&#8217;ve got to come back to New York now.&#8221; And he [inaudible 00:45:12] he wasn&#8217;t from New York. My friend was from Kentucky.<br>
So I came to New York, they interviewed me. It was a very intimidating interview because it was at a table full of the board of directors. A lot of famous people were on the board of directors, including the boxer, George Foreman, and Judith Jamison, the great dancer, Al Roker, the newsman. They&#8217;re people who contributed money and were part of the board of directors. And they interviewed me. And I was leaving out of the office, the place. And the receptionist, Mel, who&#8217;s still a friend of mine, she said, &#8220;Wynton&#8217;s on the phone.&#8221;<br>
And I was like, &#8220;Oh, shit. He&#8217;s going to tell me not to come back, because I didn&#8217;t get the job.&#8221;<br>
And handed me the phone. And he came on and he goes, &#8220;You&#8217;re a bad motherfucker.&#8221;<br>
It was like, &#8220;Really?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Wynton?&#8221;<br>
He goes, &#8220;Yeah, get your ass back here in two weeks.&#8221; So I got the job. And I worked for them for about five years. And from there is when I started doing advertising, because after a while, I felt like I did as much as I could do there. But through there, I got to meet so many incredible musicians, jazz and otherwise, because they used to have amazing musicians come there to do benefits. So people like Stevie Wonder came and Ray Charles came and Paul Simon came, and it was just an incredible, incredible experience.<br>
And they&#8217;re nonprofit. So the whole point of view of Jazz at Lincoln Center is to teach people about jazz and [inaudible 00:46:34] jazz still lives, and that it&#8217;s in existence, and you should go see it. You should appreciate it. It&#8217;s not what you think it is, and all that. So it was great. And I got to design for them, and I got to meet a lot of incredible other designers, and be part of the community of graphic designers in New York, the whole time thinking in my mind, &#8220;I really want to be an illustrator. But this is great.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, to me, that sounds like a dream job. You&#8217;re doing design, you&#8217;re surrounded by jazz. That sounds like, for me, that would be perfect.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Oh, it was, for a while. All good things come to an end; like any organization, there&#8217;s changes, and things happen, and it&#8217;s not what it was when you first started. And new people come in and they have their own ideas. I have nothing bad to say about it. It was a decision I made, as well as something that I loved. But you can&#8217;t stay any one place forever.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
And ironically, after working in advertising for a few years, I ended up going back into the music and being the art director for Blue Note Jazz Clubs.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. I was there for about four years. So Blue Note Jazz, people think of the one club in New York, but they actually have clubs all over the world, in Madrid, Milan, Japan, Hawaii. I was their art director for several years. So again, I was in this club. I was back in my jazz world. I was in heaven, because I love jazz musicians. Jazz musicians are some of the most even-keeled people, artists there are, because they don&#8217;t make any money. They don&#8217;t get rich. They&#8217;re just doing it because they love it, and they&#8217;re happy to be doing it.<br>
If you can make a living doing something you like doing it, then you&#8217;re a happy person. So they tend to be not arrogant, tend to be happy, tend to be hardworking, tend to be very committed and focused, because to be a good musician, as you know, it takes an incredible amount of concentration, rehearsal, practice and focus. And they&#8217;re always thinking of what they&#8217;re going to do next. So being around those people makes you better at what you do. So it makes you better at your art, because you see the commitment they have. I said, &#8220;Damn, I need to get serious about what I&#8217;m doing, because these motherfuckers are kicking ass, what they&#8217;re doing.&#8221; You see somebody play, you see Herbie or Chick Corea come up there, sweat their ass off and play, and they get off and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;What you going to do now?&#8221;<br>
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to go get some chicken wings.&#8221;<br>
I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Damn, man. This guy just killed himself. But now he&#8217;s done, and now he&#8217;s going to go do something else.&#8221; And I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Oh my God, these guys, I want to be like them. I want to be like them.&#8221; So that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re the constant inspiration to me. It&#8217;s like total commitment and highest level of achievement, mixed with this sort of chill, like, &#8220;Yeah. Well, we&#8217;re here doing it,&#8221; type attitude. It&#8217;s beautiful, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to people out there? They&#8217;re hearing your story, they&#8217;re hearing all this about you. What advice would you give to people that want to follow in your footsteps?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
I just think you have to be honest with what you really want to do. I mean, listen, I understand practicality. I totally know that that is. I mean, I spent a lot of my life doing jobs. I&#8217;ve had all kinds of jobs. And I&#8217;ve done whatever it took to take care of myself or my family. But there also has to be this part of you that doesn&#8217;t lose the eyes on the prize. What is it you really want to do? What is it that makes you the happiest? And it doesn&#8217;t matter what it is. If it&#8217;s riding a unicycle backwards or being the world&#8217;s best juggler, whatever, you have to focus on that eventually, because you don&#8217;t want to spend the rest of your life just doing something that you just feel like you need to do in order to make a living. And I know that&#8217;s not always everybody&#8217;s path, but you have to work towards it, I think.<br>
I would say I spent a good half of my life doing things that I had to do. And now I&#8217;m having a half of my life where I&#8217;m doing things I want to do. And I think it&#8217;s worth doing that, whatever it is, whether it&#8217;s being a doctor or being a hedge fund manager or being a fireman. It&#8217;s the passion behind it that I think is important. And you shouldn&#8217;t deny yourself of that.<br>
Both my sons and musicians. Now, any parent will tell you, you don&#8217;t want your son to be a musician, for all the reasons I&#8217;ve already stated earlier. It&#8217;s hard to make a living, and you&#8217;re never probably going to be rich. But I can&#8217;t imagine them doing anything else, because they&#8217;re so deeply committed to it. And that&#8217;s all they want to talk about. I did a book about it because it&#8217;s such a focused commitment. Even more so than me, they knew what they wanted do before I did, in terms of their lives. So I guess my advice is always do what you have to do. No one&#8217;s going to fault you for that, but don&#8217;t forget what you want to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have a dream project that you&#8217;d love to do one day? It sounds like you&#8217;ve already touched on so many of your passions with your work.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
There&#8217;s specific things. Right now, I&#8217;m trying to get out a coffee book on jazz portraits I&#8217;ve done over the years, which is tougher than you would think to get printed and published. And the other thing is, some years ago I wanted to put out a book about Eric Dolphy. And I did a lot of preliminary work. I even did a Kickstarter. I could not get the book published, I could not get it finished. And I wrote a script, and I illustrated over half of it.<br>
And Eric Dolphy is a saxophone player, composer, who I actually am totally enamored with, in terms of his life trajectory. He was just a really nice guy who was committed to his art. And he died very young, in a very sad way, actually on a gurney in Germany from a diabetic shock. And the people that were there did not realize that he had that problem. And they thought he was just a Black musician who was on drugs, and didn&#8217;t take care of them the way they should have. But his life before that, he brushed against all the great musicians, Charles Mingus and John Coltrane, he played with for a lot of years, who loved him. And I wanted to do a graphic novel about him. And I did a lot of work on it, and I did a lot of things. But it&#8217;s one of those projects that keeps getting away. It fell through a couple of times. And I am just starting to resurrect it now. And if I can get that book done, I&#8217;ll die happy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at your career, is there a particular moment or an experience that really stands out to you the most, in your mind?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Can I break it down into two?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sure.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Okay. The first one is the one I just told you about, which is Wynton Marsalis telling me I was a bad motherfucker. The second one is, and it&#8217;s almost the opposite of that, but it gave me a motivation. I went to a comic book company early on, soon out of high school. I was starting to get small jobs to do things, but I didn&#8217;t really get anything major yet. And I won&#8217;t tell you which comic book company it is, but it&#8217;s a major one. It&#8217;s one of the big two. I showed them my portfolio, and the editor, the white editor looked at it and he said, &#8220;Yeah, this is pretty good, but we already got a colored artist. We already got one, so thanks for coming in.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Damn.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
And I just said &#8230; Can I? I won&#8217;t say the word &#8230; &#8220;F this guy.&#8221; And he ain&#8217;t stopping me. And I can say, even in this world, and I&#8217;m 60 years old, and I&#8217;ve seen racism of all kinds, but I&#8217;ve never really been held back when I really wanted to do something. I&#8217;ve had all kinds of opportunities, despite my race. I just don&#8217;t accept that as a reason for not achieving anything. My father was a doctor. My mother was the first Black woman to work in this bank that she worked in. I feel like if you really want something, you cannot use that. So I guess to answer your question, it was important to me that that that guy told me what he said, because I said, &#8220;F this guy. He&#8217;s not stopping me because I&#8217;m Black.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Before we wrap this up, and I meant to get to this earlier in the interview, you love jazz, I love jazz. Who are some contemporary jazz artists that you like?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Oh, that&#8217;s an interesting question. I like a lot of cats, man. One of them just passed away, but I still consider him contemporary. That&#8217;s Roy Hargrove. He&#8217;s an awesome cat. I think Christian&#8217;s pretty contemporary. There&#8217;s a young cat that&#8217;s out now called, named Joel Ross. He&#8217;s fantastic. Kamasi Washington is pretty awesome. I mean, I&#8217;m trying to think when. You&#8217;re 60 years old, you&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;Well, who&#8217;s contemporary,&#8221; because [inaudible 00:54:50] say Brad Mehldau, but Brad Mehldau been around for a minute, so maybe he&#8217;s not so contemporary. But you know what I&#8217;m saying. It&#8217;s like I hear cats all the time, man. I want to hear it. I want to hear the young guys. Joey Alexander is kind of a phenomenal young guy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, young kid.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Really young. I mean, he could play his ass off, though. There&#8217;s a lot of them, man. I mean, there&#8217;s so many. I occasionally write for a website called allaboutjazz.com, and I do do reviews. And I just did an interview with a cat named Croker, Theo Croker.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Theo. Theo Croker, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. And we did a nice interview. I painted him many times, too. He&#8217;s real good. Oh, my favorite young singer is C√©cile McLorin. She&#8217;s a brilliant jazz singer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, she&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
She&#8217;s modern. At the same time, she got the old school thing going on too. There&#8217;s a drummer I really like named Makaya McCraven. He&#8217;s pretty hot. Man, there&#8217;s so many cats out there, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, there is. There is.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Vijay Iyer. He&#8217;s a little bit on the older side, but Vijay could play, could play, could play. Tyshawn Sorey. Yeah, I feel like I&#8217;m having a conversation with my son. We&#8217;re always talking about music. He&#8217;s a little more on the edge than me. He always knows what&#8217;s going on more than I do. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Dad, you never heard of this guy? Man, you old.&#8221;<br>
And I was like, I said, &#8220;Buddy.&#8221;<br>
He said, &#8220;He been out about two, three years.&#8221;<br>
I said, &#8220;Son, I don&#8217;t [inaudible 00:56:13] two, three years. Two, three years is still new to me.&#8221; But yeah, there&#8217;s a ton of them. Anybody you like, Maurice?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You mentioned C√©cile. I like her. There&#8217;s actually a jazz singer I first found on TikTok, who&#8217;s really great, Samara Joy. She&#8217;s a jazz vocalist.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah [inaudible 00:56:35].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh my God, her voice is so good.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
She&#8217;s incredible, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then I like-</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve seen her live.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, oh. I want to see her live. I hope she comes to Atlanta one day. I know she&#8217;s playing at Blue Note next month in New York. I&#8217;m trying to think who else. I like a lot of bands, like Incognito. There was a time in, I would say, I don&#8217;t know, maybe mid to late &#8217;90s to early 2000s where you started to see this mix of jazz with other genres. So you would have jazz and hip hop, or jazz and R&#038;B, &#8220;neo soul.&#8221;<br>
So that&#8217;s how I started to find out about &#8230; well, that&#8217;s not necessarily how I started to find out about jazz artists, because I&#8217;ve been playing jazz through &#8230; I was in a jazz band in high school, and everything. So I had always kind of known about it, but it&#8217;s just interesting diving more into learning about other artists and just sort of the &#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I feel like for a while in the &#8217;70s there was just sort of a fine line between jazz and I guess what could be considered R&#038;B, where someone like a Roy Hargrove or a Roy Ayers or someone would tow that line a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, totally. I mean, my son&#8217;s favorite musician is D&#8217;Angelo. And if you have D&#8217;Angelo, you can take your finger and bring that to Erykah Badu, and you bring that [inaudible 00:57:47] and then to Robert Glasper [inaudible 00:57:49]-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, he&#8217;s so good. Robert Glasper is so good.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
And Robert Glasper, by the way, we were talking earlier about popular success, he&#8217;s probably the most successful jazz musician, if you call him a jazz musician. I don&#8217;t even know if I&#8217;d call him that anymore, because he works with so much pop. But he&#8217;s the epitome of the kid that grew up listening to hip-hop, but loved jazz, but also has jazz chops. So there&#8217;s always that element of hip-hop with jazz. So you got Robert. He played at Blue Note a lot recently. And he&#8217;s up there on a stage with Mos Def, Yasiin Bey, rather, and cats like that. So he&#8217;s doing that. He&#8217;s bridging the gap. So I do think you&#8217;re absolutely right that there&#8217;s a bridging the gap between old school jazz, Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis, and more contemporary music, hip-hop, funk, R&#038;B, mixed in with what could be called jazz, like Kendrick Scott, Nubi Garcia, who&#8217;s an English saxophone player.<br>
There&#8217;s just so many people who, for whatever reason, they got exposed to jazz, and they appreciate the musicianship of it. But then they also connect to where they&#8217;re coming from, which is their music. My music is R&#038;B from the 1970s. Their music is that. But they like the elements of both things, and they kind of put them together into this other thing. There&#8217;s a label called Jazz Is Dead, which is run by a guy named Adrian Younge, and a guy named &#8230; I forget his name, but he was one of the original members of A Tribe Called Quest. I can&#8217;t remember [inaudible 00:59:22].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, Ali Shahid Muhammad.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Exactly. And Jazz Is Dead is a project that basically takes &#8230; they&#8217;re constantly playing with either old established jazz musicians, jazz musicians that exist now, or up-and-coming people, mixed in with their R&#038;B funk, hip-hop sensibilities. It&#8217;s a perfect mixture of all this. And to me, they represent what jazz is right now, because they look back and forward at the same time.<br>
I think the most common thing that they probably want to see is just great musicianship, being able to play. So you&#8217;re not going to hear just somebody playing off a computer or synthesizers and loops, although that might be an element. But there&#8217;s people playing live bass, there&#8217;s people playing live drums, there&#8217;s people playing a horn, a saxophone, or a trump, so that you have all these things in it. You got raw singing and you have other things. And to me, that&#8217;s where the music is right now. And I&#8217;m really excited about it, because I love all that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I had a designer on the show, I don&#8217;t know, this had to have been a couple of years ago, Aricka Lewis. She was a designer in Arkansas, and now she&#8217;s in New York. And I had her on the show and we were just talking about her work as a designer. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m a UX designer,&#8221; et cetera, et cetera. And then I ran across this group, I think it was on YouTube, and she was the lead singers. It&#8217;s this group called Calle Soul, C-A-L-L-E. And they&#8217;re, I don&#8217;t know, I guess sort of a jazz samba sort of &#8230; not samba, because samba&#8217;s fast, I would say.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Like bossa nova?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, like a jazz bossa nova sort of band. And she was the lead singer. And I was like, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me?&#8221;<br>
She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Ain&#8217;t nobody want to hear about that.&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;It&#8217;s just a thing that I do with some friends.&#8221;<br>
I was like, &#8220;That is amazing. That is amazing.&#8221; I would say &#8230; Oh God, I&#8217;m trying to &#8230; I mean, we&#8217;re going off on a tangent. We&#8217;ll wrap the interview up. But I&#8217;d say probably my favorite jazz artist now is one that I sort of found by accident. I had just come to Atlanta in &#8217;99, and I had went to &#8230; There&#8217;s a neighborhood here called Little Five Points. There&#8217;s a music shop there called Moods Music, which is still open to this day. And I remember hearing this single called Ghosts from this band out of &#8230; I think they were out of Norway, called Beady Belle, B-E-A-D-Y B-E-L-L-E. And I was like, &#8220;Oh wow, this is really good.&#8221;<br>
And Darryl, who runs the shop, was like, &#8220;Yeah, I got their CD right here if you want it.&#8221; And that started, to me, a 20-plus year love affair with this band. I have all their albums. They&#8217;ve only performed in the States once. They performed in Rochester, New York, in 2007, I think.<br>
And when I heard about it, I was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going, I&#8217;m going.&#8221;<br>
My friends were like, &#8220;What&#8217;s in Rochester, New York?&#8221;<br>
I was like, &#8220;Beady Belle is coming to the United States for the first time, and they&#8217;re playing at the Rochester Jazz Festival.&#8221;<br>
And they&#8217;re looking at me like, &#8220;Okay, go for it.&#8221; And I went and I heard them perform. I was sitting in the front row. There weren&#8217;t a lot of people there, because I guess people didn&#8217;t know the band. But I was just giddy. I got to talk to them afterwards. They signed all my albums that they had up to that date. The band has since broken up, but still the lead singer, still goes by the name Beady Belle. And she still performs and puts out work, and stuff. But that&#8217;s probably my favorite artist, my favorite jazz artist.<br>
And then that opened me up to &#8230; I&#8217;d say contemporary jazz artist, probably my favorite contemporary jazz artist. But her and that band opened me up to Norwegian jazz and Finnish jazz. And I mean, they&#8217;re all pulling from Black American roots. But it&#8217;s just so interesting how jazz in other countries is just received, as opposed to here.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
[inaudible 01:03:05] a lot of DJ elements and hip-hop elements too, and electronics, in a lot of the Norwegian jazz world. So they do a lot of interesting things there. Do you have any other bands that you really like from Norway? I just want to know if I know any.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know that she had a background singer on her fourth album named Jarle Bernhoft, who went on to become a solo artist. And sort of to that thing you&#8217;re talking about with the sort of mixing with electronic, he would do this live mixing on stage where he&#8217;d do some beat boxing or some other vocal sounds, and then mix it all together on stage while also performing, singing and playing guitar. I like a lot of his work.<br>
There&#8217;s a lot of UK jazz, like Quantic Soul Orchestra, Alice Russell. Oh God, there&#8217;s one in particular who I&#8217;ve mentioned on the show before. Zara McFarlane. Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot. There&#8217;s a lot. Now I&#8217;m getting overwhelmed, trying to think of all of them. But yeah, wow. Wow. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
As I said earlier, I think I&#8217;m going to try to make a situation for myself where I am focused mostly on illustration. I want to do more writing, I want to write more books. I like getting assignments because you get brought great stories, like the one I was talking about with Malcolm X, or John Lewis. But I also want to create more stuff on my own. I do like doing magazine stuff. I like doing newspaper stuff. I just think if I just get assignments to create art based on subjects that I&#8217;m interested in, I&#8217;d be really happy, and if I&#8217;m able to do that.<br>
And I always fantasize about not staying in one place, like traveling around the world, because when you do what I do, you can be anywhere. So you can be in Berlin, you can be in Paris, you can be in London, you can be in Mexico. And I want to start doing that. I want to do these assignments, but be in different countries, set up a studio, and just illustrate books from different parts of the world. Live somewhere for six months, live somewhere for a year, and get to see the world, which is something I&#8217;ve never really been able to do much of for most of my life. So, that&#8217;s my goal I hope to do someday.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Well, my website is keithhbrown.com. My Instagram handle is @iamtheleopard, which I&#8217;m actually on hiatus with it right now, but I&#8217;ll be getting back on in a couple of weeks. I decided to take a break from social media, just because I was doing it every single day. And I just think I got addicted, so I wanted to see if I could unaddict myself, if there&#8217;s such a word. Yeah, those two places. Instagram. And I&#8217;m also on Facebook, at Keith Henry Brown. But the easiest way is probably just go through my website.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Keith Henry Brown, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. I was so excited, putting together what I was going to talk to you about, because I was like you&#8217;ve done illustration, and it&#8217;s jazz. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;This is going to be a great conversation.&#8221; And you did not disappoint with that. I think if there&#8217;s anything people can certainly take from this conversation, it&#8217;s that you can do what you want to do, if you set your mind to it. Don&#8217;t be afraid to go out and do it. And you found a way to meld your passions together in a way that lets you live the life that you want to live, which I think is what all creatives strive for, at the end of the day. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, and if I may, I just wanted to say one more thing really quickly. Can I, Maurice?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sure. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
It ain&#8217;t about awards, it&#8217;s about doing what satisfies you. A lot of times in design and even in illustration, people are always saying, &#8220;You should put yourself up for this and get that. And you should tell everybody you won that award and this award.&#8221; It ain&#8217;t about that. It&#8217;s about what makes you happy. And you can win 10 awards and Golden whatever, but you got to satisfy you, or it&#8217;s not really going to mean anything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wise words. Again, Keith Henry Brown, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Keith Henry Brown:</b><br>
Cheers, brother.</p>

<p>With a name like Magnus Atom, I had a feeling I was going to be talking with someone extraordinary. This award-winning motion graphics designer and commercial artist has an impressive roster of clients, including Headspace, Viceland, Playboy, MTV, and Lil Uzi Vert. On top of that, <a href="https://www.oneclub.org/articles/-view/young-guns-19-magnus-atom" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">he recently received a coveted Young Guns award</a>!  Very impressive!</p>
<p>I caught up with Magnus a few months after his win, and he talked about working as an animation director with <a href="https://strangebeast.tv/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Strange Beast</a> and settling down in upstate New York after a recent stint in Miami. He also spoke about going to the &#8220;Fame&#8221; high school in NYC, how his father inspired him to be an artist, and what he&#8217;s got his sights set on for this year. With a name like Magnus Atom, I&#8217;ve got a feeling we&#8217;ll definitely hear more from him in the future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
Hey, so yeah, my name is Magnus Atom. I&#8217;m an animation director and I work globally with brands and clients to bring their brands to life with motion graphics and design, illustration, and tying that all in with animation. So&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2022 been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been interesting. I mean, it&#8217;s been as good as it could be, I guess, this year. I mean, it&#8217;s been another one. But yeah, I started off&#8230; My wife and I, we actually went down to Miami for New Year&#8217;s and I&#8217;d never been there. So that was an interesting start. I was 100% sure I was going to get COVID and then I didn&#8217;t. So I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;ve&#8230; It seems like everyone has been getting it so far, but somehow my wife and I, we&#8217;ve dodged it. So it&#8217;s been good. I mean, I&#8217;ve been busy working. I just moved to a new place. So I&#8217;m actually living in upstate New York in this town called Saratoga Springs. And so it&#8217;s definitely a departure from what I&#8217;m used to because I grew up in New York City. So this is more country, a little bit suburby, kind of small town living.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
And so I&#8217;m sort of&#8230; We just moved into an actual house [inaudible 00:03:43] renting, but it&#8217;s definitely a departure from the New York City one bedroom, 600 square-foot apartment. So now it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, we have a place with space and yard space.&#8221; So it&#8217;s been interesting adjusting to it. So yeah, it&#8217;s been really an interesting start. So living in a new place, I definitely&#8230; I don&#8217;t really know anybody, either. So it&#8217;s also acclimating to the fact that I&#8217;m far away from a lot of friends and family. So trying to start fresh, I guess, is&#8230; Yeah, 2022 has been year of starting fresh.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So being in upstate New York, is it still pretty easy to get back down into the city if you need to?</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
We picked a place that was sort of close to the city. So actually, I&#8217;ve never lived in Saratoga Springs or even really been to it. I visited it like once before we moved here. But we visited it and it was like, &#8220;Oh, this is&#8230;&#8221; It has enough stuff going that we didn&#8217;t think it would be super boring. And also it was close enough to the city that I can still visit my parents and my parents can come visit us. But it&#8217;s about two hours on a train or like two and a half hours driving.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s not too bad.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
No, it&#8217;s not bad. But in the wintertime it&#8217;s&#8230; sometimes you&#8217;re just&#8230; And especially if it&#8217;s snowing or inclement weather, it can be a little&#8230; a trek, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about the work that you&#8217;re doing now. You&#8217;re the animation director at Strange Beast. Tell me a little bit about the studio and what a typical day is like for you.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
Sure. So I&#8217;m actually an animation director at Strange Beast. So the way Strange Beast works, it&#8217;s kind of unique. I don&#8217;t see a lot of this sort of setup in the States, but it&#8217;s a little bit more popular in Europe. So the way their setup works is, they have a bunch of animation directors that they&#8217;ve sort of signed and&#8230; kind of a year-by-year basis. And so if you visit their website, each animation director has a very specific sort of style and a distinct voice, I guess, that they&#8230; It&#8217;s very specific to them. And it&#8217;s a little different than what you might find in the States where some of the big animation houses like Buck or Giant Ant or some of these other names, the animation directors don&#8217;t get as much recognition.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
It&#8217;s more of like the studio takes the credit and people go to the studio to work with that studio name. Whereas with Strange Beast and some other studios like ours in Europe, people come to Strange Beast to work with a specific director. So whether that&#8217;s Caitlin McCarthy or Anna Ginsburg, they want to work with those specific animators and they have to go through Strange Beast to work with them. And so it&#8217;s a pretty cool setup because it gives you the flexibility where&#8230; I&#8217;m not full time, by any means. And I have a lot of flexibility whether I want to take on a project that they give me.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
So just to kind of give a mock scenario of how it would work, say a client wants to make a&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, a 30-second spot for TV. And they want an animation director from Strange Beast and they don&#8217;t really know which animation director they want to go with. So maybe they&#8217;ll pick out a few different animation directors. So maybe me and a couple other people on the Strange Beast roster. And then maybe they also want to look for some animation directors from other studios as well.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
They&#8217;ll probably&#8230; They&#8217;ll pick a bunch of people. And then we&#8217;ll all sort of pitch to&#8230; We&#8217;ll pitch for the project. And that usually involves creating style frames and written treatments and sort of a pitch deck and presenting it to the team. And all this is sort of&#8230; I don&#8217;t get paid for any of that stuff. So there is sort of a pros and cons of this kind of method where it&#8217;s&#8230; In this situation, I might have to do a bit of work to create some style frames and deck building. And if I don&#8217;t win the bid, then it&#8217;s like I didn&#8217;t get paid for it. But at the same time, it can be really an interesting process.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
And so another scenario would be, they would come to Strange Beast and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, I really want to work with Magnus Atom specifically.&#8221; And maybe I&#8217;m busy because I take on other freelance work outside of Strange Beast as well. So I can tell them, &#8220;Hey, sorry, I can&#8217;t work with you right now on this project.&#8221; And so they might go to another animation director or they&#8217;ll&#8230; Maybe the stars will align, which happens less often than I would hope&#8230; But sometimes the stars will align and I&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m free and I&#8217;m ready.&#8221; And they&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Awesome. We want to work with you.&#8221; There&#8217;s no pitching. &#8220;We just want to work with you.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
And so from there, we&#8217;ll sort of&#8230; We have some producers that are full-time at Strange Beast and actually, lately, Strange Beast had a bit of a transition in terms of the heads. So actually, the woman who was running it, Kitty Turley, who&#8217;s amazing, she actually stepped aside for a little bit because she&#8217;s gone on maternity leave and there&#8217;s another producer who has come to sort of take her place. And so she sort of oversees everything at Strange Beast as like an executive producer. And then underneath her is a bunch of other producers who might be working on different projects. So they&#8217;ll be assigned to one project at a time. So yeah. So from that, we&#8217;ll sort of create a budget. They&#8217;ll tell us what the budget is and we&#8217;ll tell them, &#8220;Okay, this is what&#8217;s feasible. This is what can work.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
And we&#8217;ll talk about timelines, the yada yada, all that&#8230; the more production-level stuff. I&#8217;m personally&#8230; I don&#8217;t really have to deal that much with it, which is really nice because the producers, they get to just handle that. They get to interface with the client in terms of all the numbers and stuff. And for me, I might start off a project by trying to create style frames. So I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, what is the look of this project going to be?&#8221; So for example, I just did a piece&#8230; But one of the pieces I just did for them was for Headspace. And so they wanted to create a animation series where each animation episode was directed by a different animation director. So each animation had its own kind of unique style.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
And so obviously, there&#8217;s a constraint that you need to work within. So Headspace has brand colors. Headspace has sort of guidelines that they kind of need&#8230; You can&#8217;t do super-grotesque, raunchy, rated X stuff. This could be for children. This is going to be very calm, meditative animation. So from there, you sort of think about like, &#8220;Okay, what can we do within the parameters?&#8221; Maybe we&#8217;ll start designing some frames and start developing the look and feel. And alongside that, we might be developing the storyboards. How is that going to play out? Before we even touch anything animation, we&#8217;re just going all into the planning of getting all the style and concept down. And then once that&#8217;s approved, then we&#8217;ll move on to another layer where we&#8217;ll start working on the actual animation; the production.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
And from there&#8230; Strange Beast doesn&#8217;t have any permanent employees, really, except for the producers. But we work with a roster of freelancers, which they&#8217;re&#8230; We have freelancers that we love to work with because they&#8217;ve proven themselves. We get along. And so we&#8217;ll call up some animators and maybe we&#8217;ll need illustrators. And it&#8217;s kind of a cool process because it makes it so that each project, we&#8217;re not constrained by the resources that&#8217;s&#8230; we&#8217;re limited&#8230; Maybe a house that has in-house animators&#8230; We have to work with those animators or we have to work with those designers.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
I would have a project where maybe I need animation that&#8217;s a little bit more Disneyesque. I have animators who are very good at that sort of style and I can call on those. Or maybe I want someone who&#8217;s a little bit more free-flowing style and I have people that who would come to mind and I would want to reach out to to work on that kind of project. So it&#8217;s a very sort of organic process, each time we go into a project. But yeah, I guess that&#8217;s sort of the overall, I guess, methodology of Strange Beast.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting. It sounds almost kind of like a collective setup where people come together for the work or people may have to sort of pitch themselves for the work. Just because something comes into the studio doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the entire studio works on it.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. And like I said, there&#8217;s many animation directors, so&#8230; I haven&#8217;t even met half of them. I&#8217;ve worked with a bunch of them and everyone&#8217;s been super awesome. And even when I was working at their studio in London, there wouldn&#8217;t always be overlap. So I would have a project and then it might&#8230; another animation director would have a project and we&#8217;d&#8230; might overlap for a couple days and we&#8217;d get to talking. But for the most part, it&#8217;s sort of a project-by-project basis and Strange Beast is good at giving you the resources when you need it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. Okay. So I guess when new work does come in and, say, you put in for the project, you&#8217;ve made a little deck or you&#8217;ve made some slides or something for it and you do get the project, you win the project. What does that process look like once you&#8217;ve actually started on it?</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
Yeah. So the process once we&#8217;ve actually won the bid, it&#8217;s kind of what I was saying where you need to create the look, the style frames and the storyboards, and really just fleshing out the entire project. So Headspace, that&#8217;s an example. For that, we needed to&#8230; Well, actually, so that was an interesting, unique project because it was actually me and one other animation director, just because it was like, we had to do 20 minutes of animation in like two months&#8217; time period. And so that&#8217;s a lot of animation. And so they thought it would be better if we have two animation directors who can sort of tag team it and approach it. So yeah. So for a project like that, that was fun because I got to kind of bounce ideas back and forth.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
So I worked with this animation director, Yuval Haker, and it was an interesting project because we had to both come at it with kind of our own style. But we also had to develop a style that was very unique to the project. So I would sort of start by creating a style frame and then I would send it to him. He would take that and he would sort of make his own style frame sort of inspired by that and then he would send it to me. And it was a very back-and-forth process. We did this dozens and dozens of times before we finally came down with a style that we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, this is going to work.&#8221; And then once we come up with the style, so in that example, we were just hand-drawing everything in Photoshop using just brush tools.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
So once we were sort of comfortable with the style, we sort of then send it off to the client and the client will then have a bunch of notes and be like, &#8220;Okay, well, we don&#8217;t like the way this character looks. Can you slim them down?&#8221; Or, &#8220;Can you give them&#8230;? Take off these brands,&#8221; or whatever. Stuff like that clients are supposed to say. Then we&#8217;ll have that sort of back-and-forth process with the client. Then that&#8217;ll happen several times. From there, we start to organically build a style that both we&#8217;re comfortable with and that I&#8217;m comfortable making and animating and that the client is comfortable with. And so once we sort of create those initial style frames, and then we&#8217;ll start creating the storyboards where we&#8217;ll start saying, &#8220;Okay, this is what&#8217;s going to happen here. When the voice actor says this, we&#8217;re going to have the sun rise over the sunset and the swans are going to fly out of the reeds.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
You have to sort of build out that very minute detail of what you think is going to happen. Because as an animation director, a lot of the times, I&#8217;m not actually touching everything. So you&#8217;re sort of building out a roadmap. Yeah. You&#8217;re building out a roadmap for&#8230; Then you give it to other animators who don&#8217;t animate in that style. And they&#8217;re coming in with very little knowledge and they&#8217;re basically&#8230; You&#8217;re giving it to them and being like, &#8220;Okay, build this.&#8221; And so there has to be a lot of&#8230; very little lost in translation. So they need to be able to see the storyboards and be like, &#8220;Okay, this scene is going to have a sun and it&#8217;s going to be rising. And the rays are going to be turning like this and the reeds are going to be blowing.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
And then they&#8217;ll have that style frame that I made of that exact scene. And so they&#8217;ll know, &#8220;Okay, this is what I need to animate and this is what the final style should look like.&#8221; We go through this process where we have the storyboards laid out for the entire&#8230; whether it&#8217;s 20-minute project or 30-second project. And we then create a style frame of what it should look like for each key moment, whether it&#8217;s a different landscape or a different character. And so that whole process is&#8230; It can be very time-consuming because obviously, there&#8217;s a lot of back-and-forth. You&#8217;re basically just creating the style and the playbook for the entire animation. So from there, once you&#8217;ve finally gotten that and you&#8217;ve got it approved, the client loves it, you like it, and then you can just go straight into the animation.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
And then that&#8217;s when you start reaching out to your animators; you&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Come on board.&#8221; And designers, if you need background designers or illustrators. And then you just go on full-on production where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, these rough animators are&#8230;&#8221; And when I say &#8220;rough animators,&#8221; there&#8217;s several layers to the animation process if you&#8217;re doing this sort of illustrative style. So there would be the very rough, hand-drawn, loose animation where it&#8217;s not fully fleshed out, it&#8217;s not final line work, but it shows the movement. This is how the character is going to move. And this is the weight and this is how the waters are going to ripple. But just in terms of&#8230; Think of it like a rough sketch of a painting. Before you do the final painting, you probably want to do a bit of a rough sketch underneath. That&#8217;s what the rough animation is.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s a process. And then after you&#8217;ve gotten that down, then you&#8217;ll have another layer of animation and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll call cleanup animation. And then a lot of times, those two animators, the rough animator and the cleanup animator, won&#8217;t even be the same animator. So the rough animator has to create it in a certain&#8230; They have to create the rough animation in a certain way that any cleanup artist can come to it and be like, &#8220;Okay, all I have to do is trace over this rough animation in the final line work. Because now I&#8217;m trying to make it look final.&#8221; It&#8217;s basically&#8230; We&#8217;re just trying to get it from the rough animation to the final. And that&#8217;s actually even a longer process, surprisingly.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s kind of like building, I guess, a car. You don&#8217;t start by just building the car. You have to start by thinking it out. You have to think about the production, the budget&#8230; And then you have to think about the schematics and the layouts and the materials. And then it&#8217;s this iterative process that slowly over time, a bunch of different people with a bunch of different skills all are coming together to sort of build this final animation that has that sort of initial style frame and idea that you sort of created. Or, and when I say &#8220;you,&#8221; me as an animation director sort of created from the get-go. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That is quite a process. I think it probably helps to have a client that really is tuned into working with creatives to be able to go through all of that with so many different steps and working with so many different people.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
For sure. I mean, it&#8217;s definitely not for the impatient. And yeah. Animation, it takes work. People think&#8230; There&#8217;s a running joke in the animation industry; it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Just press the animate button and bring your character to life.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, no, it&#8217;s a process, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I want to get more into really how you learned about animation. So let&#8217;s take it back into the past a little bit. I want to learn more about sort of your origin story now. You&#8217;re from NYC originally. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
Yeah. So I actually&#8230; Well, I was born in Hawaii, but I grew up in New York City.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What was it like growing up there for you?</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
Well, so I grew up in Brooklyn. And so I lived in&#8230; When my family first moved here from Hawaii, they didn&#8217;t buy a place. We were renting. So when we first moved here, we were actually living in Park Slope. And if you know New York City, you know Park Slope is a super-expensive, super-nice, ritzy neighborhood. To hear tell, it was not like that when we moved here. I actually hear it was quite dangerous when we first moved here. So I spent my early years, like in elementary school, in that area. But as rent started increasing, my family ended up having to move from Park Slope and we ended up moving to an area called Ditmas Park around Flatbush. And I didn&#8217;t spend a lot of time actually in Flatbush, per se. I went to middle school there and I had a lot of friends there, but when I started going to high school, my high school was actually in the city.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
So I actually spent a lot of my youth just in the city, whether it&#8217;s&#8230; was Midtown where my high school was, or&#8230; I spent a lot of time in Chinatown. And it&#8217;s funny because New York City, it&#8217;s kind of a place where you kind of need money to do a lot of things. And also when you&#8217;re a kid, there&#8217;s a lot of things that New York City offers to you that you just can&#8217;t have access to because you&#8217;re under 18 or you&#8217;re under 21. So a lot of my youth was spent hanging out in parks in Chinatown, playing sports; like playing handball and&#8230; That&#8217;s where a lot of my friends hung out.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
So in terms of living in New York City, to compare it to&#8230; I guess I can&#8217;t really compare it to anything else because I only had one childhood. But I would say that it was nice having such a diversity of people. It was something you didn&#8217;t think about. I wasn&#8217;t thinking, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m the only person of color in this area.&#8221; I was surrounded by all different ethnicities, all different cultures. And so, I mean, it was funny, even at my lunch table in high school and middle school, it was like the UN. It was like&#8230; I literally&#8230; every ethnicity. It definitely gave me a lot of experiences in terms of the type of people I met. I had&#8230; I guess parents tried to take me to cultural events when they could afford it. But for the most part, it was good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I mean, New York City sort of has that reputation of being a really big melting pot. So it sounds like that definitely was what your experience was like growing up. And you mentioned high school. I don&#8217;t want to gloss over&#8230; You went to a pretty well-known high school for those who might be of a certain age, like myself; the Fame school, LaGuardia High School of Music &#038; Art and Performing Arts. What was it like going there, knowing that it had such a reputation?</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
I never took school seriously until I finally got to college. But high school&#8230; I guess, to backtrack just a little bit&#8230; My dad always wanted to train me to be an artist. So I never really pushed myself in terms of art, but my dad was always the one who was on my ass about like, &#8220;You need to do this painting, you need to&#8230;&#8221; I don&#8217;t remember if it was every night, but it was definitely several times a week it was like, &#8220;Okay, get onto your corner and do your painting.&#8221; It&#8217;s like I didn&#8217;t have a choice. It was kind of, I guess, like a typical parent would tell you, &#8220;Go and hit the books.&#8221; My dad was like, &#8220;Go and paint.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
When I was applying to high school, I think I already had an edge over the other people who applied because a lot of the other applicants, a lot of their body of work was maybe school assignments. And you can tell when something&#8217;s a school assignment or something&#8217;s done outside of school. And so I think that really helped propel me into it because I already had this sort of formal training from my dad growing up. So when I finally got into high school&#8230; You had to apply to get into it. You had to take an actual test; an art test. You had to show a portfolio to teacher and they would ask you about it. So it&#8217;s definitely&#8230; It was a lengthy process to get in. But when I actually got in, I didn&#8217;t take it all too seriously.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
So funny, my grades were actually terrible. In the first year, freshman year, I think I failed three classes and I had to do summer school for the first time. That wouldn&#8217;t be the last time. And I kind of goofed off a lot. But in terms of the people I met, it wasn&#8217;t your typical high school experience. And I think that was sort of the thing I took away from it the most was, the people I was surrounded by were musicians and other artists.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
And although maybe not every single person was passionate about art and wants to be an artist&#8230; I&#8217;ve never seen Fame, so&#8230; But [inaudible 00:26:48] I think I&#8217;ve seen clips and people are dancing on tables and singing in the hallways. There was singing in the hallways, but it wasn&#8217;t&#8230; People weren&#8217;t dancing on the tables and&#8230; But people genuinely&#8230; Talking to other people I&#8217;ve met outside of LaGuardia, in their high school experience, I&#8217;ve heard it&#8217;s very much cliques. Like you got the jocks and you got the cheerleaders and&#8230; At least this is what I&#8217;m kind of imagining other high schools to be like. Like the kids who wore Abercrombie and Fitch. And then you had the skater boys.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It was high school.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
Yeah. It was high school. But for me, there was a little bit more emphasis on being unique, I guess. It wasn&#8217;t forced. No one was telling you, &#8220;Oh, you got to be unique.&#8221; It was more like people were proud to wear clothes that they just made themselves. Whether it was good-looking clothes or not, it wasn&#8217;t&#8230; It didn&#8217;t really matter. Cool, if you had started your own little fashion T-shirt brand in school and you wore your own jeans that you had messed up with paint. So that was sort of the vibe. I guess everyone had this unique sort of voice.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
And there was definitely a lot of talent. Looking back, the amount of talent at that school&#8230; You don&#8217;t realize it when you&#8217;re in the moment. As a kid, you don&#8217;t know what to compare it to. But looking back, I went to a performance&#8230; They do these concerts that the instrumental majors and the vocal majors and the drama majors will put on. And these are not like normal high school productions. I&#8217;ve been to many Broadway shows. These are on par with Broadway productions. These, they&#8217;re good. And it goes to show, because a lot of them end up working in that field afterwards. So yeah. I mean, that was my experience. I met a lot of really cool artists. Most of my friends, if not all of them, were just artists.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
So it was cool to bounce ideas off of. And I did a little bit of graffiti when I was of that age. And my first clothing company was with some of my best friends. We just decided to create a small clothing company. And so we&#8217;d create stickers and merchandise and we would sell it to our friends and other people. And we even dabbled in making music. It was a really creative, I guess, environment to grow up in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So we were talking before recording about like, &#8220;Oh, yeah,&#8221; I said, &#8220;the Fame high school.&#8221; You&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, it was a movie.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, it was a TV show. It was a movie first, then a TV show. Then there was Fame LA and then another movie.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
Wow. I didn&#8217;t know it was such a series. I literally just thought it was a movie and I feel kind of ashamed because so many people have been like, &#8220;Oh, you went to the Fame school?&#8221; And I&#8217;ve never even seen Fame.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, you should check it out. It&#8217;s a pretty good show. And a movie. I mean, I remember the first movie, but not the second one. The second one was in 2009 or something, I think.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
Oh. Oh, well, that&#8217;s funny, because I graduated in&#8230; Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I did remember that coming out. Sure. But yeah, I graduated 2008.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;m curious to see it. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;ll actually be like the real life experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, after graduating, you went to Parsons, which is a very well-known school in New York City for fashion and for design and everything. And we&#8217;ve had a few Parsons alum on the show as well. How was your time over there?</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
Yeah. So definitely different than high school, because like I said, in high school, I completely slacked off. I barely graduated by the skin of my teeth. Yeah. Terrible grades. And I actually just got into Parsons by the skin of my teeth. But when I got into Parsons, I sort of&#8230; Well, my dad told me, he was like, &#8220;This is your last chance. If you fail, if you flunk, there&#8217;s no point in you doing this. You don&#8217;t need to be in school anymore.&#8221; And so I realized, I was like, &#8220;Oh, okay. This is like, it&#8217;s serious time.&#8221; And so I took it very seriously.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
So actually, funny enough, I guess it&#8217;s kind of serendipity, but when I was applying to Parsons, I hadn&#8217;t heard back from them for&#8230; Yeah. I sent in my application and I hadn&#8217;t heard back. And it was like, time was passing, months were passing. And I was like, &#8220;Ah, I wonder whatever happened.&#8221; And the girl I was dating at the time was like, &#8220;You really need to check on them and see what&#8217;s going on.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
So I went down to the office. I was like, &#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s going on?&#8221; And they were like, &#8220;Oh, so you actually got accepted, but they didn&#8217;t send out some sort of letter,&#8221; or maybe I didn&#8217;t get it. And so by the time I went down there, all the applications for the basic&#8230; I forget what the term is for most art majors that go into Parsons, but&#8230; That was all filled up. And they were like, &#8220;We feel really bad and you did get in and we have this experimentative&#8230; a new program that we&#8217;re creating called Design and Technology that we still have some spots open for. And if you want to go in through that, it&#8217;s a different curriculum.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
And so rather than going in through the traditional route where you have to go through graphic design and you have to learn all these very fundamental principles and&#8230; It was more of a DIY sort of route, where you get to kind of&#8230; It&#8217;s kind of like a Choose Your Own Adventure. And the whole idea is, it kind of merged a whole bunch of different, I guess, topics. So you had coding, coding within art, and then you had web design and then you had more experimentative&#8230; It was anything that you could think of where it&#8217;s design, but also plus technology. So you even had some sound designers in that mix. And so I went into that not knowing what I wanted to do at all.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
I thought maybe I was going to do graphic design. I knew I had to pick something at some point and time was ticking. And so when I went in, I was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll try graphic design.&#8221; And that was not for me. I was like, &#8220;This is not my thing.&#8221; And then I did like&#8230; I really loved illustration and that was something I always did passionately on the side. But it wasn&#8217;t a choice, in terms of what I can do. They didn&#8217;t offer&#8230; If I wanted to be illustration, I would&#8217;ve had to completely do a whole new curriculum. And I would&#8217;ve had to start over or something. So I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not an option.&#8221; And then there was web design. I was like, &#8220;Okay, maybe I want to be a web designer.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
And I think I got into it because I had some illustration stuff and I wanted to put it on a website. And this was before Squarespace and all those kind of templated websites where you could just upload your images. Kind of still had to know some coding. There was a WordPress, but I never really liked the whole WordPress thing. So I thought maybe I would do some web design and&#8230; I even took an internship in web design and realized&#8230; I got pretty far. I learned&#8230; I knew HTML, CSS, a little bit of JavaScript. I realized it wasn&#8217;t for me, either. Staring at lines of code for like 12 hours a day was just like, &#8220;Okay, this is not my thing. I&#8217;m going to burn out doing this.&#8221; And then the second year of Parsons, I had a good friend who&#8230; He had a little bit of animation experience that he just did from high school.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
I think he was kind of a go-getter; he just tried interesting stuff, tried new stuff. And so he already came in knowing a bit of animation. And so he was a close friend of mine. And I saw what he was doing and I was like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s&#8230; kind of looks fun. That looks interesting.&#8221; And so he convinced me to take the Motion Graphics 1 class. And so I was like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; It was just learning After Effects; basic After Effects. How to make shapes move and text move on screen; simple learning how to use the program. I took the class and I immediately was like, &#8220;This is pretty cool.&#8221; Because I liked illustration already, but it was the first time where I can take my illustration and have it come to life.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
And I took it very seriously too. A lot of people I knew&#8230; So I was&#8230; I lived in New York City, so&#8230; And I couldn&#8217;t afford to live in the dorms, so I lived at home. And so a lot of people I knew, they were living at the dorm life and they were partying a lot and&#8230; I was very jealous of like, &#8220;Oh, man, you get to live with three roommates and 200 square feet? Oh, man, I&#8217;m so jealous.&#8221; I really was. But I didn&#8217;t have any of that. And so I spent a lot of my time just working on my school projects.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
And so I think putting a lot of that work in early, I already saw&#8230; The amount of work I put into it, people were noticing it. I think the first time I was doing artwork or something that was kind of unique to myself. And people were like, &#8220;Oh, this is really good.&#8221; Before, people would be like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, I like this illustration,&#8221; or &#8220;I like that painting.&#8221; I was doing those kind of because I had to, almost. This was the first time I was like, &#8220;I want to do this.&#8221; And then people were telling me that they think it&#8217;s really good. And then also I was in these animation classes and it was already better than a lot of the other animators who were in that class.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
So there I think it created sort of a feedback loop of: People are saying you&#8217;re good at this. And I&#8217;m enjoying it so I feel kind of proud. So I feel like I have to do it even more. It ended up just becoming a thing where I&#8217;m&#8230; I ended up taking a whole bunch of animation classes and I wanted to learn everything about animation. I started off just learning After Effects, but then I was like, &#8220;Oh, I want to learn how to do stop motion. I want to learn how to do CGI; 3D animation.&#8221; And then within 3D animation, I was like, &#8220;Okay, I want to learn how to do dynamics. I want to learn how to do lighting and modeling and character rigging.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Oh&#8230;&#8221; I discovered cel animation for the first time, where you can actually just draw on a screen, rather than having to draw it on paper and then scan it in, and move it around in After Effects like moving images; it was like, &#8220;Oh, you can bring things to life Disney-style.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
I was just fascinated by every different aspect of animation. And not only that, how can you combine all of these different things? So how can I mix CG and cel animation? Or how can I mix stop motion and cel? Or&#8230; And I even went so far as to take sound design classes because I was like, &#8220;I want to make the sound and music to my own animation.&#8221; So I was sort of just gathering all these skills, just because it was really fun to do. And I was like, this is&#8230; Seems appropriate. I wasn&#8217;t thinking&#8230; I was thinking I want to make a career of this, but it was more of like, &#8220;I&#8217;m doing this because I&#8217;m just super-fascinated by all of these different aspects.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
Yeah. I think learning all those different things really helped me. And so I think by sophomore year, I definitely knew what I wanted to do. And by junior year, I actually&#8230; I felt like I was just ready to hit the workforce. I actually had a lot of teachers who were really helpful in terms of my early getting off the ground. So one of the classes I had, it was an intermediate animation class, learning concepts. And so one of the projects was for creating a mock commercial for a product or for a brand. And at the time, I was super into the whole vinyl toy scene; Kidrobot and even like BAPE and all that stuff was super popular.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
And so I really loved Kidrobot so I was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m just going to make an animation about one of their toys,&#8221; which was that iconic money&#8230; If you don&#8217;t know it, it&#8217;s&#8230; kind of looks like a white monkey that you can draw on; customize. So I made this animation, it was like a 15- or 30-second animation. It actually ended up&#8230; The teacher brought in some professional, I guess, people she knew from her professional circle to actually critique us in the finals. And so a lot of them&#8230; Some of the critiquers came in and they saw it and they were like, &#8220;Oh, this is really&#8230; You made this by yourself? This is definitely top-level&#8230; At least almost studio-level stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
And went so far where I sent it to Kidrobot and I was like, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. I might not hear anything.&#8221; I think it was a couple days later, one of the directors of operations, they reached out to me. They were like, &#8220;Hey, this is awesome. Can you do something like this just for us for this other product that was coming out?&#8221; And so that was sort of my first step into a client project that I had gotten just by myself; no one else. So Parsons, I think, set me up in a way where it&#8217;s like, I met a lot of really interesting people, a lot of other interesting animators who also wanted to do what I did. Yeah, it was kind of like LaGuardia where it was a very creative atmosphere that was fostering my creativity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And of course, now, you&#8217;re well-known animation director with Strange Beast. So clearly, even just getting that spark from doing the work at Parsons and learning about it has propelled you to where you are right now. The way that actually I had heard about you was because you won an award back in 2019 from The One Club. You won the Young Guns award, which is usually given to young designers. I think they do it every year. They have a Young Guns 17, Young Guns 18, et cetera. Where were you when you got news about your win?</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, just really quickly, I actually won it this last year. But it was called Young Guns 19. I was actually sitting in the same spot I am sitting in right now. I was just at home when I read the email that I won. Actually, when I read that I was the finalist, I didn&#8217;t even know that I was a finalist. My executive producer at Strange Beast just texted me and she was just like, &#8220;Hey, congratulations on being a Young Guns finalist.&#8221; And I had&#8230; I didn&#8217;t even know I was a finalist and I was like, &#8220;What? Awesome.&#8221; Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And have things kind of changed for you since you won the award?</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
Not really. I mean, yes and no. I&#8217;ve had a lot of people reaching out to me to try to pin me down for a full-time job. Actually, funny enough, this one company I&#8217;ve always wanted to work for&#8230; When I was starting off in my career, I always wanted to work for this animation studio. And I reached out to them early on and they never even got back to me. And it was always a dream to work for them. And then after I won, they reached out to me and they were like, &#8220;Hey, do you want a full-time job?&#8221; And actually, I turned them down because I&#8217;m enjoying freelancing and doing the whole thing with Strange Beast so much. So it&#8217;s funny how life works like that, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. I&#8217;m curious about that because we&#8217;ve had other award-winning designers on the show and I&#8217;m always curious to know if things really change once you get the award. Does it open you up to bigger and better jobs? Does that mean you get more press? Do you get representation? I&#8217;m just always curious about that because I feel like it&#8217;s still kind of 50/50. Sometimes it&#8217;s good, sometimes it&#8217;s not. Sometimes the award can be kind of the thing that&#8230; Not hold you back, but it can end up being a bit of a curse, in a way.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s interesting that you say that. After I won the award, I felt like all of a sudden, now there&#8217;s like a spotlight on me. I feel like I can&#8217;t really mess up, you know what I mean? Because it&#8217;s&#8230; A bunch of people now know my name in the industry. I&#8217;m not just, I guess, a nobody at this point. But at the same time, it was very liberating because it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve always wanted, was the Young Guns. Ever since I was in college, I wanted to win this Young Guns award. And it was definitely like it was a dream come true for my twenties. So when I won, it was sort of liberating because all of a sudden, I didn&#8217;t have to think of, like, &#8220;Okay, I need to do this animation because I have to&#8230; It has to fit into my body of work so that I can win this award; the Young Guns award.&#8221; Now I&#8217;m kind of like, &#8220;Oh, I can do whatever I want.&#8221; If I want to do something different, I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m constrained to doing just animation anymore.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That makes sense. The award kind of&#8230; It&#8217;s the validation. And so from there, you can springboard to other things because the work that you&#8217;ve won that award for, you don&#8217;t really have to prove yourself. You&#8217;ve gotten an award for it. People have judged your work and said that it&#8217;s good to this caliber; to this standard. So it kind of does give you freedom to do other things in that way.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. That&#8217;s it, definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And now, speaking of other things that you&#8217;re doing, aside from Strange Beast, you have a fashion and art brand that you created called Yugen Goon. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
Yes. That was a fun side project I actually created with my wife. Actually, I started concepting it many years back because&#8230; I work as a commercial artist. So this work that I put on my site and the stuff that I do professionally is definitely of a certain, I guess, content. It&#8217;s commercially viable. I always had this outlet of stuff I like to do outside of that. I like to paint. I like to do&#8230; I love doing pastel still to this day. I grew up my dad making me do pastels and I still love to do it. And I have all these fascinations with all this other stuff, whether it&#8217;s spiritualistic or tribal or different content from religious or spiritual stuff from around the world that&#8230; It probably is not going to make it into my commercial for Nike.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s like, I kind of wanted to create this separate thing where I was like, &#8220;Okay, this is going to be just me.&#8221; That&#8230; I don&#8217;t really have to answer to anybody. Actually, funny enough, I created it because I wanted to sort of just create a side hustle. Because I was like, &#8220;I want to make a bit of money on the side, just as a revenue source.&#8221; And it ended up being&#8230; I couldn&#8217;t just do something for the money. It ended up being like, &#8220;Okay, if I&#8217;m going to make something, I got to make it cool.&#8221; So I ended up spending a long time on it, way longer than I should&#8217;ve; years creating just the idea for&#8230; I guess I&#8217;m such a perfectionist, but&#8230; Actually, my wife helped propel me to really finalize it because if it wasn&#8217;t for her, I would just have just been aimlessly just creating designs and not even putting it out.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
And she was like, &#8220;Okay, just&#8230; You got to put it out.&#8221; It was a nice departure from my usual animation stuff, because I got to take the artwork that I was creating on the side and then kind of play around with some graphic design and illustration that I get to experiment and kind of have fun and do stuff that I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, this might not be right, but it&#8217;s like, this is&#8230; I think it&#8217;s cool. And if I think it&#8217;s cool, maybe other people will think it&#8217;s cool.&#8221; The whole idea with Yugen Goon was, I wanted to create this brand that was sort of a world in its own. So I wanted have these different characters and all these different storylines and hopefully one day I&#8217;ll create an animation that ties in and kind of tells the story a little bit better.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
But I made up all these different gods that are depicted on the clothing. And even within the clothing, if on the inside label, there&#8217;s&#8230; unique poem on each&#8230; So you know where the tag would be on the inside of the&#8230; that apparel tag? Instead of having a tag, I have a poem. And it&#8217;s just kind of there just for the people who buy it. It&#8217;s not there to show off. It&#8217;s not there for anybody else other than the people who know it; know it&#8217;s there. So I kind of like this idea of creating this world where it&#8217;s just&#8230; It&#8217;s sort of like storytelling and it&#8217;s sort of constantly evolving. It draws on a lot of, really, stuff that I&#8217;m fascinated by, whether it&#8217;s cultural&#8230; tribal masks, African masks, or Japanese masks or things like holy scripts from like the I Ching. Stuff like that just fascinates me. So that&#8217;s kind of Yugen Goon in a nutshell.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I was going to ask about what the significance with the masks might be.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
I haven&#8217;t even figured it out myself, honestly. Maybe if I ever have a therapist, it&#8217;ll come out and I&#8217;ll figure out why I&#8217;m so fascinated by masks. But I don&#8217;t know. I love the mask designs, whether&#8230; Of all cultures. Yeah. Japanese, Tibetan, Chinese, African, different African tribes&#8230; I think it&#8217;s kind of what they represent. And when you look into why they exist, they all kind of have their own unique meaning, but there&#8217;s kind of this connection that you see between all these different cultures that were separated by oceans. I don&#8217;t know. There&#8217;s just something beautiful, I think, to masks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. When you look back at your body of work, is there any one project that really stands out to you the most?</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
When I was working at Vice, I created this one piece called Bone Dance. I think it&#8217;s 15-, 30-second long animation. It was for Vice&#8217;s&#8230; They did a weed week where for a week, they would just air weed-inspired content. And they tasked us&#8230; They were like, &#8220;You can create anything you want, if it&#8217;s for weed week, and we&#8217;ll put it on TV.&#8221; Which is a cool brief. I don&#8217;t have that anymore. And at the time, even I knew, I was like, &#8220;This is cool.&#8221; But looking back, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wow, that was&#8230; You can create anything you want and they&#8217;ll put it on TV.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
For that project, I was like, I came up with this concept of having these&#8230; Without going too deep into it, I wanted to create this thing that was a little bit trippy, but sort of high thought, kind of would make people think, because it would be playing late at night, hopefully while people are smoking weed and they&#8217;ll see it and be like, &#8220;Oh, that was different.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t want to just create regular weed bong stuff. So that was probably my favorite project because it was sort of&#8230; I had the most carte blanche. Still to this day, I look back and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, this is&#8230;&#8221; People see it and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, this is still super cool.&#8221; So yeah, I think that&#8217;s probably my favorite piece I&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you had any mentors or anyone that have really kind of helped you out throughout your career? And before you answer that, I feel like your dad may be one of them, in case you&#8217;re not going to mention him. Because you&#8217;ve mentioned him just in passing about how he&#8217;s really pushed you, especially early on, to be more artistic in this way.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, that was&#8230; Yeah. I mean, you got it. It&#8217;s definitely my dad. I&#8217;ve always had teachers who are&#8230; They&#8217;re really helpful, but they haven&#8217;t stuck with me for the long haul, you know what I mean? After&#8230; I might keep in contact with some of my teachers after school, but not as much. So my dad has always been there. So I&#8217;ve always been able to tell him about what I&#8217;m doing and&#8230; He&#8217;s an artist himself. So I can&#8230; He gets it. He is&#8230; I don&#8217;t have to explain&#8230; He doesn&#8217;t have to be like, &#8220;Oh, so what is this animation thing?&#8221; It&#8217;s like, he&#8217;s always been super-supportive and pushing me to do that. So yeah. It&#8217;s definitely my dad.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. What do you really appreciate most about your life right now?</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
The thing I appreciate the most&#8230; Probably the fact that I&#8217;m safe and I&#8217;m healthy and everyone I know is healthy. I know&#8230; I have friends who have lost loved ones to COVID and it&#8217;s been really hard for the last several years for a lot of people. And so I&#8217;ve been super-fortunate that everyone I know is healthy and&#8230; Yeah. I guess that&#8217;s it, really. I mean&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? I mean, it sounds like so far, your career has really progressed to a fantastic point. I mean, you&#8217;ve had this strong upbringing, this dad that really pushed you, now you&#8217;re doing this work at Strange Beast. What else do you see yourself doing in the future?</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting thinking about it, because even if I look back at the last decade, I would never have imagined I would get to where I am here. Because my goals when I was younger is completely different now. Where I will be in ten years or five years, I have no idea. But the stuff that I&#8217;m super-passionate about now is not as&#8230; It&#8217;s not the same stuff that I was passionate about when I was in art school.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
So I think a lot of the stuff that&#8217;s really&#8230; still inspires me is working on my clothing company or if it&#8217;s&#8230; I&#8217;m really into this upstate living of repurposing&#8230; antiquing furniture and making it brand new, which is something I never thought I would be into. So yeah. It&#8217;s like, I still want to do&#8230; I still love animation; that&#8217;s still my path, I think. And in terms of where I see that going, I want to keep creating stuff that&#8217;s sort of in my style and keep it evolving. Keep doing work that I am passionate about that pays the bills. But on the side of that, I have other passions that is completely outside of animation now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
Sure. So you can visit my website. It&#8217;s just magnusatom.com. Or you can find me on Instagram, @magnus.atom. And if you want to see other Strange Beast artists as well as my stuff, you can just go to Strange Beast&#8217;s website, which is strangebeast.tv.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Magnus Atom, I want to thank you so much, really, for coming on the show. I think if there&#8217;s one thing that people really get from this, aside from just your incredible story, is that getting to where you&#8217;ve gotten has taken a lot of work. And that&#8217;s not to say that the road should always be easy as a creative, but what it sounds like to me is that you&#8217;ve really put in the work over the years and now you&#8217;re sort of at the point where you&#8217;re able to really kind of reap those rewards, which sounds, of course, really good to hear. I really am interested to see kind of what you do in the future. I mean, a lot of your work is already out there. I didn&#8217;t mention this, but there&#8217;s a Lil Uzi Vert video that you did also. So you&#8217;ve managed to amass a huge body of work, and I&#8217;m really excited to see what you do next. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Magnus Atom:</b><br>
Well, thanks so much for having me, Maurice.</p>

<p>2021 has been quite a year for us all, including this week&#8217;s guest Alanna Flowers. This year, she became a full-time creative and launched her own business, <a href="https://www.agfdesignstudio.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">AGF Design Studio</a>, and I had the chance to talk to her in the midst of her very busy holiday schedule.</p>
<p>Alanna gave me the rundown behind why she started her studio, how she plans to expand her services next year, and also gave some insight into her creative process. She also talked about growing up in NYC, the pros of art licensing, and how she builds her brand through social media. </p>
<p>Thank you all for listening to Revision Path this year &#8212; onward to 2022!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So, tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Hi, my name&#8217;s Alanna Flowers. I&#8217;m a lettering artist and illustrator, based in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has the year been for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Wow. This year has been unlike any other that I&#8217;ve had. Professionally and creatively it&#8217;s been really refreshing and really a big learning experience, I would say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In what ways?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Well, I&#8217;m a new freelancer. I started freelancing January 1st of this year, so-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
I just jumped in feet first and, yeah. I&#8217;ve had so many rewarding experiences and I think, because I&#8217;m still so new, I&#8217;ve learned a lot along the way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, congratulations on striking out on your own like that.</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If you don&#8217;t mind me asking, what was the catalyst behind you deciding to do that?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
I mean, everyone knows how things have been for the state of the world. So, the pandemic hits last year, and at that time I was a full-time in-house graphic designer/graphic design manager. I was reporting to work every day, working in downtown Manhattan. New York City&#8217;s a hotbed, but I reported to work. So, that was a challenge for me definitely. Then I guess as the whole year went on, I was really evaluating. I&#8217;m like, how can I start doing what I&#8217;m actually really passionate about? Because at that point I had already thought about maybe I want to strike out, even do something different, even if it wasn&#8217;t necessarily freelancing on my own. I knew that I just wanted something different. So, the pandemic was a humongous catalyst for reevaluating on all levels. So, yeah. I decided, I think midway through 2020, I&#8217;m just like, all right. I&#8217;m going to start saving this money that I&#8217;m making, and try to figure out something on my own.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you did, and you struck out on your own.</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Since this is coming up at the end of the year, do you have any early plans or resolutions for 2022?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Yeah. Geez. I&#8217;ve been thinking really hard about next year actually, because now I have something to base things on, because everything was very, well, we&#8217;ll see how this goes. So, now I actually have quantifiable metrics to base things off of. So, I have big goals for next year. I want to expand my services definitely, and just continue working with great brands and clients.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, let&#8217;s talk more about your studio, which is called AGF Design Studio. You started at the beginning of this year, how has business been, just establishing yourself?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s been really great. I&#8217;ve been very fortunate honestly, to have worked with all of the brands and people that I&#8217;ve gotten to work with this year. I&#8217;ve gotten to work with Adobe. My first client was American Greetings.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
It&#8217;s like, how does that happen? I&#8217;ve had a very fortunate year and experience going out on my own. I think if we can keep that momentum, and it seems that we are so far, going into next year, I think that would be great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Those are two big names just right off the bat for your first year.</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, what is the process like when you&#8217;re&#8230; Say you have a new project come in, or there&#8217;s a new design that you&#8217;re working on or something like, what does your creative process look like when you&#8217;re starting something new?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a really great question. It really definitely depends on what the client&#8217;s needs are, and they give you a creative brief and you review it, and I start thinking about what exactly is it that they&#8217;re asking me to letter? Because as a lettering artist, I&#8217;m usually illustrating some sort of quote or phrase, so I start thinking about stylistic treatments. Sometimes the origin of the quote is historical, so maybe it&#8217;s from an actual figure, so I do a little bit of research on that person. From there, I just follow the steps of my process, which are basically establishing some kind of hierarchy for the piece, so that it communicates in the best way possible to the intended audience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It seems pretty straightforward then.</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s not too complicated. I think where things start getting complicated is maybe how long the phrase is, and the composition, creating for social media. I&#8217;m usually given some sort of dimensions and constraints, so my compositional approach for something that&#8217;s supposed to be a square will be completely different than something that&#8217;s supposed to be a poster, for example. So, it just depends from project to project, I think.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are you currently working on any projects that you can talk about right now?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good question. I can vaguely describe it, I guess. Yeah. I actually just started a project that I&#8217;m really excited about, and it&#8217;s actually going to allow me to incorporate lettering and a little bit of animation actually. It&#8217;s a marriage of my interest in filming and video and editing, with lettering and animation. I&#8217;m pretty excited about this one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds pretty cool. Wow. So, you mentioned Adobe, you mentioned American Greetings. These are both very visually strong companies. American greetings with greeting cards, Adobe of course, with everything they do with the Adobe Suite and stuff. Are there specific types of clients that you&#8217;ve found that you work best with?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve been fortunate to work with Adobe for a few projects this year, each one was so different. I think what I&#8217;ve seen from the clients that I&#8217;ve gotten to work with is, it&#8217;s always best when the vision is as clear as possible, I guess. And when we can just establish that we&#8217;re on the same page as much as possible. Things pretty much sail smoothly from there, as long as you can have a nice, clear line of communication with the client, I find that those project go over the smoothest and the best, from beginning to end.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, even with those types of clients, I&#8217;ve got to imagine you&#8217;ve probably had a bunch of different people just try to hit you up. And with it being your first year, I&#8217;m probably guessing there&#8217;s been some clients that you&#8217;re like, &#8220;You know what? I don&#8217;t know if this is the best one,&#8221; because sometimes in your first year of business, you want to take on everything, or you try to take on as much as you can because it&#8217;s your first year and you want to try to do all the things. But have you found the flip side to that?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ve definitely had some interesting things come my way, and it would just meet me right in the middle of me working on something. And I&#8217;m just like, I could say yes and rush through this and it not be that great. Or I could just politely decline at the moment. It&#8217;s great they found me, they have my contact information and I have that contact from them, so those doors could more easily be reopened. Just like, &#8220;Hey. I was busy then, but my schedule&#8217;s open now.&#8221; But, yes. There&#8217;s definitely been a lot of temptation to say yes to everything, but thankfully, so far so good, and timing seems to have been on my side for most of the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I was going to say, it sounds like it&#8217;s more of a timing thing than the actual work itself. I guess that&#8217;s pretty good. It&#8217;s good to know.</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s switch gears here because I really want to learn more about you and how you really came into all of this. Tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Yeah. I grew up in White Plains, New York, suburban kid all the way. Even though I&#8217;ve been Brooklyn now and I&#8217;ve been here for a few years, I definitely was not a city dweller all my life. So, yeah. I grew up in White Plains and that&#8217;s the only place I&#8217;ve known.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Were you exposed to a lot of design and art and stuff like that growing up?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Yeah. I would definitely say, that as a kid, I was always very enthusiastic about the opportunities during class to color and do arts and crafts, and art class and stuff like that. And then, just from, I guess, a personal side, I always enjoyed musical theater, and my family would be able to go to Broadway shows every now and again for the holidays or something. So, just being exposed to even different forms of art, even if it&#8217;s not visual or digital art, just being exposed to all different kinds of artistic expressions was definitely a thread throughout my upbringing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now you went to the New York Institute of Technology, in Old Westbury. Can you tell me what your time was like there?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Yeah. My time there was so great. It was so interesting because I went there and I applied there even, on the recommendation of my old high school art teacher, Dr. A. So, he was an alumni of there, so he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, apply there,&#8221; because that&#8217;s where he went. The art program there was very small because NYIT is actually more of an engineering school. So, the art program felt very intimate. Everyone who had some sort of art major, whether you were graphic design or motion design, or what have you, everyone knew each other. So, it felt like a very close knit little family and community, and I really enjoyed my time there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you feel like they really helped prepare you to go out there in the world and work as a designer?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
In some respects, yes. Where you&#8217;re thinking about working for a company, or an agency, or working in-house. Yes, thinking about, okay. I could have a job after this in a creative field, but not necessarily in the thread of a, this is how it looks if you want to work for yourself idea. So, definitely preparation was there, but definitely in the traditional sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I haven&#8217;t found that there have been a lot of schools, maybe some of the art institutes, only because I know that they do take a lot of input in from people in the community, basically just about what they should be teaching. But, yeah. There&#8217;s not a lot of design focused schools I&#8217;ve seen that give you the tools for entrepreneurship. It is about pushing you into that&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say pipeline, but pushing you into that realm of, are you going work for an agency? Or you could work for a design focused tech company, or something like that. It&#8217;s not really about, how can I take these tools and strike out on my own because a lot of that is&#8230; I mean, yes. It&#8217;s your technical skill, but there&#8217;s also just so much business stuff that you need to know to run your own business and deal with contracts, and all that sort of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Yeah. Absolutely. Any kind of inkling of what it was like to be a freelancer came from the one off, maybe you have a semester with an adjunct professor who happens to also be a freelancer on the side, or something like that. I mean, they might show us some of their client work as examples and stuff like that. But definitely not completely focused, like you said, where it&#8217;s dedicated to teaching you the ins and outs of the business aspect that goes into freelancing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Why do you think that is?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a great question. I feel like there&#8217;s more attention on the creator economy, and maybe it&#8217;s because now I&#8217;m in it directly, but I don&#8217;t recall it being talked about as much, even amongst me and my peers. The power that social media could have in transforming someone&#8217;s creative career in that trajectory, and being able to go off on your own. So, there might have just been an unknowing of the potential of these platforms. When I was going to school, Instagram was king, but now there&#8217;s so many competitors and so many different avenues that you can take. I don&#8217;t know. I think, as more people do it, the more shine it&#8217;ll get, and more people will talk about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What were those early years like after you graduated?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
It&#8217;s pretty interesting actually. When I first graduated, I was very bright-eyed and was super excited to just jump into my field, but I actually had an opportunity fall through, that I wanted to take to be a designer. I was down on my luck a little bit, and I told my friend, I was like, &#8220;I just need income please,&#8221; anything. I ended up actually taking a job as a receptionist for a year right out of college, before I was able to secure my first graphic design job.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
A receptionist, huh?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative) I gave myself one year because I was just like&#8230; And I was a great receptionist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
I was very efficient and they&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Yeah. You&#8217;re great.&#8221; And I&#8217;m just like, and with all this stuff comes complacency and comfort, and you know this was just a very temporary thing so you need to move on. So, I had my exit strategy, and after that experience, I was able to get an associate design job in-house.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, that&#8217;s something good to know, that you had a plan to get out of it, because sometimes you fall into those gigs where you&#8217;re doing the work as you have to do it, it keeps a roof over your head, it keeps food on the table, but it&#8217;s not fulfilling. It&#8217;s not what you really want to do. So, at least you had a plan to get out of that, and eventually start somewhere and really work on your design career.</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s very interesting thinking about it now, but it&#8217;s just like, well, it&#8217;s part of my story. It is what it is. It&#8217;s not always red roses, but I&#8217;m grateful for the way things happened anyhow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I noticed that you&#8217;ve been doing a lot with social media. You can go to your website and really tell that you&#8217;re very active on these other platforms like YouTube and Instagram and Pinterest. How has, I guess, exhibiting your work through those channels helped you out as an artist and an entrepreneur?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
I think it has really challenged me to think about one, I guess how much one person is capable of. So, you&#8217;ll see a lot of people who do content creation full time, and you&#8217;re just scratching your head and just like, how are they doing all of this content? And just like, well, there&#8217;s a strategy behind everything, and a lot of content is actually strategically recycled and scheduled and all this stuff. So, once I was able to break that formula down in my head, I was able to be like, okay. I&#8217;m just going to put my work in multiple places, because you never know how someone will find you or come across you, and shooting as many shots as you can is always, I think, good. Especially if you&#8217;re entrepreneurial like me, or just trying to increase your chances of someone coming across your work. I think it&#8217;s always best to be in as many places as possible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And also, by doing that work and showing off what it is that you&#8217;re doing, you&#8217;re attracting other people, which for your first year in business, I mean, that&#8217;s the best marketing that you can do, is to really show the work that you&#8217;re doing so other people can find out about it.</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
No, definitely. It&#8217;s definitely a whole process of show and tell. Your social media quickly becomes your portfolio, or your YouTube becomes a reel of the things that you can do. I&#8217;ve had so many people tell me, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I watched some of your YouTube videos,&#8221; and that exhibited that you can speak about this topic, and you know about video editing. It&#8217;s interesting also the way that people will break down, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve seen your content in this place, this place and this place,&#8221; and from that I can deduce relatively the kind of skills that you have, and the interests that you have. I think it&#8217;s just a great way to showcase everything that you can do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you find that different social networks are better, depending on what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Yeah. I would say so. I think it depends, because a lot of people have been saying, especially this year, that video content has really taken over platforms that were previously photo based, like Instagram. Where TikTok and Snapchat have&#8230; Well, mostly TikTok, but I guess Snapchat really did it first, where people are creating video content, and using that as a way of exhibiting a tutorial. It could be for anything. I use a lot of my platforms to use as tutorial based posting, so I think that&#8217;s a great way to engage with my community. It&#8217;s not always about, oh, this is the finished piece that I did. I like to share educational content, so I&#8217;ve found that anything that really has videos on it, which is everything, can really be used in that way, which I&#8217;ve tried to leverage a lot this year and has been pretty successful.</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
And then, other platforms like Twitter, I found are just great for building community and just getting out there, and just talking with people who are really like-minded, and in your same creative sphere. Maybe they don&#8217;t do lettering, but maybe they do type design and other kinds of illustrations. So, it&#8217;s really interesting to hit that follow button on someone and see them follow back, and be surprised maybe the people who are just willing to talk to you about the stuff that you guys already know that you&#8217;re interested in from your bio or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, even with all that, you&#8217;re on these different social networks, you&#8217;re doing these things. I see that you have a section on your site about art licensing. Talk to me about that, because that&#8217;s something that I haven&#8217;t really seen on a lot of really designers or illustrator sites, is about licensing.</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s definitely one of the areas that I knew that even if, quote unquote, I was maybe slow out the gate to get some clients, I could definitely build a licensing portfolio. I&#8217;m personally, I think I&#8217;ve collected probably almost every greeting card or holiday card, birthday card I&#8217;ve gotten since I was, I don&#8217;t know, 10 or something. I&#8217;ve just always loved the illustrations, and just the look of greeting cards. I&#8217;m just like, that&#8217;s art licensing. I could totally do that. I was able to actually get an art licensing course that I purchased at the top of the year, and it was really helpful for me getting some licensing clients. That&#8217;s just a little bit of recurring income that I get, which is nice, and it&#8217;s completely passive. Once I&#8217;ve done the designs, they just generate that little bit of income for me every month. So, it&#8217;s really nice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, have companies already reached out to you to license some of your work?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Yeah. I actually did a little bit of&#8230; I think I&#8217;ve actually done probably all of the outreach maybe, I think, for all of the companies that I&#8217;m licensing with right now. The first one I did was a mobile app called Felt, and they actually do digital greeting cards. So, you have the app on your phone, you can design the greeting card, you can write it on your phone and they&#8217;ll mail the card out to whoever is in your address book. So, they have a hybrid approach, where it&#8217;s like you do the process digitally, but they&#8217;ll still mail the card. So, that was interesting. I don&#8217;t&#8230; Honestly, I think I just Google searched like crazy, just art licensing, seeing other companies that fellow lettering artists have licensing deals through, and just collecting contacts and doing the research, and just sending out cold email. Got a few good responses this year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And is that&#8230; I mean, I would imagine that&#8217;s probably pretty steady income too, with licensing, because you&#8217;re doing along certain time terms, maybe monthly or annual or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Yeah. Exactly. It just depends on whatever your contract agreement is, the terms of your royalty payments. But it&#8217;s cool because I can expand my portfolio, if I want to add 10 new cards to a collection, I can, and just have those go in circulation and see how they perform. And then you just get your little monthly commission reports, so you can see how your designs are performing, and maybe where you want to make some improvements, maybe add to different categories or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of your inspirations, either as an artist or as a business person? Who inspires you?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Oh, geez. Well, I definitely was inspired from the very beginning by Jessica Hische, because she was probably the first name that I heard attached to lettering. I think that happened when I was in a typography class that I took in college. My professor had shown her daily drop cap project as an example of lettering, and I was just like, &#8220;Lettering?&#8221; And then, from there I just fell down the rabbit hole, so to speak. I was pretty much hooked from there. Other than her, Martina Flor definitely, has all also been a huge inspiration. I actually took her freelancing course when I was first getting started this year, learning the ropes of freelance from one, a seasoned lettering artist, but also someone who&#8217;s been running their own lettering business for 10 plus years. It was a huge inspiration for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to someone out there that&#8217;s listening to this, and they want to follow in your footsteps? They want to maybe learn lettering design, or they&#8217;re looking to strike out on their own as an entrepreneur. I know those are two separate things, but what advice would you give to someone that&#8217;s listening, and they want to go in either or both of those routes?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, when I was first thinking about it, I think I was first listing all of the talents that I had, I guess, like these are all the ways that I could monetize the skills that I already have. I&#8217;m a trained graphic designer, I can do that. I taught workshops before, I can do that. Just listing out those skills and talents was, I think, the first thing, because I&#8217;m just like, okay. These could be my services hypothetically for freelancing. And then, I think it just from there went to following this passion that I&#8217;ve had for a long time. I think that first exposure to Jessica Hische&#8217;s work was probably 2013, 2014 or something like that. So, from there I just had lettering as a hobby and a creative outlet while I was sitting at my receptionist desk. I think being a graphic designer full-time made it harder for me to nurture that creative hunger, I think, for lettering.</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
I knew that what I wanted to buy myself was more time. So, from there I saved money. I&#8217;m just like, I&#8217;m completely new to freelancing. I never truly envisioned myself freelancing in my career. So, I was just like, I know one thing that I need is a little bit of a cushion financially. I definitely took a risk quitting my job, but I didn&#8217;t just do it without any logistical understanding of my expenses and stuff. And then, I think from there, it&#8217;s just really go with your gut. I did have the financial cushion, but I did not have a client history. I didn&#8217;t have referrals from other people that I could take with me in my little email address book or something.</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
I took a risk definitely in that aspect. But because I&#8217;ve been nurturing this skill and this hobby for so long, with the hopes of somehow making this my profession, I think a lot of the things that I&#8217;ve encountered were that whole luck, where it&#8217;s opportunity meets the preparation. So, yeah. If you want to do something, make sure that you&#8217;re already doing it in some capacity, even if it&#8217;s just on the side to begin with. As long as you&#8217;re feeding into that, whatever that thing is that you really want to be doing, that&#8217;s definitely positive as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does success look like for you at this point in your career?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Wow. Right now, success looks like being able to sustain and continue from places of passion and genuine excitement and interest, and not from the place of, I&#8217;ve got to take this client on because I need to pay my rent this month. I think just continuing with that feeling of excitement and passion, I think, because even when you&#8217;re doing things that you&#8217;re really interested in, after a while you might get a little burned out. I&#8217;m hoping to not, to not reach that burnout point, and be able to be responsible with my time and with my emotional wellbeing. I just want to keep doing this and maintaining,</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have a dream project you&#8217;d love to do one day?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Oh, geez. I have many, and it&#8217;s great because some of them even happened this year. But I am definitely setting my sites out for large scale projects, like murals. I am definitely looking to get my lettering painted outside somewhere in New York City. I think that would be the coolest thing, and have people take pictures with my work outdoors. I think that&#8217;d be really awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you appreciate the most about your life right now?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
I appreciate the privilege that comes with being able to take a risk, like the one that I took, and in some ways I&#8217;m still taking. I really appreciate that. And I appreciate the luxury of time. I&#8217;ve bought myself a little bit of time with a little bit of the planning that I did before, I ended going freelance, but I&#8217;m abundantly grateful for those things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, given where you are now, where do you see yourself in the next five years? Is there certain work that you&#8217;d want to be doing at that point or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
This year has been a lot of seed planting. It&#8217;s like I have to start working from somewhere. So, I started my YouTube channel this year, started with zero subscribers just like everyone who starts anything. In five years it would just be nice to see these communities that I&#8217;ve started, investing and grow. I really love lettering and I love working with clients. It&#8217;s such a rewarding feeling, being able to help them. But it&#8217;s also really rewarding to help other people who are interested in lettering. So, that&#8217;s why I definitely knew that as a part of my freelancing that I wanted there to be some sort of educational aspect, with workshops or tutorials and stuff like that, like I do on YouTube. So, yeah. Just expanding my reach and having that allow me to reach back as well to others.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Reaching forward and reaching back, I like that. So, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you? Where can they see your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Yeah. You can find my work at agfdesignstudio.com, but you can find me on YouTube at AGF Design Studio. That&#8217;s my channel name, that&#8217;s also my name on Instagram. And then, also on Instagram and Twitter. I&#8217;m Alanna_ Flowers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Alanna Flowers, I definitely want to thank you so much for coming on the show and really one, I think telling your story, but then two also, giving us a little bit of a peak behind the curtain of what it&#8217;s like to a new freelancer. There&#8217;s been all this talk this year specifically about the great resignation, and people leaving jobs and striking out on their own. It seems like you&#8217;ve really&#8230; I mean, well, one, you have struck out a lot on your own. But two, it seems like you&#8217;ve really hit a stride and you&#8217;re making great work. You&#8217;re promoting yourself out there on social media. I wish, when I started my studio, that I was half as prepared and put together as you are with how you&#8217;re doing everything. I think you&#8217;re doing a great job, and I&#8217;d love to see where your work goes in the future. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Alanna Flowers:</b><br>
Thank you so much, Maurice, for having me.</p>
