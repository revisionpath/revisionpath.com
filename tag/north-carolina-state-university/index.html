Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>Our paths have crossed several times over the past couple of years, but I finally managed to sit down and chat with the one and only Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel. Along with being an author, design educator, and community builder, she is one of the editors behind <em><a href="https://blackexperienceindesign.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">The Black Experience in Design: Identity, Expression &amp; Reflection</a></em>, a compilation of essays from over 70 Black designers, artists, curators, educators, students, and researchers.</p>
<p>Our conversation began with some good news about a recent grand that she won, and from there we talked about her areas research and what she teaches. Dr. Noel spoke about growing up in Trinidad and Tobago and studying design in Brazil, including becoming a Fulbright Scholar and arriving at North Carolina State University. She also talked about motivation, ambition, and about the importance of finding your own community.</p>
<p>Take Dr. Noel&#8217;s advice &#8212; the world of design is a lot bigger than you think!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
All right. So my name is Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel, and I&#8217;m an assistant professor of design at North Carolina State University. What I do is a hard question because I do a lot of things. I guess the main thing is that I teach design and I work as a design coach in a kind of consulting capacity. And then I do research because I&#8217;m at a research university. So I do research in education, public health, and community engagement. And then, I&#8217;m an author and an editor. And maybe I&#8217;m a convener. I like to bring people together to talk about design. Yes. So I&#8217;ll stop there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I was going to say I&#8217;m glad you mentioned author and convener, because you did bring so many people together, myself included for The Black Experience in Design book that published earlier this year.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Yeah. So I&#8217;m one of six editors of that book. But I think you see my character and my outlook in the way that I brought people together, I suppose in the chapters that I worked on. Or when we were preparing the book, I brought people together to write together. Because I really believe in I guess the power of community. And I understand everybody&#8217;s journey with their own kind of imposter syndrome.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So in that book, one of my key roles was just that. To bring people together and kind of tell people, &#8220;Oh my goodness, your writing is amazing. All you need to do is change this little thing.&#8221; If you have that kind of approach, people can become so much more productive. So I think that that&#8217;s an outlook that I take into a lot of the things that I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I remember those Saturday morning Zoom writing sessions. Those were really helpful.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ve been doing those maybe for about two and a half years. Actually when I went to Tulane, so I&#8217;ve worked at about four different universities. So when I was at Tulane University, I was introduced a little bit more to this culture of writing together with other people. I joined some of their writing workshops that my colleagues had organized. But then I started either joining other people&#8217;s writing workshops, or running my own. I have to say that is really what has made me really productive writing wise in the last two years or so, because I write so often. So now it&#8217;s like I write every day, I suppose.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now you also recently won a grant too, right? The Outreach and Engagement Incentive Grants.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Yeah. So I won a grant at NC State. It&#8217;s a small grant, but it was an exciting proposal to be funded. It&#8217;s called STEM Games Against Oppression. Right? And it was a kind of, I don&#8217;t want to say it was a crazy idea. Because the stakes are &#8220;low&#8221; because it&#8217;s a small grant and it&#8217;s an internal grant, I felt I could actually be very creative in the way that I put together the grant. So this grant combines a lot of things that I&#8217;m interested in. So Afrofuturism or speculative futures. Games. STEM, and teaching STEM in different ways. And of course design. So for this grant, we are going to work with a group. And then the other interest is teenage boys. That sounds weird to say it like that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
My son is 14, and I kind of jokingly say to some of my friends a lot of my research has always been focused at whatever age he&#8217;s at. Right? So with this one, I&#8217;ve been thinking about how can science be more engaging or more interesting for 14 year old boys? So that&#8217;s what this grant is about, this project is about. Where these boys are going to discuss society, and oppression, and all of these things. But they&#8217;re going to make these games. And while they&#8217;re making the games, we&#8217;re going to introduce them to a lot of design-based STEM kind of concepts making. And I don&#8217;t know what the content is actually yet. But I&#8217;m excited about doing this work, which I&#8217;m going to start late fall.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
It was just exciting that I could win that kind of creative grant, to really bring together a lot of the things I was interested in and just create this experimental workshop where we&#8217;re just going to make these fun games. But while we&#8217;re making these fun games, we&#8217;re talking about society. We are going to do some 3D printing and AR/VR kind of stuff. So it&#8217;s creative, and it was exciting for that kind of creative activity to be seen as research. So hopefully, it&#8217;s another line of work that I&#8217;m going to be able to continue in the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, it sounds like you&#8217;ve had a banner year so far. Not just this year, but last year also. I mean, before we started recording, I was just congratulating you on your honorary doctorate that you got from the Pacific Northwest College of Art. Have you kind of had a chance to celebrate all these wins? I mean the doctorate, the book, the grant. Have you had a chance to celebrate?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
No. No, I haven&#8217;t. And it&#8217;s strange to say it, but I know that the pandemic caused a lot of disruption for a lot of people. For me too. But the pandemic also created access in a way that I might not have had access before. I&#8217;m parenting. So before the pandemic, I was always weighing things and trying to figure out, &#8220;Okay, what can I say yes to? What can I say no to?&#8221; And most things I would have to say no to, because I couldn&#8217;t go and participate in things because of my son&#8217;s school year or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So what happened with me with the pandemic is that because of these virtual meetings that we do, I could actually say yes to everything, right? Which is not a strategy that I recommend for a lot of people. But that is I suppose what has led to this bumpy year that because we weren&#8217;t physically going to places, I could now suddenly be involved in a lot of projects that I couldn&#8217;t have been involved in 2019. But also because of the pandemic, I haven&#8217;t had time to celebrate. Now I want to go somewhere and celebrate, but I haven&#8217;t actually been able to.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s been an exciting year. It&#8217;s an exciting year or a couple of years that have been the result of a lot of collaboration. So people might see me, but it&#8217;s hardly ever only about me. I love working with other people. So it&#8217;s a lot of these kinds of collaborations with other people that have created a lot of the results and the visibility that exists now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know what you mean about taking everything as it happens. I swear that summer, really I&#8217;d say from the summer of 2020 on to the end of that year, I just had this influx of opportunities that came in. And I didn&#8217;t say no to any of them because I could just do them all from home. So I know exactly what you mean by that, not having to kind of weigh the pros and cons. You can do it all because you happen to be in a place where you can do it all.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Yeah. And actually, you reminded me of this other thing of course, which we have to talk about. As Black people, summer 2020 was I suppose a year of hyper visibility for Black designers. So there were a lot more opportunities that would&#8217;ve come &#8230; or certainly for me. Let me not speak for everybody. A lot more opportunities, many more opportunities came my way after summer 2020. And I didn&#8217;t have to worry about could I accept them or not. So that&#8217;s why I guess I&#8217;m visible now and I&#8217;m able to celebrate these things. The book, the honorary doctorate, all of these things. Because really the visibility for us professionally changed that summer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It really did. And it&#8217;s interesting because now just two years later now, really kind of looking back on it, I mean we&#8217;re recording this right around the time a lot of this stuff happened back in 2020. It&#8217;s almost two years to the day when a lot of this really happened. And it&#8217;s amazing to see how things have changed just in terms of not only visibility, but also that attention. I don&#8217;t know about you. But for me, I feel like the attention has pretty much just completely died down. Like companies that said they were going to do stuff haven&#8217;t done it yet. Or they made a pledge and they never actually went through with it. That sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
I&#8217;m an academic. Right? And I guess I&#8217;ve maybe been able to use visibility in a slightly different way to other designers. Right? So it&#8217;s like if then that hyper visibility of that year and a half or those two years has given me &#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say it like this, but I will say it like this. It&#8217;s like that has given me permission or validation to do other things. Because then, my name became known as a designer who talks about equity or a designer who talks about social justice. I&#8217;m kind of channeling that into the research that I want to do or the community engagement that I want to do.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s not quite that I&#8217;m depending on the companies that said that they would be doing stuff to do this stuff because I&#8217;m in academia. But I am using the little bit of validation that I got during those 18 months then to underpin some of the work that I want to do. Right? Whether it&#8217;s this work about futures, and Afrofuturism, and how we combining that with design and world building, right? At least I could use the little bit of name recognition that I created in that time to now continue to do this other work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of being an academic, you mentioned teaching at North Carolina State University. How has it been teaching and going through all this over the past few years?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So an interesting thing that I found out during the pandemic is that I love teaching online, which is strange. I enjoy teaching face-to-face or online. But what I really enjoyed about working online &#8230; and there were ups and downs, right? But I first taught online in I think 2018 or 2019. So just before the pandemic. When we went into that crisis in March 13th, I already had two different experiences to build on. One, I worked at the d.school at Stanford in 2018 to 2019, and I did teach some Zoom-based classes then. And then 2019 to 2020, I was at Tulane. And at Tulane, we had to have a crisis management plan where we had to practice teaching online before the pandemic. We didn&#8217;t know the pandemic was coming. It was just part of hurricane crisis management.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So from those experiences, I already had some experience in things like bringing music into the classroom while on the Zoom call or changing up my Zoom backgrounds. I&#8217;d already started using these kind of warmup activities to get people comfortable online. So certainly the early days of the pandemic, I actually really enjoyed teaching online. There&#8217;s some frustration. As a design teacher, one thing that is complicated or difficult to manage is that we don&#8217;t have the same relationship with materials when we&#8217;re working remotely. But then we can experiment with other things, like maybe drawing together on a virtual whiteboard. I did some activities where people had to take photographs and add them to the virtual whiteboard. So I really enjoyed that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
I think that the last semester that was kind of hybrid was the worst point of the pandemic, because you can&#8217;t do both at the same time well. So I really wanted to be either online or in-person, but not both. Because there are these other issues that people hadn&#8217;t thought about. Like maybe we can&#8217;t hear properly when we&#8217;re in that kind of format with booths. Or our classroom suddenly became very accessible during the pandemic. And then when we went back to this kind of strange hybrid space, it became inaccessible again. I had one or two students who just couldn&#8217;t come to the classroom anymore because of accessibility issues like stairs and stuff like that. Right?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
But what else can I say about the experience? The accessibility issue, the pandemic broad accessibility. Or let me not say the pandemic, but teaching remotely made some classes and design classes accessible in ways that they might not have been before. Like throughout the pandemic, I taught hearing impaired people in many different settings, and I never had a lot of engagement with the deaf community before the pandemic. Right? So I that has always been something that has concerned me as we kind of go back to business as usual. What about all the accessibility that we created? Where is it going to go?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you mentioned North Carolina State University being a research university. Can you talk a bit about what research you&#8217;re working on?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Yeah. Well maybe, first I&#8217;m going to talk about one thing that I teach that might be tied to research. So I teach a class called contemporary issues in art and design. And it is a class about &#8230; well contemporary issues yes. But it&#8217;s equity and social justice. And that&#8217;s kind of one of the areas that underpins some of the engagement, because we do research and engagement. And the public engagement that I&#8217;m interested in is very equity and social justice focused.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So out of that class, I&#8217;ve been doing writing that&#8217;s related to the content of that class. So about race, gender, disability, all of these oppression issues. And I&#8217;m starting to bring that into the research that I have to say I want to do, because I&#8217;m a new assistant professor at NC State. So not all of it has started.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
But there are three areas of research that I plan to continue working in. Right? So the first one is tied to education. And it is about using design, and design principles, and design pedagogy, the way that we teach and learn design. And using that to make STEM education more accessible.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
I see this also as a justice issue. So that&#8217;s why I said it&#8217;s tied to that class that I teach. So when I was at Tulane, we started to do this tiny experiment where we turned a math class into a design class. And that&#8217;s a little bit of an example of where I see that research going. Where I worked with a professor, a math professor at Tulane called Marie Dahleh. And she taught me about something called ordinary differential equations, which I knew nothing about before. But when I did a little bit of research, I found it is about actually predicting the future. She might not describe it as that. And mathematicians might not describe it as that. But as someone who&#8217;s interested in futures, that&#8217;s the thing that I grabbed onto. This equation is to predict the future. And then we turned the math class into a design class about predicting the future and then using the equation to somehow support the prediction. Right?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m playing with making STEM curricular really exciting, engaging, future-focused, and critical at the same time. So maybe overlaying a lot of things, but it is a track that I&#8217;ve been following for a little while. In my PhD research, I worked with children who were in fourth grade. And at that time, they had to discuss society and the world around them and then take action through design. And I&#8217;m really just continuing that research and saying well okay, you&#8217;re going to discuss society. Yes. Take action through design, but we are going to make the STEM principles that are attached to the action that you&#8217;re taking a little bit more explicit. So that&#8217;s one area of research that I&#8217;m involved in.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Another area of research. And again, this is tied to another collaborator again at Tulane. This is Alessandra Bazzano. And in this area of research, we are looking at how can we use the way that designers think, talk, express themselves, the way designers use materials. How can we use all of these things to support patients or members of the public to talk about their public health experience more, or more clearly? So we did some workshops where for example, we gave people prototyping materials. And then we asked them to make something related to their pandemic experience, and then use that thing that they had made as a prompt to open up and talk about issues related to public health, right? Or could we get people to use photographs that they had taken as a prompt to get people to talk more about their public health experience in the pandemic? So that&#8217;s another area of research, which is related to patient-centered outcomes research, which is a whole area of research in public health. But it is using design methods and these design ways of thinking to support that patient centered outcomes research.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
And then the third area of research that I&#8217;m into is civic and social innovation, where we are building capacity within cities to get more people within the city or from the public to go through the design process together to address social issues. Right? So it&#8217;s civic or social engagement through design. So I mean, maybe I explain all three badly. But these are the three areas that I&#8217;m interested in. STEM education, public health, or patient-centered outcomes, and civic and social engagement. And all through design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s really interesting that you are doing this as you mentioned, all through design. Even the first part that you mentioned about math really kind of struck me, because my degree is in math. So you start talking about differential equations. That took me right back to my 2002 differential equations class at Morehouse with my professor, Dr. Bozeman and him talking about how a lot of engineers and stuff, they use differential equations for futures predictions. For example, if you want to predict the spread of an oil spill, you would use differential equations to try to figure that out. You&#8217;re predicting it. You don&#8217;t know for sure. But with calculus being the rate of change across a certain period of time or across a certain distance, differential equations helps you to try to chart those paths and stuff. So you&#8217;re right on with that. Certainly. It&#8217;s really just interesting that you&#8217;re able to do all this and tie design into all of it.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Yeah. And it&#8217;s about access an agency, and creating access and agency through design. But I&#8217;ll just share like a little bit of feedback that the professor I was working with that she gave. After we did that math class, that was a design class. She said, &#8220;There were different students engaged in the class today. And that&#8217;s interesting.&#8221; Because there&#8217;s some students who just expect, they&#8217;re going to love everything about math. But she said, &#8220;When we turned the math class into the design class, there were different people who were involved,&#8221; because there were people who were involved because maybe they were acting as they presented the future scenario that they had predicted. So I think can we use design to get people engaged in different ways around STEM education, public health, and social innovation? These are the three little pockets I&#8217;m interested in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And I have to say, I think that&#8217;s important for designers now to really think about. So much I feel like design within the past maybe decade or so has really largely been product focused and UX focused. I think as certainly technology, and tech companies, and social media and stuff have started to really become these pervasive entities in our lives. There&#8217;s so many designers now that are just getting into product, or UX, or something, but not thinking about other areas of practice where they could use their design. Like the stuff that you&#8217;re talking about with social innovation, other non-product oriented design work, community engagement. Speculative futures, which is related to an article that you just published recently. I think it&#8217;s important to show that these options are options.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
These options are options. And then also, we create these options. There&#8217;s something that I say all the time. So someone&#8217;s going to listen to this interview and say, &#8220;Oh my God, she&#8217;s saying this again.&#8221; But when I was finishing up undergrad just before the end, our professor said something like, &#8220;You make yourselves relevant?&#8221; I did industrial design. And he says, &#8220;Nobody needs any industrial designers anywhere.&#8221; But you are the one who kind of make yourself relevant to the conversations that everyone is having. So it&#8217;s like we make these opportunities for ourselves. So we don&#8217;t only have to talk about product and tech. There is work for us as designers in education, in even project management. Because to be a good designer, you know how to manage things, and manage time, and manage people. So these skills kind of don&#8217;t have to stay within the design world. We can take these skills and move them to other sectors where the opportunity might be so obvious.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Absolutely. Absolutely. Well said. Also at North Carolina State University, you&#8217;re co-chair of the Pluriversal Design Special Interest Group, which is part of the Design Research Society. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
All right. So that&#8217;s an exciting little research group. So the Design Research Society is supposed to be the largest professional organization for design research in the world actually. And they do an annual conference. There&#8217;s one that&#8217;s going to happen in June or would&#8217;ve happened by the time this is. So they do a conference every two years. And I&#8217;ve been a member of this association for about five years. Right?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So when I used to go to the annual conference, I used to be very struck that nobody was discussing stuff that I wanted to talk about. Right? And when I say I wanted to talk about, I mean as a Black woman from Trinidad and Tobago. It doesn&#8217;t have to be about race, I suppose. But as somebody from the global south, I found there was no one talking about design in ways that I really wanted to talk to. But if in the conference I met someone from Brazil, from Nigeria, from any other place other than Europe or North America, I found that we started to have more overlap of issues.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So we created this research group, myself and colleague Renata Marques Leitao, we had created this little research group to focus on issues in design from a non-European and non-North American perspective. Right? Also issues related to challenging the dominant narrative in design. Challenging that kind of white Euro American perspective in design. So this group became a group to talk about these types of issues within this Design Research Society. So it was like where could you find stories about practice from designers in South Africa and in India, for example. This became the group where we could have these kind of multicultural or cross cultural conversations in a way where &#8230; in design or very often, these kinds of conversations come with a little bit of a hierarchy where it&#8217;s kind of assumed that the person who is from America or from Europe has more authority or more knowledge than the person from wherever else. And this group challenges a lot of that kind of conversation.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So we&#8217;ve been around since 2018. It&#8217;s a vibrant group where the most vibrant thing that we do is actually a book club where we focus on design. We focus on who designers should be reading, authors that designers should be reading that are not from Europe or North America. People from within the group suggest people, so one week we had worked by a Puerto Rican feminist, Aurora Levins Morales. Another week we had someone talking about, N. K. Jemisin who is American, but is not part of that dominant white male perspective.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So we bring all of these authors that we think people need to hear from and talk about that, and talk about how their work affects design. And then we share stories about practice. We share research. And it is a group then that is focused on decolonizing design, but not only talking about decolonizing design. Because a lot of people talk about decolonizing design, but it remains as just talk. And in group, we&#8217;re asking people to share practice, and share stories. And kind of like, what are you doing that is not focusing on maybe more traditional ways of doing design? How are you shaking things up in your own design practice? And can you share this with us?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know you mentioned that about decolonizing design, and it reminded me about well one, I know Dr. Dori Tunstall is doing a lot of work in driving conversations around that. I remember, I think this might have been maybe a couple of years ago, there was some pushback from another Black designer about even using that term decolonizing design. I believe it was &#8230; oh my goodness. I think it was Saki Mafundikwa from Zimbabwe. He had written this piece for AIGA&#8217;s Eye on Design kind of pushing back on that term. I think thinking of colonialism in the more imperialistic sense, particularly with him being African. Pushing back on that term like can you really say you&#8217;re decolonizing design as an American?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Right. So that&#8217;s a good point of view. Actually, we had a conversation &#8230; when I say our conversation, I mean our group, we led a discussion a few months ago where we actually said that you probably should be an existential crisis if you&#8217;re a designer to be. Because you might want to talk about something like decolonizing design, but actually design is modernist and colonial. So how do we decolonize this? And when we decolonize it, is it still going to be design? Even that&#8217;s going to be part of the future existential crisis. It might not be design when we reach whatever place we think decolonization is.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s not actually a place, it&#8217;s a journey. And the work that I&#8217;ve been doing, I guess my step towards this whole decolonizing work is every issue that I look at, I keep asking myself, &#8220;Well, what is my perspective as person X?&#8221; Which to be really reductionist, this Black woman is from the Caribbean or Black mother from the Caribbean. So that informs a lot of the issues that I am focusing on. And I think that that&#8217;s my small step towards decolonizing given the space where I&#8217;m practicing as a designer and as a design researcher in my very authentic way. I don&#8217;t want to say an authentic way. It&#8217;s my way. And I encourage other people to do that. Bring your way into the process. And I see that us moving towards decolonizing the work, right?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Because a few years ago, maybe five, six years ago, I really thought about how I would see students kind of struggling to fit in or kind of struggling to replicate what they thought good design was.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So I travel a lot or I used to travel a lot, but I went to a design school in India. And at that point, at first I was like, &#8220;This is kind of interesting.&#8221; To see the similarity in the design world between Brazil, and Trinidad, and India. But actually on the other hand, I found it really disturbing that all of these students would&#8217;ve come into design school with their vibrant, vibrant identities, and maybe leave with this more homogenized outlook. And I think that my step towards decolonizing design is making sure that that doesn&#8217;t happen. Right? Getting people to really bring themselves back into the design process.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now we&#8217;ve talked a lot about your work. But I really want to kind of dive more into your origin story, because you&#8217;ve sort of dropped some little breadcrumbs here and there about going to India, and Brazil, and stuff like that. I know you&#8217;re originally from Trinidad and Tobago. So let&#8217;s start there. Tell me about growing up there. What was your childhood like?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Yeah. I grew up, from Trinidad who might be listening to this, I&#8217;m from Diamond Vale Diego Martin. I had probably a really kind of ordinary, middle class kind of existence. And I was a middle child. So growing up in my sister&#8217;s shadow and then kind of the baby after me. But you probably want to know about okay, design in Trinidad. And people in Trinidad don&#8217;t see this, but Trinidad is a very designerly place. Right? Because we have carnival culture. So it means that you are talking and thinking about design every year. And it&#8217;s a very fashion-conscious place.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So there&#8217;s a design language in Trinidad that I think people use from [inaudible 00:37:48], and at different festivals. Maybe they&#8217;re talking about design with regard to the way bamboo structures are made for some of the festivals and things like that. You know? So there&#8217;s that designerly sensibility I think all the time.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
The first design that I remember is in the equivalent of sixth grade, which is like form one. I remember designing maybe my first carnival costume and doing some work with lettering, which I still had. I still have somewhere. I saw the image the other day. But I can&#8217;t say that I know when I made the real conscious choice that design would&#8217;ve been it, right? But I guess maybe somewhere between 10th grade and 11th grade, this was the path that I joined. I became a &#8216;designer&#8217; from that age, became really interested in things like typography. I did a lot of book covers in school. I remember one design exam where I did a popup book with Christopher Columbus. So maybe this was me already challenging the world. Right? So Christopher Columbus was sailing across the ocean. And then when you pulled the little tab, he fell off the flat earth or something like that. But I always thought that design was exciting.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
I went to high school where art and design were really considered respectable professions or respectable areas. My parents probably wondered if I would&#8217;ve been able to pay for myself, survive as a designer. But my parents were really very open-minded and maybe focused on making sure that their children felt empowered. So when I wanted to study in Brazil, nobody ever told me no.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So actually, maybe I have to go backtrack a little bit and say how I ended up in Brazil. But I couldn&#8217;t study design in the way that I wanted to in Trinidad. And again, my parents, because they spoke a language that was very open. They kind of said, &#8220;Well, you could study anywhere in the world, as long as we don&#8217;t have to pay for it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s a good challenge to give 17 year old or 18 year old child. Right? Because I then started to just look for places around the world that I could study and my parents wouldn&#8217;t have to pay for it. Because what they were saying is that, &#8220;If we have to pay for it, we are going to tell you where you have to study. If you want to study anywhere, then you find the opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So eventually, I ended up starting school in Bahia in Brazil. So I started graphic design in Bahia in Federal University of Bahia, but then eventually I moved to a town called Curitiba in the south of Brazil. And I did industrial design. And I spent a really long time in Brazil. But it was an amazing &#8230; I actually spent six years in Brazil. An amazing six years where I was just able to grow without family influence. I just really became very independent and very worldly. I lived in a community, a university community that was very politically conscious and politically active.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So my interest in equity and social justice really started then with my roommates who were in social sciences and psychology. Because we didn&#8217;t have those conversations in design. Those conversations were happening on other floors in the building that I studied in. But those fueled me and world view.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
From Brazil, I went back to Trinidad in the late &#8217;90s. And then kind of almost immediately started working as a kind of design consultant with agencies that was somehow tied to export. So within Trinidad, I worked as a consultant with our trade and export agency for a few years. Then I worked with, there was a regional agency, Caribbean Export. I worked with them also as a consultant. Then I worked in East Africa in different places. Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya also as a consultant in trade and export. And, I was also adjunct faculty at the same time at the University of the West Indies in design.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
But I suppose it&#8217;s a little bit of that work with the export agencies, because this is kind of like development, international development kind of work. That work encouraged me to ask questions that eventually led me to do a PhD. And there was pressure from the university as well, because I eventually moved from being an adjunct to full-time. And you probably know how this academic thing is, but you probably need a PhD if you&#8217;re going to stay in academia.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So it was both the internal pressure from the university as well as these questions I was asking about the work we were doing as designers working in the area of development that eventually led me to do a PhD. Because I just thought that we needed to be asking harder questions, different questions. Really about how do we engage communities? What&#8217;s our role as designers when we are doing this work with people and trying to tell them, &#8220;This is the kind of product you need to make to get more sales and export you.&#8221; I just thought that we needed to reflect more on the work that we were doing. And I took a step back, and I started to apply to PhD programs in the mid, I don&#8217;t even even know how to call that decade in 2015. With no name.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So how did I end up here in the states? I actually got a Fulbright award. NC State, and the Fulbright Association have a good relationship. So it was a school that was recommended to me. I knew about the work that NC State was doing in education and design education. And that&#8217;s kind of how I ended up with the Fulbright Award. And because of NC State&#8217;s reputation, I ended up applying here, and coming here, and really enjoying the program. I spent three years here. I did not actually pursue the questions that I was thinking about pursuing, where I was thinking about design and development, because I was interested in education as well. My PhD is more tied to design education and developing critical design curriculum. So design curricula where people are asking hard questions about society. That was what my PhD research was about.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
But yeah, I spent three years here. Then I spent a year at Stanford and two years at Tulane. And now I&#8217;m back here at NC State. So I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s an origin story, but that&#8217;s a little bit of a story.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, that&#8217;s quite a journey. I think what I kind of want to pull from that is what drove you to really make these big jumps not just geographically, but culturally? I mean, you&#8217;re going from Trinidad to Brazil, then from Brazil back to Trinidad, and then from Trinidad to the states. So there&#8217;s that. But then also it seems like you&#8217;re also leveling up educationally and vocationally I should say, in each situation. You&#8217;re going to undergraduate in Brazil. You&#8217;re pursuing your masters and working in Trinidad. Now you&#8217;re pursuing your PhD in the states. What was driving you during that time? What was really fueling that ambition?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Oh my goodness. I don&#8217;t even know. So what got me to Brazil &#8230; or maybe I&#8217;ll give a kind of umbrella statement. I&#8217;ve had people around me who have made me feel that I could do anything. So it was like the openness of that conversation with my parents. So that challenge that they gave me, that got me to go to Brazil. That got me to find Brazil as a place to go to. Right? Or little things that I would&#8217;ve heard from that professor in undergrad that made me just feel fearless.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
For most of my adult or professional life, I have felt that I could do anything. I have to say I&#8217;m grateful to the people around me who have made me feel like I can do anything. I guess the leveling up is just kind of what had to be done. That was part of the opportunity. I wouldn&#8217;t really have come to the states maybe without doing the PhD. But again, the people around me just made me think, &#8220;Well okay, of course you can go and get a PhD. Why wouldn&#8217;t you be able to get a PhD?&#8221; You know? Or, &#8220;Of course go to Brazil. Why wouldn&#8217;t you be able to go to Brazil?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So I&#8217;ve had that kind of empowering language around me all the time. And that has opened up my world. I really would say though, that I credit my parents for giving me the openness to think of going to Brazil. And I will say to any parent who might be listening to this, that changed my whole outlook on life. Because learning a new language, learning a new culture, that kind of removed all of the barriers on the world. Because I was able to do that, encourage other parents, &#8220;Push your children to kind of open up their worlds a little bit more.&#8221; That open world will just continue to take you to other places.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So of course Brazil, that experience of going back and forth between Trinidad and Brazil for six years made it seem like going between Trinidad and Tanzania for a few months, or Trinidad and Kenya, it was just another thing like that. All of this travel, and getting to know new cultures, and new people, and understanding that the world happens differently for other people. And that curiosity of wanting to know more about how other people experience the world. All that started because of that very open experience I had, I think in undergrad.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And what is it that sort of keeps you motivated and inspired these days?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
There are a few things. I&#8217;m still very excited about conversations with other people in other parts of the world, and how they live, and think, and do. So the Pluriversal Design group is a little bit of that. How do we create a space where we can really listen to how other people, whoever other is, how people do things differently. So that&#8217;s one thing that continues to inspire me, just my curiosity about other people in the world. So that also affects the way that I do research, because that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m interested I suppose in anthropology, or anthropological methods, or ethnographic methods. Because I have that curiosity about the world and people.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
What continues to inspire me as well is that &#8230; well, this is where we get wishy washy, I suppose. Because I think my son, and my niece, and my nephew. What is the world that they&#8217;re going into? I suppose that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve always had this one area of research that has focused on child centered methods or questions that I think are from a child&#8217;s point of view, or questions about making things better for other children so that other children don&#8217;t have to deal with some of the legacy systems that we have that don&#8217;t work. I&#8217;ve been very interested in redesigning or challenging things that we think just have to be the way they are. Right? So one example I&#8217;ll give is we have an exam in Trinidad called the Common Entrance Exam. And that is actually one of the things that started my PhD research when I changed direction. I was like, &#8220;But why do we even have to have that exam?&#8221; And that&#8217;s why I started to do that research.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s something that continues to inspire me. How can we change the things that don&#8217;t work? And that&#8217;s also tied to my interest in futurism or Afrofuturism, because it&#8217;s how do we build new things, and new worlds, and new systems? How do we use design to do all of that? So I&#8217;m very interested in first having these critical conversations so that we could see clearly the things that don&#8217;t work, because sometimes we&#8217;ve been so brainwashed, that we don&#8217;t actually see the systems that don&#8217;t serve us. So everything that I do has to start off with that kind of conversation where we actually talk about what are the things that are wrong? But then we don&#8217;t just stay in that space of talking about the things that are wrong. We try to kind of move beyond that and take action through design. So I mean, that kind of social change also is something that motivates me as well. So I guess internally, it&#8217;s a curiosity. And then externally, it&#8217;s about changing systems, and fighting oppression, and social justice, and equity, and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you want to tell any designers out there listening who might be feeling a bit lost right now as to what to do with their future? And I&#8217;m asking this because I&#8217;ve had several people right into the show, particularly over the past two years, that maybe they just got out of design school through the pandemic. They got a job, but it&#8217;s not what they wanted, because they&#8217;re working from home, which is not really an ideal place for them to work, because this is their first job. And in some cases, it&#8217;s their first department.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And then there&#8217;s also people that have been working at places &#8230; I mean, we&#8217;re recording this right now in mid-June. But there&#8217;s been a huge slate of design and layoffs in the tech community over the past couple of weeks now. And some people have just ridden into the show just wanting some advice like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to do now with my future.&#8221; What advice would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not actually going to give people the job advice. I&#8217;m going to ask them about the non-job stuff. Right? Or my advice might be about the non-job. So one thing is about finding community or creating community. So because your job might be fantastic, but maybe you&#8217;re lonely in your job. But it&#8217;s like we need other people to go along this journey with us. Right? And they make the process more interesting, more exciting. They might validate us as we do the work. So like for me personally, when we created that Pluriversal Design group, that kind of changed again my outlook on the world. Because my group was also then feeding me and my work, you know? So for people who might be a little bit lost, I would definitely advise them to make sure that they&#8217;re not just doing this alone. Right? And find these groups, whether there&#8217;s a meetup group about the area of design that you&#8217;re interested in. Or groups probably exist or you can create the group, but you don&#8217;t find that community.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
And then the other bit of advice I would give people is figure out what your passion project is so that you aren&#8217;t only pouring your energy or your creative energy into the work that your employer is giving you. There must be a side creative project that is also feeding you. And maybe that&#8217;s the project that you&#8217;ll get known for later on. Right? Or maybe that&#8217;s going to be the thing that&#8217;s really going to eventually take over, and pay your bills, and whatnot. Right?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
But I think that for me professionally, those two things of making sure that they&#8217;ve always been communities of support, and then making sure that I&#8217;m doing work that is very, very fulfilling and satisfying. Even if that&#8217;s not the work that the employer&#8217;s giving me. I think that those two components of me, and my life, and my work have been really important. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d recommend to young designers. Find that stuff. And then the professional work hopefully will get better because of those two buckets.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
And then maybe a third bit of advice I would give to young designers is just about, well this is tied to the community thing. Networking sounds crass or crude, but make sure that you are yes, meeting people and telling them about their work so that you&#8217;re not invisible. I think that that&#8217;s also really important to be talking to new people often about the work that you do. And that&#8217;s going lead into other opportunities in the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you appreciate the most about your life right now?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
I like gardening. But actually, because I talk about design in a very abstract way now, because I teach about the design process and maybe helping people to see the design process. This means that I now see the design process as I&#8217;m gardening, or as I&#8217;m cooking, or as I&#8217;m dressing in the morning. And all of this, I do appreciate. I really do love choosing where I&#8217;m going to put that gladioli bulb in my garden, or choosing which salt I&#8217;m going to use as I cook dinner. I think there&#8217;s a real ordinariness in my life now that I&#8217;m happy for. I&#8217;m very appreciative for. Because I move a lot. I&#8217;ve had like a lot of chaos I suppose, or kind of been in constant flux. So what I really appreciate now is not being in flux like that, and just being able to relax and watch the plants grow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work would you love to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So I really want to continue doing the civic and social innovation work that I&#8217;m doing. I do some of this work with a foundation. And I&#8217;d love to do more of it with other cities. So what I do is I work with a city for about nine months, and we address some issue that the city has been interested in. Right? And I really enjoy that work. I love working with design students at the College of Design. But I also love working with people who are using design for the first time.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So in five years&#8217; time, I hope to be doing more either public engagement or research around Design for Social Innovation. And working with cities and close to, whether here in North Carolina or back in Trinidad or in the Caribbean. But I really like that kind of public design work that is done with community members and maybe local government representatives, and having people co-create solutions to the issues that they&#8217;re concerned about. So I hope to be doing that more of that in five years&#8217; time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work? Where can they find all of that online?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m on a lot of different platforms. But actually, LinkedIn is probably the best place for people to find me. They just have to look for my name, Lesley-Ann Noel. L-E-S-L-E-Y. That&#8217;s the thing. So if they want to know more about the general work that I&#8217;m doing, LinkedIn is the place. As an academic, I&#8217;ll repost some of the academic articles that I&#8217;ve written on ResearchGate. And then I&#8217;m also pretty active on Twitter actually. But if people Google me, they&#8217;ll find me on some platform that they can reach out to me. And I actually do respond to people generally. But LinkedIn is generally the easiest place to find me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well Lesley-Ann Noel, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. This has been a long time coming I think. I feel like you and I have intersected quite a few times over the past few years, so I&#8217;m really glad to finally have you on the show. Not just to of course share your story and your research, but I think to inspire. I mean, so much of what you&#8217;re doing is about pursuing your own curiosities and interests. And I think that&#8217;s something sometimes as designers, we tend to lose sight of. Especially if you&#8217;re like working in product, I hate to say that. But if you&#8217;re working in UX or product, it&#8217;s hard to kind of see the forest for the trees sometimes because what you&#8217;re doing is so laden into a specific thing, whereas it sounds like at least you&#8217;ve been able to indulge a lot of your creativity across many different passions throughout your career, which is just super inspiring to hear about. I&#8217;m sure of course, we&#8217;ll hear about you now for years and years to come. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel:</b><br>
Thank you so much for the invitation. And I hope that at least this conversation is able to help people see that they could kind of craft a bit of a path that works for them. Even when the path looks like it&#8217;s been clearly marked, they could kind of shake up the path a little bit and do a little bit of what they want hopefully. So thank you for the invitation.</p>

<p>I was introduced last year to Dr. Kenya Oduor through a Tech Circus panel we both participated in, and I&#8217;m really glad to have her on the show now so she can share her brilliance with you all! She is a human-centered designer, researcher, and strategist, and also runs her own consulting and staffing firm <a href="https://leangeeks.net/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Lean Geeks</a>. Very impressive!</p>
<p>We dove right in and talked about her increased focus at this stage of her career, and from there we discussed how Lean Geeks works and what she want to accomplish with the firm this year. She also spoke about growing up in Queens, studying to become a physical therapist, and then pivoting into human factors and user experience design. According to Kenya, getting comfortable with being uncomfortable is how you grow, and her path to where she is now certainly proves that!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Hi, Maurice. I am Dr. Kenya Oduor and I am a human-centered strategist researcher and designer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s on your mind? How&#8217;s 2022 been treating you?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
What&#8217;s on my mind. So, I think there&#8217;s a lot going on right now in terms of coming out on the other end of COVID and understanding what that means to the work that my team and I do with our clients. And how much of this remote model will change to a more hybrid or in-person model, again. I think in looking at some of the work that we do for our clients, I think there&#8217;s a huge opportunity for those conversations to shift to what new expectations do users, customers, clients have around their products and services. So, I&#8217;m really curious, not only to see what that means in terms of work opportunities, but also what insights do we gain from the work that we do in that regard.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I&#8217;m also finding that my career is gravitating towards more focused on me being a Black woman. And 10 years, 15 years ago, I would&#8217;ve never imagined that my identity would matter so much to the trajectory of opportunities and the voice that I present out to the world and that thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s interesting. Can you talk about that a little bit more?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Sure. So, I never forgot who I was, just because in the industry that I&#8217;m in, I might be the only or have been the only woman in the room, the only Black person in the room or both. And so, it&#8217;s always been a constant reminder for me because at certain points in my career, I didn&#8217;t necessarily feel like I was an integral part of the organization, in terms of feeling like I&#8217;m a fit within the culture because of my differences, or I didn&#8217;t feel like I was necessarily heard as much as some of my peers were. But what I&#8217;m finding now is that all of that experience and all of that maybe insecurity, imposter syndrome or angst that I was feeling throughout my career, I feel like that&#8217;s all coming to a place where I&#8217;m now using it to tell my story.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s becoming what I never realized would be a story that a lot of people, Black, white, or otherwise, want to hear in terms of just, we all have our unique differences. And knowing that and embracing those differences and using that to your advantage in terms of, especially in the design room, using that to your advantage in terms of bringing a different perspective.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious if that change has happened since the summer of 2020 because I feel like for a lot of Black folks who I&#8217;ve had on the show&#8230; well, all the Black folks. I&#8217;ve only had Black folks on the show. Let me be clear about that. But I think every person I&#8217;ve had on has said since that summer, there&#8217;s been a shift.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Absolutely. I am more comfortable in the skin that I&#8217;m in and I am unapologetic about. And I&#8217;ve heard that in a lot of circles that I&#8217;m in, being unapologetically Black. And just recognizing that if you are uncomfortable with my identity and who I am, then that&#8217;s not my problem, that&#8217;s yours. I don&#8217;t have to work to make you feel more comfortable. I have to be me and recognize that. And especially, as a business owner, I recognize that clients that want to do business with me and my company have to be comfortable with who I am and that sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of your business, let&#8217;s talk about Lean Geeks. This is your design agency. Where did that name come from?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, the name came from, as a researcher by training and coming from the academic world and having a PhD in human subject research and that sort of thing, I recognize that throughout my career, a lot of times I would get the poo-poo to ideas of &#8220;let&#8217;s go and validate stuff.&#8221; I would get a lot of resistance where the immediate response that people would go to is, &#8220;It&#8217;s going to take too long. It&#8217;s going to be too complex. We don&#8217;t have time for that. We didn&#8217;t bank in that, that time to do those things.&#8221; So, I recognize that being able to position research around being lean research and scrappy where necessary is really, really important in terms of getting buy-in.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And the geek part comes from just as human factors professionals. I&#8217;m not the only one that subscribes to this, but what I found is a lot of my colleagues, we always have swapped stories about whenever we take on a project, we have to go really deep in understanding a new domain or a new type of industry and user within that industry. And so, we almost geek out in the things that we learn about medicine or what we learn about different industries that might be very different than what we would play in otherwise, banking and that kind of thing. So, it&#8217;s always interesting to think about all of those different industries and how you have to go deep in order to be effective in creating solutions or redesigns for services in those different fields.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, your agency offers both consulting and staffing services to clients and you have what you call a human-centered approach. Tell me about your process.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Absolutely. So, the ideal, let me tell you about the ideal because this is what really excites me. When we have a client come to us and they&#8217;re in this phase of discovery where they have certain assumptions or certain hypotheses around what they could do or what their product could do differently. And so, having the opportunity to help define and execute on some research that validates their ideas, we usually provide them with more clarity on essentially what are the requirements for their solution.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And so, having the opportunity to do that and informing the experience design and having data to support our design approach is really, really, to me really exciting. Because it&#8217;s not one of those things where you or I on the team are going off of what we think is the right experience or approach. We&#8217;re using some of our experience to understand what is the best design, but we&#8217;re more so using data to validate the person&#8217;s ability to get something done. Okay? And in those types of projects, we help our client get to the point of sprint zero or basically giving them the different assets that are necessary to feed development and the engineering effort.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And the really ideal experience is when they then allow us to partner with them from a contractor perspective and having maybe an interaction designer or a strategist join their team as a contractor. So then, there&#8217;s continuity from the work that we did. So, it&#8217;s not as if we&#8217;re just throwing research and wire frames over the fence, we&#8217;re actually continuing on with their team. And that allows those individuals that did the research to stay connected to the project and help to still continue and inform the direction that things go in. And for me, if every project started and continued in that fashion, my life would be golden at that point. If that was the model that we could always follow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
To that end, it sounds like the best types of clients then for you to have are ones that possibly would have you all on retainer, because it sounds like the work that you&#8217;re doing continues along a timeline. You&#8217;re not just going in doing one thing and then that&#8217;s the end of the project.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I wish that we were on retainer. Typically, it&#8217;s the upfront research and the deliverables around requirements, priority, wire frames. All of that stuff is usually time boxed and it&#8217;s a fixed cost effort. Over my career, I think, being in a practitioner role and in a leadership role, I&#8217;ve gotten really good at being able to estimate how long an effort should take. So, those are usually time-boxed. And then when you talk about the contractors, those are typically your standard contractor on your team. Somebody that&#8217;s there six months and then they&#8217;re converted to a full timer or they&#8217;re on the project for two years as a contractor. So, those are typically, someone who has a badge and a computer from your company and they submit timesheets to our company. And we pay payroll and that sort of thing, benefits and all that sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds that&#8217;s where the lean part kicks in, at least in terms of being able to estimate the time pretty, pretty accurately.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Absolutely. The one thing that I&#8217;ve not necessarily learned, but has become really clear over the last few years, is that in any project recruitment is the longest [inaudible 00:12:55]. That&#8217;s going to be the hardest part of a project. And it&#8217;s going to take the longest is to recruit panelists to use for interviews, qualitative interviews, or to observe, or to have them do usability testing and that sort of thing. Recruitment is probably the hardest part of what we do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does an average day look for you with Lean Geeks?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
It typically, like most other people, getting up and checking your emails and &#8220;What do I need to do today?&#8221; It&#8217;s engaging with, I don&#8217;t want to say, prospects, because I don&#8217;t look at engagement with potential clients. I don&#8217;t look at them as prospects. I want to get the opportunity to talk to them. &#8220;Let me hear about what&#8217;s going on in your organization. What are your biggest struggles? What keeps you up at night?&#8221; So, having or scheduling conversations with different people is a lot of what I do.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I am focused on business development and closing the sale. So, I&#8217;m not so much doing the research work anymore or the design work as per se, but I try to bring in those projects. And I stay involved from the extent of knowing what&#8217;s going on, so that might also be a part of my day is checking in with the team to see how are things progressing. &#8220;Show me where you are. Maybe I have ideas or questions that help you to expand what you&#8217;re thinking is around a particular problem.&#8221; So, I also spend a portion of my day doing that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And I&#8217;ve had to get comfortable over the last year or more comfortable with marketing. So, just thinking about strategically, what is my brand and what is my voice and what do I want to put out there? And this goes back to my identity, becoming so much more of what I present to the world where historically that wasn&#8217;t necessarily something that I put as much importance in or on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now for those out there who may not have heard of human-centered design. Again, we talked about how you have this human-centered approach. Can you talk about what it is and why it&#8217;s important?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Absolutely. So, human-centered design is essentially, I don&#8217;t want to say putting the human first, it&#8217;s informing your approach to a solution with information around your user and their motivation, their needs, what are their goals in terms of interacting with your product or service. And most importantly, the most important part is context. And I teach a human computer interaction class and my students are software engineering students. And whenever they ask questions, I always get them to unpack their understanding of the context.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Because context really, really impacts our ability to assume what is someone thinking in a particular moment. What are the environmental factors that are outside of their control that they have to consider in using your product? When you think about your product, what features or capabilities need to be in the forefront because of that context? So, that to me is what human-centered design is all about is allowing someone or giving someone the tools that they need to get something done and to consider their motivation and their context in that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you to really accomplish with your business this year?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I really want to get to a place where obviously closing more business. Any business owner wants to continue to grow, so I always want to continue to grow in my business. I want to get connected to more designers and researchers that are in a freelance situation because I&#8217;m always looking for talent. And as you know right now, the market is really hot. So, either we&#8217;ve lost team members or we&#8217;re constantly looking for new ones and I think I do a pretty good job of spotting talent, but in most cases they&#8217;re already either fully committed or not available or whatever it might be at that particular time. So, that&#8217;s a huge goal of mine in 2022 is to build up our network in that regard and across the country, ideally. I have some little pet projects that I&#8217;m working on with colleagues and I would love to see some of those pet projects shape up a little bit more and for us to move from idea to concept.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit, because I want to get more into your background and learn more about really how you came about all of this. So, let&#8217;s start from the beginning here. Talk to me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and I was really young before I started school, we moved to Queens, New York. So, I grew up in Queens. Very different from Pittsburgh and it was very different going back and forth during the summers and holidays. And so, I grew up around a lot of people who might have been first generation Americans. And it was to me, I think that is what shapes my belief that culture and context have so much to do as inputs to any solution because I just remember being around people that were so different, but had similar goals.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Everybody wanted the best for their children. Everybody wanted to work hard and earn a living and that kind of thing. So, I knew that there was a common thread amongst the culture of the people that I was around. But I knew that, when I went into different people&#8217;s homes, the way they did things and the languages and all those sorts of things were different. So, I look back and when I talk to some of my friends growing up, we always talk about how unique our situation was. And we didn&#8217;t realize it until now that we&#8217;re adults living in different parts of the country.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s so interesting that hindsight, looking back and you don&#8217;t think about it at that time when you&#8217;re a kid, probably not even when you&#8217;re a teenager or a young adult. But I find the older I get, when I look back at how I grew up and how I first got into tech and everything like that. It&#8217;s abnormal for the time I think, but I didn&#8217;t even think about it because essentially at the time when I was doing this stuff, it just all felt like play. It just felt toys that I was working with, not actual computers. Teaching myself a language, that kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yeah. And I think that&#8217;s the beauty of, I&#8217;m the parent that, &#8220;Oh, I want them to do the things they enjoy and double down on the ones that they&#8217;re passionate about.&#8221; But I always have to tell myself that you have to also remind yourself and your kids that exposure to as many different things as possible really open your eyes to things you didn&#8217;t even know existed. And like you were talking about, the things that you did with computers early on, you would&#8217;ve never thought about the impact they would have on your career now is just we, as people, have to always look beyond what we&#8217;re comfortable with. Look at the beauty of art and how that translates into the beauty of what you can create. And just being able to translate some of what we see and experience into the work that we do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Did you have a lot of exposure to design or tech as you were growing up?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yeah. So, my parents coming from a small or from small towns in and around Pittsburgh, their intention in moving to New York was to be around culture and that kind of thing. So, my parents used to drag me to the theater when I was younger and I was always, &#8220;Ugh, we have to get dressed up and go to the theater.&#8221; And I used to go to the Museum of Modern Art or Guggenheim Museum. And I used to always look at it like such a chore, because it was maybe different than what my friends were doing or my friends didn&#8217;t go with me.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
But as an adult now, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, my goodness.&#8221; I thank them all the time because all of those different experiences and that exposure had so much to do with, my mother used to do art projects and she would get wood and carve it and then do stamping on fabric. And I look at all those experiences and say that creativity and just seeing different types of creativity, they remind you that there&#8217;s so much out there that can apply to what we see, what we do, what we experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, when it was time for you to go to college, you went to the university of Maryland. Tell me about what your time was like there.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Too much fun. That&#8217;s why I was on a five-year plan. I knew when I was in high school that I wanted to go away to college. I didn&#8217;t want to stay in New York, surprisingly. As much as New York is a wonderful place, it&#8217;s exhausting. And I was talking to somebody else from New York the other day and we were saying how until you leave New York, you don&#8217;t realize how much life there is outside of New York because it takes so much out of you to do everything.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, I went to Maryland and I struggled with figuring out what do I want to do or what do I want to be? I started out as an engineering major. Then I got interested in psychology and people. And then I thought I wanted to be a physical therapist. So, I ended up having to do an extra year because I thought I was going to be a physical therapist and I had to do additional classes. But my time at Maryland was my awakening to experience Black culture more than when I was just going to see my family. Coming from Queens and then going to Maryland, I felt like my identity as a Black woman, I was able to see other people like myself, that I was actually around all the time and not just family that I&#8217;m going to see during a holiday.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, that for me was really interesting and exciting. And I just knew at that point that I wanted&#8230; I used to get the itch to say that one day I was going to start a business. What that was going to be, who knows. But I used to say to myself that I wanted to create something one day. So, I enjoyed Maryland, but obviously not enough to stay there because I&#8217;m in North Carolina now. But yeah, I enjoyed my time at Maryland.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One thing that I remember really, again, another hindsight thing that I remember is just how many different types of Black people I met at college. I&#8217;m from the country-country. Everybody is they&#8217;re Southern. You really don&#8217;t see other types of people unless it&#8217;s maybe on television or something like that. And I remember being at Morehouse here in Atlanta and meeting Caribbean people for the first time that wasn&#8217;t via Caribbean rhythms on BET. Actually meeting people from the Caribbean. Meeting people from other parts of the country and stuff. And realizing how much that really shaped my Black experience, but just the diversity of what is considered the Black experience.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
It&#8217;s true. And so the difference, I think&#8230; I have a cousin, actually, a cousin by marriage, who&#8217;s from Atlanta, born and raised. And I just found out recently that he did not see non-Black people until he went to college. And that blows my mind because for me, you see Atlanta obviously as a metropolis or a metropolitan area. And I think about the fact that to me, that&#8217;s so fascinating in the sense that you had exposure, you had the means and the capability to go to college and in your lived experience, you never saw people that were not Black. That tells me that the upbringing and the community had was one that helped you to get to where you needed to be in order to get to that next level, which I love.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And then I think about the flip side of it with my experience in growing up in Queens, I used to almost feel, I was one of the few people that were not white, whose family had several generations that went back in terms of being in the US. So, I almost felt like, I felt like the outsider because I was the one whose family had been slaves. And to have that connection to this country, but to have no one else around you that has that connection to this country, I felt like the outsider.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. And I think going to Maryland is where I experienced more of my people who were like me, descendants of slaves. And so, I could relate to them in a different way than I could my people in Queens.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, you were enjoying your time at University of Maryland, soaking in that good Black experience. What was your early career like after you graduated? What was next for you?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Oh, my gosh. Yeah. So, like I mentioned, I thought I was going to be a physical therapist, so I got a job even before I finished school. I got a job at a nonprofit that worked with special needs children as a physical therapy aide. And the place that I worked was in the hood, in Southeast DC. And I&#8217;ll never forget that that was probably my first immersive experience into seeing and experiencing, I&#8217;m not going to say we all, but I have the experience of growing up and having family that lives in public housing or we had to eat government cheese and all that stuff.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I had had that experience, but this was my first time really experiencing true poverty and seeing children who were probably in a situation that when they left school, they did not get food. They didn&#8217;t get their diapers changed. They came to school the next day with the same diaper on. So, that experience really opened my eyes to just the divide that existed in this country and the unfortunate result of real poverty that I&#8217;d never experienced, even if I was poor or with poor members. So it really, really became an emotional, not only was it hard to do therapy with special needs children, who born with fetal alcohol syndrome or vitamin K deficiency. Things that you would think are preventable.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
But it was just the emotional part of just seeing that even when they went home, there was no joy necessarily for some of them. That was hard. That was hard. So, it made me revisit only wanting to be there, but also, did I want to consider a different career?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is that when you decided to go back to school after that?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yes. So, I would come home from work in the evenings and it&#8217;s just, so when I went to college, the email just came out the last semester before I graduated. So, me working on a computer was word processing and that kind of thing. And so, the internet was just starting to become popular when I would come home, for me, at least. It might have been for other people, but not for me. So, I would come home from work and get on the internet and start to do my search and look at different fields. And then I found Human Factor Psychology that way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And what about that appeal to you?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Because I don&#8217;t know if you remember me mentioning that I started out undergrad as an engineering major, so I was very interested in engineering. I was interested in designing things and creating things that would impact people and their lives. And I loved interacting with people. So, Human Factor Psychology was the intersection of those things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so, you attended North Carolina state studying this. This is where you got your master&#8217;s and then eventually, your PhD in Human Factors, Ergonomics/Experimental Psychology.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember from that time, whenever anyone talked about ergonomics or at least maybe in the context that I heard. It always was about office furniture like an ergonomic mouse, an ergonomic chair, an ergonomic desk. But of course, ergonomics is more than just that. Correct?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
It is. And it&#8217;s funny because when I first came to North Carolina State, I thought that was going to be more of my major and that my minor would involve psychology. But when I got here, I got to know more about the psychology program and I flipped it. And I was like, &#8220;No, I really. I enjoy more of the experimental and cognitive psychology and the physical is also a part of your context in your environment.&#8221; So, that was to a lesser extent, my areas of interest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now prior to founding Lean Geeks, I know that you worked for a long time at two companies, but you also alluded that you&#8217;ve worked for other places as well. But you worked at IBM for seven years, which people know for big tech and you worked at LexisNexis for eight years, which I know is a service that a lot of lawyers use, I believe, for background checks and things like that. But with both of these work experiences, you were focusing on user experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not asking you to necessarily give the years, but I&#8217;m curious on during that time, how did you notice user experience in the design community? Was it something that a lot of people were latching onto or how did you see it at that time?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, IBM was my first foray in the whole user experience. True user experience realm in terms of, so I shouldn&#8217;t say that. I take that back because the definition of user experience for so many people is something different than what some of us know or understand it to be. When I started out, it was human-centered design and this was in consulting and then IBM. And it started with discovery of who&#8217;s your user, what is their context and what is their need or motivation. And so, at that time, I think IBM was one of the companies that was in the forefront in terms of doing the work to constantly iterate and validate on ideas or concepts.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And as time went on, what I saw was more of an evolution towards design, more of UX than being termed design or focusing on design less about the validation or the discovery aspect of things. Probably midway in my career is when I started to see people who would talk about stumbling into a career in UX, or they might have been painters or people who did visual arts or, industrial design and that their interests. And of course there were people earlier than that time, but in terms of my experiences in the software world, that&#8217;s when I started to see more people coming from the more design community. More of the design community that were playing in the software space. But my early experiences were primarily people who were coming out of the human center design space.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting. How are those IBM and LexisNexis experiences, how were they from each other?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I was just talking to someone earlier today, a student that is considering a transition into UX and I was explaining to her that one environment was very structured and the other was very unstructured. And so, when you talk about structured versus unstructured environments, it&#8217;s what rigor do they have in place and how mature are they from a user experience perspective? Do they have the right people in the organization and do they have a design system and that kind of thing, a process? Do they have validation baked into their framework sorts of things?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, one was very different than the other in that regard. And some people thrive better in one versus the other. But I realized in my career, I made an intentional decision to shift from one to the other because I wanted to see and to build up my own toolkit of navigating two different environments. And I think that&#8217;s helped me in the consulting world, because I&#8217;m able to spot where an organization&#8217;s mature is and how to interact with the people in the companies that we work with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so, what was the impetus behind you starting your own company? You&#8217;ve put in now 15 years in this industry, working as a user experience professional with human-centered design research. What made you say I&#8217;m going to start my own thing now?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, it had been probably more than 15 years at that point that I was saying to myself, I was getting that itch of wanting to spread my wings and go somewhere new. And I explained it or I likened it one day to someone that every day I walked into the office, I felt like I was a caged bird that had to get in the cage. And then every day at the end of the day, I felt like I was stepping out of the cage. And so, I felt like I was being constrained by the four walls of industry. And I didn&#8217;t feel like part of that came from presenting ideas that didn&#8217;t necessarily align in terms of &#8220;it&#8217;s not your job&#8221; kind of thing or &#8220;we&#8217;re not there yet,&#8221; that kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, it got frustrating and I said to myself, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m either going to move on to a new company and take on a similar type of role. My highest level of evangelism and hiring and all that stuff and firing.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well, do I want to do that? And do I want to go through that same climbing the ladder.&#8221; And honestly, I didn&#8217;t want to and I felt that it had almost been 20 years at that point that I was doing this work. And so, I was like, &#8220;You know what? It&#8217;s time for me to spread my wings and try something new and take the show on the road.&#8221; And I&#8217;ve built a pretty good network over those years, so why not tap into that network and see what happens?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You stepped out on faith and here you are.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I stepped out on faith and I have to tell you that statement right there is the only thing that has kept me going is stepping out every day. When you talk about my day-to-day, every day is stepping out on faith and it&#8217;s a faith walk and it&#8217;s constantly reminding yourself that just because you don&#8217;t know something today or it&#8217;s an unknown or it&#8217;s uncomfortable, you got to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. And always know that you have to do the work to figure stuff out, even if you don&#8217;t know it today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Who are some of the mentors that have helped you to get to this place now in your career?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I always had formal mentors when I was at places like IBM. I had people who I leaned on, who were able to help guide me in that way. But as I got further into my career, I found that I didn&#8217;t have as many mentors or the people that I sought out as mentors weren&#8217;t necessarily either in my discipline or they just didn&#8217;t have the bandwidth to take on additional mentors. I started to do a lot in terms of coaching and finding other resources.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting. I would imagine and I&#8217;ve talked about this with other like PhD level people that I&#8217;ve had on the show is like it&#8217;s lonely at the top. Once you get to that level of education and you get to that point in your career, you look around and it&#8217;s just you in a way.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. And it&#8217;s interesting because I would see people and I would see people who were in a position of running their own company or who were in a certain type of leadership role. And I would look at them and say to myself, &#8220;I aspire to be there.&#8221; And what I found in a lot of cases was that, they were and it was no slight on their part in any way. They would just say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have the bandwidth to take on the responsibility of being a mentor.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, I would get whatever opportunity I could to connect with them and then figure out who do I want to be when I grow up and what does that look like. And, and I think the part that&#8217;s most important for anyone that&#8217;s exploring that thing is to always, always, always connect with people and ask questions and invest in yourself. That&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve recognized I have to do a lot of.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you appreciate the most about your life right now?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
When you meet people and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, I hate my job&#8221; or &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so unhappy,&#8221; or &#8220;My kids are stressing me out,&#8221; just have life stressors. What I&#8217;m really happy about my life is that I&#8217;m fortunate to be in a situation where life is hard. I work really hard, but the joy that my family and my career and my company, the joy that I get from those things mean so much to me. And I feel like I&#8217;m so fortunate. Even if things are hard, I&#8217;m so fortunate to have the ability to do these things at this point in my life.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And to not have the grumbling. Whenever I work with colleagues or whenever I talk to colleagues or I work with a client, it&#8217;s so refreshing to know that whatever drama I get pulled into for work projects. As soon as I hang up the phone, leave the meeting or whatever it is, I don&#8217;t take any of it home like I used to when I worked in-house.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What haven&#8217;t you done yet that you want to do? It could be in life. It can be through your business. What&#8217;s the dream project?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, I definitely want to travel more now, especially after COVID. I want to travel more, but more importantly, I have colleagues that I&#8217;m working on side projects with and we&#8217;ve been talking about them. And some of them were things are starting to get off the ground, but I would really love to see some of those things come to pass in terms of us being able to realize and to see things happen.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I always, I&#8217;m very much a visionary. So, I put out there if you have a vision board or they say do visualization of what you want to do or where you want to be. And I see myself creating something that is impactful. So, just doing project work or engaging clients around project work is one facet of my interest. I also have ideas that I feel like I need to bring to life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of, this traveling now, you and I have both spoken on a couple of panels now. Are you starting to see a return to in-person events? Are you getting invited to speak out at any conferences?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yes. I have a speaking engagement next month in the Baltimore area. I have a few, I want to say late summer or early fall. So, I do realize that things are starting to open up. I actually spoke on a panel recently. So, I&#8217;m excited to see and to interact with people in-person, because I feel like the connections. And I had a conversation with someone that I met in-person after meeting them over or talking to them over Zoom a number of times. You really don&#8217;t get the value of connecting with someone the way that you do when you meet that individual in-person first and then transition to virtual versus the other way around. Because it&#8217;s like you make that connection with people face-to-face that you can&#8217;t make over a screen. So, I&#8217;m looking forward to that again.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I just got my first in-person conference invite in a while. I just got it a couple of days ago. So, I&#8217;m leaking it early by saying it on the podcast, but I&#8217;ll be at Design Thinkers in Toronto in October, which is cool. Because I&#8217;ve always wanted to visit Toronto and to now go and do my first in-person conference thing really since&#8230; gosh, I think the last time I did one was in maybe 2019, I think, probably 2019. Wow.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Wow, so it&#8217;s time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s time.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:41:49].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve done a ton of virtual things, so it&#8217;s time to get back on a stage. So, I&#8217;m excited about that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s time, yes. Well, I can tell you that since COVID my whole dress and shoe game is different, so all about-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, really?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I&#8217;m all about comfort now. So, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;If you say I was going to put on heels and all that, forget about it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to anyone that&#8217;s been listening to all of this and they want to follow in your footsteps? What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, I would tell them that don&#8217;t ever look at any experience that you have as a waste of your time or that it&#8217;s in vain. From the time I first moved, when I first moved to North Carolina and I was an administrative assistant in an engineering firm to the jobs that I&#8217;ve had that have nothing to do with what I&#8217;m doing today, each one of those experiences gave me a perspective on interacting with people. Gave me a perspective on myself, what I&#8217;m good at, what I&#8217;m not good at, where my strengths are.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, every experience that you have in life and know that they all build upon one another, even if they&#8217;re not in the same field. And always walk away from bad experiences with the ability to say, &#8220;What did I learn from it?&#8221; Especially when you work with people that get on your nerves or you can&#8217;t stand, figure out what it is you can learn from that. And getting comfortable with being uncomfortable is another thing.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
The only way we grow is by going through some change and I found that I can procrastinate on the things I don&#8217;t want to be bothered with or do. But when I look back, sometimes I delay the things that really were in my mind overwhelming, but once I got into them, they weren&#8217;t. So, don&#8217;t put off for tomorrow what you can do today. And know that you don&#8217;t know if you can do something unless you try. That&#8217;s the way I see it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s the legacy that you want to leave behind? Where do you see yourself say in the next five years or so? What work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, in the next five years or so, I realize in my whole marketing effort that honing in on my brand, my personal brand is something that before I used to, I was always the little young, skinny one in the crew throughout my life. So, I was always quiet and in the background and the observer. So, I never really thought that my brand or who I am or what I have to say was necessarily that impactful or important. But as I get older and I have platforms to do that, I realize, &#8220;Wow, I do have things to say that people are listening to.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And so, I think in the next five years, continuing to sharpen my brand and my voice are a big part of my focus and that I want to be able to use my skills around being an idea generator, being a connector, helping people to progress ideas. I like to see others, I thrive by seeing others thrive. So, being able to utilize that capability and everything that I do would be just the most awesome thing ever for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good question. So, definitely connect on LinkedIn, Kenya Oduor, PhD. Last name is O-D-U-O-R. I wish I would have kept my maiden name if I knew my last name was going to be so hard. Check out the web company website leangeeks.net, L-E-A-N-G-E-E-K-S dot-net. And I think LinkedIn is the best place to start because from there, you can get to YouTube video thing. You can get my contact information.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And I just like to connect with people and like I said, I&#8217;m trying to build up my network of folks, especially like us designers and creators and researchers that look like us are important for me to connect with at this point in my career. Especially those that I don&#8217;t know now or yet. Yeah. Keep in touch.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Dr. Kenya Oduor, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. One, of course, I think just thank you for telling us about your story. But also about putting forth, this really powerful message about look at your experiences and see what you can gain out of them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
My mom used to tell me when I was younger, especially early on in my career before I started becoming a designer, sometimes you have to do the things that you don&#8217;t want to do, so you can do the things that you want to do or something like that. I might be screwing up that whole thing.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Amen. No, but that to me, I get it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s true. Sometimes you have to put the time in, you have to see what you can gain from those experiences, and then use those to become a better person. And certainly, I think from what you&#8217;ve shown in this interview and then even with what you&#8217;re doing through Lean Geeks, you&#8217;re definitely making that happen. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Thank you so much for having me, Maurice. And continued success to you as well.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re halfway through the year! Summer&#8217;s here, and I thought it would be a great time to feature an extraordinary young designer whose work I recently discovered &#8212; Keisha Okafor. Her work is brimming with energy and vibrancy and joy &#8212; feelings we all could use a bit more of these days.</p>
<p>We start off talking about freelance design, and Keisha told a bit about how she helped <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rERRIna8dA" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">make one of the features Google Doodles for Black History Month 2021</a>. Keisha also spoke on her signature design style, talked about one of her dream projects, and gave some great advice on being an illustrator. Keep an eye out for Keisha &#8212; I think we&#8217;ll definitely see more of her work in the future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
My name is Keisha Okafor. I&#8217;m a freelance illustrator. And I would say that my work I&#8217;ve been using depicts joy and celebrates people. I really like to use bright colors and bold patterns.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s the year been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been going pretty great. I actually just went freelance full time. So that&#8217;s the thing. But before that, I&#8217;ve been working full time in design as a production designer, actually for print and also doing project management. Ironically, I was managing all the print projects I was doing. So kind of like a one-woman show. So all of that was very technical and like sending client emails. And then out of work, I was doing illustrations and drawing and working with my freelance clients. So it&#8217;s nice to have more time this time, but honestly, it&#8217;s been going pretty well. I mean, I know the whole pandemic is still happening. In my mind, it&#8217;s not even close to being over, but as a very, very heavy introvert, my day-to-day isn&#8217;t really that different, I be inside. So I&#8217;m still watching Anime, still playing video games. Yeah. Outside of work is pretty normal to me because I wouldn&#8217;t be outside anyway.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Wow. So yeah, you just went freelance. That&#8217;s a kind of scary thing to do to make that leap of faith. I mean, did you feel like you were prepared for it when you did it?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. I definitely did, which is surprising because years ago, would have been terrified, but I did a lot of planning, I watched so many seminars and workshops about going freelance, like what do you need to have in place before you do that? And I also saw enough clients coming in and projects coming in to where I believed like this is going to keep happening. I&#8217;m not just a Juneteenth, Martin Luther King Day illustrator. I can do this 365. So once I saw that and all the other planning I&#8217;ve been doing for the past several months, I wasn&#8217;t as scared as I expected to be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s good. That&#8217;s good. I mean, oftentimes, we&#8217;ll have the designers that are here on the show that either are freelancing or they&#8217;re thinking about going freelance, and making that leap can often be really scary. I mean, you said that you had some preparations in place, which is good. I mean, to know that you can step out there and have at least some sort of a foundation, so you&#8217;re not necessarily going at it alone, but you have, it sounds like you had some major things already planned out before you made the jump, like clients.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. I also had savings. That was like my main thing. I didn&#8217;t want to jump with like $25 in my account. So with all the freelance money I&#8217;ve been getting, luckily because I had the full-time job, I was able to save all of that pretty much by pretending that I didn&#8217;t have it. I was tricking my mind, like, don&#8217;t spend this, this is for your future. Like, don&#8217;t wild out and buy stuff, but I&#8217;m also not naturally a big spender. My biggest splurge last year was getting Netflix, the two accounts. Yeah. I mean, I bought video games, but I would&#8217;ve done that anyway, but yeah, I got Netflix. So that&#8217;s like an idea of something I think about, a purchase that I would think about for a while before doing so. Was able to save all that money to have bought a year&#8217;s worth just in case nothing happened, which I don&#8217;t believe that was going to happen, but just in case, I had enough money to live off of that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a very smart move.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Thanks. I take risks, but it&#8217;s very calculated because I get very scared, just the idea of going freelance is so scary. So I just wanted to make sure I have things set in place, I thought it through that I&#8217;ll be good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What made you decide to go freelance? You said you were working as part-time gig, did something happen or did you just feel like it was just time to go?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Honestly, just in general, the jobs I&#8217;ve had, it was a full-time job too. Boy, was I tired anyway. It was just like, no matter what job I had, it ended up being rinky-dink. And by rinky-dink, I mean, no matter how confident I am, no matter how competent I am at the job, no matter how much work I do, how fast I go, I&#8217;m still getting treated like I&#8217;m entry-level or like the level of a recent graduate in my pay, in how I&#8217;m talked to when I ask questions. And I&#8217;m just getting tired of that. And because I saw that doing freelance wasn&#8217;t as intimidating as I thought, I was just like, let me better myself and make sure that I&#8217;m handling that side for myself, that I get to advocate for myself and also determine what I&#8217;m worth.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That is a big reason why I ended up going freelance back in 2008, the company that I was working for was treating me in that same way, like I felt like I was being undermined or belittled or patronized too, even though I&#8217;ve got the skills to be there and I&#8217;m cranking out top quality work, you still feel like you&#8217;re almost treated like a child.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yes. Oh my gosh. Yeah. This past job, the work I was doing, it took four people to do before I got there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. And they&#8217;re not a startup company. They&#8217;ve been around for many years over a decade. And even taking on that work, they still saw me as a rookie. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Really after all of this?&#8221; So I could see that that wasn&#8217;t really going to change anytime soon. They would give me compliments, but I&#8217;m like, &#8220;But my pay isn&#8217;t changing.&#8221; And when I say things and give suggestions, it&#8217;s just going over the head and out the window. So I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;All right, I see where this is going. I&#8217;m out.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What does a typical day look like for you right now? I know you just started freelancing, but have you started getting into a good rhythm?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. Generally, I have a Trello account, where I have all my freelance projects that I&#8217;m working on right now and just different to-do lists, broken down to all the small steps, just so I can see overall what I need to work on. So if there are any priorities or upcoming deadlines, I&#8217;ll then write a list, a to-do list of like at least three things I want to get done during the day, like I want to finish this sketch or I want to finish this piece, send this email to the client, things like that. I usually start my day at around 10 o&#8217;clock. I am not a morning person at all. Also, I have a cat who only wants to be pet in the middle of the night. So from like 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM, she&#8217;s crawling on my chest, like, &#8220;Pet me, pet me.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Let me sleep.&#8221; That&#8217;s why I start at 10:00 to get back some of that sleep I lost.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
But yeah, I usually start eating cereal, see if I have any emails. I don&#8217;t really get too many emails, but I&#8217;m also someone who like, I get through them. So I usually only have like three tops. And then I just start the work I&#8217;m doing. And if, and then I just keep reviewing that Trello list with my deadlines and checking things off. And if I&#8217;m like at the right pace, because I&#8217;m trying to pace myself doing a little each day to make sure I hit the deadlines early, instead of like binge doing it all in one day. So once I hit that pace for the day, if I&#8217;m done, then I&#8217;ll take a break and rest for the day. Yeah. That&#8217;s generally how it&#8217;s been going so far.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. The best thing about freelancing is really setting your own schedule and then no one can tell you to change it. It&#8217;s completely up to you. So if you want to stay in till 10:00 AM, till noon, you can do that. No problem.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. It still feels like, I feel like a kid beginning summer break, but then I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Keisha, you&#8217;re an adult.&#8221; Make sure you get stuff done, which I always do. But waking up at 10 o&#8217;clock and being like, &#8220;Well, time to get this started.&#8221; That still feels wild to me. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I get to do this. I planned for this and it&#8217;s happening.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Now, I first heard about you this year from your work you did for YouTube&#8217;s Black History Month campaign. I think they did four different illustrators and artists for each of the four weeks in February. Can you talk about that? How did you become a part of that project?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah, that still blows my mind. This was like maybe a week before Christmas. I randomly get this email saying, &#8220;Hey, Keisha, I work with YouTube. Want to work on this project about Black Creativity for Black History Month?&#8221; I immediately thought it was a scam. And then I googled everyone that he mentioned just to make sure kind of just like, who are you? What the heck? His email didn&#8217;t say @youtube.com. So I was just like, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know about this. Let me just double check.&#8221; But I googled everyone and then their LinkedIn pages were like, they&#8217;re designer at Google, engineer at Google. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, okay. So he was serious.&#8221; So I immediately said, &#8220;Yeah, I am available to do this. Are you kidding me?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. And then probably a week or so later, I met with like a small design team at the YouTube. And they were just telling me about the initiative that they had and they want to work for artists celebrating History Month and wanted to have all the artists make art around black creativity. And that was it. They were like, &#8220;You can make that whatever you want it to be, but it just needs to be around black creativity.&#8221; And they gave some keywords, like forward-thinking, hopeful, bright, like that. Literally, those were the keywords they gave. So I pretty much just took that and ran with it. But also in the back of my mind, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay. Okay, Keisha, this is YouTube. You got to show up, you got to show out. So like, do it, do the thing.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
So initially, I was planning on doing portraits of women who in math and science from the past just to celebrate them. But then they wanted something, when they said forward-thinking, that&#8217;s why they gave me the idea of having children in there, like giving like a hopeful idea instead of looking to the past, wanting people to look to the future as well. And I was the one who chose math and science, just because normally when you think of creativity, I usually think of a paintbrush, like dancing and music.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
And they also mentioned that they didn&#8217;t want to hit the normal black stereotypes. So like a boombox and people doing break dance. They want it to steer away from that. So I personally like math. I still, even at my big age, I watch PBS Kids shows about math and science. So I figured that would be a fun thing to do, a fun thing to go around. And that&#8217;s in that forward thinking idea, it was me having like women in STEM, showing young girls the magic in front of it. So that&#8217;s where the idea came based on their feedback. That&#8217;s how that idea came to pass.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. And once they approved it, I was just going with it. The main critique was at first, I made everyone dark skin and almost the same tone. And they were like, &#8220;Oh, can you give it some variety?&#8221; I go, &#8220;Oh yeah, no problem.&#8221; And then they wanted me to use like, I was being very literal at first. So like the sky is blue, rockets are gray. And they were like, &#8220;Can you use like some of the colors that you use? Like the ones that you use.&#8221; And I was just like, &#8220;Oh, okay. So you actually want me to put my spin on it.&#8221; I was putting all these rules, adding all these rules to myself. This has to be very literal. If I&#8217;m drawing math, it needs to look like math. But once they said that, then that&#8217;s when I went crazy with the colors, like, &#8220;This guy could be pink and yellow and purple.&#8221; So yeah. Then I added my own spin to that. And that&#8217;s pretty much how it turned out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I have to say it looks amazing. And for people that haven&#8217;t seen it, we&#8217;ll make sure to put a link to it in the show notes so you can definitely check it out. I mean, I get that kind of forward feeling, that forward-thinking notion from that. It&#8217;s interesting enough, I had discovered an organization, I think they either left a comment or I saw it somewhere else on the web, but because your piece was centered around STEM, I had discovered this group called Black Girl MATHgic, like Black Girl Magic, but MATHgic. And I mean, I love math too. My degree is in mathematics. So I saw that, I was like, &#8220;That is so cute.&#8221; That was the cutest thing I&#8217;ve ever seen. It&#8217;s like it&#8217;s a program, but then they also sell some merch for fundraising and stuff. I was like, &#8220;This is really dope teaching young black girls math fundamentals and stuff.&#8221; It&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Oh, that is so amazing. I just love that so much. And the lack Girl MATHgic, Oh my gosh.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like you working with YouTube on this was like a really kind of collaborative process. Are those sort of the best types of clients for you to work with?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yes. I would say that working with YouTube was definitely like ideal client. They were very responsive, followed the schedule, they communicated so well. And they were also really nice, like we&#8217;re working with big clients, I just assumed like they were going to be very strict and we need to have it look a certain way. They want to work with people, but they want it to look a certain way, it&#8217;s what I expected. But working with them, I really saw that they wanted me to show myself in there and to put my own spin. When they said, put your own spin on a theme of black creativity, they actually meant it. That&#8217;s why I mentioned the thing with the colors. That was like very refreshing for me, something I really enjoy, like the great communication, being responsive, when things were delayed, they adjusted the schedule to match the delay. I was like, &#8220;You&#8217;re amazing.&#8221; Yeah. I really enjoyed them as a client. And those are things that seeing that it&#8217;s possible, those are things that I start to look for when I&#8217;m working with people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s go back to freelancing just a little bit more. When you have a new client or you&#8217;re approaching, let&#8217;s say, a new project, what does your creative process look like?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. So usually, I try to get as much information from the client at the beginning as possible because a lot of people say, &#8220;Oh, just do whatever.&#8221; But they actually have something in mind. So I try to ask a lot of initial questions, just to get an idea, like, do you have an idea or do you actually want me to give you my ideas? I just want that to be clear from the very beginning before I start doing research. And then I also asked like a lot of technical questions, how much do you want the resolution to be? What size? What&#8217;s your timeline? Because if it&#8217;s a small timeline, then I won&#8217;t try to do this super complex thing. I&#8217;ll make it simpler.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
But in terms of like the creative making the thing once that&#8217;s settled, I usually do a lot of research on stock websites. I like iStockphoto, just to get an idea of like composition, and if it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m not familiar with, I can&#8217;t just think of 35 math formulas off the top of my head. I just got f of x imprinted in my mind, but I need more. So I like to look at stock websites just to see what kinds of things are default, their body poses, body expressions, what do real people look like? Because I don&#8217;t want every person I draw to have the same face, but different bodies and different hairstyles. That feels weird to me, but I like when other people do it.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. So I like to go on stock websites just to see if anything is giving me ideas, is it inspirational? Is it good for reference? And once I get that, I&#8217;ll start sketching out different ideas, trying out different compositions, just to see like, does anything look good? Can I draw this thing? What are the hands going to look like? And then usually, that&#8217;s when I start going back and forth with the client, seeing what they think of my ideas.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
But if anything&#8217;s going in the right way, usually, that&#8217;s also the time I&#8217;ll ask, &#8220;Do you have any other ideas once you see this, a better idea of what you&#8217;re looking for kind of thing?&#8221; And then once that happens, I&#8217;ll either revise it or start going with color, again, make more ideas, send that to them. And then it&#8217;s usually just a back and forth, giving them the art and then getting their feedback. But as I&#8217;ve been working and seeing like how easily that can turn into a 100 revisions, I put limits like, okay, we&#8217;re going to have two rounds of revisions. And if you want more, this is going to cost. So yeah, I say back and forth, but it&#8217;s back and forth like twice just to protect my time essentially.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, even with all of this, are you also thinking a lot about, let&#8217;s say, colors, like a color story or anything to go along with a new project? Or does that come naturally?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Sometimes it comes naturally, but I also have a Pinterest board just full of different pictures that are like, it&#8217;s either a fashion outfits, stationary, graphic design branding, things like that. But if I don&#8217;t have any ideas, I&#8217;ll just pick from that, like, oh, let me try this, or since I&#8217;m on social media a lot and have a lot of artists I follow, there are just some artists I like the way they use color. There&#8217;s an artist, her name is Olivia Fields. And one thing she likes to do is have a very monochromatic color scheme, but she uses value so well it&#8217;s still very interesting to look at. So if I&#8217;m thinking about that lately, I&#8217;ll like, let me try to use a monochromatic scheme just to see what it look like if I do it kind of thing. If it doesn&#8217;t work, I&#8217;ll just trash it. But yeah, it can either come from other artists, that Pinterest board or I&#8217;ll just start off with, I want the main color to be yellow and then I&#8217;ll just randomly pick colors and adjust it based on that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. So I want to switch gears here a little bit based on what we were talking about prior to recording. You mentioned you&#8217;re from North Carolina, that&#8217;s where you grew up. Tell me what it was like growing up as a creative kid in North Carolina.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. I will say my grew up story isn&#8217;t similar to like the ones I hear on interviews. People will be like, &#8220;I drew all the time, I love drawing.&#8221; I drew some of the time and I was mostly watching cartoons, animated movies, just a lot of TV, playing a lot of video games. It wasn&#8217;t until I was 13 that I even decided like, oh, I want to do something art related. It was from seeing the Incredibles. I saw the behind the scenes animation thing. And I was like, &#8220;I want to be an animator.&#8221; But then once I got closer to picking a college and saw what animation was, very quickly, it was like, no, I don&#8217;t want to do that.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
I want to draw because I used to draw like a little bit, when I say every once in a while, I mean like a handful of drawings per year. I wasn&#8217;t really, I liked to draw, but I wasn&#8217;t sitting around drawing all the time because I was just overthinking it so much, I would draw, one time, I drew the Powerpuff Girls, like just very stiff Powerpuff Girls poses and look like them. But then I took it to school for the next few days and showed everyone. I was like, &#8220;Praise me. I&#8217;m a good artist. Look at me.&#8221; And then didn&#8217;t draw for like the next few months.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
That was me as a kid artist, but still very much enjoyed it. I took art classes in middle school and high school. And I would say that&#8217;s where my artistic skills and sense and interests started to grow. I wasn&#8217;t doing anything like extracurricular. I was just taking it as an elective. So by the time I got to college, I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any other interests. I want to be an artist. And I&#8217;m hoping college will unlock the key to figure out how people actually get paid to make art.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I mean, you went to North Carolina State University, which we&#8217;ve had several alums just here on the show that have went there. While you were there, do you feel like they really prepared you to become a working designer out in the world?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Now, when I look back at it now, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh yeah, they actually did.&#8221; But at the time, I didn&#8217;t think so at all, because it just felt very vague, because I also, I majored in art and design at NC State and I thought that meant I&#8217;m going to paint, like be an artist. They attach design to it. But they really mean art, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
It was like the first week they were like, &#8220;Hey, I know you guys like to draw and paint, but we&#8217;re not teaching you to be artists, we&#8217;re teaching you to be designers.&#8221; And in my mind, I was just like, &#8220;No, what is design? Oh, no.&#8221; Looking back on it now, I see they were teaching us how to think like designers and how to problem solve. And that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s been so helpful. And also, with drawing, making sure you understand the foundations of drawing, that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve been using a lot as well, but really that problem solving thing and also how to think like a designer, I would say that&#8217;s been the most helpful in my design career. But in terms of like how to get a job, how to make a good portfolio for a job, nope. I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;I wish I did something about it.&#8221; But now that I am working and have had jobs, those design fundamentals have actually been very helpful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Now, after college, you ended up for a while moving out to LA, what prompted that?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
It was actually like one of those moments of close family member passed away. So it was just very much like life is short kind of moment, let me try things that I would never do, just you never know you get this chance again. And growing up, watching a lot of TV, California always looked cool. And that was one of my bucket list thing, like I want to see what it&#8217;s like to live in California. So once that chance came up, I just went for it, oh, man. So scared. I was sweating on that plane just, Ooh, oh my gosh. I was so scared. But yeah, that&#8217;s how I ended up getting there.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
And really, my goal was just to see, like, can I go there and survive? Can I do enough to make sure I don&#8217;t have a flight back in three months? And I ended up staying for four and a half years, going on five years. I came back to North Carolina at the end of 2019, months before, I mean, months before COVID happened. So I am so, oh, I don&#8217;t have family in California. So that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m like, I am so glad I moved just in time so I could be near my family and at least know they&#8217;re safe in person versus a phone call from like 3000 miles away.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, while you were out there, did you get a chance to really experience the LA design scene?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t think so. When people say that, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;So where&#8217;s the scene at? And how do I get there?&#8221; My only experience was through the jobs I had. And comparing it to North Carolina, the main difference I noticed was that things were way more fast-paced. Yeah, that was like the biggest difference I noticed. And also like, but this is with anything. Once you see the process behind things, it takes that bale away. Things aren&#8217;t as glamorous as I initially thought, like I had a job at a media buying agency, where I was editing album covers for social media posts or resizing banner ads that will be put on YouTube, like watching the YouTube video and seeing of like, oh, this looks so like, well, one it&#8217;s annoying, but also seeing like a big artist with an ad, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Ooh, fancy.&#8221; But hearing the media buyers trying to get the space and make it and asking me to resize things and how crazy that process can be, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Okay. These are just regular people trying to just do their jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
And I would say a big thing that just in general in the workforce, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Man, people procrastinate so much.&#8221; I thought that was like one of those warnings I got in college, like, you&#8217;ll never be able to procrastinate when [inaudible 00:27:40], but adults do that all the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All the time.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yes. Oh my gosh. And it happens so much. When I was working on those album covers, I was just like, &#8220;Come on guys. Just please send me the picture so I can resize it.&#8221; But it did help me build up efficiency because there were such fast turnarounds. I was used to working at a fast pace. So coming back to North Carolina, that&#8217;s how I ended up, when I mentioned earlier doing the work of four people, because I was used to working so fast. Like when things are slower here, it wasn&#8217;t that big of a deal. It felt normal. It helped me in that sense. But yeah, you asked about the design scene. I would also love to know what the scene was like, where was the all people? Where were the people at? What do design people do? I didn&#8217;t really get that question answered.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, it&#8217;s interesting because like, you mentioned earlier like, well, where is the design scene? I think designers carve out their own scene based on who they&#8217;re working with or working for, who they have met or inspired by. I&#8217;ve been to LA only once, I went in the beginning of 2020 in February. And I found that it was just like real, it was just so spread out. I mean, Atlanta is spread out, but LA is way more spread out. I&#8217;m like, it takes forever to get anywhere. Like if you&#8217;re going to go somewhere, you better hope it&#8217;s on your side of town, you don&#8217;t have to cross over and go down. It&#8217;s so big. I was there for two weeks and I know I only saw maybe like a 10th of LA. It&#8217;s so big. So big. I mean, I guess when I asked about like how the design scene was, I&#8217;m curious if it was different from maybe the design scene that you knew back home in North Carolina, like you mentioned, it was more fast-paced, but were there other differences?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good question. I will say, like you mentioned, because everything was so separated, it was kind of like, if you weren&#8217;t in that neighborhood, we&#8217;re not going to meet or we&#8217;re not going to meet often. So it ends up being like pockets of communities that I would notice. So I had a lot of animation friends because they lived in Glendale and Burbank and they were interested in working at Cartoon Network or Disney TV.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
So I would meet those people in Burbank and Glendale, but then the people who were interested in more of graphic design or stationary, I talked to those people down near the beach because that&#8217;s where a lot of the agencies were. It was like, I could find pockets of people in different areas, but it was so rare for them all to come together just because how long it took to go places like, like literally, Google Maps will say something is maybe 10 miles away and you think, oh, I&#8217;ll get there no time. That&#8217;s an hour trip one way. I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;This doesn&#8217;t add up.&#8221; But then you take the trip and I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;That took an hour. Oh my gosh.&#8221; So it&#8217;s just like people aren&#8217;t going to make that. Even people who were natives, they weren&#8217;t really going to make that trip on a regular basis. So it was just like pockets of communities that I would have in the different places I was at depending on where I lived and worked. That&#8217;s how I ended up seeing the people.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
But I feel like in North Carolina, everyone is in Raleigh, you&#8217;re in Raleigh, I can get to the edge of Raleigh, the top, it will take like 20 minutes. So to me, compared to being in LA, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not a big trip at all.&#8221; So I feel like people are taking more initiative to meet up, and I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s because of COVID as well, have like a lot of meetups and groups and workshops and stuff. Whereas it would be like a once in a lifetime thing to do, I&#8217;ll take this trip one time an hour for this workshop, but don&#8217;t count on me to come every week.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And the web is going to change things too. I mean, there&#8217;s events and workshops and things. A lot of stuff has come online just over the past year that before either didn&#8217;t exist or it was just inaccessible because of location or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. Adobe MAX, the first time I attended it was last year because it was virtual. I lived in LA and it happened there every year, but I just was not about to sit there and pay for it not only, but just go there and talk designer talk. Sometimes I feel like there could be a prestige that some people might have, like, hello, I&#8217;m art designer. I integrate things together. They use all the design words and I&#8217;m not very good at that. I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Yeah, make pictures.&#8221; So being in that environment isn&#8217;t something I would want to pay to do. So it was nice to be able to attend the virtual version because I never would have went otherwise. Yes, there were so many conferences and things I&#8217;ve never heard about that I got to hear about because it was virtual and people I got to meet because of that, which is nice to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. As I was going through your work, I saw your illustration work and your portrait work, which is beautiful, but your patterns, the patterns on your website are absolutely gorgeous. I love that you have in your bio, on your website, you mentioned that you&#8217;re an artist and designer depicting joy. What does it mean for you to depict joy in your work?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. So in terms of people, you&#8217;ll probably see that I draw a lot of black people. And one thing that makes me happy about black culture and just black people in general is just seeing us love the things that we love, however we love it. It just makes me really happy to see all the different facets and ways that black people just are. I get so excited. And I feel like when I draw that, that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m trying to convey just how excited I am to see black people as they are, doing whatever they like, looking as cool or as goofy or as happy as they are. I feel like that comes through with the people.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
And in terms of the patterns, I really like music. But when I hear music, I tend to see a lot of different shapes and colors just moving together. That&#8217;s how I see the song. Like me drawing those abstract patterns, it&#8217;s usually me listening to music and drawing whatever comes to mind. So just kind of like the happiness that comes from listening to music, that energy is something I&#8217;m trying to capture in the patterns. And I like for it to fit together kind of like different sounds fit together in a song, that&#8217;s how it shows up in the patterns.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And when you&#8217;re even doing these patterns, it also seems like you&#8217;re drawing from nature some too. I don&#8217;t know maybe if that was just the particular collection that you were doing, but I saw a lot of kind of tropical themes and leaves and stuff like that. It&#8217;s just very, very stunning work.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Thank you. Yeah, the tropical thing is I just love the way tropical scenery looks. I also think it&#8217;s nice, like all the different leaves and like patterns that you see within leaves, I think that&#8217;s nice as well, but also sometimes, if I draw too many triangles and circles, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Let me draw something that people can recognize.&#8221; So it ends up just being leaves and flowers for some reason. I&#8217;m not even a big flower person, it just ends up coming out, or I&#8217;ll just look up pictures of flowers. But yeah, I really love tropical weather and themes and stuff. So I just end up drawing it a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I have not met a Nigerian that didn&#8217;t like bright colors. So you&#8217;re definitely onto something there.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:35:22]. I love that. You&#8217;re right. You&#8217;re right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you get your creativity back if you are feeling uninspired, like say you hit a block in a project somewhere you&#8217;re working on something, what do you do to get that spark back?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
So when I am inspired, I have a bunch of hidden Pinterest boards. And then I also have a notebook where when I&#8217;m inspired, I just write down ideas of things that I think will be cool to make. So when I am feeling blocked or uninspired, I&#8217;ll look through that Pinterest board. One is just called Black, and it&#8217;s just black people, just random black people that I can find on Pinterest. It used to be really hard, but I saved so many pictures and looked at it that Pinterest has realized this girl likes to look here black people. So now my homepage has that.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
So I&#8217;ll either look at that Pinterest board, just kind of seeing people do stuff or I also have some with just colors or textures or shapes. I&#8217;ll just look through the Pinterest board or I&#8217;ll look through that list of ideas that I have. I&#8217;ll either do that or I&#8217;ll just take a break. Turn the thing off, turn the computer off, turn the iPad off, watch TV, play a video game, take a nap and then come back. Yeah. And then if there&#8217;s like a time crunch, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Well, honestly, think about the money.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Girl, do you want to get paid?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; So I just do it no matter what I&#8217;m like, okay. Just loosen up. Then I&#8217;ll take a five minute break, loosen up, get some water or something and then come back and just do it.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Or another thing I&#8217;ll do, sometimes I&#8217;m not a good singer, but I love to sing. So I&#8217;ll just turn on Spotify and then just force myself to sing along out loud as bad as it&#8217;s going to come out, just so to get my mind not overthinking it. And then things usually come out better. If I have, like my mind is focused on me singing, even though like, what notes? What notes am I hitting? So that helps me have a bit of more energy and looseness to the art that I&#8217;m making.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One thing that I would do when I was working on projects is I&#8217;d always build in at least a week into the sort of like project plan, because I mean, I think the expectation, certainly, I think from clients, but oftentimes, for us as freelances, as designers, the expectation is we&#8217;ll get the work and we&#8217;ll just be able to knock it out, like we&#8217;ll sit down and we&#8217;ll know what we do because the client has brought us on for our expertise. So we have to be the expert.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I mean, depending on how, if you set up a project rate or hourly rate or a day rate or whatever, sometimes clients will try to nickel and dime you to try to know like, well, how long did it take you to work on X, Y, Z, and blah, blah, blah? And I certainly early on in my freelance career, that was a mistake that I made. And then eventually, I switched things over either to like a project rate or I do like a day rate or something like that. I&#8217;d build in like a week of time because there&#8217;s no telling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And for me, it&#8217;s almost like creative insurance, like I may need it in the future if something happens, like what if I get sick? Or what if I just am not feeling it? And I can take that time out of the bank sort of because I&#8217;ve built it into the project and then I can, like if I take a day off and then decide to come back later and do it, then that way I&#8217;m not impacting the project because I built that time in there. It gives me permission to not have to be a machine when it comes to like creativity because sometimes the ideas flow and sometimes they just don&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;ve certainly been at that place where you&#8217;re at, where you&#8217;re like, you just have to think about the money, like think about what this is going to do. And then you soldier on or you push through it. But yeah, that&#8217;s one thing that I would do is I just build in the time because the good thing is if you never use it, then you come out early and the client is happy. And then if you do use it, the client is still happy because you came out on time.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Right. That&#8217;s great. Because I learned in the design world as well, especially when I was at that media buying agency, it was an open office and there were only like eight of us. So sometimes I&#8217;ll work on stuff, they just be standing over my shoulder, &#8220;How long do you think it&#8217;ll take?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Please. Oh, I think it&#8217;ll take me a few hours rolling.&#8221; It wouldn&#8217;t. It would take me shorter than that, but I like to add in that buffer, just like you said, like if something happens, I can still turn it in when I said I could, but also giving myself that insurance, like you said, to make it.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
But in terms of the illustration projects now, those few hours turns into a couple of extra days or maybe an extra week, like you said. Yeah. Especially when people say they have a tight turnaround, things never are as tight as people want it to be, especially with getting revisions and just getting feedback, especially if there are a lot of cooks in the kitchen. So it is way better to add in more time for that kind of stuff in the beginning, like you said.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now when you were in school, when you were back at North Carolina State, let&#8217;s say, I think that was maybe probably around 10 years ago at this point, right?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where did you see yourself career-wise by this age where you&#8217;re at now?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Honestly, by the time I graduated, I was just like, &#8220;Am I cut out for this?&#8221; Honestly, because I thought, again, like when I was 18 entering college, I thought, okay, college is going to give me the roadmap. And by the time I am a senior, I&#8217;m going to know exactly what I want to do, how to get there and I&#8217;ll be able to get there. But that didn&#8217;t happen when I was a senior. I felt kind of similar to how I was as a freshman, like, what? Like, what am I doing? I need to find a job.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
So I mainly, the main goal I had, I was like, Keisha, please have a job, please have a job and an apartment that you can pay for with your job. I had very, very basic goals for myself, have a job that&#8217;s something related to design. Yeah, that was pretty much my only goal. I wanted, the idea of freelance sounded good, but then at that time, I had no idea how to do it. So it wasn&#8217;t even, it was more like a fantasy more than like me seeing myself there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I didn&#8217;t go to design school, but it is something that I&#8217;ve thought about in terms of like, do I need this in order to have this legitimacy for myself as a designer? Because I&#8217;ve been self-taught and I did a little bit of work at companies, like I worked for the State of Georgia for a while, I worked at AT&#038;T for a while. And then like, I really had just felt like, you know what? I got this, I could start my own studio and do this and really do it myself. And I&#8217;ve learned so much really just in the time that I had my studio doing things by myself, but they never really teach you entrepreneurship. I mean, again, I didn&#8217;t go to design school, but even with the work that I was doing, by the time I started my studio, I had a bachelor&#8217;s and a master&#8217;s degree and still didn&#8217;t know anything about freelancing. I was really either making it up as I went along or I was asking other freelances. I was really gaining this education while I was also trying to run my business.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Absolutely. Because in design school, in my senior year, we had this class that the description was literally, we&#8217;re going to prepare you to get a job. But when we actually took the class, they were like, &#8220;You need a website. Do you know what a website is? You can make websites on Squarespace.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Are you kidding me? This is my senior year and you&#8217;re teaching us that we need a website. Of course, we do. What are you talking about? How do you get a job? Please tell me what to put on my resume and how to get the people to actually hire me.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Even then, like being in design school didn&#8217;t make that difference. It&#8217;s almost like they&#8217;re out of touch with what was happening in the world. Like they got the art skills, but getting a job or even being an entrepreneur, that wasn&#8217;t even close to being thought about in any of my classes. I would have had to talk to alumni who are already doing it. And kind of like you said, they were figuring it out on their own or like having outside resources to figure that out. So I definitely don&#8217;t think going to design school will or not going to design school, you won&#8217;t really be missing out honestly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, by the time I really started figuring it out, I think I was about, I don&#8217;t know, I think maybe I was about two or three years into my studio and from just talking with other freelancers and picking up, because sometimes you just have to get, unfortunately, you just have to get burned a few times in business before you learn that lesson or whatever that particular lesson is. But I think by the time I was like, by the time I hit my fifth year, I had it down pat at that point, I knew about contracts and proposals and getting things done and everything just ran smoothly, but it took some time to get there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So yeah. I think now, because freelancing is an option for so many people, whether they do it either independently, like you&#8217;re doing, or if they do something like working via like a design marketplace, such as ThemeForest or Envato Elements or Envato Market, whatever the thing is that Envato has with all of the different websites and stuff, Fiverr, even those kinds of things, Upwork, there&#8217;s ways that you can use those tools to manage your business better, but it&#8217;s still, at the end of the day, it comes down to really knowing what those fundamentals are and knowing what works best for you. I think certainly, when I was doing business, there&#8217;s not an all-purpose solution for like being an entrepreneur. I wish there was. But once you learn what works for you in terms of cashflow and payments and client communication and everything, then you&#8217;ve cracked it, you&#8217;ve cracked the code pretty much.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. A lot of the stuff I&#8217;ve learned even about graphic design because NC State does have a graphic design major, but I majored in art and design, a lot of the stuff I learned about graphic design was just learning by doing. It ended up being like the jobs I had, more doing stuff for family and friends was really the stuff that prepared me for the different jobs. And I&#8217;m learning that that&#8217;s the same thing that&#8217;s happening with freelance as well, like the classes that I take, the people, the Instagram artists that I&#8217;ll DM or Instagram friends I have, I&#8217;ll DM, those things have been really helpful. And also, like you said, being burnt, having bad clients, that helps me set better boundaries for future clients, like knowing what to do. So yeah, that&#8217;s definitely something I&#8217;m in the process of right now. I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to the part where everything runs itself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;ll get there probably I think sooner than you expect. Before you know it, it&#8217;ll just flow. It&#8217;s sort of like a&#8230; I mean, you watch anime, it&#8217;s like the Avatar State. Eventually, you&#8217;ll be able to just invoke it and you&#8217;ll be good.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Awesome. Avatar is one of my favorite shows. So I love that you said the Avatar State.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are you obsessed with at the moment?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Speaking of anime, so I&#8217;m watching this anime called Fruits Basket. It&#8217;s a silly premise. When it&#8217;s like, if you hug someone of the opposite gender, they will turn into Zodiac animal, so like the Year of the Horse, or a cat, rat, like things like that. But you end up finding out everyone has these crazy backstories and there&#8217;s this whole curse and things like that. So I&#8217;ve just been binge-watching that show basically, because I&#8217;m so curious to see what&#8217;s happening. Other than that, I&#8217;ve been playing a video game called Mario &#038; Sonic at The Olympic Games for 2020. I&#8217;ve just been going through the story mode. There was one, it&#8217;s the triple jump and I keep getting disqualified. So I got mad and turned it off, but I still think about it because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to win.&#8221; Yeah. I would say those two things.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Also, I have a cat. I&#8217;ve never had a pet before, but I got one a few months ago, honestly, off the strength of seeing other black people on social media have cats and they seem to enjoy it. And I always wanted a cat. So I ended up getting one. So I spend a lot of time peeking over the couch, seeing what she&#8217;s doing or looking for her around the house and just smiling really big. She gets annoyed, but I think she&#8217;s used to it. I would say I&#8217;m pretty obsessed with her.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Do you have like a dream project that you would love to do one day?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a great question. I would say the only dream project I had, I got to do it last year. So I got to illustrate a deck of playing cards and I pretty much did the art direction for the whole thing. So you mentioned the tropical idea, there was a running idea I had for a long time of joining black people in the tropical space, kind of like an oasis, a place where they could freely celebrate themselves without all the isms in the world that black people carry. So I pretty much made the deck around that and got the job black people being happy or silly in that tropical environment. And that was something I really enjoy doing. If I think of like a future project, it would be a similar thing, but in a different format. I haven&#8217;t figured that out yet, but definitely enjoyed doing that deck of cards, but I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s like a book or like a coffee book or like a storybook, but that&#8217;s kind of like something that I&#8217;m juggling in my head right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is the best advice that you&#8217;ve ever been given regarding what you do as an illustrator?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Interestingly enough, I would say the best advice I have is more of like a you as a person. So like, not finding your identity in the work that you do, you&#8217;re more than the work that you do. You are enough as you are. Like those kinds of things I&#8217;ve seen have made the biggest difference for me. Yeah, a lot of times the artsy-fartsy, mumbo-jumbo, it just slides off of me. I&#8217;m just like, this sounds, but when I draw, what does that mean? So hearing things like, I&#8217;m more than the art that I make is very freeing for me to be able to just have fun with it and do stuff that I like. And I don&#8217;t have to judge myself based on how well I drew today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I can see how that, I mean, well, one, I see that is good advice just in general, like, make sure that you don&#8217;t get too caught up in the work, but also realize that you put your own identity into everything that you do as well.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next like five years? Like this whole pandemic craziness is over with, it&#8217;s 20, what? 2026. What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Honestly, I haven&#8217;t thought that far ahead. I was like, &#8220;Will the world still be turning at that time?&#8221; I think it would be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hope so.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
You&#8217;re right. Me too. Honestly, I hope I&#8217;ll be doing bigger projects, projects I&#8217;m really excited about. I&#8217;m enjoying the projects that I&#8217;m doing right now. So more, just like an extension of the kinds of things I&#8217;m doing right now getting to illustrate different people, doing things, really hoping to get into the Children&#8217;s Book World, be able to illustrate them to children&#8217;s books. That&#8217;s something I&#8217;m looking forward to. And also, I want to get my patterns onto products. So one thing I&#8217;m hoping to do also in five years is to have my products on things. Yeah. More of like, just like all the different ways I can get my work out there, either on products or online in different formats. That&#8217;s something I&#8217;m hoping will happen, just as I grow and do things and get better at art, have it just spread onto different formats as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and everything that you&#8217;re doing online?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. So you can find my work on my website, which is keishaokafor.com, O-K-A-F-O-R. You can also find me on social media on Twitter and Instagram, mostly Instagram @keishaoak, oak as in oak tree, O-A-K. The reason why it&#8217;s like that is just so you know how to pronounce Okafor. But yeah, that&#8217;s pretty much where I&#8217;m at, Instagram, Twitter and my website.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Keisha Okafor, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I have to say, I just love how joyful and colorful and vibrant your work is. Like I mentioned, when I discovered you from the work that you did at YouTube, I was just looking at your website, like, this is so fun. And I have to say that it&#8217;s rare to see a designer put that sort of joy into their work, but I am really excited to see what sort of work you&#8217;ll be doing after this interview, after people get a chance to really see your work, because I feel like this sort of vibrancy and joy in life is what we need right now. We need to be seeing more of this everywhere. And so I&#8217;m excited for people to really learn more about you and learn more about your work. And yeah, just thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Thank you for having me. I am hope, really excited for people to see my work too. And I really appreciate all your kind words. Yeah, I definitely, I&#8217;m just like, if I&#8217;m going to draw, I&#8217;m going to have fun with it and I want everyone else to have fun with it too. So definitely excited to see where it all goes.</p>

<p>Design can be a powerful way to bring people together, and Tim Allen embodies that as the VP of design at Airbnb. He oversees several teams at the popular online housing marketplace, including their newest offering <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/experiences" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Airbnb Experiences</a>, and we spent the first part of our interview talking about how Tim got started at Airbnb, as well as the company&#8217;s open culture.</p>
<p>Tim also shared how growing up and living around the world as a military kid helped inspire his early design work, talked about attending NCSU and working his first design jobs at Interactive Magic and IBM, and spoke on the importance of design leadership and designers as business leaders. Tim truly wants to be a beacon for more Black designers to enter the industry, and he&#8217;s leading by example!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Hi Maurice. I&#8217;m Tim Allen, VP of design at Airbnb, and I look after design functions globally across design, research, UX, writing and creative.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, that&#8217;s a lot to look over.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s quite a bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s a regular day like for you at Airbnb? Does that exist?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if it does exist in terms of a regular day. It&#8217;s a lot of context switching, I can tell you that. Sometimes I&#8217;ll have a day where I try to avoid these, but it&#8217;s just back-to-back meetings with wildly different contexts for each meeting.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
But typically there&#8217;s some combination of our creative culture. How do we feel that? How do we calibrate it? What does quality look like? Which leads into product. How are we impacting customers&#8217; lives through our product and maintaining quality? Again, that&#8217;s a pretty constant theme.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
And then creatively, how are we creating resonance with our brand? So in some variation, sometimes all three, sometimes just focusing on one, like people. I&#8217;ll have one day where I&#8217;m focusing just mainly on one-on-ones and connecting with folks, making sure folks are being enabled to do the best work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How did you get started at Airbnb?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I got started through a conversation. Much like many other positions I&#8217;ve had. I had a conversation with Alex Schleifer who is our chief design officer and we just hit it off immediately. Our sons are about the same age, so he was actually on his way to pick up his son the first time we chatted. And we started talking about our design ethos and what we believe in. And that pretty much rhymed and that was a great way to start a relationship.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So just had the conversation and then before you knew it, you&#8217;re working at Airbnb.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s pretty good.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
It was a snowball effect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s the best thing about your job?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I guess the best thing about my job, I think it&#8217;s just being creative. Just thinking orthogonally about business challenges, customer and community challenges, and then applying my own sense of tuition and background to those challenges is pretty exciting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me more about the team. You mentioned you are doing a lot of context switching. Talk about the teams that you oversee.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. You have experience design, which is a pretty broad function. We have generalists here, so a good range of folks that either index on visual design or interaction design. Or mostly a combination thereof, but with varying levels of capability on either side of that. You have research and insights, survey science, data science and UX writing, information architecture. There&#8217;s quite a bit of variance there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting that there&#8217;s all those positions at a company that is&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, would you call Airbnb a tech company since they&#8217;re mostly deals, I would say with&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to call it hospitality, but with lodging in a way?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. Accommodations is one big part of our brand. We&#8217;ve recently expanded into just Airbnb experiences where you don&#8217;t have to own a home or have a home in order to be a host basically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me more about that.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. So Airbnb experiences is all about the best in class experiences. So when you arrive at a location you can feel like you&#8217;re at home and you feel like a local as opposed to feeling like a tourist. We have different categories such as animals just launched recently to a lot of a fanfare. We have a couple of categories that are getting ready to launch soon as well. Cooking is another category that&#8217;s very popular.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
We also have adapted experiences too. So just in terms of inclusivity and accessibility, a lot of times people with mobility impairments or people that are disabled, have a tough time when they&#8217;re traveling, being integrated into experiences. And so we have a whole host of adaptive experiences that are specifically catered towards disabled and the combinations that are required.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, it&#8217;s not even so much&#8230; It almost sounds like a built in almost a package in a way. Of course with Airbnb you&#8217;re renting out someone else&#8217;s space, but it sounds like with this it also lumps in different activities you could do, like maybe going out to eat or I don&#8217;t know, seeing a play or something like that. Is that a good way of describing it?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean mostly my job is about innovating around the entire consumer journey across digital and offline experiences. From the moment you think you want to go somewhere, as an inception moment through planning, through booking. Obviously through hosting is a big experience in terms of your commendation and the experiences you have while you&#8217;re traveling. And so it&#8217;s like how do you create the best trip possible and make it as magical as possible?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I never thought about it, I guess in an end-to-end sort of way like that. It&#8217;s not just that you&#8217;re providing lodging, you&#8217;re also providing entertainment. You&#8217;re providing&#8230; It&#8217;s almost tourism, I guess, in a way.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. A big part of our brand is around tourism. We have ecotourism category of experiences as well. So yeah, that&#8217;s a good way to think about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Let&#8217;s see. So one thing that I&#8217;ve heard a lot about with Airbnb, we actually have had someone from Airbnb on the show. This was years ago. I don&#8217;t even know if he still works there anymore, but he talked a lot. His name is Ariem Anthony. I think he was in the production design department, but he talked a lot about Airbnb and it&#8217;s very open culture. Is that something that you&#8217;ve experienced since you&#8217;ve been there?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yes, one of the biggest things that drew me to Airbnb was my perception from the outside of the community. And then now that I&#8217;m a part of Airbnb, it&#8217;s definitely rung true. That open theme is definitely there. I think it&#8217;s because of the company mission is resonates so deeply with so many people. It&#8217;s usually the number one reason people join or want to be a part of the company.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
And company missions can be fluff sometimes. Right. But I think the actual intent of delivering on the mission of creating a world where anyone can belong anywhere, so intentionally going after that and then also having the means to deliver against that. I think those two factors create this culture that it&#8217;s like a baseline understanding that people have. This shared purpose that allows people to be open in a different way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know that&#8217;s something that and really I think in a lot of big tech companies, having an open culture is something that&#8217;s really important because diversity and inclusion is important. They want to make sure that people can bring the notion of bringing your whole self to work. Is that something, I would imagine in your position being a VP, that&#8217;s a really big deal.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, if you think about the long game, the way I think about belonging is almost synonymous with creativity. I think when you overlay the factors that add up to belonging with the factors that enable creativity, they&#8217;re very similar. To a sense of safety with this fearlessness of not creating errors and the openness of communication, feeling like you can contribute. All of these things that when you feel like you belong, it&#8217;s very much a way of cultivating creativity too, which is basically my job.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you help to enable that throughout your teams that you oversee?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Well, one thing I start with is just this foundational representation. I think homogenous teams usually make homogenous products based on homogenous strategies. And that&#8217;s definitely not what we&#8217;re aiming to do. Again, we want anyone to belong anywhere.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
And when you say anyone, how can your team stretch as much as possible across the breadth of human diversity in terms of gender, race or gender identity, orientation, background, ability, disability and so forth? We&#8217;ve got a good range of folks. So you start to get that diverse perspective built in. We don&#8217;t have it solved. I think we still have a ways to go as many organizations do but that is definitely our intent at our foundation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit. Of course, people know you from that not just your work that you&#8217;ve done while you&#8217;ve been an Airbnb, but also a lot of your other design leadership positions, which we&#8217;ll get into later. But let&#8217;s take it all the way back. Tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, so my father was in the military, so we moved quite a bit. I actually spent a lot of time growing up in Japan, several years in Okinawa and several years in Iwakuni. And then we moved to California, South Carolina, D.C., Northern Virginia area. And I ended up going to high school and settling in North Carolina. And yeah, went from high school to college and design school in North Carolina as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I saw as I was doing my research, you got your undergrad and you got your graduate degree from NCSU, which we&#8217;ve featured on the site before. We&#8217;ve talked a lot about how great the program is. We&#8217;ve had a few NCSU alums on the show too. What was it like there for you? Paint a picture. What time period is this when you&#8217;re at NCSU?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Oh man. So this was a while back, at NCSU. It was called the School of Design rather than the College of Design. It was&#8230; I want to say it was one of the top 10 design schools or so. So coming into it, for me, was a very big deal. I was so excited to get in. When I first got there, I did feel like a fish out of water though. I was like these are real designers around me. My background is airbrushing so I had my little airbrush compressor and airbrush all ready to do some design work and-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wait wait, hold up hold up, back up. Airbrushing? Like how people airbrushed T-shirts or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah that&#8217;s actually&#8230; So how I got into I guess design or I would say art back then was in high school. Yeah, I had my own airbrush company.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, T-shirts. In sophomore year in high school, my dad got me a airbrush set as a gift because I just drew all the time. I was a big drawer and I just drew cartoons and stuff all the time. And then he was like &#8220;You should try this.&#8221; And before he knew it I was making T-shirts for the basketball team and football team and all my friends. And then that blew up into cars and boats and then I started doing businesses in the area and stuff. And by the time I was a senior had just a whole portfolio of business. Which I use that as a portfolio, which I didn&#8217;t even know what a portfolio was, to get into design school.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you were airbrushing T-shirts in the South? I&#8217;m imagining this is probably mid &#8217;90&#8217;s probably.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah you&#8217;re talking about mid &#8217;90&#8217;s.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. You were cleaning up, you were cleaning up because airbrushed T-shirts were pretty big back then.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Huge, man. I had a pretty nice business man as a little high school student. It was good. I just loved doing it. I&#8217;d just stay up. Literally I&#8217;d start, I don&#8217;t know, after dinner ish and just airbrush all the different, I guess clients I had until 2:00 AM or so. Get some sleep and then go to school and handout all the merch.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. So it sounds like your parents were pretty supportive of you using your talent in this way.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean even just introducing the airbrush. It was just really, really supportive of art in general. I know that&#8217;s not always the case but yeah. Yeah, that definitely was the case with my family.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did they introduce you to art and design at an early age or was it something you just picked up?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s interesting because both my&#8230; Well, my mother used to teach art and then my father was just a doodler. And I just would see him doodle and he&#8217;s actually a really good artist and he taught me how to draw when I was super young and then I just kept doing it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. And then that of course inspired you to end up going to North Carolina State. So tell me about the program. Do you feel like it really helped you once you got out there in the world as a working designer?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, I mean I&#8217;d say there was a couple of very fortuitous events that happened and some mentors that sprinkled in there that just fueled the passion I already had around art into design. And not only helping me understand what design is but also how it relates to art. I think I was very fortunate to be in a curriculum that was labeled art and design. So it was this intermix of subjective emotion and then objective problem solving and how those things relate. Still to this day is foundational in the way I approach design. But yeah, the opportunities I had really were straight coming in. One of the professors saw my airbrushing and airbrushing is very volumetric. And that was one of the things that drew me to it. It&#8217;s so easy to shade and so forth.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
And so he&#8217;s like &#8220;You know what, 3D design and CGI is probably something you would gravitate towards because you just have this natural instinct towards objects.&#8221; And I was like okay cool. And so eventually, that relationship blossomed and he got a grant from NSF to create character animation and pedagogy for what they used to call multimedia back in the day. So this is basically like CD-ROMs and stuff. And so he just paid me for a summer to learn CGI. It was these silicone graphics machines that were down in a basement and no one that knew how to use them. They were built on Unix and he was like &#8220;Crack the code on these and learn how to create 3D avatars and animate them and there you go.&#8221; And so I literally again, it was sort of deja vu with the airbrush. Because the same thing I did was for the next three months I just holed away in that basement learning 3D. And then yeah, that started&#8230; That was my path of how does art relate to design?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Self taught.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So once you graduated from North Carolina State, what was the first design job that you had?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
First design job was at this game company called Interactive Magic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
And they were known for this flight simulation game called Apache and it was just&#8230; Apaches are these huge helicopters in the military. I think it&#8217;s like&#8230; Well, I don&#8217;t know, one of the most feared or destructive helicopters in the arsenal or whatever. So we played that up in the game and basically you got the experience of flying an Apache helicopter but we also did first person shooters and a couple other things as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now as I was looking through your extensive LinkedIn resume, I saw that you were a product design lead at IBM for five years and this was back during a time when product design certainly wasn&#8217;t as widespread as it is now in the industry. I&#8217;m curious to know, what did you take away from that experience?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Oh man, that was foundational as well. I was fortunate enough to have Chris Paul as a manager coming out of the Interactive Magic. He recruited me into the team within a year I was already managing folks just because he just believed in my capability. So not only was I learning product design at a very early time but then also learning how to manage people and so forth early in my career. Yeah, it was a pretty cool time. I was working on WebSphere, which is like a enterprise web development IDE. Yeah and a couple other projects there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One thing that I saw recently, I was reading through, I think it was FastCompany. I was reading through and they were talking about this study. I don&#8217;t know, you probably might&#8217;ve read this, the study from McKinsey about CEOs and design leadership. Do you know what I&#8217;m talking about?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yes&#8230;yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you probably know where I&#8217;m going with this. So you&#8217;ve held down a lot of design leadership positions at a number of different companies and agencies. I mean we&#8217;ve mentioned IBM, of course you&#8217;re now at Airbnb but I mean, Adobe, Amazon, Microsoft, RGA. That&#8217;s a huge swath of experience there. And to sort of refer back to this study, the study basically was saying that CEOs don&#8217;t understand design leadership at all. When you look back at your career, have you found that to be the case?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I think there&#8217;s been a progression. I wouldn&#8217;t say where we&#8217;ve reached the Nirvana yet but there has been a progression. And I could describe my early career as trying to get a seat at the table as a designer. And then as a team lead trying to get your team to have a seat at the table. You&#8217;re the voice of your team, at the seat of the table. And then human centered design and design thinking. Being the voice of the customer and having the customer have a seat at the table. Table being like executive forums, decision making forums and so forth. And then I think now, if you&#8217;re fortunate enough to be in a successful company, most likely there&#8217;s some notion of design as a strategic asset in there.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I think the extent to which that&#8217;s true probably varies. But yeah, I think we&#8217;ve grown. At the same time, I think designers as leaders are very rare. And I think at the point of my career that I&#8217;m in now, what spoke to me quite a bit, getting back to Airbnb a bit is the fact that the founder, two of the three founders are university grads and Brian and I have a good rapport. Brian Chesky is like a designer&#8217;s designer if anything. He leads the whole company as CEO. And the way to approach problems that we learned very early on as designers is just thematic in how Airbnb just runs in general. And I find that fascinating.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you just dropped a little something there I want to go back to. You said that designers as leaders are rare. Can you unpack that a little bit? What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, designers as business leaders.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Are rare. Yeah. I think there are very few CEOs with design backgrounds. Typically even at the executive levels, design reports into engineering. Typically there&#8217;s very little design organizations that end at CEO level or report into sort of a C level position. Again, that&#8217;s just representation, that&#8217;s sort of quote unquote, seat at the table. So I just find that interesting. I think that at a certain level, we plateau a bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you think would need to happen to change that?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I think that design&#8230; Approaching design with a business lens without sacrificing the ability to be creative is one way to do that. I think there&#8217;s a balance to be had there. But understanding and even building this into design curriculums at a early phase in people&#8217;s development is key. Like how did decisions get made in business? And how can design play a part not only in what&#8217;s delivered but how it&#8217;s delivered and why it&#8217;s delivered? In relation to the business and the reason why the company even exists.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Given your design leadership positions, have you found that designers are starting to come more into that business sense as the years go on? Are they improving, I guess? That&#8217;s probably a better way to put it.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I think that design has just&#8230; It&#8217;s been democratized by technology a lot more. So I think when we bring folks in with varied backgrounds, so folks just out of undergrad while they were going to school or even not attending undergrad, that have had their own brand agencies or have been contracting and understand-</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Agencies or have been contracting and understand business at a level of basically putting the food on the table. I think it enables them to have the same, a different level of rigor in terms of how they impact decisions at work as ICs or even managers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I&#8217;m curious about that, because I feel like certainly as technology has made it so more and more people can enter into design at pretty much any level. In a way it sort of forced some people to be almost more entrepreneurial and more businesslike in their design, because they may not necessarily be doing it for a business, but they have X number of clients. Say if they do a bunch of design for a marketplace website or something like that, I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m thinking like 99designs or something to that effect where they didn&#8217;t have to kind of talk to a number of different clients and weigh the business cases and not just creates for the sake of creation I guess.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. Even just bringing it back to my own story of having an airbrush business and understanding clients and briefs and however crazy they were either in high school or sort of like, &#8220;Hey, just hook me up with a T-shirt with the Wu-Tang Clan symbol on or whatever. But you still need to understand like, &#8220;Okay, what is this person&#8217;s sensibility and what are you&#8217;re trying to do with?&#8221; It&#8217;s basically what this person&#8217;s brand is. That enables a different level of &#8230; A different way of seeing the world when you hit the corporate or agency roadmap.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So you&#8217;ve been now at Airbnb, we spoke about this before recording. You&#8217;ve been there for about seven or so months now. What lessons did you learn this past year? How has this new experience improved you or has it helped? How has it helped you grow?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been for me just refreshing to be in a company where creativity and design is an extreme asset. I mean, I think I probably took that for granted earlier in my career working with Nike at RJ and just being in sort of an agency for so long of like, your purpose or what you believe in intersecting or overlapping with your talent or kind of capability as a designer. And so I didn&#8217;t understand how rare that was until after I left RJ and wasn&#8217;t working on Nike.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
And I think now, I&#8217;ve worked with a lot of companies that have great missions, but being at Airbnb, it reminds me of early in my career where it&#8217;s just like a lot of people believing in something, a lot of people with extreme amounts of talent. And I think that belief mixed with the level of creativity and talent that&#8217;s cultivated here is just, it&#8217;s one the things that just it&#8217;s really refreshing and it&#8217;s a delight to be here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. When you look back over your career at all the places you&#8217;ve worked at, what are some of the biggest lessons that you&#8217;ve learned?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
The biggest lessons I&#8217;ve learned I think is that in some ways I think creativity in terms of design is an act of kindness. What draws me to design the most is when that&#8217;s quantified and calibrated against. What I&#8217;m saying is, I think that creativity by itself is an inservice of something. Creating a better world or impacting people&#8217;s lives in a positive way can start to feel a little self-indulgent. But I think a mission like empowering every person on the planet to achieve more. When you mix that with creativity, there&#8217;s kindness involved in that. I think a mission like anyone feeling like they belong anywhere, there&#8217;s a notion of kindness in that. And design in the right circumstances can impact people&#8217;s lives if people are committed to it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does success look like for you now?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
For me it is just authentically committing to a purpose and kind of propagating that commitment among team members. So attracting people to that mission, fueling that mission, and then delivering on that mission, which is basically our products and our innovation. So I think success is all about understanding that purpose and just being a catalyst for belonging at this point.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I know just started at Airbnb not too long ago, but I&#8217;m curious, are you happy kind of with your current work-life balance? Is it good?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Work-life balance is interesting because I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t know if I create a binary between the two.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d necessarily say it&#8217;s a binary, I guess think of it more like a see-saw. Like the balance is where you feel it&#8217;s the most balanced, so it&#8217;s not necessarily taking one from the other. And I&#8217;m curious, if it&#8217;s not balanced, what would that look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
So I have a two-year-old now, which is a new thing that&#8217;s very inspiring as well, and a five-month-old.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Thanks a lot. So I think I&#8217;m happier in my career, just in terms of where I am and the people I&#8217;m working with. I think so that makes me a better spouse, better father and so forth. I think in doing that, the balance is, I think when you&#8217;re passionate about something, you&#8217;re compelled to do it quite a bit and go above and beyond. So it&#8217;s like how do you calibrate against responsibilities as a new father while still stimulating yourself and improving yourself? And just along that, is it just being on a journey of an improvement as a person and then, how does your career fit into that as well? Let&#8217;s that being a new father, those are some new variables that I hadn&#8217;t had to deal with before.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What keeps you motivated and inspired these days? I mean, aside from your kids, I would imagine.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, kids definitely. I would say that&#8217;s probably number one. I mean, without being cliched, you see that everything is new in their eyes. You see everything that comes in comes out in some way. You see a reflection of yourself, both the best parts of yourself and sometimes the worst parts. So that&#8217;s definitely an area of inspiration. I read sci-fi, I&#8217;m a sci-fi fanatic. I love Octavia Butler. So I read her stuff a lot. I think mainly it&#8217;s a combination of fashion, sci-fi, and just being enamored with my kids is probably the biggest inspiration for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I heard you are quite the sneakerhead too. Somebody told me that. I mean, you let me know if I&#8217;m wrong there, but.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, I have a big, large collection of shoes from my days working with Nike and I feel like I&#8217;m a reformed sneakerhead a bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is that possible?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I think I probably have way &#8230; I don&#8217;t know, but I don&#8217;t have as many as before. And so I have just a few, a smaller inventory than I did before. But I try to make them count.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Like a nice warehouse set aside for them.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, [crosstalk 00:35:38].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Climate control. Do you feel like you&#8217;re living your life&#8217;s purpose right now or do you think you&#8217;re still searching for it?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Oh wow. That&#8217;s deep Maurice. Yeah, at times I do feel like that&#8217;s the case. I love what I&#8217;m doing right now in terms of purpose. I love how it&#8217;s being directed and delivered. I love the impact that I have on people&#8217;s lives, or the impact I want to have on people&#8217;s lives. And yeah, it&#8217;s cool to be a new father. And so there&#8217;s a lot of things that are in line right now. So yeah, I hadn&#8217;t really thought about it like that, but yeah, I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m starting to live my purpose.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything that you haven&#8217;t done yet that you want to do? This can be career-wise. It can be life-wise, anything in particular?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I&#8217;d want to learn how to fly, fly planes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, for one of my recent birthdays, my wife got me flying lessons and it was pretty amazing. So I just started, but I haven&#8217;t been able to keep it going. But yeah, I&#8217;d love to just be I guess a novice pilot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I feel like we&#8217;ve had someone on the show that was a pilot. Well I don&#8217;t know if they were a pilot. I think they were just into flying planes, like model planes. I&#8217;m thinking of Dantley Davis. I don&#8217;t remember if he told me he was into planes or if he did fly recreationally. I don&#8217;t remember which it was. But I would imagine that&#8217;s probably pretty well within your grasp right now?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean it&#8217;s just amazing to be up there and how you feel when you&#8217;re actually in control of the plane, how complex it is. But in some ways it&#8217;s fairly simple as well. Just seems like extremely challenging but very peaceful at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Will probably make your commute easier.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Oh indeed, yeah. Going from Seattle to San Francisco man, you wouldn&#8217;t talk about work-life balance. That&#8217;s one thing that&#8217;s off balance is like, how can I make that commute less painful? So yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How far is it? I mean, I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;re flying, but it&#8217;s what, like a two hour flight?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. Sometimes a little less. And then yeah, I&#8217;m trying to make it a science to get in and out of the airport and to the office as quick as possible so I can get my day started at 10:00 AM starting from Seattle, which isn&#8217;t too bad.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. See Airbnb needs to work on the air part. They got the bnb part down.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They get the air part down, get you a private jet or something back and forth. Make it happen.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
There you go. I like the way you&#8217;re thinking Maurice. We should have a transportation division as well. I got to hit them up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, so what is it like, I&#8217;m curious because Seattle is a pretty big tech city. I mean Microsoft is there, Amazon is there, and Nintendo is there, bunch of other probably smaller companies and stuff, but you&#8217;re working in Silicon Valley. Do you feel like that&#8217;s a big shift for you in any sort of way?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
For me personally, no. I mean we have an office, Airbnb has an office in Seattle as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. So there&#8217;s a office here and so I work out of the Seattle office as well as the San Francisco office. So we&#8217;re quite a community here in Seattle. And I think what&#8217;s interesting, really interesting in terms of the black design community here, woman by the name of Bekah Marcum has just recently just used LinkedIn to literally just knit together a community out of thin air over the last couple of years of black designers in Seattle. I just spoke at one of the events not too long ago, but being a part of the design community just at large in Seattle, it&#8217;s great. And like you said, there&#8217;s a ton of tech companies here. There&#8217;s a ton of agencies here as well. This is a nice creative climate.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me more about that local Seattle design scene. Black design scene I guess if we want to put a finer point on it. What is it like for you at this stage in your career?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I like to be closer probably to the black design community or design committee in general. So fairly busy. But yeah, just being able to meet with young early in career designers and folks who&#8217;ve been in the game for a while as well is just super interesting. I mean, iron sharpens iron and sometimes it&#8217;s just representation, like this being in a room of people that look like you, especially when that&#8217;s not often the case is cathartic in and of itself. And if all those people are also within your function and are passionate about what you&#8217;re passionate about as well, it&#8217;s like paradise.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. There&#8217;s something that I found interesting when I started doing live shows with Revision Path is that oftentimes just the fellowship aspect alone of being in the same room, like for attendees, for me too really. Just being in the same room with a bunch of black designers, I don&#8217;t want to say that&#8217;s enough. It feels like a disservice to say that&#8217;s enough given sort of the dearth of spaces that are available in the design community that speak to us, that are for us, that cater to us, et cetera. But just being in the space, every time we do a live show, people are like, &#8220;When&#8217;s the next one?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Ah, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; But they love that opportunity so much and they&#8217;re able to talk to people that look like them, that are in the same field as them. It&#8217;s such a rarity when it does happen.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Oh my God yeah. It&#8217;s so rare. I mean basically we couldn&#8217;t stop talking about it. After we finished up with the event, people were just constantly remarking about how rare this is and how good it feels. And yeah, I mean just like you said, it just speaks the dearth of opportunities, places, times when we are together. And so we&#8217;ve got a long way to go in our industry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;ve been a design leader in this industry for a long time. You&#8217;ve seen designers come and go, you&#8217;ve seen trends come and go, et cetera. What is something that you&#8217;ve &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Seeing trends come and go, et cetera. What is something that you think most designers don&#8217;t worry about but they should? I have an answer. I don&#8217;t want to seed your answer but I want to listen to what you have to say.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I would say the why, I think the more senior you get, the more experienced you get, it gets better. But I&#8217;ve even seen more senior designers not really understand why they&#8217;re making decisions and be able to articulate the rationale behind it. And it goes back to just art versus design. We&#8217;re not artists necessarily. We should be artists, but our job isn&#8217;t art, as a designer at least. You are solving problems, so understanding how to articulate why you&#8217;ve made a decision, down to every design decision. Even some of the design decisions you&#8217;re probably making intuitively or instinctually, I&#8217;d love to see designers focus more on that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That was actually pretty close to my answer. Yeah, I was going to say writing, but for the very same reasons of being able to articulate sort of why you made a certain design decision or why you decided to go a certain way. I mean look, I&#8217;m a designer that can sit out and vibe for hours over fonts and find what the right typeface is to get a vibe and all that. But being able to articulate the why behind it is so important because otherwise people just think you&#8217;re some woo woo hippie designer just pulling stuff out of nowhere. And it&#8217;s like where is &#8230; what&#8217;s the rationale behind it? What&#8217;s the thought process that goes into the decision? Because it feels like without that then yeah, you are an artist because artists don&#8217;t necessarily have to explain that. But as a designer you&#8217;re in service to the user, to the company, to the client, et cetera. So that rationale becomes paramount.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, I couldn&#8217;t describe it better. I think &#8230; and then as you rise in seniority, you have this whole notion of accountability. So as you define that, you either create accountability because of those decisions or you&#8217;re given accountability because of those decisions. And if you don&#8217;t understand what you&#8217;re being held accountable for, you can&#8217;t measure it, you can&#8217;t tout it, you can&#8217;t &#8230; When calibration performance reviews come around, you&#8217;re sort of like, well I did this, but why did you do it? How does that track against the business impact? Can you make a &#8230; I think there&#8217;s several ways to use that as ammunition and one of them is through performance reviews. I also see that as an area where writing and everything we&#8217;re talking about comes in handy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What advice would you give to, let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m a mid career designer, I&#8217;m even loath to use that term because the middle of a designer&#8217;s career, it&#8217;s often a very weird nebulous period of time. You know what I mean? I mean certainly if you look at titles, you can be a junior or senior whatever, but mid career, is that three years, five years, 10 years? How long is a designer&#8217;s career, et cetera. But let&#8217;s say a mid career designer, say five years or so in the game, they&#8217;re listening to this interview, they&#8217;re looking at your work, they&#8217;re looking at your resume. What advice would you give them if they want to get to the level where you are?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Sometimes I&#8217;m a little old school, I don&#8217;t even know if this really still applies, I haven&#8217;t thought about it as much, but when I was coming up and it was again, my father&#8217;s influence, he had the whole adage of you got to be twice as good. He didn&#8217;t really necessarily add the whole expect half as much thing. He just &#8230; they definitely instilled that, understand where the bar is and then just double it. So I&#8217;d say craft and just excellence. If you can just be as scary talented as you can be, I think that starts to speak for itself. And also it reflects your passion, whether that is interaction or XD or communication design, visual design, graphic design, whatever it is. Even gathering insights, just that notion of excellence and understanding where the bar is and always trying to push it is a gift.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So one of the things that we have for this year, for 2020 is basically a more equitable future. I mean 2020 is sort of this year that&#8217;s been driven into pop culture as the future in many ways, whether it&#8217;s the new show or just the notion of a repeating year of some sort where this is the future. How are you helping to use your design skills or even just kind of your station at where you&#8217;re at in life, how are you helping to create a more equitable future?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
One of the things we just started to do is to work with companies, like the Inneract Project, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar with the other Maurice Mo and even beyond that how can you create more awareness of design as a viable path. Not only viable but extremely lucrative in some cases, path as well, to underrepresented marginalized groups. I think that&#8217;s key. I think for me, in terms of contributing to a more equitable industry and talent pool, it&#8217;s just like getting folks in and then understanding the barriers there. I mean it&#8217;s not just social economic but it&#8217;s also cultural. I think we talked about my background where my parents were very supportive of art just as a means to &#8230; as a way of living but that&#8217;s definitely not always the case. You see that all the time.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
So overcoming those barriers, so awareness. I think access is another one. And then also just tilling the soil as it were, as a leader myself in propagating the understanding of representation, diversity and having a diverse population feel like they belong as well and how that puts jet fuel on creativity. There&#8217;s tons of research on it, I won&#8217;t go into all that, but it&#8217;s tangible what happens when you get a bunch of different voices singing the same song.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? It&#8217;s 2025, it&#8217;s even further in the future, what is Tim Allen doing? What&#8217;s he working on?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Oh man. 2025 in the future, I&#8217;m probably a host of some sort. Either a super host, in terms of an experience or my home or both. I&#8217;m working on that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Oh, an Airbnb host. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know why my mind went straight to game show when you said that, but okay.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I could be a game show host. That could be interesting too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hey, nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. No, I feel like I would want in five years to be &#8230; to have provided some pathway of access to increase our numbers as black designers in the field. Definitely within Airbnb. But not only us racially but numbers of other underrepresented populations as well. Just being a beacon of inclusion and belonging. Yeah, I think if in five years, somehow in the orbit of what it means to create a creative team or produce creative deliverables that are inclusive and that inspire people to want to be more inclusive and host and make people feel like they belong. That&#8217;s what I would want to do in five years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
You can definitely check me out on Twitter, Tim Allen Design. Hit me up on Instagram as well. I&#8217;m just Timothy Allen there. LinkedIn is always a good route too. I&#8217;ve got a couple of portfolios out there, but they&#8217;re super old. So take a look at those if you want to, but just to kind of see my path and some old work like-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Any of the airbrush shirts up there?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
No, I need to put some of those up there though.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You should, I feel like that&#8217;s making a comeback now. Fashion design comes in 20 year cycles.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
True, true, true. And we&#8217;re &#8230; that would be right for right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hey look, think about it.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Okay [inaudible 00:08:44].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right Tim Allen, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you for, one, giving us kind of a peek behind the curtain at Airbnb, what it&#8217;s like to kind of be at your position, but also just talking about your path, your journey as a designer, how you&#8217;ve come up and also really, I think it&#8217;s good to have that sort of introspection once you get to a &#8230; I don&#8217;t know, I think once you get to a certain level in your career to kind of see this is where I&#8217;ve been, this is where I&#8217;m going.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s always good, I feel like to have those sorts of insights and reflective moments because not only does it help you out and help you grow as a person, but also it helps out others as well because you&#8217;re able to kind of impart that knowledge on the next generation and certainly it looks like with the work you&#8217;re doing at Airbnb, through your teams as well as this work that you&#8217;re talking about with the black designer community in Seattle, et cetera, that you&#8217;re making that happen. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Thanks for having me, Maurice. I appreciate it. It&#8217;s been a pleasure.</p>
